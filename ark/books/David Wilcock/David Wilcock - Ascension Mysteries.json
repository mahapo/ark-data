Instantaneous telepathy, whereyou read others’ minds so effectively that words are obsolete. Levitation, whereyou soar into the air with nothing more than the power of your thoughts.Telekinesis, where you levitate objects, even of colossal size, and command themto move with your mind. Materialization, where you can create anything you wantas easily as you once opened your mouth to speak. Time travel, where you jumpinto the past and fast-forward into the future with stunning clarity. The “veil”between living and dying, which caused you to forget that you had a greateridentity beyond each mortal life, has now dropped. In every moment you are fullyaware that you are a soul having a human experience. Your level of intelligenceis now vastly greater than anything you had access to in the past.Is this a dream? A case of ridiculous wishful thinking that has no grounding inreality? Or is it possible that the world’s great spiritual teachers weretelling you the truth? Are you walking around in a state of amnesia, obliviousto who and what you really are? Could the choices you make and the thoughts youthink be far more important than you might ever realize? Is there a cosmicbattle between good and evil playing out in the seemingly mundane struggles ofyour everyday life? Is this hidden battle also raging behind the headlines ofmany of the world’s most noteworthy events? Is ascension—a graduation into ahigher level of existence—your ultimate goal for being human? And are therenegative forces in the universe that feed on your fear, anger, guilt, and shameand will stop at nothing to prevent you from achieving this quantum leap in yourevolution? Are we witnessing a tremendous competition over who gets to controlour planet? Would these negative forces literally die without our selfishness,jealousy, materialism, greed, and loneliness providing them with an energysupply? Have these forces been fighting a battle that has gone on for hundredsof thousands of years—in their own conscious memory?You are about to enter a world where all these questions have answers. We arethreatened with doom and destruction from a seemingly impossible array ofvillainous forces. Not only do we have an “elite” who appear to thrive oncreating wars, financial catastrophes, plagues, and chaos, nature itself appearsto have betrayed us. Our planet is dying. The water is disappearing. The animalsare being hunted into extinction. Every year the temperatures are gettinghotter. Earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, and superstorms threatenour lives and planet.People tend to think the ancient spiritual tales are only “mythology,” whereaswe live in the “real world,” which is far more lonely and threatening. Humansoften use denial and addictive behaviors to push the unpleasant and seeminglyinevitable truth of mass destruction out of our minds. Then, when the truthcomes blasting out of its feeble packaging, it triggers a hidden sense ofhopelessness once more, and we crash-land into another deep, dark depression ofprofound loneliness. Now we believe in God—when things are at their worst—and inour private hell we cry out, “Why? Why? Why?”You may have been fortunate enough to come into contact with what manyvisionaries have called “ageless wisdom.” You may have had a near-deathexperience, where you caught a glimpse of the greater reality beyond the veil ofliving and dying. You may have had a dream so beautiful and breathtaking thatyou woke up in tears, longing for the promise of a new tomorrow. You may havehad a peak emotional event, either of extreme terror or utter ecstasy, andbroken through to that resplendent calm that is the bounty enjoyed by all thegreat masters—where time slows to a crawl and you see your life from an“overview” perspective. Something may have happened to you that was so utterlybizarre, so undeniably supernatural, that your entire being seemed to tingle andvibrate in amazement. For those few precious moments, you touched the essence ofsomething truly profound. You experienced a reality where there is no fear, nopain, no loss or loneliness—only love, joy, happiness, and boundless, brilliantwhite light.This expansive, awe-inspiring sense of eternity often seems fleeting. You get abrief glimpse of the magic, but all too soon the mundane realities of everydaylife surround you once more. The candle flame of infinite potential is snuffedby the cold, hard wind of reality—as most now see it. Thankfully, it doesn’thave to be that way. One of the great mysteries of our time is that positivespiritual beings do exist, and if you follow certain guidelines, you can makedirect contact with them. I get letters almost every day from peopleexperiencing bizarre and mystical phenomena. I worked very hard to achievecontact with spiritual beings, and the results have been extremely profound andmeaningful.I am going to tell you the story of my experiences in this book—how one personmoved through incredible hardship to discover dazzling hidden truths aboutascension and our future. The Gnostic spiritual tradition teaches us thatinformation is alive, and exposing ourselves to information about the truenature of the cosmos can trigger a metamorphosis within us that ultimatelypromotes ascension. My previous books have presented this information from ascientific perspective, but in the first half of this book I will reveal howthis metaphysical truth manifests in your life on a personal level.THE MYSTERIES OF HISTORYScience teaches us that you evolved from a spectacularly boring life in caves,in which your distant forefathers were illiterate hunter-gatherers who wereforced to survive against the elements. Your ancient ancestors eventually becameintelligent enough to invent the wheel, plant crops, domesticate animals,develop systems of trade, build sturdy shelters, and gather together in townsand cities. Civilizations arose gradually, and we developed written language,mathematics, ceramics, metallurgy, astronomy, governments, laws, and religion.We also worshipped gods. Virtually every culture on Earth reported some form ofdirect contact with advanced beings of significantly higher intelligence.Civilization, so we are told, did not arise randomly. We were taught how tospeak, how to read, how to write, how to grow crops, build shelters, study thestars, and understand the universal language of science by sophisticated beings.Again and again, our own written records soberly tell the tale of advanced,human-looking people handing us these keys to knowledge. In many cases thesepeople walked with us for hundreds if not thousands of years, governing theaffairs of our world with the presumably divine right of kings. Some of these“gods” taught us to be more loving and forgiving of others, and helped originateour major religions—which may hold deep mysteries that few of us trulyunderstand at this time. Other “gods” were nowhere near as kind or benevolent.They warred with one another, were petty and conniving, lied and deceived, andin many cases were overthrown and destroyed when their angry and betrayedsubjects finally rose up against them.Is it possible that these “gods” of antiquity were, in fact, extraterrestrialbeings? This is a question that I have been publicly tackling for twenty yearsin a variety of forms, including my website, DivineCosmos .com; my books, TheSource Field Investigations and The Synchronicity Key; and well over eightydifferent episodes of Ancient Aliens, the number one show on the HistoryChannel, entering its tenth season at the time of this writing. Yet many arestill acting like the priests who refused to look through Galileo’s telescope.The worldview most people now take for granted is nothing more than a beliefsystem, much like any other religion. We defend our current scientific modelslike Bible-thumping zealots, claiming there is only one truth, and the magi ofscience have all the answers.THE “STORY” HAS CHANGEDTraditionally, skeptics have defended their belief systems by invoking scienceas the ultimate authority. This should be a confusing time for them, becausethose same authorities are continually changing the story. Everything we weretaught to believe was quietly transformed on October 22, 2013, in a paper thatwas published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, withoutany major media publicity. A team of three scientists, led by Dr. Erik Petigura,used NASA’s Kepler telescope to study 42,000 nearby stars that are similar toour own Sun. They were looking for moments when the brightness of each starplunged in a measurable way. These dimmings are caused when a planet crosses infront of the star. Petigura’s team found a total of 603 planets. Ten of themwere Earth-sized and orbited in the “habitable zone”—where oceans can formbecause the planet is neither too hot nor too cold. Petigura’s team already hadthe data to tell them these ten planets likely had liquid water. When youcombine two hydrogen atoms with one oxygen atom, you get water. NASA has alreadyproven that stars give off countless tons of hydrogen and oxygen gas. When thesegases reach a planet with the right temperature, they combine into water—andform atmospheres, rainfall, and oceans.Petigura’s study concluded that an astonishing 22 percent of all Sun-like starsin the universe have watery, Earth-like planets orbiting around them—in the zonewhere life has the proper conditions to appear. The closest star with anEarth-like planet around it is only twelve light years away, making it easy toreach in one human lifetime if our technology advances to a point where we cantravel at light speed. However, the real magic occurs when we take this 22percent figure and extend it out into the known universe. The results areabsolutely astonishing, and were summarized in an article entitled “The FermiParadox” on the website WaitButWhy.com.1 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber0]There are an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy alone.We now know that for every star in the Milky Way, there is an entire galaxy inthe universe. A galaxy is nothing but a huge grouping of stars. Once we arearmed with these numbers, we can prove that for every grain of sand on Earth,there are ten thousand stars in the universe. That number alone seems impossibleto comprehend, since we have thoughtlessly walked over countless grains of sandall our lives. Our story gets even more outrageous once we estimate that 5percent of those stars will be Sun-like, as NASA’s data has suggested. Thatmeans there are 500 quintillion, or 500 billion billion Sun-like stars in theuniverse.Each of these Sun-like stars will have a “habitable zone,” where a planet coulddevelop oceans of liquid water. If 5 percent of all the stars in the universeare like our Sun, and Petigura’s team discovered that one-fifth of these starswill have Earth-like planets orbiting around them, then that means 1 percent ofall the stars in the universe could be home to another planet we could live on.There would be 100 billion billion Earth-like planets in the cosmos. This meansthat for every single grain of sand on Earth, there are a hundred Earth-likeplanets in the universe. Based on these numbers, there are about a billionEarths in our own galaxy alone. If we then assume that only 1 percent of thosewatery worlds have developed some form of life, then every grain of sand onEarth represents an inhabited, Earth-like planet in the universe.Let’s assume that a mere 1 percent of those inhabited planets have life that hasevolved into an intelligent civilization, like what we now see on Earth. Thatwould mean there are 10 quadrillion, or 10 million billion intelligentcivilizations in our universe. When we apply this same logic to the Milky Way,we have 100,000 intelligent civilizations seeded among the billion Earth-likeplanets out there waiting for us. This is a radical re-envisioning of everythingwe think we know, coming directly from official sources working with NASA data.And with these numbers, the idea that we are alone in the universe becomesutterly ridiculous—akin to an extreme fundamentalist religious belief that iseasily dismissed.“The Fermi Paradox” also asks us to consider the age of the universe, currentlyestimated to be about 13 billion years. Earth was formed only 4.54 billion yearsago. It is entirely conceivable that an Earth-like planet could have emerged 8billion years ago around an older, Sun-like star. Now let’s imagine that thisplanet evolved to our current level of intelligence and technology in the samelength of time that it took to flourish here on Earth—4.54 billion years. Thatwould mean that this planet had 3.46 billion years to evolve beyond the level wehave reached today. The degree of technology, intelligence, and sophisticationthat could develop during that time may be beyond our ability to evencomprehend.On March 5, 2015, NASA announced that nearly half of Mars was once covered withan ocean, like those on Earth, that was up to a mile deep.2[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber1] Then, on September 28, 2015, NASA revealed thatMars still has liquid water on its surface today, in limited quantities.3[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber2] Finally, on November 5, 2015, NASA announcedthat Mars once had an atmosphere like Earth’s that was wiped out, perhaps bysome form of solar event.4 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber3] Pluto has an oddlyEarth-like atmosphere. According to a BBC article from March 12, 2015, whichquoted NASA, Jupiter’s moon Ganymede was found to have a subsurface ocean aswell as a variety of other satellites: “These include the dwarf planets Plutoand Ceres; other Jupiter moons—Europa and Callisto; Saturn’s moons Enceladus,Titan, and Mimas; and possibly Neptune’s moon, Triton. ‘The Solar System is nowlooking like a pretty soggy place,’ joked Jim Green, the US space agency’sdirector of planetary science.”5 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber4]These official discoveries are changing everything we were taught to believe.There are multiple places within our own solar system that are suitable forlife—in one form or another. Mars appears to have been Earth-like enough that anintelligent civilization could have thrived on it in our own past. These utterlylife-changing findings are being released here and there in the media, one at atime. They get a day or two of minor headlines, which are easily overlooked intoday’s world of information saturation, and are then forgotten. By simplyputting the pieces together, we can build a radically different worldview thanwhat most people now believe to be the absolute truth.THE COSMIC SEEDAnother scientific revolution occurred just a month before the Proceedings ofthe National Academy of Sciences study, in September 2013. It was too late toinclude the data in The Synchronicity Key, but I certainly wish I could have. Ican still see every detail of the plane I was sitting in when I read “A Jewel atthe Heart of Quantum Physics” in Quanta magazine.6[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber5] Even though we were still climbing in altitude,I wanted to unbuckle my seat belt and run up and down the aisle, shouting withjoy and amazement. So many years of scientific research and journalism had paidoff—in a way I honestly had never expected would happen. Hundreds of puzzlepieces snapped together in my mind, and for the first time I was able to see thegrand solution that unified them all into a single, complete whole.Most of us believe that the universe originated in a “Big Bang.” In this model,we are taught that “in the beginning, there was nothing.” Then, this “nothing”became “something.” In fact, “nothing” supposedly created all the matter in theuniverse in a single, sudden explosion—i.e., a “Big Bang.” It is obviously veryproblematic to tell us that “nothing exploded,” and in that one moment theentire universe was created. We still come back to the core problem, which isthat science is telling us that we get something out of nothing. If we canaccept this idea, then why would matter only be created once, at the verybeginning of the universe? Why wouldn’t there be an ongoing transformation ofsome form of invisible energy, or “nothing,” into the matter that we see today?The Big Bang model was given scientific support by the black hole theories ofStephen Hawking. However, the Big Bang is still an unproven assumption. Hardlyanyone is aware that Hawking’s own senior professor, Sir Roger Penrose, wasworking on a very different theory about the origin and nature of the universe.Hawking and Penrose have publicly debated about their two models for many yearsnow, but Penrose’s concepts have been completely ignored by the media. Penrosewas studying the movements of energy we see at the quantum level and looking fora hidden pattern that unified them. He found compelling evidence that everythingwe see in the universe—all space and all time—was being formed from a singlepoint, moment by moment. This would mean that there is no space, no matter, noenergy, and no time as we know it—only “distortions” of this one single point.The beginning, middle, and ending of the universe all exist simultaneously.The story gets even weirder when we see that Penrose believed this “point” wasactually an odd-looking three-dimensional geometric shape, made predominantlyout of triangles, as you can see here.[../image/01_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Sir Roger Penrose’s Model of a Universal Geometric SeedPenrose was working on the math to prove that this is how the universe works,and he had made compelling progress, but he hit a brick wall. His theory sataround as an intriguing but unproven scientific mystery until Nima Arkani-Hmedand Jaroslav Trnka, two scientists at the California Institute of Technology(Caltech), reopened the investigation. Through a staggering feat of mathematicalgenius, they were able to prove that Penrose’s basic idea was correct—he justdidn’t have the right shape. By finally getting the math right, these scientistseffectively proved that the universe as we know it does not exist. It behaveslike a hologram: it appears to be solid and three-dimensional but nothing isreally there. This also means if we zoom into the quantum level deeply enough,we will ultimately find a single “particle” that is making the entireuniverse—including all space and all time. This “particle” looks like a group offour triangular pyramids, or tetrahedrons, that have all been stuck together:[../image/02_AscensionMysteries.jpg]The “Amplituhedron”—Geometric Seed of the UniverseAlthough we see 100 to 400 billion galaxies in the universe, and potentially 100billion billion Earth-like planets—a hundred watery worlds for every grain ofsand on Earth—we now have proof that they are all emanating from this singlegeometric shape. The universe becomes like a vast tree with countless branchesthat all grew out of a single seed that is almost impossibly small. And, asconfusing as this may seem, the seed is all that really exists. The tree is onlyan illusion. There is no beginning and no ending. The seed and the tree coexistat the same time.SACRED GEOMETRYThe question then becomes, What is the universe? How do we explain all theseemingly solid matter that we see out there? In my first book, The Source FieldInvestigations, I presented extensive evidence that atoms and molecules are notmade of particles, but energy that is appearing in geometric patterns.7[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber6] Science tells us the nucleus of the atom is madeof protons and neutrons. One of the founding fathers of the atomic bomb, Dr.Robert Moon, discovered in 1987 that many of the greatest mysteries of the atomcould be solved if we see each proton as the corner of a simple geometricshape—like the cube. This elegantly solves the problem of wave-particle duality,the idea that subatomic particles can act like waves and vice versa. Dr. Moonconcluded that there are no particles in the atom—only waves of energy that formcertain geometric shapes. The simplest example of this is with oxygen. There areeight protons in an oxygen molecule. Dr. Moon identifies these eight protons asthe eight corners of a cube. That means if we could see the nucleus of an oxygenatom, we would be looking at a cube. The cube isn’t solid—it is only a wave.As we then go into heavier elements, the cube remains inside the nucleus, andits corners still count as protons, but new geometric shapes start forming overit. This begins with the octahedron, then the icosahedron, then thedodecahedron. This nest of shapes cranks out some of the most stable andabundant elements on Earth—oxygen (cube), silicon (octahedron), iron(icosahedron), and palladium (dodecahedron)—and solves an impressive number ofquantum physics problems.[../image/03_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Dr. Robert Moon’s Geometric Model of the AtomAlthough I love to explore these technical details, The Source FieldInvestigations has already been written. This book is not intended to presentanother scientific discourse on consciousness, biology, and physics, though wewill revisit some of those concepts. The most important point we need to knownow is that geometry is the visible form of vibration. This was very elegantlyproven by Dr. Hans Jenny, who generated beautiful geometric patterns—includingthe cube—in a drop of water. Dr. Jenny started with sand that was floating in adrop of water. This created what looked like a muddy, whitish liquid. Then hevibrated the drop of water with pure tones of sound, like what we hear when weplay the white keys on the piano. Miraculously, the sand particles arranged intobeautiful geometric wave patterns—as if they were under the influence of somemysterious, unseen force.[../image/04_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Geometric Patterns in a Vibrating Drop of Water Observed by Dr. Hans JennyThe same drop of water, with the same sand, will create totally differentgeometric patterns—including the cube—depending upon what sound you play intoit. As you can see, a three-dimensional Star of David–type pattern of trianglesappears in the water at certain sound frequencies. This pattern has astonishingsimilarities to the triangular shape our Caltech scientists discovered as beingthe seed of the universe.Most of us still believe matter is made of particles that are hard, solid, andtangible. If we retool our scientific models to see that atoms are geometricenergy patterns, then that means all matter could be formed by something akin toa sound wave—that has reverberated throughout the entire universe. This isexactly what the ancient spiritual traditions tell us. Hindus and Buddhistsbelieve the universe was formed from a primordial sound they call the aum. Theywill spend hours chanting this sound, and believe it gets them closer to theCreator. The book of Genesis says, “In the beginning, there was the word.”Native Americans beat a drum in honor of the heartbeat of the Mother—i.e., theuniverse.Let’s assume for a moment that our Caltech scientists are correct, and theentire universe is emanating from a single seed. We know that we are living andconscious beings. We are surrounded by a wealth of biological life. We appear tobe separate from everything else around us, but we are connected by the hiddenenergy in the quantum realm that flows through and creates all matter. All lifeon Earth is ultimately the fruit of this universal seed, if this new model iscorrect. Therefore, the seed must have all the ingredients needed to makebiological life and consciousness. The seed itself must be alive andintelligent. Everything we need to make intelligent civilizations like the oneswe now see on Earth would be contained within the seed. That means theingredients to make intelligent life are cosmic in nature, and sentient life mayvery well have flowered throughout the universe. This also means that life couldhave an energetic component that would not require any physical biologicalmaterial to exist. The energy itself is alive, forming what I call the “SourceField”—and all matter in the universe is part of a living cosmos.If you have already read The Source Field Investigations and The SynchronicityKey, then you have seen extensive scientific proof to support these assertions.The cosmos is not a void of darkness peppered with unthinking blobs of gasburning away with nuclear fusion. The universe is alive, aware, and intelligent.It is designed to make biological life. The codes that make DNA, proteins, andcells are directly written into the laws of quantum physics. My favorite proofof this came from the Nobel Prize–winning biologist Dr. Luc Montagnier.8[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber7] He was able to transform ordinary watermolecules, in a sealed container, into DNA. All he needed was another nearbysealed tube of water with DNA in it and some static electricity. The hydrogenand oxygen in the plain water somehow transmuted into complex amino acids thatassembled themselves into DNA. Montagnier’s experiments are very sound, and herepeated them many times. As you might expect, hardly any media outlets coveredthis story, even after his research was formally presented at the United Nationsin 2014.9 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber8] If this really works—and again,remember he won a Nobel Prize—then why would our own human DNA be any different?The code that makes human life could be written into the universe itself. Theremay be people living on a majority of those 100 billion billion Earth-likeplanets out there.“The Law of One,” a body of spiritual work we will explore later in this book,tells us that roughly 40 percent of all intelligent life throughout the universemay be human or at least hominid in appearance—meaning having a head, eyes,nose, mouth, and ears, walking upright on two legs, and with two arms with someform of hands for toolmaking. We are also told that there are more than 67million inhabited worlds in our galaxy alone—or about 67 percent of allEarth-like planets in Petigura’s estimate.If the universe is making all of us out of a single seed, then what are we doinghere? What is the greater purpose for our lives on Earth? Why does our planetseem so incredibly damaged—surfing right on the brink of total catastrophe? Whyare so many people suffering through such intense pain and loneliness? Why do weseem hopelessly confused, with no definitive proof that we are not alone in theuniverse? If other intelligent civilizations do exist, they have been hummingalong just fine—whether we realize they are out there or not. Why don’t theyjust show up, tell us who they are, and reveal the true nature of the universe?Perhaps we simply haven’t matured enough, as a planet, to be given the secret.DESTROYING THE UFO COVER-UPAnother central mystery we will explore in this book is the shadowy world ofgovernment secrecy. The Snowden documents were released in June 2013, rightafter I had finished writing The Synchronicity Key, which predicted thatinformation like this would be revealed.10 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber9]Suddenly, whistle-blowers who had been ridiculed for years as “conspiracytheorists” became brave harbingers of a terrifying truth. An overwhelming amountof information was released in the first six months alone, and the disclosureshave been ongoing ever since. We now know that we are under constantsurveillance in almost every form imaginable. Nothing is private. If we takenude photos of ourselves, someone like Snowden working at the NSA has thesoftware to look at them whenever he wants. We can be watched through thecameras on our smartphones and laptops. Every conversation can be transcribedinto text with a system like Apple’s Siri, and those transcripts can then beorganized in vast databases to look for keywords. And this “all-seeing eye” wasin place for many years, cloaked in total secrecy. Snowden proved thatastonishingly elaborate secrets are being hidden from us—secrets that wouldprofoundly change everything we think we know about our lives on Earth.In this book I will combine the testimony of multiple whistle-blowers who haveinformation that makes Snowden’s revelations seem like kindergarten class. Wehave overwhelming evidence that UFOs and extraterrestrials do exist—not just inour own time, but throughout our recorded history. For most people, “Are wealone?” is still an intriguing question with no absolute proof. However, I havemet multiple whistle-blowers who have had face-to-face, in-person contact with avariety of humanlike ETs—and no longer have the luxury of doubting that UFOs arereal.Some of these people have already gone public, and I will give you all the linksyou need to follow up and hear more of what they said for yourself. Others haveonly spoken to me personally, and the stories they have to share are absolutelyastonishing. The insiders present us with the tempting idea that a wide varietyof intelligent civilizations are already here now—and the truth has beencarefully hidden from us. Millions of people have avidly followed the work Ihave put out in YouTube videos and television shows, on my website andelsewhere, and the vast majority of you have said you want to hear what theseinsiders have revealed. It is quite a story, and in order to properly tell it, Ineed to summarize twenty-two years’ worth of “leaks” from a variety offascinating characters. Some of these people need to have their identitieshidden for their own safety, and in the second half of this book I will focus onwhat they told me—and how it all fits together into a grand mosaic.Ask yourself this: Isn’t it strange that we had the technology to land on theMoon as early as 1969, and then we never went back? Isn’t it strange that thespace shuttle program was completely discontinued, as if there was nothing outthere worth seeing? Did you know that the US government revealed they had asecret space plane, the X-37B, that was orbiting the Earth for nearly two yearsbefore landing? What were they doing up there? Is it possible that there havebeen ongoing missions to the Moon and even Mars, and we already have basesthere? I have spoken with multiple insiders who claim to have lived and workedin bases on the Moon, Mars, and elsewhere in our solar system—and beyond. Manyof these insiders say they have had contact with extraterrestrials. The mostsurprising thing they say is that these extraterrestrials are predominantlyhuman-looking, or at the very least hominid in appearance.Henry Deacon claims to have met about forty-three different human-lookingextraterrestrials. Pete Peterson claims to have seen about thirteen varieties.Both of these men came forward in Project Camelot videos I was featured in.Sergeant Clifford Stone went public at the Disclosure Project event in May 2001and said he was personally aware of fifty-seven varieties operating in Earth’sown airspace. I was there at this groundbreaking event, where Dr. Steven Greerbrought together thirty-nine different high-level whistle-blowers to share whatthey knew at the National Press Club in Washington, DC—in front of the world’smedia. Each insider offered to testify before Congress, swearing to tell thetruth under oath, and subjecting themselves to rigorous cross-examination.Nothing ever happened. None of them were subpoenaed. Yet I had a chance to talkto the majority of them while I was there. The stories are extremely fascinatingand still largely unknown to most people. Other insiders who appeared to melater in our story had much more information than anyone at the DisclosureProject.I understand how ridiculous this must sound, particularly if this is all new toyou. I encourage you to have an open mind and not immediately decide that thisis all nonsense. One of the most fascinating features of this investigation hasbeen that different insiders have continually said the same things over thesepast twenty-two years. I deliberately withheld the majority of what they weretelling me so I could weed out the real people from the frauds, charlatans, andfakers. There are countless examples of people making up stories on the Internetand looking to cash in on the quick fame that can occur when an interesting newstory “goes viral” in the UFO community. My policy has never been to accuseanyone of making up stories. I try not to say anything about the suspected fakesone way or the other. I discovered a long time ago that this unleashes hordes ofangry followers who will then do whatever it takes to try to destroy you andyour reputation online. There are dozens of examples of people who pretend to beinsiders, and then come out with “new information” a week or two after I releasea little more of what I was told. Then all the emails come in from people whoare excited about what they just heard, and they do not realize that I hadalready leaked that exact same information a week or two before.One major clue that an insider is the real deal is when I hear twenty or thirtydifferent things in a single conversation that others have already shared withme, which have never been revealed online. This is what we would expect to occurwhen there is a common body of truth that each of these people has come intocontact with. Some skeptics argue that the government can’t even find a piece ofpaper in a file cabinet, never mind keep a secret, but this is not true. TheManhattan Project proved that the government can keep very big secrets from us.More than 130,000 employees worked to develop the nuclear bomb in the ManhattanProject over the course of a decade, including Dr. Robert Moon, who discoveredthe geometric nature of the atom. Many of them had no idea what they were doing.The facilities were kept secret, as was the technology. Not one employee everleaked their secrets. It was only once the bomb was actually detonated that theyfound out what they had been working on for all those years.In a similar sense, one of my insiders claims to have had a job at a militarybase where all he did was autopsy various extraterrestrial corpses and look foridentifiable organ systems. For the first nine months, he was handed little“salmon filets” of biological tissue and told to dissect and analyze them. Inhis second nine-month term, he started getting body parts like arms and legsthat were humanlike but different. Then in his third nine-month term, he gotintact or semi-intact corpses. He was never told they were extraterrestrial. Hewas never allowed to ask a single question about where they were from or what hewas doing. He claims to have personally autopsied approximately two thousanddifferent varieties of humanlike ETs. They ranged from less than a foot tall toover forty-five feet in height. A high-ranking friend of his eventually sneakedhim into a hangar that was on the same base and showed him a very bizarrediamond-shaped craft. He was apprehended, beaten, threatened with death if hetold anyone what he had just seen, and fired. He then was captured, threatened,and beaten again just for riding his bike in the mountains near where he used towork. These experiences caused him to have severe PTSD—post-traumatic stressdisorder—that he still suffers with today. He has never wanted to come forwardand has not profited from this in any way. He knew many of the same secretsother proven insiders had shared with me privately.There is a single mega-story that emerges from this collective body of insiderinformation, and in this book we will give a summary overview of it—both on thepersonal level as well as the cosmic. To begin with, we find out that there aregood ETs and bad ETs, and they have been warring with one another in our solarsystem for hundreds of thousands of years. Both types of ETs are making directcontact with certain people on Earth who are receptive to the messages they haveto share. The negative ETs are apt to contact those who already have great moneyand power, and will give them tools to further enhance their control. Thepositive ETs are far more apt to contact private individuals who are judged bythe quality and virtue of their character—their forgiveness, acceptance,patience, and love. Their method of contact is thoroughly outlined in this book,through my own direct personal example. They deliberately approach you throughthe imagination first. You are not sure whether what you are seeing and hearingis real or just a dream. Your life becomes filled with ever increasingly bizarrecoincidences. You suspect something but are not sure, and flip-flop betweenunderstanding and great confusion. All this is done to prevent fear, and to giveyou a gentle, peaceful introduction into this greater reality.Both types of ETs have walked the Earth’s surface themselves at various times inour past. And the choices we all make as a people, both individually andcollectively, will determine the outcome of this battle for each of us. Both thepositive and negative ETs are bound by a Prime Directive, just like the one wehear about in Star Trek, stating they cannot openly reveal themselves to us orinterfere in our development until a sufficient majority of us welcome them todo so. Scientific explorers from our own time follow a similar policy whendealing with indigenous tribes. If they show up and introduce themselves, aphenomenon called “enculturation” occurs. The indigenous tribes quickly give uptheir own language, culture, and customs, and adopt the food, language,technology, information, and beliefs of their visitors.Many insiders have said that a gradual plan to reveal the truth has been underway for many years—at least since the 1950s. Some have referred to this as theProcessed Release of Information, or PRI. We are publicly told that UFOs do notexist, while countless films and television programs talk about it as if thetruth is obvious—and even make jokes about how ridiculous it is for anyone todoubt it. More and more, the greatest skeptics end up looking like religiouszealots.The greatest secret these insiders have shared with me is that a massiveenergetic shift is happening on Earth. We are apparently moving into a densecloud of highly charged energetic particles in our galaxy. This zone of higherenergy is having an effect on our consciousness as well as our DNA. For manyyears I had read spiritual sources saying that this was happening. Versions ofthis story appear in the Bible, the Koran, the Hindu scriptures, the Buddhistscriptures, and many other ancient texts. Collectively, there are thirty-fivedifferent ancient spiritual traditions that predict a time of great strife andpain on Earth that then leads to a Golden Age, much greater than anything we areseeing now. Over the years I have done the hard work to put together ascientific case that could prove this is really happening.In the past I have tackled this investigation by integrating a wealth ofscientific data together. I have also extensively explored the mysteries ofancient civilizations, where “gods” walked among us and were said to have builtmassive stone structures we can still visit today. Many of these structures werecreated with stones that are so heavy we still do not have any crane on Earththat is large enough to lift them. An ancient temple in Baalbek, Lebanon, hasthree huge rectangular stone slabs in it that weigh more than a thousand tonseach, and are supported by a structure keeping them feet above the ground. In2015, an even larger carved rectangular stone was found nearby, weighing anastonishing 1,650 tons with a length of sixty-five feet. This stone wasdiscovered beneath another loose stone that was almost as heavy, indicating thatthe upper stone would have to have been lifted away in order to sculpt the lowerone. Mainstream archeologists have tried to explain all this away as the work ofprimitive savages rolling them along on greased-up logs, pulling them withmakeshift ropes in huge teams. In The Source Field Investigations, I reviewedsome of the evidence that reveals this idea is thoroughly impossible, evenridiculous. Why do these gigantic stone structures appear in so many differentcultures, worldwide, that are completely isolated from one another? Why wouldapparently primitive people want to tackle engineering projects that are stillalmost impossible to achieve—even with today’s technology? If it were so easyfor primitive people to fit hundred-ton or even thousand-ton blocks of stonetogether into huge, beautiful monuments, then why don’t we see any primitivecultures building structures like this today?Asking these questions, and being willing to search for the answers, is all apart of growing up, in the spiritual sense. We need to have the strength to riskbeing laughed at and ridiculed by our friends and family. Our history revealscountless examples in which we thought we knew everything, only to have majordiscoveries completely change our worldview. We did not understand that therewere creatures too tiny for the eye to see that could cause infections, and thusdoctors did not wash their hands when performing surgeries. We thought thatvarious health conditions were caused by “bad blood,” and that “bleeding” aperson could make them better. We thought the Earth was flat, and was the centerof our solar system, with the Sun orbiting around it just like the otherplanets. We thought objects fell by magic, and did not understand gravity, untilNewton. Even in the twentieth century, prominent scientists were sayingheavier-than-air flight was impossible, and were debunking the Wright Brothers’invention of the airplane for four full years after it was first successfullyflown at Kitty Hawk.It appears that the single most important thing the positive ETs want you tohear is the spiritual message given to us in the great world religions. Theworld seems to be impossibly broken, and every day we face problems that seem tohave no solution. But no matter how dire, depressing, and hopeless someone’slife may be, everyone is capable of undergoing massive transformation. Many ofmy readers and viewers look up to me as an authority figure, and do not realizehow profoundly I have suffered to reach this point. Now you will know. If youwere to zoom in on my life as a teenager, you would see someone who appeared tobe on a road to nowhere. I was significantly overweight, had long hair that Inever bothered to comb, wore black rock-and-roll T-shirts, and did not want totalk to anyone. I was extremely shy, terrified of rejection, and let my friendsand classmates walk all over me. Bullies could basically do whatever they wantedwith no fear of reprisal. The people at my twenty-year high school reunion wereutterly astonished when they saw me and realized how much I had turned my lifearound.I originally did not want to include personal information in this book at all.Everything changed when I took one of the only real vacations I have ever had inmy adult life, and got away to the mountains of Banff, in Alberta, Canada, for awhole month. I went back and actually read the four main texts of the NewTestament—the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. I had felt so alienatedfrom Christianity as a whole that I had never read those books before. Once Iactually saw the words, I realized that there were dozens of references toascension—both on a personal and global level—that I had missed.I was very reluctantly forced to admit that all the key elements of myinvestigations were right there in the Bible. We have a global villain that isfar more evil than most people ever allow themselves to see. It has penetratedalmost all aspects of our society, including the government, the military, thefinancial system, the mainstream media, and corporations. Insiders have revealedthis entity is secretly being supported, if not controlled by, extraterrestrialhumans who are very, very evil. These beings have a hatred of us that is so pureas to be the perfect embodiment of evil. On the opposite end of the spectrum, wehave Jesus, who gave the same teachings I have been hearing and sharing allthese years about loving and forgiving others—and who said love was the key tosaving the world. There are multiple references in the Bible to some sort ofcelestial “moment of truth,” when we undergo a spontaneous, mass evolution. Thisseems to involve an incredible release of blindingly bright light from the Sunthat utterly transforms us into a new level of human evolution.Once I found this new evidence in the Bible, I went back to the originalreferences I had found to this same type of event in the Hindu and Zoroastrianscriptures. The Hindus referred to this solar flash as the Samavartaka fire, andthe Zoroastrians referred to it as an event they called Fraso-kereti. Both ofthese stories were briefly mentioned in The Source Field Investigations. Thevery end of The Synchronicity Key presents several quotes from the Koran thatpredict the same type of event. Now I went back into a variety of spiritual andphilosophical scriptures and looked for as many details as I could find. Certainkeywords opened up worlds of forgotten data I had never before encountered. Istarted finding scholarly papers that may have had only twenty-seven viewsonline, but were discussing this same solar event in academic terms. Idiscovered many other references to such an event in a wide variety ofcultures—references that were very specific. As a result, I now feel as if Ihave finally solved the grand puzzle of the Ascension Mysteries that I have beennavigating all these years. There is overwhelming evidence that we are headinginto a massive event that will utterly and completely transform life on Earth aswe know it. If this is really going to happen, and is an unavoidable naturalphenomenon, then the best thing we can possibly do is to prepare ourselves forit. It appears that the more we prepare for ascension on the personal level, thesooner we will “authorize” it to occur on the collective level.REPETITION COMPULSIONThe vast majority of spiritual sources I have found on this subject agree thatthe most important way to prepare yourself for ascension is to “do the work” ofbeing more loving and forgiving toward yourself and others in your daily life.This practice is not as easy as it sounds, as we can become physically addictedto drama, stress, and unhealthy situations. Dr. Sigmund Freud, the father ofpsychotherapy, named this “repetition compulsion.” In 1989, Dr. Bessel A. vander Kolk gave an excellent summary of this phenomenon in The Compulsion toRepeat the Trauma. This study has so many reference numbers at the end of itssentences that I removed them here to make it easier to read:Many traumatized people expose themselves, seemingly compulsively, to situationsreminiscent of the original trauma. These behavioral re-enactments are rarelyconsciously understood to be related to earlier life experiences. This“repetition compulsion” has received surprisingly little systematic explorationduring the 70 years since its discovery, though it is regularly described in theclinical literature. . . . Re-enactment of victimization is a major cause ofviolence. Criminals have often been physically or sexually abused aschildren. . . . Self-destructive acts are common in abused children. . . . Inone study of adults who had recently been in accidents, 57 per cent showedbehavioral re-enactments, and 51 per cent had recurrent intrusive images. . . .At least four studies of family violence have found a direct relationshipbetween the severity of childhood physical abuse and later marital violence.Interestingly, nonhuman primates subjected to early abuse and deprivation alsoare more likely to engage in violent relationships with their peers asadults. . . .Some traumatized people remain preoccupied with the trauma at the expense ofother life experiences and continue to re-create it in some form for themselvesor for others. War veterans may enlist as mercenaries, victims of incest maybecome prostitutes, and victims of childhood physical abuse seemingly provokesubsequent abuse in foster families or become self-mutilators. Still othersidentify with the aggressor and do to others what was done to them. Clinically,these people are observed to have a vague sense of apprehension, emptiness,boredom, and anxiety when not involved in activities reminiscent of thetrauma. . . . Many observers of traumatic bonding have speculated that victimsbecome addicted to their victimizers. Erschak asks why the batterer does notstop when injury and pain are apparent and why does the victim not leave? Heanswers that “they are addicted to each other and to abuse. The system, theinteraction, the relation takes hold; the individuals are as powerless asjunkies.”11 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber10]Dr. van der Kolk goes on to reveal that this addiction is actually biochemicalin nature. The body has natural “opioid systems” that release the same basicchemicals as heroin or morphine. When we engage in repetition compulsion of ourtraumas, we are actually getting high from it. This is dangerously addictive,creating a full-body pain-relief sensation called “stress-induced analgesia”:Starr, Solomon, Erschak and others may be right in postulating that people canbecome physiologically addicted to each other. . . . High levels of stress,including social stress, also activate opioid systems. Animals exposed toinescapable shock develop stress-induced analgesia (SIA) when re-exposed tostress shortly afterward. . . . We found that seven of eight Vietnam veteranswith PTSD showed a 30 percent reduction in perception of pain when viewing amovie depicting combat in Vietnam. . . . This amount of analgesia produced bywatching 15 minutes of a combat movie was equivalent to that which follows theinjection of 8 mg. of morphine. . . . Depending on which stimuli have come tocondition an opioid response, self-destructive behavior may include chronicinvolvement with abusive partners, sexual masochism, self-starvation, andviolence against self or others. . . . This pattern is reminiscent of spouseabuse described by Walker: “tension gradually builds, an explosive battering(self-mutilating) incident occurs, and a ‘calm, loving respite’ follows.”12[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber11]The great villains in our planetary script constantly fill the headlines withfear and trauma. Terrifying media, presenting horrors such as the threat of massdestruction, triggers a morphine response that gets us high—which I have termed“fear porn.” Some people are then influenced to abuse others, whereas others gethigh from feeling victimized. I feel the best way to understand this phenomenonand deactivate the system is to study the personal testimony of someone who hasidentified the addiction and recovered from it. Breaking this habit, I believe,is the core of the ascension process, and it is the main reason why I am sharingso much of myself with you in this book. It took a great deal of time,meditation, and concentration to remember all the most significant details frommy childhood. The timing of my memories was often calibrated by things likemovies, albums, and television shows, for which I could use the Internet to findout exactly when they happened. Significant events in the world and in my ownfamily also provided clues. It was quite interesting to discover that one memorywould immediately cause two or three more to appear. I was able to rebuild anincredible number of things I had forgotten, and once I remembered them, thememories became crystal clear. This has been quite a journey of healing, and Ifound out that Tibetan monks do a very similar “life review” while they spendyears meditating alone in caves.The villains are doing everything they can to make you ignore your spirituality,fall into jealousy, materialism, and fear, and prevent you from being ready forthis epic change. The only way to break the trauma addiction is to learn to loveand protect yourself, and then to be able to forgive those who have harmed you.The positive forces cannot just appear in the sky and tell you what is going tohappen in our future. They need to present you with information that you canchoose to either accept or reject with your own free will. One of the mostfascinating things I have gotten out of writing this is seeing how life canappear to be right on the edge, damaged beyond all possibility of repair, andyet the higher beings working with us are completely at peace in this zone. Theyknow every twist and turn of the path, from the brightest to the darkest, andcan help us out of the most impossible-seeming paradoxes. I was told that bysharing my own story of awakening, you may be able to see how a life that seemsimpossibly painful, broken, and wasted can be turned around into something thatcan create genuine value and uplifting inspiration for others. Ultimately, youdon’t have to be perfect. If you can learn to love yourself and love otherpeople, your life will transform as if by magic. If you remain addicted to fear,new traumas will keep reappearing, and the highs will never last very long. Youmay indulge in all sorts of addictive behaviors, including stress eating,compulsive spending, and chemical dependency, to cope with daily life. If youdemonstrate love, patience, humility, acceptance, forgiveness, and the courageto face the truth, ascension is in your grasp. You may just leap into anentirely new level of human evolution—and gain all the abilities of masters likeJesus."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOA BATTLE AGAINST DARKNESSIt was a cold, dark night in the fall of 1978 when I discovered I was levitatingover my bed. The ceiling was much closer than it was supposed to be. Everythingaround me seemed to be pulsating with an unseen energy. I pushed my arms downand nothing was there to stop them. I then lifted my left shoulder, dropped myright shoulder, twisted my torso, and was able to turn over in the air. To myincredible surprise, I could now see my own five-year-old body sleepingpeacefully in bed. My chest was rising and falling, so I clearly was not dead.My first thought was, “If that’s me down there, then who the heck am I?”Fascination quickly took over, as my floating body was fully clothed—wearing thesame pair of yellow pajamas with the red cuffs that I was wearing in bed. How inthe world could a simple pair of pajamas, made out of cheap “plastic” polyestermaterial, have suddenly doubled? The experience lasted several minutes, andeverything around me stayed stable and vividly realistic the entire time.When I finally emerged from this incredible event, I was so dazzled I couldbarely fall back asleep. I immediately knew I had discovered a new frontier thatmost people were completely unaware of. I no longer had to wonder about whetherthere was life after death. Even if my physical body died, I would still havethis energetic body—my soul—afterward. Life was not simply about flesh andblood. There is something much greater about who and what we are than wenormally realize. I was so profoundly transformed by this event that I saved thepajamas and still have them in my closet right now. What ended up surprising methe most was that this appeared to be a natural event, something anybody couldpotentially do, but hardly anyone had experienced it—or even believed it waspossible. That was a big clue that something was really wrong with the world asit is today. I realized that I could potentially travel long distances, observethings that were happening somewhere else, and gain valuable information. Italso occurred to me that there must be some part of me that is doing this allthe time. Either I did not remember these experiences consciously, or I thoughtthey were only dreams. Little did I know at the time that this was also thefirst glimpse of a stunning new reality that could provide humanity with realhope—to defeat a global villain far beyond most people’s wildest imagination.Our collective fear of “the monster under the bed” might make us high as eachnew threat occurs, but until we soberly face the truth on a collective level, wecan never hope to break the addiction and heal our world.THE BRITISH INVASIONBoth of my parents shared a nation’s grief when a very well-liked Americanpresident, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, was murdered in broad daylight, receivinggunshot wounds to the head. The Warren Commission explained away what clearlyappeared to be multiple bullets from different locations as the work of a singlebullet that zigzagged around. Like most Americans, my parents knew the storydidn’t add up. It was all too convenient to blame everything on one gunman, LeeHarvey Oswald, who was shot to death before he could ever stand trial. At thetime, no one wanted to consider that elements of the US government itself mayhave been responsible for Kennedy’s murder. Everyone chose to stay asleep andkeep their heads down as they felt the morphine response from the terror thiscaused. There were no mass protests or calls for a new investigation thatcreated any tangible results. Kennedy’s vice president, Lyndon Baines Johnson,was sworn in as president—and ramped up a “police action” that soon became knownas the Vietnam War. The first deployment of 3,500 Marines was in March 1965, andit was increased to 200,000 troops that December.Less than three months after the Kennedy assassination in November 1963, the new“British Invasion” came to America in the form of the Beatles. As I said in TheSynchronicity Key, the ear splitting screaming and crying of female Beatle fansseemed to be a mass cathartic purging of the trauma of JFK’s assassination—andof the government and media participating in an obviously botched cover-up.John, Paul, George, and Ringo suddenly became new heroes, filling the epic voidthat Kennedy had left behind and creating a musical legacy and celebrity thathas still never been duplicated or outmatched. In a sense, the Beatles created anew high that allowed people to forget the traumas of their immediate past—andnever look back. The band was so besieged by screaming, crying fans that theyquit touring after their fourth album and spent most of their time in thestudio. The classic albums Rubber Soul and Revolver were followed by Sgt.Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in early 1967, which strongly influenced whatwas called the “Summer of Love.”The Beatles used their fame to fight back against the death-dealing powers ofthe day by releasing “All You Need Is Love” as a single on June 25, 1967. It wasperformed live during a show called Our World, which was the first to fullyutilize new satellite-based broadcast technology.13[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber12] This would prove to be the most popular momentin television history, watched by more than 400 million people in twenty-fivecountries. The Beatles changed the song they were scheduled to perform at thelast minute and brilliantly touched off a youth revolution in the process.Unlike during World Wars I and II, Britain did not have a draft, and they sentonly about two thousand soldiers into Vietnam—but the Beatles were obviouslygreatly concerned about what was happening to their American brothers andsisters. My parents were two people among millions of young adults who wereprofoundly affected by all the changes taking place at this time. It becameclear that silence equaled death, and they needed to stand up to the forces inpower in order to secure their own future.THEIR BRITANNIC MAJESTIES REQUESTThe only other British band that was competing on the same level as the Beatlesin the transformative period of the late 1960s was the Rolling Stones. OnDecember 8 of the magical year 1967, in the aftermath of the Summer of Love, theRolling Stones released a bizarre album called Their Satanic Majesties Request.The title was a play on the text that appears in every British passport,beginning with “Her Britannic Majesty requests and requires.” Mick Jagger, thelead singer of the band, was pictured wearing a dunce cap, suggesting he was thefool, or court jester—the character who often reveals secret politicalinformation in Shakespearean plays. It thus appeared that the “court jester” wasintroducing the British empire as “Their Satanic Majesties.” The cover art andmusical style were obviously intended to copy the Beatles’ classic record fromthat same year, but the Stones were doing a lot of drugs at the time and SatanicMajesties did not have the timeless quality of Sgt. Pepper.Oddly, the drummer of the band was pictured in a costume that looked exactlylike that of Henry VIII, the legendary British king. Henry had six wives, two ofwhom he assassinated, and he was famous for breaking away from the RomanCatholic Church. Henry created radical changes to the British constitution,instituting the Divine Right of Kings, and also declared the British sovereignto have full supremacy over the Church of England—effectively putting himselfand his successors in a godlike role over Christianity. Henry also executed manyof his dissenters without a formal trial through the use of “bills ofattainder,” which lobbed charges of treason and heresy that could not bequestioned. It was very puzzling to see the Beatles’ main competitor come outwith an album that very openly mentioned and endorsed Satanism, and thatsuggested it was woven directly into the British empire, just six months afterthe Beatles had triggered a revolution by saying “All You Need Is Love.”Satanic Majesties also had intriguing suggestions that it was written to honoran extraterrestrial civilization that had fallen to Earth. A ringed planet,perhaps Saturn, appears behind the band in the cover photo. Due to copyrightlaws, we cannot feature all the lyrics here, but it is worth a look. The song“2000 Man” has a chorus that says: “Oh Daddy, proud of your planet, oh Mummy,proud of your sun. . . . Did you come down crashing?” After hearing the insidertestimony I received in 2014, which I will review in the second half of thisbook, I realized these lyrics could be describing a civilization from anotherplanet and sun coming down and crash-landing on Earth—led by an extraterrestrialbeing we now call Lucifer, who arrived here along with his supporters, the“fallen angels” in the Bible.How could anyone on Earth support a being like Lucifer? It doesn’t even seempossible. Up until recently, you would open yourself up to ridicule andostracism from your friends and family if you even dared to believe such anidea. It took a great deal of time, energy, research, insider testimony, andpersonal risk for me to discover that there is a vast, secretive cult on Earththat considers Lucifer to be the good guy. Some people call this group the “NewWorld Order,” the Bilderbergers, the Trilateral Commission, or the Illuminati,but here we will call them the Cabal.This Cabal believes the Christian god is the embodiment of evil—suppressingknowledge, freedom, sexuality, and scientific progress. Even more outrageously,this group has amassed incredible power—including a shocking degree of controlover the media, the financial system, Western governments, and themilitary-industrial complex. It can be deeply upsetting, if not almostimpossible to face—but hiding from the truth and hoping it will “just go away”is much more dangerous than educating yourself about it. Once you finally comeinto contact with enough evidence that you are convinced, you end up goingthrough a “dark night of the soul”—a deep grieving process during which yourealize you have been lied to all your life, and a terrifying global villain isleering at you from all sides. This is an essential step in the awakeningprocess, as ultimately you realize you have been living in a world ofillusion—and much of what you were taught to believe has been deliberatelymanipulated by those in power.A variety of insiders have risked their lives to reveal these hidden truths.Today’s youth are being forced to confront this on a much greater level than anyprevious generation. Unlike the brief signs of trouble that were seen in albumslike Satanic Majesties, millennials are now being inundated with a seeminglynonstop bombardment of Luciferian symbolism in movies, music videos, Super Bowlhalftime shows, music awards ceremonies, video games, and television shows. Popmusic icons such as Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, and Miley Cyrushave music videos and live performances that are astonishingly full of“Illuminati” symbolism, such as the All-Seeing Eye. This Cabal now appears to beon a very aggressive advertising campaign, hoping to make their religion seemhip and trendy.14 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber13] Nonetheless, this does notnecessarily mean that the stars themselves support the message, and insiders saythese stars are often severely abused. The singer Kesha openly accused herformer producer of raping her. She gained widespread sympathy from other popstars, including Adele, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga, after having her casedismissed in the spring of 2016.15 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber14] At leasteighteen different celebrities voiced their support for Kesha.16[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber15]Many insiders told me this secretive group is building up to a formalannouncement of their presence that they have called “The Great Revealing.”Luckily, a tremendous number of YouTube videos now exists that expose theagenda—and many of them have millions of views. This has become the next greatyouth revolution—far greater in numbers and potential impact than the originalWoodstock. Many overlooked and forgotten clues from the past are now beingunearthed and reexamined as part of a massive, generations-wide investigationinto these mysteries.It is important to note that these elites do not think they are doing anythingbad. They believe they are liberating us from weakness and ignorance. Anyone whodies along the way toward their pursuit of a “New World Order” is considered tobe an acceptable loss as we move toward what they consider to be“enlightenment.” One of their most highly guarded secrets is that they believethey are the direct bloodline descendants of ancient extraterrestrial humanvisitors to Earth who were more advanced than the rest of us and becamepharaohs, kings, and gods. This “magical blood” is used as an excuse for them tofeel superior to everyone else, thus giving them the right—and the need—to rulethe Earth. The best intel we now have from high-level insiders suggests theywere an extraterrestrial refugee group who crash-landed here 55,000 years ago.They were badly defeated in a war and did not have the technology or know-how toleave once they arrived. They spread throughout the world, set up controlsystems, and survived multiple collapses of civilizations and uprisings by thosethey attempted to rule.The Satanic Majesties song “2000 Man” also says the “circling sun”—perhaps inanother solar system—is “where we all come from.” The song “The Lantern”includes the words “We . . . knew that the stars were right . . . crossed thesea of night.” Then the message seems to culminate in “2000 Light Years fromHome,” which includes the lyrics “We’re . . . bound for a star with fieryoceans . . . it’s so very lonely, you’re two thousand light years from home.”Why would all this talk of what is obviously space travel be on an album calledTheir Satanic Majesties Request? Bruce, one of the key insiders we will meetlater in this book, told me, “David, it doesn’t matter whether you believe this,or anyone else believes this. It doesn’t even matter if it is really true. Allthat matters is that they absolutely do believe this. It is a religion—and theyare very devout followers of it. Once you understand that, everything they aredoing begins to make a lot more sense. They believe that practicing theirreligion gives them occult, magical powers that lead to great fame and fortune.The more money and power you have, the more enlightened you are.” This does notmean that the artists themselves are Satanists, necessarily. It is common forthe power elite to create scapegoats who will take the fall for them in casethey are ever exposed. They will tell countless lies to make their religion seemattractive to others.Rock and roll was being introduced to the British public through the Top of thePops television show. The number-one-selling band each week got to perform liveon the show, and the Rolling Stones put in an astonishing thirty-threeappearances—including a performance of “2000 Light Years from Home” on December21, 1967. In 2013, the world learned that the main host of the show, JimmySavile, was a serial rapist. More than 450 victims came forward with terrifyingtales of how he abused them, with estimates that the full number could easily bethree times greater. Savile financed a variety of children’s hospitals, and onevictim told the UK’s Daily Express that she was taken to a secret room in one ofSavile’s hospitals. The room was dark, lit only by candlelight. Savile was therealong with others wearing robes and masks. Savile chanted “Ave Satanas,” or“Hail Satan,” in Latin while sexually abusing and torturing her. This certainlydoes not mean that the Rolling Stones were torturing and raping people insatanic rituals, but it does strongly suggest that the Cabal was using theStones’ music to spread negative messages. Savile had so many victims that thereis no way the BBC could have avoided hearing about what he was doing—and yet hecontinued to be a very popular television star all the way up through the 1990s.Additional revelations from 2013 and forward have revealed that there werepedophiles in high levels of the British government as well—suggesting thepresence of a powerful hidden culture where this was considered acceptable. OnMay 20, 2015, British police announced that 261 “people of public prominence”were being investigated for child sex abuse. This included 135 figures from TV,film, and radio, seventy-six politicians on both a local and national scale,forty-three different figures in the music industry, and seven involved insports.17 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber16]On March 26, 2016, the New York Times published an exposé that was the result ofa three-year independent investigation of the BBC by Dame Janet Smith, a retiredjudge: “In the scathing report of more than 700 pages, Dame Janet Smith . . .said BBC staff members were aware of complaints against Mr. Savile, but theaccusations were not conveyed to senior management because of a ‘culture of notcomplaining.’ . . . Dame Janet said an ‘atmosphere of fear’ still existed at thecorporation, noting that some of those interviewed for the report spoke onlyafter receiving guarantees that their names would not be published. She said shesuspected that they feared some form of reprisal.”18[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber17]PUBLIC CLUES OF A COSMIC BATTLEBy early 1968, fully 550,000 American troops were stationed in Vietnam, manyagainst their will. The climate in America was very dark. This was the year myfather met my mother while they were both working at General Electric inSchenectady, New York, and they quickly fell in love. Mom grew up in afundamentalist Christian family, only to become disillusioned and break awayfrom it after leaving home and going to Philadelphia Bible College. Theauthorities shot her down in flames for intelligently questioning the dogma shewas being taught. She was ultimately forced to sign a document swearing on hereternal soul that she believed every single thing they taught her, or else shewould not receive her diploma. As a result of her extremely strict upbringing,she had been almost completely divorced from pop culture, avoiding all music,films, and TV shows.My father loved horror movies and talked my mother into going to see Rosemary’sBaby with him. This film terrified and disturbed her so much that I heard aboutit many times throughout my childhood. The film portrayed Satanists as beingblended in with everyday people in a very believable way. The seemingly friendlyelderly folks living in the lead couple’s building were actually performingterrifying satanic rituals at night. In the movie, a struggling actor is toldthat having a baby with his wife and sacrificing the child to Satan wouldimprove his career. His wife is drugged and brought into a satanic ritual inwhich the Devil manifests in physical form and impregnates her. At the end ofthe film, she is horrified to discover that her child has glowing red eyes. Sheis told by the cult that she is the “chosen one,” and she should be honored thather baby is the spawn of Satan. She also hears that she does not have to jointhe cult if she doesn’t want to. She decides to love and raise the child despiteits horrific appearance. Despite the surreal idea of the Devil manifesting inphysical form, the film had an overpowering sense of realism and terror. Theviewer was led to believe it was entirely possible that Satan worshippers couldbe living among the rest of us—and the title of the Rolling Stones’ latest albumat the time certainly didn’t help.Rosemary’s Baby was directed by Roman Polanski, who originally wanted to casthis wife, Sharon Tate, in the main role. Polanski did not push the studio onthis, hoping they would suggest her, but they did not. Tate contributed notes tothe script, including suggestions about the impregnation scene. She wasfrequently seen on the set and photographed by Esquire magazine to generatepublicity for the film.In November 1968, the Beatles released the complex, emotional album The Beatles,known as the “White Album,” right as Richard Milhous Nixon won the presidentialelection. The White Album featured the song “Revolution 1,” openly calling for amajor political shift, and this again helped to crystallize the desire forchange in the world’s youth at the time. The album also had some very darkthemes as John Lennon was sliding more and more into heavy drugaddiction—leading to songs such as “Happiness Is a Warm Gun,” which veryblatantly described shooting heroin, and raunchy blues in which Lennon screamedabout how lonely and suicidal he was, and how he hated his rock and roll. PaulMcCartney’s song “Helter Skelter” also had a wild, raw, and violent feeling toit. The strangest song on the album was “Revolution 9,” an extended and deeplydisturbing “bad trip” of sounds that included machine-gun fire, peoplescreaming, and haunting, horror-movie dissonance. As he revealed in hisbiography Many Years from Now, Paul McCartney heavily fought to have the songremoved from the album, but he lost the battle. The White Album became thegreatest-selling record in the entire Beatles canon, though Rolling Stonemagazine journalists consider Sgt. Pepper, Revolver, and Rubber Soul as allbeing superior to it in quality.The Rolling Stones released their classic album Beggar’s Banquet on December 6,1968, which was a remarkable improvement in quality over Their Satanic MajestiesRequest from the year before. In February 1969, their record label released oneof its songs, “Sympathy for the Devil,” as a single. This seemed to be a directfollow-up and further revelation of the mysteries hinted at in SatanicMajesties. The song was admittedly quite shocking and worthy of analysis, asMick Jagger sings as if he were Lucifer—introducing himself to the world andasking for our understanding and respect. Jagger-as-Lucifer identifies himselfas being extremely wealthy and cultured, like the British elites, and indicatesthat if you want to speak to him, you must approach with the highest levels ofpoliteness and manners.Jagger-as-Lucifer takes credit for several key historical events. In order,these include the temptation of Jesus, the assassination of the Russian czar inSt. Petersburg that led to the Russian Revolution of 1917, the aggression ofNazi Germany, a ten-decade war of kings and queens over “the gods they made,”the Kennedy assassinations, and the deaths of British soldiers on their way toBombay, India. A connection to the Vietnam War is implied as well. Availableresearch and whistle-blowers have since revealed that a single group did indeedfinance the Russian Revolution, Nazi Germany, the Kennedy assassinations, andthe British Empire—owning and controlling both sides of World Wars I and II. Theevidence is summarized in my online book Financial Tyranny. Therefore, thisRolling Stones song did appear to be a genuine attempt to create “sympathy forthe Devil.” Most interestingly, Jagger-as-Lucifer said that the events thatpuzzle and confuse us the most were the nature of his game. Lucifer—or in thiscase the British majesties, seeing Lucifer as their patron saint—was responsiblefor many of the most damaging events on Earth. Insiders would later tell me thatLucifer’s greatest trick is convincing the world he does not exist. There isalso a potentially revealing line in which Mick sings in a high falsetto, “Itell you one time, you’re to blame”—suggesting that if we do not solve thesemysteries ourselves, we are indirectly authorizing these crimes to continue.RIDING THE LIGHTNINGMy mother was still reeling from her disillusionment with Christianity when Dadtook her to a live concert featuring The Doors, while Jim Morrison was in hisprime. Morrison had experimented with LSD, and the name of his band was anhomage to Aldous Huxley’s drug-taking memoir, The Doors of Perception. Theeffect that Morrison had on my mother was tremendous. In a single night, herentire life changed—her attitude, her values, and her goals. All herdissatisfaction with the religion she had been brought up with, the repressiveclimate her mother created, and the terrifying inferno that the nation’s youthwere being carelessly tossed into was transformed. Almost instantaneously, sheembraced the thoughts and ideals of the music and the youth anti-war movement inthe late 1960s—which some would call an awakening. Morrison had become a herofigure and a face of the movement, fearlessly demonstrating his rebellionagainst authority on stage and creating transcendent, life-changing music as hedid it.Jim Morrison also had an extremely dark side that became increasingly apparentbefore his tragic death. The Doors’ 1971 single “Riders on the Storm” featured acharacter who takes LSD, so that “his brain is squirming like a toad.” Thecharacter ends up brutally murdering his sister, brother, father, and mother. Heis also portrayed as a serial killer who becomes a hitchhiker—and “if you givethis man a ride, sweet family will die.” In at least one interview, Morrisonmentioned that the serial killer Billy Cook inspired this song, as Cook hadkilled six people, including a young family, while hitchhiking to California.Oddly enough, Morrison died of a drug and alcohol overdose on the very same daythat “Riders on the Storm” entered the Billboard Hot 100 chart at numberthree—creating a powerful, haunting mystery around the song itself and itsdisturbing message.WELCOME TO VIETNAMBy the time he went to see Morrison live, my father was already terrified ofbeing sent into the Vietnam death trap. He had decided to sign up for the ArmyReserve in the hopes of avoiding the draft. He was then forced to move to FortLee, Virginia, in 1968, married my mother, and was activated to serve in Vietnamin June 1969—which was his worst nightmare come true. His father told him he hadnever been so proud of him, and to Dad this felt like an incredible betrayal.Dad was flown out on a commercial airliner, not a military plane. As theylanded, the attractive female flight attendants gave a very normal-soundinggreeting: “The time is now eight thirty a.m. The local temperature isninety-nine degrees. Welcome to Vietnam!”When they got off the plane, all the soldiers were asked to stand in a circlearound a fire that was lit and burning right there on the tarmac. This was theirlast chance. If they had brought any illegal items with them, they could throwthem into the fire and no questions would be asked. If they failed to do so,they would be searched and the penalty could be very severe. Dad was covertlyholding on to some sleeping pills his mother had given him for anxiety—whichwere very bad for him to have in an active combat zone. He cast them into thefire, giving up any and all secrets and attachments to his former life. Thesoldiers were then told about Hamburger Hill. Anyone who was sent there would beforced to storm a hill surrounded by Viet Cong soldiers and would almostcertainly be killed. Right on the spot, there was a lottery in which many of themen standing there were sent to a certain and almost immediate death. Dad waslucky enough not to have to go, but this experience, coupled with theunexpectedly massive heat, rocked him to his core. He was told that he hadbecome “property of the United States government,” and that they had completeand total control over him—including whether he lived or died.Dad was stationed at Long Binh, the largest US base in Vietnam. Thanks to havingenlisted in the Army Reserve, he was able to work as a military journalist andavoid the front lines. Stories would come in from the “wire,” such as from theAssociated Press, and Dad would integrate them into a daily newspaper for allthe soldiers to read. Dad was also responsible for writing his own articles,including reports of every death on the battlefield.Dad was brave enough to write about the revolution that was taking place throughrock and roll music, which could easily have gotten him court-martialed or evenkilled in an “accident.” If it hadn’t been for my father, the soldiers atAmerica’s largest base in Vietnam would have had little or no idea what wasgoing on in music at this critical time in 1969. This made him a figure muchlike Robin Williams’s radio DJ character in the movie Good Morning, Vietnam. Momwould mail him all the latest records and he would listen to them and writeabout them. He also revealed the greater social issues that were taking placeback home—where soldiers’ friends in America were fighting to end the war. Thisincluded coverage of a huge upcoming music festival in Bethel, New York—whichwas later moved to Woodstock at the last minute when the farmer from Bethelpulled out of the deal.HELTER SKELTERSix days before Woodstock began, on August 9, 1969, the guitar-strumming wannaberock star Charles Manson led a group of his followers to murder Roman Polanski’scelebrity wife, Sharon Tate. She was eight and a half months pregnant. She andher baby died in the attack, and four others were brutally murdered at the sametime. Apart from helping her husband write Rosemary’s Baby, Tate had starred inoccult-themed movies including Eye of the Devil (1966), in which she played awitch who needs a blood sacrifice to restore a vineyard’s success, Valley of theDolls (1967), about the extremely negative effects of drugs, and The FearlessVampire Killers, from 1967.It was very frightening that a pregnant celebrity was murdered, along with herunborn child, just two years after she helped write a very similar-soundingscreenplay. In Rosemary’s Baby, a woman’s child was intended to be sacrificed soher husband could become a more successful actor. The idea that a real sataniccult was responsible for planning the sacrifice of her and her baby was tooupsetting for most people to bear. Manson claimed to have played the Beatles’White Album while he and his followers carried out this mass murder. Mansonspecifically cited songs like “Happiness Is a Warm Gun” and “Helter Skelter” asgiving him coded messages telling him he had to do it.In the mid-2000s, insiders told me the Manson murders were deliberately stagedto try to destroy the hippie movement and demonize them all as potentiallyviolent serial killers. It was specifically intended to create an aura of totalhorror and fear around Woodstock and collapse its momentum. The story of thegruesome murders dominated the headlines in the six days leading up to theevent—and the killings were performed by rock-music-loving hippies who said theywere doing it for the trees and for nature. I was told the hidden organizers ofthis atrocity had hoped to scare off any new people from accepting this newrevolution against the elite—and to demonize the Beatles as the embodiment ofevil itself. Despite this very negative mass trauma, Woodstock took off far morethan anyone could have imagined—and my father covered the whole story for thesoldiers at the largest American base in Vietnam, at great personal risk.It may not surprise you that at a Rolling Stones concert in San Francisco onDecember 6, 1969, just a few months later, a black man named Meredith Hunter wasstabbed to death in the front row by a motorcycle gang called the Hells Angels.The Hells Angels had, controversially, been hired to provide security for theevent. Hunter approached the stage, was violently driven off by the HellsAngels, pulled a gun on them, and was stabbed to death. Footage of this “humansacrifice,” as some called it, was featured in the popular Rolling Stonesdocumentary Gimme Shelter.Despite this controversy, the Rolling Stones released another Lucifer-themedalbum, Goat’s Head Soup, on August 31, 1973. Mick Jagger was pictured on thecover dressed as a woman with a veil over his face. His hair was styled like aclassic British updo, and the mass of hair over his head had the subtle butundeniable appearance of devil horns. This album featured the classic Stones hit“Angie,” but also included a song called “Dancing With Mr. D.” It was loadedwith references to drugs and death, and portrayed a character with human skullsaround his neck that the singer had a “tryst”—a sexual encounter—with in agraveyard. We also hear about a woman in black who looks at our singer withdesire, only to have the flesh fall off her bones, and her eyes burn like fireand brimstone.BORN INTO WATERGATEAfter my father returned from Vietnam, my parents tried for some time toconceive a child, and finally succeeded in early June 1972. Very soon afterward,on June 17, Richard Nixon’s presidential re-election team was caught breakinginto the Democratic National Committee headquarters to plant listening devicesthat could help them win a second term. This was the beginning of a dominoeffect known as the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to the exposure anddownfall of Nixon’s war-mongering regime, and the end of the deadly Vietnam Warthat was killing off an entire generation of young men. During her pregnancy, mymother had dreams and visions telling her the baby she was carrying would be aspiritual leader, and that she should raise him as if that was what he wouldbecome. She withheld this information from me until the late 2000s, and feltthat unless I was humble enough to hear it without getting an ego, she wouldtake it to the grave.Nine months later I was born, on March 8, 1973. Just three weeks before, onFebruary 14, General Electric had fired my father from his job. He came homewith roses and chocolate, wished my mother a happy Valentine’s Day, and thentold her he had been laid off. He was forced to look for work on an emergencybasis, and was able to find it only in Buffalo, New York, which was more thanfour hours of driving away from our home in Schenectady. As a result, he wasforced to go off to work very soon after I was born, while Mom stayed with hismother and father in Schenectady.The Watergate political scandal led to Senate committee hearings from May 17 toAugust 7, 1973, in which former administration officials testified. The threemajor networks—ABC, CBS, and NBC—took turns covering the hearings live, witheach network having sole coverage for a particular day. It is estimated that 85percent of Americans with television sets tuned in to at least a portion of thehearings. Up to 85 percent of Americans were reeling in horror at the idea thatthe government they had known, voted for, and in many cases loved was actinglike a tyrannical dictatorship—keeping secrets, lying, and stealing to defeattheir political opponents. Fourteen months after these hearings started, Nixonwas forced to resign. Eight months later, the Vietnam War ended, and thisobviously corrupt government could no longer send young men into a highlytraumatic and lethal combat zone.Strangely, my mother discovered that every time the Watergate hearings came on,I would start crying in my crib, even if I had been asleep. In addition,whenever Mom tried to leave the apartment, even to go get the laundry down thehall while I was fast asleep, I would immediately wake up and cry as soon as herhand touched the doorknob. Both of these events happened so many times that theidea of it being “just a coincidence” quickly became ridiculous. These were theonly times I cried, as otherwise I was a very quiet and relaxed baby. Even atthat early age, my mother felt that I was intuitively sensing the thoughts andfeelings of those around me, both on a personal and collective level, andresponding."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREETOUCHING THE INFINITEThe 1960s drug culture triggered an interest in Native American shamanism, whichcrystallized around the popular books by Carlos Castenada. Carlos reportedalleged transcripts of conversations and experiences with a Yaqui shaman hecalled Don Juan. Confidants of Castenada’s revealed that many of his far-fetchedtales, particularly in the later books, were fabrications, but the underlyingconcepts were valuable to many people—including my mother. She became aware thatthere could be an alternate reality surrounding us, in which unseen spiritualforces are guiding us. With the proper spiritual instruction and practice, itwas possible to enter into the “second attention” and have direct contact withthese entities. These concepts inspired my mother to begin writing her dreamsdown in notebooks she kept by the side of her bed, and she found that theyprovided useful guidance in symbolic form. I heard about this from a very youngage, and began remembering my own dreams as well—often in vivid detail.Dad managed to get another job at GE, and his parents helped us move into athree-bedroom, one-bath house in Scotia, New York, on the other side of theMohawk River, just opposite Schenectady. This gave Dad an easy commute that wasnever more than fifteen minutes even in rush-hour traffic. Our move-in datehappened to be October 31—Halloween—1973. I was fortunate enough to live in thishouse throughout the entire remainder of my childhood and adolescence, and Momheld on to it until after my younger brother graduated from college in 1997. Welived fairly close to a military base in Glenville, and occasionally an enormousC-130 Hercules aircraft would fly over the yard at an astonishingly lowaltitude. This created tremendous noise and a vibration you could feel in yourchest, and the plane was so large it almost covered the entire sky. It was anextremely powerful, even shocking event every time I got to witness it in thebackyard. I started having many dreams where I saw similarly huge flying craftin the yard—except in these dreams the craft were huge, cigar-shaped cylinderswith no wings. They also made no sound, and had an odd fluttering motion as theytraveled over the land. My mother had very similar craft appearing in her dreamsas well.THE POWER OF TELEVISION AND MUSICIt may be hard for millennials to understand that there were only fourtelevision stations to choose from at the time—CBS, ABC, NBC, and PBS, thePublic Broadcasting System, which was commercial-free and relied on donationsfrom its audience to stay on the air. The most significant and well-producedshows appeared at “prime time,” beginning at eight p.m., and with only threenetworks and PBS to choose from, the selection was quite limited. This meantmuch of America was watching the same programs. By far, the two shows that myfather never missed were M*A*S*H, which took place in the Korean War, and HappyDays, which presented an idealized view of fifties culture. My mother onlytolerated TV, unless it was educational programming for children. She wouldoften get up and walk around or leave the room entirely while the TV was on.My mother sat and read to me from books ever since I was an infant, pointing atthe words as she said them aloud. She very quickly got me watching educationaltelevision programs on PBS, particularly Jim Henson’s classic Sesame Street. Wenever missed a day of it from as early as I can remember. The show did a greatjob of teaching children how to read. I remember seeing profile images ofpeople’s faces as they verbalized the sounds of certain letters or syllables,and then the image of those letters would pop out of their mouths. In some casesthey would assemble words this way. You got to see how the word was spelled andwhat the letters all sounded like together. There was also the Count, a puppetvampire character who verbalized various numbers as they appeared on screen, andtaught you the order in which you would count them. This, combined with dailystory time, led me to have the ability to read by the time I was two. By thetime I entered kindergarten at age five, I was significantly ahead of most of myclassmates.My father started his own local pop culture newspaper called KITE in 1970–71 andwrote articles promoting major rock bands that were coming into town to doconcerts. This made him very valuable to the record labels, who saw thispublicity as critical to the financial success of their shows. As a result, wehad a brown United Parcel Service van pull up to the house every afternoon anddrop off two-foot-square cardboard boxes of varying thicknesses, from half aninch to as much as two inches deep. Inside them were precious jewels: all thelatest releases from every major record label in existence. It was normal toreceive two or three boxes a day. We received copies of almost every new rockalbum in existence, whether they succeeded or not—and most never did. Each albumwas marked in some way, such as having a hole punched out of the cardboardjacket, the corner of the jacket sliced off, or a big stamp that said FORPROMOTIONAL USE ONLY. The labels included Arista, Columbia, CBS, Atlantic, andWarner Brothers. Dad was also given free tickets to every concert, as well asbackstage passes—giving him direct access to the heroes who were making themagic happen.Dad would come home from GE at around 5:20 p.m. in a suit and tie, have thedinner that Mom had waiting for us at the table, and then go upstairs and changeinto a T-shirt, blue jeans, sneakers, and a flannel shirt. All the best rockalbums of the time were played after dinner, and they fit into neatforty-four-minute chunks of time, divided into twenty-two-minute sides. The TVwent on at seven p.m. to watch the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite;Cronkite was considered “the most trusted man in America.” Dad never missed thenews, and felt that it was vitally important that he watch it in order to ensurethat “the world is safe for democracy,” as Cronkite would often say. Iinvariably watched every single broadcast with him over the years, and was fullyaware of what was going on in the world as a result.Friday night was often reserved for a rock music marathon after Walter Cronkite.Led Zeppelin’s classic albums were played far more than anything else,particularly I, II, and IV, and Dad very much liked their heavy bluesinfluences. I also heard all the classic Rolling Stones albums, and the firstfour Aerosmith records—the American answer to Led Zeppelin, who were also verypopular for their hard-rocking blues influences. I also heard many sixtiesclassics, including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, The Doors, and the Moody Blues,as well as seventies psychedelic gold such as Pink Floyd’s Meddle and TangerineDream’s Rubycon. (For some reason Dad disliked the Beatles and never played anyof their music, because he felt they were overexposed—and thus I hadn’t heardmost of their songs until I started listening to them in 2010, when Iinvestigated why they had such a powerful historical impact.) My father wouldoften get up and dance when he played these albums, along with my mother and me,giving this music a deep, almost subconscious positive association in my mind. Ihad no idea at the time that there were any negative associations with theRolling Stones. My father didn’t take any of it seriously. Many other bandswould follow similar paths as time went on, presenting a mystical aura to theirlisteners. It is important to remember that the Cabal does not expect to createany sudden changes in the people who are exposed to this media. Their goal is agradual, long-term introduction of Luciferian symbolism to the public. They planto create an eventual hostile global takeover and establish a New World Order,in which everyone is required to accept these new beliefs or be imprisoned,tortured, or killed.Every Saturday, my father would sit at the fold-out living-room table, which werarely ever used, and type up his latest articles, which he called “columns,” ona gray-and-blue Smith Corona electric typewriter. During this time I was notallowed to talk to him or make any noise in the area, and that rule was strictlyin place until he had finished. He would interview many of these bands bytelephone; he had a funny black suction cup from Radio Shack that he would stickon the receiver, allowing him to record a barely audible version of the callonto a cassette while he also took notes. Dad was heartbroken when he actuallygot an article into Rolling Stone magazine, the ultimate goal that any rockjournalist could aspire to, only to discover that the pay for each article wastwenty-five dollars. There was no possible way that he could put in the time andenergy to write for Rolling Stone and still raise a family.My parents did bring me along to rock concerts as early as age two, when I wasplaced on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle at a Grateful Dead concert. Marijuana usewas heavily advertised in classic rock albums—including Hendrix singing “Purplehaze all in my brain” and Led Zeppelin’s lead vocalist, Robert Plant, singing“Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine” in the classic “Going to California.”The sweet, complex aroma of marijuana smoke was a constant, inescapable odor atevery concert I went to. As soon as the security guards went by, all the glowingpipes and joints would pop up, and thick clouds of smoke would billow into theair. It was quite common to see the bands smoking it backstage as well—and I metcountless famous rock bands in my youth thanks to Dad’s journalism. I hardlyever saw any other children at these shows, and it was very common for people toglare at me in hatred when they saw the bright, colorful backstage pass stuck tomy shirt.UFO DREAMS AND BROTHER MICHAELMy brother Michael was born on April 7, 1975. I remember my mother showing meher pregnant stomach and explaining that I had a brother on the way. One night Itold her that I loved her very much, and I was sad because I knew she and Iwould never be as close once my brother was born. She held it together as Iinnocently told her this, but then quickly left the room, where she quietlycried for some time. I didn’t find out about what happened that night until Iwas much older. During the time my mother was pregnant with Michael, sheexperienced extremely realistic dreams of going out into the backyard and seeingawe-inspiring UFOs, including cylinder-shaped craft just like what I was seeingin my own dreams. Some of my dreams featured Mom and me standing out there atnight and holding hands as these ships hovered just above the yard. My mother’sdreams were so vivid that she became convinced there must be truth behind theUFO phenomenon, and it was a source of great mystery to her.I really enjoyed having a brother. Michael had his own gifts that were differentfrom mine, as he was extremely interested in producing art. Almost as soon as hecould pick up a pen and paper, he began drawing complex mazes that really workedand had only one solution. As the years went by, his mazes became difficultenough to solve that I would often cheat by tracing my way back from the end tothe beginning; he would also create elaborate designs, including pictures andwords, with mazes in them. Michael cried a lot more than I had as a child, andMom was advised to let it happen and not rescue him every time, as otherwise itcould create a dependency. Up until he was about five or six years old, Michaelwould occasionally have frightening temper tantrums in which he would becomeextremely angry, shake with rage, and sometimes try to bite me if I upset him.This would scare me, but I learned to stay calm and prevent him from hurting me.Shortly after Michael was born, my UFO dreams became far more vivid andpersonal. I would often describe them to my mother in great detail, and she wasastonished that I could remember so much. In many of these dreams I would end upinside a very futuristic-looking spacecraft, looking out the window and seeingother ships passing by. I had many different meetings with a wise old man withgray hair and a gray beard, who wore a robe with a hood that he usually keptdown. Again and again, he would tell me that a fantastic event was going tooccur on Earth, which would transform the world in a remarkably positive way andgive us superpowers. He told me I would see this happen in my own lifetime. Healso said I had an important role to play in the process, and would become veryfamous—like the rock stars my father was meeting, or even more so. In some casesI found myself at what looked like an airport, complete with a huge controltower, but the craft that were parked there were absolutelyfantastic-looking—and unlike anything I had ever seen anywhere else.THE NATURE OF PERSONAL REALITYI remember Mom telling me about her religious upbringing, and how disillusionedshe became with born-again Christianity. She warned me that fundamentalists wereoften far more judgmental and abusive than other types of people, and that ifyou didn’t think the same way they did, they honestly believed you would burn inhell for all eternity. She also told me about the importance of being a goodperson and being kind to others. She said that whether we realize it or not,each of us is here to build houses, one brick at a time. Every time we think aloving thought, or do a good thing for someone, we add another brick to thewall. Every time we have a hateful thought, or hurt someone, we take a brickaway. This made sense to me, and I felt very deeply that she was right.My mother began teaching piano students at the Yamaha School of Music, and Iremember her taking me there when I was very young. I reached out and touched athick black pipe on the wall there and was badly burned. Scalding-hot water wasrushing through the pipe, and Mom had to cancel the class and take me home. Thiswas one of my first experiences that taught me that I was fragile, I couldeasily be injured, and sometimes seemingly innocent-looking things could be verydangerous. Shortly after this injury, Mom began reading a book called The Natureof Personal Reality. She explained that a woman named Jane Roberts had learnedhow to talk to an advanced, ghostlike being named Seth, using nothing but thepower of her own mind. She was able to speak the words that Seth wanted her tosay, and her husband, Robert, wrote them down. The entire book was allegedlywritten by Seth. The main message it conveyed could be summarized in a singlesentence: You create your own reality. My mother was very excited about this, asit was causing her to have a powerful awakening and see her life in a completelynew way.During this same time, it became increasingly clear that my parents were notgetting along. I hardly ever saw them act affectionately toward each other.There always seemed to be tension in the air. Sometimes after they put Michaeland me to bed, I would hear them arguing with each other, and this could includeshouting. This caused me severe anxiety and led to my first great addiction:sucking my thumb. I only ever worked the right hand. By the time I was fiveyears old, I had done thorough damage to the structure of my face, includingmoving my nose off to the right, collapsing my left nasal passage, pushing upthe bone on the roof of my mouth, and tilting my entire jaw so it rested at adiagonal angle and was slightly higher on the right side of my face than theleft. These were subtle changes that are quite common, and most people wouldnever notice, but the nasal blockage made it hard to breathe and caused anysickness I had to get a lot worse.MYSTERIOUS MEMORIESI started having a variety of dreams in which I could levitate effortlessly. Insome cases I went only ten to twenty feet above the ground, whereas in othercases I soared like a bird over my hometown. In many of these dreams, I wouldtake a jump rope, stand on it with both feet, and pull up on the edges. Somehow,this allowed me to lift myself up into the air. These dreams had such an effecton me that I would repeatedly try to duplicate the effect in our driveway whileI was awake. It never worked. Sometimes I would stand there in the driveway withthe jump rope and completely break down crying, pulling and pulling in a uselessattempt to levitate. Then I would have another dream in which it worked, and itwould inspire me to go out there and try it again the next day.I also clearly remember celebrating the two-hundred-year anniversary of Americanindependence, on July 4, 1976. We walked all the way down to Jumpin’ Jack’sfast-food restaurant by the Mohawk River and the Western Gateway Bridge intoSchenectady to see the show. There were many different street vendors sellingAmerican flags, all kinds of merchandise with red, white, and blue, and variousforms of the Statue of Liberty. Many people were burning sparklers, drinkingmilk shakes, and eating burgers, hot dogs, and fries from Jumpin’ Jack’s. Iremember having profound feelings I couldn’t understand. I felt as if I had beenAmerican before, that this was not new, and I could hardly believe that twohundred years had now gone by since America was founded. I had no idea why Ifelt this way, but it was very strong.PLAYING THE WORLD’S FIRST VIDEO GAMEI very clearly remember the day in the late summer of 1976 that I got my firsttaste of a hyper-addictive social revolution. My mother took me to my favoritebabysitter, Julie’s, house, who lived down the road a few blocks at the time.The kitchen was cluttered and smelled like bread dough. There, sitting on thecountertop, was a black-and-white TV with a strange black box connected to it.The box had two round knobs on it. When you turned it on, it put blocky whitelines on the TV screen. It was a “video game” called Pong, which had beenreleased in December 1975, just in time for Christmas. They asked me to try itand I was worried I might break it, but they told me it was fine. When I turnedthe knob, a line on the screen moved along with it as the paddle, and a whitesquare was the ball. Each time the ball was released, I had to keep it fromgoing past my paddle.Right as I started to get the hang of it, the hot new single “Dancing Queen”came on the radio. It was very sparkly and happy, had nice vocal harmonies and adance beat, and is commonly regarded as one of the most successful singles ofthe 1970s. I had never heard any music like this at home. The fusion of themusic and the Pong game elevated me into a state of pure ecstasy. In amazement,I breathlessly asked, “Who is this on the radio?” as I continued vigorouslyworking the paddle. “ABBA,” my babysitter replied. “It’s a band called ABBA.They are very famous.” After “Dancing Queen,” other ABBA songs were played aspart of a music marathon, and I couldn’t believe my parents hadn’t played itbefore. I asked Mom why we didn’t listen to ABBA, and she said, “You’ll justhave to ask your father.” I asked Dad as soon as I got home, and he said,“That’s disco. We do not listen to disco. It is absolute garbage.” End ofdiscussion.A MAJOR HEALTH CRISISMy mother took the flu vaccine in October 1976, when I was three years old, andstrange things started happening to her. Within a week or two after taking theshot, she was walking down State Street in Schenectady and realized that insteadof walking straight, she was nearly bumping into the sides of buildings. Shealso found that when she played the piano, and reached for octaves with her lefthand, she was overreaching. She would aim for E flat and hit a C. She thenbecame very sick, which reached a peak about two to three weeks after she tookthe shot. She had a plastic pan to throw up in as I sat beside her on the couch,and she became so sick that she couldn’t even move her head more than an inchwithout throwing up. She asked me to call our neighbor, Mrs. Warner (not herreal name), and remembered the number well enough to give me the digits outloud. Mrs. Warner called Dad at General Electric, who rushed home from work andtook Mom straight to the emergency room while Michael and I sat with ababysitter.Mom ended up being gone for an entire week, and Michael and I were never takenthere to see her. We had a very nice woman who acted as our babysitter and tookcare of us all day, every day. She had a bird marionette puppet made out ofStyrofoam balls and orange feathers, with little white eyes that had blackcircles in them that would move around as she made it talk to us. She fed uscinnamon toast, which seemed like an amazing treat. Michael and I did not knowthis at the time, but both Dad and our babysitter thought Mom was about to die,and they just wanted us to be happy and calm. The doctors thought she had abrain tumor and did tons of tests. Once they ruled that out, they felt that shehad multiple sclerosis. She kept insisting that the flu shot had caused this tohappen, but they said that was impossible—it was totally safe. Yet the woman inthe bed next to her had the exact same symptoms and had also just taken the flushot. Mom discovered that her old high school friend Hope, who worked as afarmer, also developed the same sickness after having the flu shot, and toughedit out at home. Once she talked to Hope on the phone, she found out that manyother people had developed the same deathly illness after getting the shot.This had all the hallmarks of a cover-up in the medical industry, if not anoutright terrifying conspiracy. Mom gradually got better while she was held inthe hospital for a week and was run through a battery of tests. Once she gotout, she vowed never to use the mainstream medical system again unless it was adire emergency. She started seeing a chiropractor named Dr. Leith, whose officereeked of minty camphor oil, and he got her taking vitamins A, B, C, D, and Eevery day, as well as drinking disgusting-smelling brewer’s yeast. We startedroutinely going to Patton’s, a local health-food store. She also began swimmingfifty-yard laps at the YWCA, in their Olympic-sized pool, a few times a week. Byfollowing these practices and having a healthy diet, she never got sick, nevertook any pharmaceutical drugs, and never needed to see a doctor.The downside of Mom’s health-food awakening was that she strictly forbade usfrom eating very much sugar. The television was constantly advertising sugarycereals like Cocoa Pebbles, Count Chocula, Frankenberry, Lucky Charms, FrootLoops, and Trix, which invariably featured cartoon characters that appealed tochildren. No matter how much I begged and pleaded with her to buy me thesecereals, Mom absolutely refused. Dad had a habit of eating Rice Chex everymorning, and the best cereals Michael and I ever got were Cheerios, Kellogg’sCorn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Grape-Nuts, and Kix corn puffs. Mom’s eyes wentstraight to the sugar listing on the label, and anything above a few grams wasautomatically forbidden. At the time I was very angry with her for this and feltthat she was robbing me of all the best things about being a kid, but now as anadult I am very grateful that she was tough enough to say no to me, no matterhow much I asked. I also have a strong memory of my parents buying a short-livednew cereal in a blue box, only to check on one of the ingredients, which mayhave been cellulose, and conclude that it was “plastic.” The idea that anymanufacturer would put plastic into a food product was shocking to them, and Ifelt the same way.LET THE BUYER BEWAREI got my first real bicycle in 1977. It was all sparkling indigo blue and had achain guard that said “The Rabbit,” along with the image of a stretched-outcartoon rabbit. It had rims over both tires, a kickstand, and training wheels soI wouldn’t fall over while I was riding it. Once I got the Rabbit, I startedhaving new nightmares. It was always the same dream. Mom and I would be drivingover the Western Gateway Bridge, and suddenly our car would plunge over theside. We were falling to our deaths. The dream always ended before we hit thewater. In other dreams, I had to drive the car myself, which I obviously did notknow how to do, and that was terrifying—and then the car would always fall offthe bridge. I would wake up before I died, often screaming. It would be manyyears before I understood why I kept having this same dream, over and overagain.I then saw a commercial for Keds sneakers in which kids put these shoes on andcould fly. Beautiful streaks of light emerged from their feet, and they couldsoar eight to ten feet up into a tree. I believed that this was real, and toldmy mother I absolutely must have Keds sneakers. I went to the kids’ shoe shop atthe Mohawk Mall, with the funny guy with black curly hair who looked and soundeda lot like Richard Simmons. I was measured for the shoes and could hardly waitto get home and try them. I stood in front of the old birch tree in the frontyard, did my best jump . . . and nothing happened. It was just like the jumprope all over again. I was devastated. The television had lied to me. Theseshoes could not make me fly. I started to realize that nothing could. If I everstarted falling to my death, like what had happened in my nightmare, thereprobably wasn’t anything I could do about it. As I reflect back upon this now, Irealize that my dreams of flying may well have been preparing me for the powersof ascension. I was told in my dreams that this would happen to us, and I couldalready try out the abilities—but the real world hadn’t caught up with the dreamworld yet.OBI-WAN KENOBIThe epic film Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977, just in time for thesummer movie season—and my father made sure that he took us on opening weekend.I was absolutely dazzled by this movie, transported into a parallel universe,where it all seemed completely real. All the images of spacecraft, planets, andstars seemed extremely familiar to me—so much so that I didn’t understand whyeveryone became so obsessed with the movie. For me it was just “normal.” Lukewas being trained in “The Force,” which would give him the exact same abilitiesthat I had in my dreams. The wise old man Obi-Wan Kenobi faced off against thevillain Darth Vader and was clearly losing. Obi-Wan then said, “If you strike medown, I will become more powerful than you can imagine.” Vader sliced him withhis lightsaber, but Obi-Wan completely disappeared, leaving only his robe in aheap on the ground. He then returned to Luke later in the movie as a ghostlikebeing of white light.I immediately noticed the similarity between Obi-Wan and the man who had beentalking to me in my dreams. My parents were both very surprised, because wellbefore the movie came out, they had nicknamed my brother Obie, and also calledhim Obimious (which sounds like Obadiah, a book in the Bible) and, as crazy asit must sound, Obie-Wan. That name actually pulled me right out of the movie fora moment. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing—and it proved to be one of myfirst experiences with what Dr. Carl Jung called synchronicity. My parentsadopted the full name and began calling him Obi-Wan Kenobi. The very nextmorning after I saw Star Wars, the wise old man appeared again as Obi-WanKenobi—and the interior of his ship looked even more like some of the scenes inStar Wars. He now appeared to me in the same glowing, luminous form as Obi-Wanhad in the movie. This appears to have been an effort to link a being who wasvery real in the dream plane with a symbol from the physical plane that I couldnow easily identify and interpret. The old man told me that many people on Earthwere going to transform into a luminous form like this, and that if I followedwhat my mother told me about being a good person, it could happen to me too. Ifelt even closer to him than I did to my own parents, and when I woke up andrealized it was only a dream, I started crying. This happened dozens of times."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURDARKNESS AND LIGHTThe wise old man who now appeared as Obi-Wan in my dreams told me I needed tolearn as much about science as I could, as this was an important part of mymission. Those words stayed with me, and I tried to gather as much informationas possible. I would ask my father all sorts of questions that he did not havethe answers for, like why the sky was blue or how birds could fly. He wouldoften get frustrated with me and tell me he just didn’t know. Shortly afterseeing Star Wars in 1977, I learned that modern scientists believed in somethingcalled the “Big Bang.” They said that the universe started as “nothing.” Icouldn’t even imagine the idea of nothing ever existing—it just didn’t make anysense. Then they said that “nothing exploded,” and the whole universe wascreated in an instant. I felt very strongly that this couldn’t be right. Iconcentrated as hard as I could and willed myself to see the real answer to thequestions, “What did the universe look like at the beginning? Was there evertruly nothing?” What I got back, every time I asked, was pure white light. Itseemed like it could be very large or very small, and it really didn’t evenmatter. Size was not important; it was just light. And it seemed veryfriendly—actually quite joyous. It was as if it was singing in happiness.GLIMPSES OF COSMIC MEMORIESCertain objects or places started causing me to have profound cosmic feelingsthat I could not explain. One early example happened after I entered nurseryschool, which was in a church. A weird, fundamentalist-type man came in and wastalking to us about God. He felt deceitful to me, like a car salesman or myfather’s boss at General Electric. He was giving us a strong sales pitch for hisreligion, and at the end he handed each of us a white plastic ring that was theright size to fit on our chubby little fingers. It had a cartoon bee on it thatwas made out of a raised, shiny red line. Somehow, when I saw this ring, I feltas if I was blown into a completely alternate reality. There was somethingthere—something very powerful, very ancient, and very amazing. I didn’t knowwhat it was, but the feeling was so intense that I almost fell over. I still donot understand why the ring caused me to feel this way, particularly since theman was exactly the opposite. Perhaps it looked similar to jewelry I had worn insome alternate reality. These memories were unpredictable and at times couldseem completely random and inexplicable.This same phenomenon happened again when I was playing with a wooden toy thatfeatured a chain of train-like cars that rolled on black-painted wheels. As Ipulled this toy along, I got hit again. I had flashes of the massive airport Ihad seen in my dreams, loaded with astonishing spaceships. Some of them seemedto have been chained together like this toy—but I just couldn’t quite rememberit. Another time I rode the city bus for the first time with my babysitter onthe way to a bowling alley. I was scared, as I had never ridden the bus before.As I sat on the bus and saw people in the seats, WHAM—it happened again. I feltvery close to a memory of seeing a similar scene in a much more advanced craftthat flew through space.Every year, fighter jets called the Blue Angels would do stunt-flying right overmy street, because we were near the military base where they did the airshow.They would fly in formation, go upside down, pass by one another closely, dobarrel rolls, and in some cases fly very close to the ground. They wouldrehearse for the airshow for about four or five days beforehand, and I alwaysmade sure to go outside and see it. I would always get that same feeling ofimmense cosmic knowledge that I could not explain when I saw them—and on the fewoccasions when we actually went to the airshow and saw all the planes ondisplay, I felt it even more. As a result, I got into building snap-togetherairplane models and had a poster of various jets on the wall in my room for manyyears.Another weird example of the “cosmic rush” was when I was with my grandmother,and we went to see a friend of hers out in a woodsy area. The lady gave me abrown plastic bottle that could hold milk, like a baby bottle, but this was madefor bigger kids. I was mildly insulted at first by getting this gift. The top ofthe bottle had plastic in the shape of a stylized, cartoonish cow face, with ared plastic tongue and black plastic eyes that were mostly closed. However, as Iheld this object in my hands, I had a very profound rush. It now seemedpartially like Luke’s lightsaber from Star Wars, but there was something muchdeeper than that. This bottle looked like something I knew—a technology thatmight have been like the lightsaber. I had no idea what it was, but the feelingwas overpowering and incredible.Certain places could fairly reliably cause me to feel this way. Any buildingthat was made of stone, or was castle-like, could do it, particularly if it wassurrounded by trees. I may have been remembering a society that had advancedtechnology but was also building marvelous structures out of stone. Thatparticular vision was strongly associated with medieval-sounding music,particularly wind instruments. Just hearing the sound of an oboe could causethis feeling to happen, particularly if it had a strong echo on it, like youhear in vintage Tangerine Dream music. Some brick buildings also had the sameeffect, including the house my babysitter, Julie’s, family moved into that was alittle farther away from us and was surrounded by trees. However, the singlemost reliable source of this profoundly cosmic and wonderful feeling was theSchenectady Museum and Planetarium. I would ask my mother to take us there againand again, as every time I went, the same thing would happen. The inside of thebuilding had a high, domed ceiling that was painted black. Some of thesupporting bars were visible. The walls were white, and flowed in smooth,rippling curves. Track lights were mounted in cool places, causing the exhibitsto gleam and sparkle. They changed the exhibits every few months.They often had boring GE exhibits, such as large turbines, pictures of Edison,the original model of the lightbulb, old appliances, and panels of textexplaining the history of these inventions. What really inspired me the mostwere the displays of huge crystals, hidden behind glass for protection. Some ofthe clusters were a brilliant purple. The light would glisten off them, and as Ilooked at them I would feel connected to something extremely profound. It was asif I had once known a world of crystal technology—but I couldn’t quite get itback. The flowing, curved walls and lighting of the museum reminded me of theinside of some kind of spaceship, like what I would see in my dreams—but evenolder and more powerful.At one point the museum had an exhibit of holograms, where you could walk aroundthem and see them animate—for example, a woman talking. They had strange rainbowcolors, mostly yellow and red, and you could put your hand right into them. Thisprobably caused the single most profound rush of energy and cosmic memories ofanything I had ever experienced. It was so powerful that I almost fell over inecstasy.By this time, I was having more and more experiences during which I knew whatpeople were thinking, without their ever telling me. I could sense people’sfeelings very easily, even if they were trying to hide them. This was usefulwith my father, as I could tell when he was going to get angry before itactually happened. There were many other cases that were more peaceful thanthat. Thoughts would come into my mind right before someone started talking tome about them. I would think of a specific person right before they werediscussed, or the phone started ringing and they were calling. This was sonatural that I didn’t think anything of it, and I felt like everyone must beable to do it, since it was so easy and effortless.A HIPPIE COMMUNE CALLED “TOTEM”My mother met some hippie guys at Hewitt’s Garden Center on Sacandaga Road andquickly found out that they lived with a group of other people at a farm theycalled Totem. Everyone was crammed into a single run-down house in a heavilywooded area on the end of a dirt road. They listened to weird psychedelic andtechnical music, such as the band Gentle Giant, which I would never have heardat home. The best way I can describe it as an adult is to say that it soundedlike musical schizophrenia. So much marijuana was grown at Totem that they woulddry it out in clothes dryers. The marijuana smoke was so thick that it curledaround you as you walked through the house.The first time I was there, I walked into the bathroom and was disgusted when Isaw the toilet bowl. It was supposed to be white, but their well water had lotsof minerals in it, and the entire bowl was stained a dark brown. I thought itwas all poop, and I was horrified that they hadn’t bothered to clean it. Therewas no way I could use that toilet. I marched out, thrust my right hand on myhip, pointed at the bathroom with my left index finger, and shouted, “That isthe most disgusting toilet I have ever seen in my entire life!” I could notunderstand why they started laughing—and continued to laugh, nonstop, for atleast ten minutes. Some of them even gasped for breath and rolled around on thefloor. I finally decided that it was cool that I had made them laugh, and wentalong with the joke, but I had no idea what they thought was so funny abouthaving a toilet that was absolutely covered with “mess.”A very frightening story emerged from this group not long after my motherstarted going there. A man named Lars, who was a brother of one of the guys, hadtaken a drug called LSD. I had never heard of it before then. This drug causedhim to completely lose his mind and go crazy. They tried to keep him at thehouse for several days, but he was so messed up from it that they had to takehim to the hospital. He ended up going into “the mental ward” and had to staythere for a long time before they finally let him go. He was never really thesame again; he had become shy and scared. The whole thing was extremelyfrightening. My mother told me to never, ever take LSD, as it was verydangerous, and the people who used it had no idea what they were messing with. Ipromised her I never would. She gave me similar warnings about heroin andcocaine, saying that once people tried them they couldn’t stop, and the drugswould destroy their lives.Totem ended up having a party called 7/7/77, which took place on July 7, 1977,as you might expect. Some of the Totem guys had formed a band, and they had aFender Rhodes keyboard up on stage. They were playing a simple blues-rock jamand demanded my mother get up on stage and play keyboard in front of all thosepeople. Although it was well within her playing ability to do this, she wasterrified of performing in front of an audience and had never tried to play rockand roll before. She was just about dragged up on stage, but as soon as shestarted playing, she was a natural. The audience loved her. She was instantlyhooked, and started playing in various bands that were formed with members ofthe group. By the mid-1980s she had become a professional gigging musicianplaying in wedding bands—and it all started with 7/7/77. This was my firstexperience with “numerical synchronicity,” in which repeating patterns ofnumbers reveal deeper meaning. In the future these patterns would appear inhighly unexpected ways, seemingly in direct response to important, spirituallysignificant thoughts I was having.REVEALING THE GREATEST DANGER TO ALL LIFE ON EARTHShortly after 7/7/77, the weirdest and most terrifying event of my entirechildhood happened. I didn’t witness it myself, thank God, but I heard about itfrom my parents the next day—at great length. It all started when my father andmother were up late in bed. Dad was watching his little black-and-white TV,which he had brought back with him from Vietnam. The lights were out and theroom was dark. Their bedroom was on the second floor, and they had windows thatlooked out onto our street. There was enough moonlight to see what was going onoutside. Dad noticed some movement on the street. He looked more closely andrealized that a husband-and-wife couple was walking along, side by side. Theydid not talk, look at each other, or move their arms. They walked like robots,almost as if they were in a trance. They reached the driveway of the houseacross the street, made a ninety-degree turn, walked up to the side door, openedit without knocking, and walked right in. The house was completely shrouded indarkness, outside and in.Dad’s mind surged with curiosity and fear. He quietly but urgently alerted mymother to what was going on: “Look! Look!” They continued watching as three moremarried couples repeated the exact same sequence. The house was so dark insidethat in order to see their way around, they would have needed something likecandlelight. These were people we knew and saw all the time, including Mrs.Warner, whom Mom had me call the day she went to the emergency room. The men ineach of these couples were high-ranking Freemasons, which is a secretsociety—but it took years for me to realize that there might be any connectionbetween secret societies and the event my parents witnessed that night. One ofthe men was an Italian guy who owned a popular shoe repair store in town. Thepeople across the street owned one of the most popular and successful cardealerships in town. Every year they would have rehearsals for the parade downat the end of the street. Since they were Scottish Rite Freemasons, they wouldassemble in our street wearing kilts and play the bagpipes with their hauntingsound. Some of them were also Shriners and would wear the red fezzes and drivearound in little go-karts in the parade. I would often see them sitting andtalking together on the front porch of the house just to the right of the placethey all went into that night. Thankfully, the people who owned the house acrossthe street moved away less than a year later—but the others did not.I had honestly never seen my parents so frightened before. They kept saying thatthis was just like the movie Rosemary’s Baby, which I had already heard aboutmany times before. Mom had asked my father what they should do, if they shouldsay anything, and Dad said, “Absolutely not. I have seen way too many movieswith scenes like this. If they find out that we saw them, something terriblecould happen to us. We could all be killed. Everyone in this family. And no onewould ever know what happened to us. We would just disappear.” I was surprisedthat they were telling both Michael and me this, considering how young we were,and it was one of the most powerful experiences of my entire life. I could onlyconclude that these people were members of a secret group that met at night, andvery likely were involved in something evil. Dad said it was very important thatwe act normally when we saw them, and never say a single word about what theyhad witnessed. Only recently did I speak to an insider who told me this wasprobably a ceremony known as the “Rite of Venus,” in which people wear masks andhave a sexual orgy like the one in the disturbing Stanley Kubrick movie EyesWide Shut.SEPARATING FACTS FROM MYTHOLOGYThe next major event I went through was seeing Close Encounters of the ThirdKind after it was released on December 14, 1977. My father was dazzled by thefilm, said we had to see it, and brought us out to it. I was absolutely blownaway, because this film was extremely similar to the dreams I was having. Seeingthis movie was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I felt it wasabsolutely real. I very much identified with the child in the movie and feltthat something like this would happen in the future on a much larger level. Ihad countless dreams of huge spaceships appearing over the yard, and now I wasseeing it on the silver screen. Tears streamed down my face as the mother shipappeared at the end of the movie, causing such a spectacular light show. I wasawed as the little ETs came out of the ship, and particularly entranced by thetall, skinny one. When the hero went into the ship to go with them, I cried evenmore. That was what I wanted—so much. And there it was. I could hardly believe Iwas seeing a movie like this.THE PYRAMID PROGRAMI started kindergarten classes at Sacandaga School in 1978. The school veryquickly realized that my reading ability was way ahead of most of the otherkids, and they put me into a special gifted children’s program called Pyramid.The kindergarten reading book Learning How to Read had a mustard-yellow coverwith kids playing on it, including one kid who was hanging on a tire that wasattached to a rope in the middle. The first-grade book was called Cloverleaf,featuring a cow made out of colored paper who had a clover in his mouth. I wasput right into Cloverleaf, along with a few other kids. One of them was namedEric, and it turned out that he lived just a few streets away from me. We lookedsomewhat alike and became fast friends. I would often ride my bicycle over tohis house.This was also when I started taking my old toys apart. We had all thescrewdrivers I needed to get the screws out. I was very interested in seeing howthings worked. My first major success was when our electric can opener broke.Mom was going to throw it away, because when you pushed the lever down, itwouldn’t turn anymore. I asked her to let me see if I could take it apart andfix it, and she was happy to let me try. I took out all the screws, got the backoff of it, and could see that there was a lot of metallic dust inside from thecans. I scrubbed off all the dust and grime with an old toothbrush and thenlubricated it with WD-40, which was in the same toolbox as the screwdrivers. Iput it all back together, plugged it in, hit the lever, and bam—it worked! Bothof my parents were amazed that I actually fixed it, but as far as I wasconcerned it was quite easy.Although I was a good reader and could fix the can opener, I was way behind inother areas. In our first years of gym class, the teachers would just seteveryone loose in the gym to run around, screaming and laughing. I enjoyed therunning and thought it was amazing to have all these other kids around, shootingin all different directions. However, the teachers watched me carefully anddecided that I was not as coordinated as I should be for my age. I couldn’tcatch or throw a ball very well, if at all. I didn’t want to play Frisbee withmy parents, because whenever they threw it at me I would get hurt if I tried tocatch it. I had hardly any strength in my upper body, which was a problem whenthe teachers wanted us to climb ropes or do chin-ups. I couldn’t even manage todo a single chin-up; I was amazed that the other kids could do several of them.The teachers ended up putting me in a special class to help develop bettercoordination.THE SACRED PAJAMASWhile I was still in kindergarten, sometime before Christmas, I had perhaps thesingle most positive and amazing experience of my entire childhood: theout-of-body experience I opened with in chapter 2. After this stunning event, Iconcluded that everything, not just people, must have a ghostlike existence thatis separate from the physical form. I also now knew it was possible to breakinto this alternate reality, just as my mother had read about in the CarlosCastenada books. I suddenly realized I had been incredibly stupid for gettingscared and thinking I was dying, which had caused me to snap back into my bodyas soon as I went from wonderment to fear. I felt terrible about missing mychance. It occurred to me that there could have been some sort of craft waitingfor me outside the house like what I had seen in my dreams, and if I hadn’tgotten scared, I might have been pulled into it and gotten to meet the old manfor real—not just in a dream. I started crying as I realized I had just wastedthe greatest opportunity I’d ever had in my life. Every single night, for twomore years, I prayed to get another chance. I knew I had no direct control overwhether it would happen again or not—only “they” did. I saved the pajamas andnever wore them again, and I still have them in my closet today. I also neverwashed them, in case that would somehow get rid of the magic that allowed themto be in two places at the same time. I ended up calling them the “sacredpajamas,” and they are one of the only things I still have left from mychildhood years.I continued having UFO dreams after this, involving the usual flying cylindersin the backyard. Now, however, something new would happen. One of the UFOs wouldoften crash-land somewhere not too far away from where my mother and I werestanding. I felt they might be in trouble and they needed our help. I would grabmy mother’s hand, look into her eyes, and tell her we needed to run over thereand help them. The dream always ended at this point—and I would often wake up intears when I realized that it wasn’t real. The meetings with the old manhappened less and less often, and the dreams took on more of a mysterious,symbolic quality. Every night for the next two years, I prayed for the old manand his friends to give me another chance—but it never happened. I finallydecided to take matters into my own hands—but that happens a little later in ourstory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVECOULD ESP SAVE THE WORLD?On November 18, 1978, just days after my stunning transformation into aghostlike body that could fly, the world was rocked with news of an apparentmass suicide in the small South American country of Guyana, in a village calledJonestown. US Representative Leo Ryan arrived on November 17 with four membersof his delegation to investigate claims of abuse there by a cult leader namedJim Jones. Ryan and all four of his team members were shot and killed the nextday at the airport as they were getting ready to leave the country. According tothe initial media reports, Jones then allegedly convinced 408 of his followersto drink Flavor Aid laced with deadly cyanide, which was then quickly turnedinto “Kool-Aid” in the public lexicon. The Guyanese army meticulously countedthe 408 bodies, including 82 children. The sweltering heat forced them to pokeholes in the bodies to release gases, since they were rapidly decomposing in thehot Sun and otherwise would have exploded. Over the next five days, theheadlines also reported that 700 other people survived and ran off into thewoods. A total of 150 pictures of the masses of dead bodies were taken. Some ofthe most disturbing shots were repeatedly shown in television news, magazines,and newspapers, showing large areas of bodies all neatly placed side by side,facedown in the dirt. As a child, I was deeply haunted by seeing thesephotographs over and over again—and my parents didn’t feel much better.Just hours after the deaths took place, the top pathologist in Guyana, Dr. C.Leslie Mootoo, went in with the teams that examined the bodies, without theassistance of US pathologists. Dr. Mootoo found that 80 to 90 percent of thevictims had fresh needle marks at the back of their left shoulder blades,suggesting they died from lethal injections. This is not an area that mostpeople could reach on their own. Someone else would have had to inject themthere. Other people were found shot or strangled to death. One survivingeyewitness said that anyone who resisted drinking the cyanide was killed byarmed guards. A US Army spokesman said, “No autopsies are needed. The cause ofdeath is not an issue here.” Yet Dr. Mootoo concluded that all but three of thevictims he saw were murdered by “persons unknown,” and only two of those threehad actually committed suicide.The figure of 408 dead bodies was still being reported in the New York Times asof November 21, three days after the event took place. US Army teams arrived atthe site on the fourth day, November 22, and reported 409 dead. Major Helming ofthe US Army reported “400 dead” on the fifth day, November 23, and on the sixthday, November 24, the New York Times was reporting that there were 409 deaths.19[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber18] Then that same day the body count beganinexplicably skyrocketing—first to 700, then 780, and finally 909, just sevendays after the initial number of 408 was given. On November 25, one US officialreported to the New York Times that the extra 500-plus bodies were found becausethe Guyanese “could not count.”20 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber19] Then, in aneven more ridiculous excuse, the US said the new bodies were all discoveredhiding underneath the original bodies—even though not one photograph showed anyhidden bodies, and 82 of the original victims were children.Many people suspected the seven hundred survivors in the woods weresystematically hunted down and killed by the US military and its allies,including elite Green Beret troops, the hundred-plus Guyanese troops looking forsurvivors in the woods, and nearly six hundred British Black Watch commandos whohappened to be going through “training exercises” in the area when they joinedthe search. High-level insider Peter David Beter revealed the ugly truth of whathappened for those who subscribed to his “audio letters.” Ever since 1974,Beter’s letters had reported that the Soviets had built a secret nuclear missilebase in Guyana that would give them an undefeatable first-strike capabilityagainst the United States.The world had previously learned of a secret Soviet missile base in Cuba, whichignited the Cuban Missile Crisis shortly after John F. Kennedy became president.In Beter’s Audio Letter #40, from November 30, 1978, he revealed that theJonestown massacre was staged by the US military.21[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber20] The massive, public fatalities allowed them togo in, kill all the personnel at the secret Soviet missile base, and remove thebodies and warheads in a series of coffins that were supposedly carrying thevictims of the disaster. This is why the US brought in sixteen huge C-131aircraft, allegedly just to remove the bodies, and then claimed each one couldhold only thirty-six caskets—even though these planes can carry tanks, trucks,troops, and ammunition all in one load.22 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber21] Hereis a small part of what Beter had to say about this tragedy in his own words:The complete details of the Jonestown disaster may never be known publicly. Ican tell you though that of those who died there, very few willingly anddeliberately took their own lives—and that is what suicide is. Many weretricked, not realizing that the death rites were real. Many more resisted, butthey were weak, helpless, and confronted with armed execution squads. So byvarious means, several hundred people were poisoned with potassium cyanide.However there were many others who did try to escape and who resisted moreeffectively. Many of these people were herded off into the jungle and shotwithout mercy. Finally, when the mass murder was completed, the executionersperformed their final task of stage-managing the horrible death scene. In orderto achieve the surprise needed in attacking the Russian missile base, it wascritically important that the first reports from Jonestown described the sceneas a mass suicide. Only in this way could its actual military significance behidden long enough to fool the Russians. So all of the bodies that were free ofgunshot wounds were carefully arranged in neat rows and other groupings,suggesting at first sight that everyone died willingly and deliberately.This event ended up being the largest single loss of American life in adeliberate act until 9/11. If Beter is right, then clearly the governmentofficials who ordered this attack did not care about the mass murder of hundredsof people who had done nothing wrong. They never bothered to try other avenuesof diplomatic or military strategy that could have potentially saved innocentlives. All I knew at the time was that this was a highly disturbing event thatwas obviously another government- and media-driven cover-up like Watergate. Yet,after it happened, everyone just went back to sleep and carried on with theirlives. Thankfully, with all the smartphones of today, it would be nearlyimpossible for any group to attempt such a huge atrocity and keep it a secret.Smaller-scale mass shooting events are almost immediately picked apart by thealternative media, and various lines of evidence are thoroughly explored by alegion of bloggers.DREAMS AND REALITIESI was quite shocked by Jonestown, as it was the first time I had seen a story inthe media that was as creepy and terrifying as the night my parents saw familiarcouples silently walk into the pitch-black house across the street withoutknocking. After Jonestown I started sleepwalking, and this included one nightwhen I walked into the bathroom while my mother was in there and I kept saying,“I need to find the telephone books.” I also started regularly having feverswith strong and terrifying hallucinations. My worst fever dream involved tallflames licking all around my bed, horrible white serpents looming over me, theroof disappearing to reveal the starry night sky, and some sort of Bigfoot-typemonster that came raging out of my closet. I also would see the entire worldaround me divided into geometric patterns, such as white and black tiles. Iwould scream and scream whenever this happened, partly to try to drown out theenormous vibrating pressure that I would be hearing in my head—similar to thefeeling of a huge C-130 flying over the yard.On the night my bed seemed to be surrounded with flames, my father ran to theroom and slipped on a Kleenex box, causing him to fall on the stairs. As heburst into the room I hallucinated that he looked like a dinosaur with humanlikefeatures, which scared me even more. Dad really hurt himself that night, and Mombecame responsible for calming me down whenever I started screaming. She wouldhold me and sing to me for several minutes. The enormous vibrating hum in myhead would eventually go away, and I would be able to fall back to sleep.That Christmas, in addition to being dazzled by the ascended-type abilities inthe movie Superman, my grandmother on my mother’s side gave me the Reader’sDigest book Strange Stories, Amazing Facts. Grandma was a prolific reader andwanted me to be the same. Strange Stories was a full-sized,two-and-a-half-inch-thick hardcover book, and at the time I was only five yearsold and nowhere near a reading level at which I could fully understand it.Nonetheless, I looked through it and was fascinated by all the differentpictures. What captivated me the most was a section at the end illustrating agorgeous space station inside an asteroid, and apparently real photographs ofUFOs. I spent hours just looking at those pictures and got the same incrediblypowerful cosmic sensations that happened at various times throughout mychildhood. For the first time, I had found a book that featured similar kinds ofcraft to what I was seeing in my dreams. My reading level quickly improved, andI realized that UFOs were not just something you saw in fake movies. People wereseeing and photographing craft that did not appear to be from this world.We were given copies of Ranger Rick magazine to read in school, which was mostlypictures of animals, but it advertised a children’s astronomy magazine calledOdyssey. There was a robot named Ulysses for a mascot, and it was run by a womancalling herself TCE, The Crabby Editor. I convinced my parents to let mesubscribe to the magazine and began bringing the latest copy to school everyday, reading it whenever we had free time. This, along with my high scores onevery test and assignment, almost immediately caused the other kids to hateme—and to come up with nicknames like “Odyssey Man.”EXTRATERRESTRIALS AND HOSTAGESDuring this same time, I would occasionally be lucky enough to catch atelevision show called In Search Of, featuring Leonard Nimoy as the host. Theopening sequence featured images of ancient monuments, including the giant stoneheads of Easter Island, Stonehenge, and the Egyptian pyramids. Every time I sawthis show, I had the “cosmic high” experience, as if something deep within mewas being triggered. This also happened when I saw the show Land of the Lost,and particularly when the creepy reptilian beings with huge black eyes known asthe Sleestak would appear, which put me into supernatural terror. The showfeatured children traveling through stargate-type portals that were locatedinside obelisks; all of this felt very familiar to me. I also had cosmicfeelings whenever I saw the show Mork and Mindy, starring Robin Williams. At theend of every show, Mork, an extraterrestrial who came to Earth in an egg, wouldhave a conversation with his unseen father figure, Orson. He would say funnythings that summarized his observations about humans. This felt deeply importantto me every time I saw it, as it was very similar to what my own dreams werelike, only funnier.On November 4, 1979, more than sixty American hostages were taken from the USembassy in Iran by Muslim students. That started the Iranian hostage crisis,which dragged on for 444 days. My father was very concerned about this, andevery night Walter Cronkite would talk about it. I remember hearing again andagain about how horrible it was that Iran was holding on to those people, andnot knowing if they would ever be released.During this same time, Eric and I started riding our bicycles farther andfarther around the neighborhood when we weren’t in school. One day we went tothe house of a girl in our class whom we will call Cindy. She invited us intothe garage and said she wanted to play a game. She then told us to bend over ona small bench and pull our pants down. We laughed and decided to do it. Then shegrabbed a wiffle ball bat and started yelling at us like an abusive parent,telling us we were bad, that we were in trouble and that she was going to beatus. She wanted us to cry. Neither of us resisted or got up, even though she wasabout to start hitting us. We were so surprised by what she was doing that wewere just going to let it happen. Right then, her mother walked in. She washorrified by what she saw and really yelled at her. I ended up feeling as ifsome good force in the universe had protected us from being hit. We never spoketo Cindy again, and for a while Eric and I stopped hanging out together asfriends. I soon made two other friends who both turned out to be very abusivetoward me, and my mother became quite concerned. Yet, for some reason, I seemedincapable of hurting anyone’s feelings or saying no, even if I was clearly beingbullied. This would turn out to be a pattern that would haunt me throughout therest of my life, making me a prime target for manipulators.A NEW FRONTIERAs soon as I started going on longer bike rides at age seven, my mother wouldwalk to the end of the driveway and “send” to me when she wanted me to comehome. This was a meditative exercise in which she would think strongly about me,and tell me in her mind and heart that she wanted me to come home. It workedvery well, and almost always got me to come back within five or ten minutes.Sometimes I knew she was doing it, and other times I just felt like I needed togo home. Mom taught me that everyone could do this, so I never thought of it asanything unusual or special.I soon shared my deepest secret with my mother. “You remember that night Ifloated out of my body and Dad said it was a dream? Every night since then, Ihave prayed and prayed that it would happen again—but it never works. Is thereanything I can learn that might give me another chance?” She told me that thiswas one of a series of special abilities called ESP, or extra sensoryperception, and she had books in the basement about it that I was welcome toread. She took me down into this little area under the cellar stairs where therewere three rows of books. My eyes immediately locked onto the letters “ESP” onthe spine of one of the books, and I pulled it out. It was called How to MakeESP Work for You, by Harold Sherman. I found two other books on hypnosis, anddecided it was a good idea to read those books as well—since I already knewpeople could do pretty amazing things once they had been hypnotized.I ended up reading Sherman’s book every day for at least the next two years andpracticing the exercises he gave in it as often as I could. I remember beingvery surprised to read that most people did not have ESP and did not believe itwas even real—whereas for me it was an everyday thing. Some of the stories inthere were quite amazing. I realized that it was possible to have far more ESPthan I already did—and to control it. I started bringing the book to schoolalong with Odyssey magazine, but did not want the other kids to know what I wasreading, so I taped a white piece of paper over the front and back cover, andwrote “Free Reading” on the front. I had a hard time understanding everything,since there were no pictures, the size of the words was very small, and mostkids my age were working through the huge, simple sentences in Clifford the BigRed Dog—but I never gave up.I was encouraged to keep reading the book by a television show called That’sIncredible, starring John Davidson, Fran Tarkenton, and Cathy Lee Crosby. Thisshow featured all sorts of strange and paranormal phenomena, including anepisode in which Uri Geller moved a pencil with his mind while his face wascovered so he could not blow on it. I was very impressed by that demonstration,as it was similar to the abilities I had in my dreams, and what they called “TheForce” in Star Wars. Some of the episodes were very frightening for my brotherand me, and nothing ever scared us more than the infamous “Haunted Toys-R-Us”episode. They created reenactments of a poltergeist in the Toys-R-Us store thatwere so realistic that Michael became terrified to go upstairs alone, as hethought ghosts would try to throw things at him. We started going up the stairstogether, figuring that would be safer than if we were alone.As the leaves started falling, a kid we will call Tom created a “club” on theplayground and said everyone who joined it would be “cool.” In order to join theclub, you had to go through an initiation, and I was one of about fifteen kidswho agreed to do it. Tom and a couple friends of his lined us up against thefence facing the high school running track. Then we had to let Tom punch each ofus in the stomach as hard as he could, and we couldn’t cry or make any sound.Every kid got punched and most of us passed the test, myself included. However,once we “passed,” the club just fizzled. Tom hadn’t planned out anything afterthat—or maybe he didn’t care. We realized we had been tricked. Tom just wantedto punch us in the stomach. There was no club. I quickly realized that I did notneed to get hit in order to be “cool.” I already had friends, and I startedasking everyone for their phone number. I bought a little blue notebook at thepharmacy and carried it in my pocket. I created a page for each letter of thealphabet and wrote everyone’s first name and number down on the appropriatepage.Right after I started building my phone book, my parents were devastated whenJohn Bonham, the drummer for Led Zeppelin, died at a young age. The band said itwas over and they would never release another album—and other than a compilationof old, forgotten songs called Coda, they never did. This made it even clearerthat I shouldn’t allow people to hurt me just to be cool. Led Zeppelin was thecoolest band on Earth, according to my parents, and now their drummer was dead.Being cool wasn’t enough to save John Bonham’s life.WATCHING THE WHEELS GO ROUND AND ROUNDThe hostages were still being held in Iran when the next presidential electiontook place on November 7, 1980. President Jimmy Carter looked weak for beingunable to free them, and Ronald Reagan won by a landslide. One month and one daylater, on December 8, John Lennon was shot to death by someone who asked him forhis autograph. He had just released a comeback album, which included the song“Watching the Wheels,” in which he seemed to be apologizing to his audience fortaking years off. Now he was getting back in the game, which would likelyinclude very effective anti-war protests. My babysitter, Ellen, was terriblyupset about his death, as she loved the Beatles, and she had quite a story thenext time we saw her.The night before Lennon’s death, she had a dream in which she saw him wearing apurple velvet suit with a white rose and a purple top hat. He also had purplelipstick, jet-black round sunglasses, and paper-white skin. She had the terriblefeeling that he was dead, since the white skin and purple lips made him looklike a corpse. She bolted awake in the middle of the night, terrified thatsomething had happened to him. The very next day he was assassinated. Thiscaused me to take my ESP studies much more seriously, as I now realized thateveryone had the potential to see into the future and gain valuable information.That Christmas, my parents gave me a Mickey Mouse 1981 glow-in-the-darkcalendar. Harold Sherman had said you should document every unusual thing thathappened to you once you started practicing his ESP exercises. Every time I hadan ESP experience, I would write it down on that day in the calendar. I ordereda copy of the same Mickey Mouse calendar while writing this book. It wasfascinating to see those images again for the first time in well over thirtyyears, and it helped me remember even more of my childhood. My “major present”that same Christmas was the Atari Video Computer System, or VCS, which was laterrenamed the Atari 2600. I quickly became addicted to playing video games, andwould often spend hours a day on games like Pitfall! and River Raid.The Iranian hostages were finally freed on January 20, 1981, on the exact sameday Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president. This was very suspicious. Manywhistle-blowers have since testified that George H. W. Bush bribed the Iraniansto ensure they did not release the hostages until after Carter lost the electionin November 1980. Though many people still look fondly upon the Reagan years,during that time the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union soon becamemuch, much worse.Walter Cronkite was replaced by Dan Rather on March 6, 1981, two days before mybirthday, and the news began bombarding us with stories about the nuclear armsrace. Night after night, we were told that we must support massive governmentspending to build more bombs. We were told that if we had more nukes than theSoviet Union, they wouldn’t try to attack us—even though both sides had vastlymore missiles than they needed to completely destroy all life on Earth. We alsostarted having government-mandated nuclear war drills in school. A terriblesiren would scream over the loudspeakers and we were ordered to hide under ourdesks—as if that would somehow make the radiation any less dangerous. Americahad turned into a suicide cult just like Jonestown, and no one seemed to careenough about it to try to do anything to stop it.An assassin shot Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, just sixty-nine days into hispresidency. Reagan took a bullet in the armpit, and his press secretary, JamesBrady, stumbled right as the shot that would have hit Reagan in the head wasfired. Brady absorbed the bullet and did not die. Many years later, PetePeterson, who is one of my highest-level insiders, told me that Reagan hadlearned that UFOs were real and extraterrestrial civilizations were visiting us.He had decided he was going to tell the public the truth—and the people doingthe cover-up wanted him dead. After this happened, Reagan was warned that if heever said another word about it again, this time they wouldn’t miss—and helistened. It is important to point out here that presidents do not necessarilyrank very highly in the Cabal and are not given very much real power. They arepublic figureheads, kept deliberately ignorant so that if they are ever broughtto trial, they cannot reveal any of the most damaging secrets of the group. Theyare routinely threatened with the most dire consequences if they refuse to dowhat they are told.Shortly after Reagan was shot, on April 12, the first space shuttle launch tookplace. This was very important to me, and I had read all about it in Odysseymagazine long before it happened. I wanted to be an astronaut, and I believedthis was our next step toward colonizing space. I watched each new shuttlelaunch with extreme interest. The United States government would ultimatelyspend 209 billion dollars on space shuttle missions.23[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber22] Years later, insiders would tell me that theReagan administration used the nuclear arms race, the shuttle missions, andmassive increases in defense spending to obtain huge amounts of money for topsecret “black budget” programs, in which highly advanced and classifiedtechnology was being developed.THE MAN WHO SAW TOMORROWI was absolutely stunned by the HBO special The Man Who Saw Tomorrow, which hadpremiered in January 1981 and aired repeatedly during this time. This was thefirst time I had ever heard of the prophecies of Michel de Notre-Dame, commonlyknown as Nostradamus. The show was narrated by Orson Welles, who had been thenarrator of a realistic radio show broadcast in 1938 called The War of theWorlds, which had fooled many people into believing that a mass alien invasionwas taking place. Now, Welles was causing many people to panic again, includingme. The show thoroughly established that Nostradamus was a powerful psychic whodazzled the people of his time with accurate future prophecies. Nostradamus alsoleft behind mysterious and poetic four-line poems, or quatrains, which appearedto have accurately predicted many future events, including the rise and defeatof Napoleon and Hitler. According to this show, Nostradamus said we would all bewiped out in a nuclear war, and it might happen in 1999, if not sooner. Theprogram also had Hollywood-quality images of nuclear missiles in space, makingit very easy to visualize such a war actually taking place.The Nostradamus special made me believe I had the power to change the world. Iknew I already had abilities that were similar to his, only much weaker. I feltthat if I practiced harder, and got better at ESP, I might be able to see thefuture as Nostradamus had done, and possibly help save the world. I knew I wouldbe old enough for people to listen to me by the year 1999. The old man in mydreams had often asked me to develop these abilities, and now I had a book thatgave me exercises to learn how to do it. In order to mark my new resolve, I tookan American Lung Association sticker with the year 1981 printed on it, which Ihad been sent before Christmas, and stuck it into How to Make ESP Work forYou—right below the title of the chapter “Your Healing Power.” Sherman also saidthe younger you started, the better your ESP would be. I hadn’t started as youngas I could have, but I still felt that I had to try, as even with limitedabilities I still might be able to help stop a war.Sherman said you should breathe deeply and regularly and try to make your mindas quiet as possible. He recommended that you lie down in bed and lift each arm,one at a time, holding it straight up until it becomes tired. Then you let yourarm fall down and imagine that it is no longer there. You then do the same thingwith your legs, one at a time. Finally, you do long, slow, rippling movements inyour chest. The goal is to feel as if your body has now disappeared, and youonly exist as a single point inside your head. At this point you should be veryrelaxed and breathing very deeply. Then he said that you should visualize amovie screen. Images will start appearing on the screen for short bursts oftime, and you need to pay attention to them, as that will be how your ESP willappear. I tried this many times, but I could never hold the image of a moviescreen for very long. I also never saw any images appear on my movie screen. Iwas very frustrated by this, but night after night I practiced the sameexercises and continued reading the book for more clues.Finally, one night I got an interesting new idea. I wanted to know if I couldsend my “ghost body” somewhere else and have it generate some real proof. Idecided to concentrate on my friend Eric, figuring my “ghost body” wouldn’t haveto travel very far to find him. Sherman said that if you wanted to get a messageto a particular person, the most important thing was to concentrate on theirface in your mind’s eye and to think about all the things you know and likeabout them. I held the image of Eric’s face in my mind, and over and over again,I told him, “Eric, you will wake up at three thirty in the morning.” After doingthis for a while, I realized that I needed to add in something else for extraproof. I tried to think of something that would be absolutely undeniable—so Idecided to tell him that he would wake up and think of gold. Now I kept seeinghis face and repeating the same command, very intensely. “Eric, you will wake upat three thirty in the morning and think of gold.”Sherman said you would feel a sense of relief when you were successful withsomething like this. Your whole body would relax and feel satisfied. Idefinitely had that feeling, but I absolutely wanted to make sure this was goingto work—so I kept on giving Eric the same command for another hour afterward.Exhausted, I finally fell asleep. The next morning at the breakfast table, Itold my mother what I had done. She told me it was very important that I nottell Eric anything—I should just ask him how he slept and see if he saidanything. I met up with Eric in the cafeteria, where we all drank little cartonsof milk. My mother allowed me to have only the plain milk, but Eric drank thechocolate milk. As he sipped on his straw, I threw my arm around him and said,“So, Eric, how did you sleep last night?” He was totally shocked. He backed awayfrom me and moved my arm off his shoulders immediately. “Why are you asking methat?” he said. “I don’t know, I’m just curious,” I replied, with a big smile.Eric said he had woken up in the middle of the night, terrified. He felt likesomeone was standing there in the room staring at him—like a ghost. I asked himwhat was the first thing he thought of after he got up. “I wanted to look at mywatch,” he said. “What color is your watch?” I asked him. “Gold,” he replied. Iwas absolutely shocked. I always had a digital clock by my bed, and didn’t evenknow he owned a gold watch. I told him what I had done the night before, and hewas stunned. I wasn’t completely sure if the experiment was a success, as hewoke up at four thirty instead of three thirty. However, I had kept on going foranother hour after my body felt completely satisfied, and that may have screwedup the timing. If I had stopped when my body first relaxed, Eric probably wouldhave woken up at three thirty. Despite this one-hour mistake, both Eric and Idecided that my experiment was a success. He woke up in the middle of the night,felt a ghostly presence in the room, and thought of gold—in the form of hiswatch.I started teaching Eric everything I was reading in the book. Every day wepracticed ESP exercises after school. Our most common experiment was to throwsticks up into the air and tell them which direction to point on the way down.We would break the sticks so the broken end was the pointing end, and we hadremarkable success getting them to point wherever we wanted them to. We alsotried doing a “rain dance,” and brought my brother in to help us. Almost everytime we did the rain dance it would start raining within less than ten minutes.THE ESP CLUBThe Nostradamus special aired again and again on HBO. I saw it many times andstudied every minute of it in detail. I could tell when it was coming on thanksto a magazine my father subscribed to called TV Guide. I realized that althoughthe things I was doing with Eric were cool, I needed to become a lot morefocused. I also wanted more people to study and develop their ESP, so we wouldhave a better chance of stopping disasters in the future. I felt the best way toget new people interested in ESP would be to prove that it really worked.Sherman had said that if someone strongly focused on a particular thought, andput a lot of emotion behind it, they could send it much more easily as atelepathic message—just like my mother did to call me home. A group of peoplecould send messages even better than one person. So I created an “ESP club” withEric and three other boys. Our first meeting was during recess. No one was goingto get punched in the stomach in my club—but they might very well get thegreatest shock of their lives.We were standing over by the kindergarten and first-grade side of the schoolbuilding. I asked them to go around the corner and pick a number between one andten, concentrate on it for a minute or so, and then come back. I told them totalk as quietly as possible so there was no way I could possibly hear what theywere saying. While they were gone, I breathed and relaxed deeply and tried notto think about anything. Then when they walked toward me, I took the very firstnumber that popped into my blank mind. Harold Sherman said your first impulse isalways correct with ESP if you do it right, and it’s only once you second-guessyourself that you make mistakes. So my goal was not to think about any number atall until I looked into their eyes as they walked back—and then just acceptwhatever flashed through my mind, even if it was only for a split second, as thenumber. The boys were amazed, as every single time they did this, I guessed thecorrect number. Although I was very impressed that it really worked, I laughedabout it and did not act like it was a big deal. “Everyone can do this,” I toldthem. “I’m just showing you the proof.” They said I must have been able to hearthem talking. “Then go even farther away, and whisper even quieter,” Iresponded. “Distance does not matter.”They went around the corner of the building again, and this time when I calmedmy mind down, it felt very different. Something was going on. I could feel thatthey were going to try to trick me. I tried to think about what they were goingto do, but I couldn’t quite get it. They came around the corner of the building,walked up to me, and the first thing I got in my mind was the number three. Isaid it out loud and they seemed defeated. Their shoulders visibly slumped.“Yeah,” they responded, “it’s three.” Then they turned their backs on me againand started walking away. One of the kids leaned in to the others and startedwhispering as if he was excited about something. My mind was still very blank,and as he did this, I quickly saw an image of the number seven come flyingtoward me in my imagination. It was made out of a series of round,whitish-yellow lights, like some kind of display you would see on stage at arock concert. This image was so sudden and so intense that I immediatelyrealized what was going on. I yelled out to them, “Come on back, you guys. Youalready picked the next number. It’s seven.”They were absolutely baffled, as I had busted their plot with perfect accuracy.They had chosen two numbers, three and seven. Three was the first number andseven was the second. If I guessed three correctly, they were planning to goback around the building and guess a fake number. Somehow they figured that if Iguessed the fake number instead of the real number, they would have proven thatI was doing a trick and it was not real. Instead, I caught them with ESP. Irealized very quickly that this had terrified them. One of them said they had togo, and all the others followed—leaving me standing there alone. Eric was stillinterested, and we continued doing our experiments together, but our ESP clubnever met again. None of the kids even wanted to talk about it. They just actedlike it never happened.I was deeply saddened that my club had failed, and that no one wanted to learn askill that seemed so natural and easy to do, but was vital for our own future.At least one of the kids was from a heavily Christian family, and it seemed likethey thought this ability was evil—something only the Devil could give a person.That would explain why none of them wanted to talk to me or be my friend afterthe one and only meeting of our club. This seemed sad and ridiculous to me,since Jesus could supposedly do the same sorts of things, as well as the reallygood stuff, like walking on water, turning water into wine, making enough loavesand fishes to feed five thousand people, raising Lazarus from the dead, andascension—transforming his own body into pure light after he had already died.THE PULSE OF THE PLANETNot too long after my “ESP club” failed, I was walking home from school alone,and a big kid really tried to hurt me. He came silently zipping up behind me onhis bicycle, took off his backpack, and whacked me from behind with it as hardas he could. It hit me in the back and caused my whole body to stumble forward.I was furious—and I wanted to hurt him. I suddenly got the idea to use my ESP toattack him and see if I could get him to fall off his bicycle. I went to myquiet place and asked for a way to do this. I got a very specific answer,including a name for it, which was a “pulse.” I felt there was no way it wouldactually work, so I would just try it and see what happened. I took a deepbreath, focused my gaze at the back of his head, and then tensed up every musclein my body as suddenly and as violently as I could. As I did this, I shot airout of my mouth, making a sharp noise—and simultaneously shot my head forward,visualizing a red laser coming out of my forehead and hitting him in the back ofthe head. I was in a fury as I did this.Immediately after I hit him with the “pulse,” the front wheel of his bicyclejerked in a funny way, perhaps from slipping on some gravel—and he fell off hisbike and collapsed in a ditch. He was clearly hurt. He got back up on his bikeand rode away in pain. I understand at this point that you may believe I ammaking this up or telling stories. I cannot prove that this really happened,since there were no witnesses, but it absolutely was real—and I was overwhelmed.Many years later I would find out from multiple insiders that certain giftedchildren were being trained in very dark programs to assassinate people withtheir minds. It worked better if they did it as a group. These children wereheavily traumatized and subjected to drugs and brainwashing. What I did was onlya hint of what was possible—but the problem was that it was all evil. I washorrified that I had been able to knock that kid off his bike. After he got upand left safely, I ran the rest of the way home, threw myself upon my bed, andcried for about a half hour. I prayed to God, said I was sorry and that I wouldnever “pulse” anyone again—and I never did. This was the same sort of thingDarth Vader did in Star Wars, such as the “force choke”—and I absolutely did notwant to go over to the Dark Side.A CLASSROOM DEMONSTRATIONI still knew that someone could become a new Nostradamus and help save the worldfrom total destruction, such as nuclear war—but they would need to learn aboutESP first. I felt that if I could prove to my entire second-grade class that ESPreally worked, someone would be interested enough to train with Eric and me. Ifound out about Zener cards on some TV show. Each Zener card had one of fivedifferent symbols—a star, a circle, a triangle, a square, and three wavy lines.Scientists had tested people’s ESP with these cards and gotten good results. Iended up making my own deck of ESP cards, but in my case I drew a completelydifferent symbol on each card, which would make it much harder. I convinced Mrs.Steiner, my teacher, to let me speak to my second-grade class about ESP, what itis, and how it works, and then have Eric help me demonstrate it with the cards.He would hold them up and I would try to guess whatever symbol was on them.Mrs. Steiner said yes, and we actually did the demonstration. Now that everyonewas watching me, I felt nervous. I did actually manage to get a couple of themright, even though they were all shuffled before we started, but most of myanswers were wrong. It definitely seemed like it was a failure, and I feltembarrassed about it. No one asked me about ESP or wanted me to teach them. Istill have the original deck of cards in my closet, complete with the twoink-stained rubber bands off Dad’s newspapers that I had wrapped them with."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXDARKNESS CLOSES INThe Pyramid Program for Gifted Children had only about seven kids in it by thetime I was in second grade. One of them was a girl named Tara, a thin blondewith huge eyes whom I thought was very cute. Tara walked up to me in art classone day and told me a brown-haired girl we will call Laura wanted to ask me outon a date. I was carrying all my books at the time, and I lost control of myhands and dropped them all over the floor—but I didn’t even care. Eric and I sawLaura and Tara while we were riding our bikes in the neighborhood, and we allagreed to go to a roller-skating event at the school together. Although I saidyes, I had never put on a pair of roller skates before, and certainly was notcoordinated. At the skating party I was very nervous and spent almost the entiretime hugging the stage so I wouldn’t fall over. Eric and Laura eventually cameover and put my arms over their shoulders, so I could skate without fallingdown—and I had never felt better in my life.Soon after the skating party, Laura refused to talk to me at all. If she wasanywhere near me, she immediately walked away. Eric’s mother was a staunchfundamentalist Christian, and she worked in a textile store with Laura’s mother.They also went to church together. Eric confessed that he told his mother Laurawas interested in me. I never found out what his mother had said, but Eric musthave told his parents about our ESP experiments. I got very angry and asked himwhy in the world he would tell his mother that Laura liked me when he knew shewas friends with Laura’s mom. All he did was laugh. He was clearly jealous andseemed to be happy that Laura wouldn’t talk to me anymore. He also did not wantto do any more ESP experiments after this. We stayed friends, but things gotreally weird—and over the years he bullied me more and more. By sixth grade, healmost killed me by shoving snow in my face and cutting off my breathing—whichhe called a “white wash.” I couldn’t help but feel that my mother had beenproven right about fundamentalist religions once again.SEDUCED BY THE BOXDad came home one day with a huge machine that sat on top of the TV, called aVCR—or video cassette recorder—which allowed you to record television shows ontoa big VHS tape. We were one of the very first families in the neighborhood tohave one. Shortly after this, a new channel called MTV—MusicTelevision—appeared. Dad was very excited about it and we watched it the firstday it came on. The video that inspired me the most was “In the Air Tonight” byPhil Collins, as it had dreamlike images of a hallway filled with doors tonowhere, and a very intense and emotional ending where he was screaming, and thecamera was very closeup on his face. When he sang, “I’ve been waiting for thismoment for all my life,” I kept thinking about the awesome event the old mantold me was going to happen on Earth in my lifetime—which I would eventuallylearn was called ascension.Once I started third grade, there was a new kid in school named Billy, who wasalso interested in dinosaurs, space travel, and science. We became fast friends,and I was able to get my mother to drive me over to his house a few times amonth. He had an Atari like I did, but his father worked as a manager at theFriendly’s restaurant, so he had extra income and bought him tons of differentgames. Billy had an entire two-foot-deep basket that was literally filled to thetop with game cartridges—and for me this was like heaven. All we did was playgames together—including classic titles like Yars’ Revenge, Haunted House,Pac-Man, and Adventure. I also noticed that his mom bought him all these boxesof sugar-heavy junk food that I was never allowed to have, including Twinkies,Ho-Hos and Ring Dings. I knew that a Twinkie would supposedly never go bad, evenafter a hundred years, but they sure tasted good—so I had one of them every timeI went there.I started having trouble in school during this same time. My third-gradeteacher, Mrs. Smith, wanted us to write in cursive, and I hated it. I also didnot want to memorize multiplication and division tables. I strongly believedthat the answer would change depending upon where you were when you calculatedit. The only way to be sure of the right answer was to redo it each time. So ifI saw 9 × 3, I would count it out in my head while lifting up my fingers to makesure I had the right number. I would mentally count 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,17, 18, see that I had nine fingers up, and then start again: 19, 20, 21, 22,23, 24, 25, 26, 27. This made me much slower than the other kids, and I beganfalling behind—but for months I felt it was very stupid, even dangerous, to tryto memorize the answers. I seemed to remember that if you used math to traveland didn’t make a fresh calculation each time, you could get hopelessly lost, ifnot killed. It was many years before I read about higher dimensions and realizedthat there could indeed be places where the rules of mathematics functioneddifferently than they do here. If you are in a base-6 counting system, forexample, you would count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and so on.Certain areas might force you to use a different number base in order for thecalculations to work properly.WEIRD SCIENCEI started reading as many books about science as I could—from school as well asin the children’s section of the Schenectady County Public Library. My motherwould always have us “talk” to a tree when we went there. We would go up to thetree and say nice things to it, and the tree would “answer” by having the windblow through its branches. It did seem that the tree always responded wheneverwe did this. The wind would pick up, even if it was calm, and I believed thetree was really talking to us. One day my mother told me about the work of Dr.Cleve Backster, who had a plant that “screamed” when he tried to burn it. Shehad read enough to be completely convinced this was true, and it had quite aneffect on me. I had never considered the idea that plants had feelings before,but Mom was absolutely convinced that these experiments were real. Years later Iwould interview Backster myself, and I opened up The Source Field Investigationsby summarizing his findings.I quickly became obsessed with finding science experiments and trying them outat home. Mom also bought me a chemistry set, and my favorite ingredient was thephenolphthalein solution. You could pour some of this magic elixir into a testtube, drop certain chemicals into it, and get very nice crystals to form.That same Christmas of 1981, my “major present” was a small color TV from thelocal Roy Matthews hardware store on Mohawk Avenue. It was wonderful, as now Icould play Atari games alone in my room with the door closed and not botheranyone else. I continued to have wonderful dreams of flying during this time.THE PLOT THICKENSSometime roughly at the beginning of 1982, I saw my first picture of theinfamous “Face on Mars” in Odyssey magazine. This is a mountain on the surfaceof Mars that looks exactly like a human face—and the magazine said it was verystrange. I immediately felt that someone had built it to look like this, and itwas not just an illusion. I wanted so badly to know how it got there, and whodid it. I felt the answer must be hiding in the UFO phenomenon. Perhaps therewere people out there who were much older and more ancient than we were—peoplelike the old man in my dreams. These same people may have built things like thepyramids, the stone heads of Easter Island, and Stonehenge here on Earth. Icouldn’t understand why so many kids continued to hate me for bringing Odysseyto school, as I felt this was wonderful stuff that would change the world—justlike the old man said.That summer, the movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was released on June 11. Myfather went to see it by himself shortly after the premiere, came home, and saidwe had to immediately go and check it out. We all went to see it either thatsame night or some time the next day. In the movie, a boy named Elliott startedto take care of a kind-looking little extraterrestrial who had crash-landed onEarth. E.T. was able to levitate balls to show where he came from. He brought adead chrysanthemum flower back to life, and he had a weird psychic connection toElliott. When E.T. drank beer, Elliott started to get drunk—and when E.T. sawJohn Wayne kiss a girl in a movie, Elliott kissed a girl in his class.I was stunned to see ESP in a movie, as well as telekinesis—E.T. was able tolevitate the bicycles of Elliott and all his friends and make them fly throughthe air at the end. When E.T. died, I cried harder than I ever had in any othermovie. I definitely realized that Steven Spielberg was comparing E.T. to Christwhen E.T. was later resurrected. As a young adult, I bragged about the fact thatI had cried fewer than ten times in my life for emotional reasons, and this wasone of them. I identified so strongly with extraterrestrials that I felt like Iwas Elliott, and when E.T. died it seemed like I had lost the only real friend Iever had.THE JOURNEY TO AVALONThat same summer, in late June, Dad took us on our first vacation to Cape Cod,Massachusetts, where we stayed at a place called Captain’s Row. We went to visitDad’s college buddy Bob at an oceanfront cabin he had right on the shore ofHyannis Bay, which was fantastic. However, the sand was loaded with razor clams,and I stepped on one of them by accident, causing my foot to bleed. Mom andMichael both decided to do “will walking,” and she told me that if I “set myintention,” I could walk without looking and never step on another clam. I gotangry and said there was no way I was going to do that. She and Michael went offand did it anyway, waving their arms happily. Sure enough, neither of themlooked where they were going and neither of them stepped on a razor clam. Thiscaused me to resent them both for a while, but I got over it as soon as theystopped.Mom was applying the wisdom she had read in the Seth books about the idea that“you create your own reality.” Others have called it “the law of attraction.” Icertainly do not advocate putting yourself in dangerous situations like this.However, life is filled with unexpected dangers and distractions, andcultivating a positive attitude can significantly affect your experiences. Thephenomenon of synchronicity taught me that when I focused on the positive,amazing and inexplicable things could happen. Similarly, when I knowingly hurtothers or hurt myself, I would invariably attract “bad karma,” in which negativeevents would manifest in my life with shocking precision and timing. By the timeI was in high school, I was already convinced that karma was absolutely real—andextremely important to be aware of.SHE BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCEIn the fall of 1982, I became one of the “big kids,” and got to stay on theupper floor of the elementary school in Mrs. Austin’s fourth-grade classroom. Bythis point, Dan Rather was warning us almost every night that we could all diein a nuclear war. More and more often, I heard my parents yell at each otherafter they put Michael and me to bed. We were upset enough by this that I gotrid of my huge hardwood double bed and moved into Michael’s room, with a new setof bunk beds that the bass player in Mom’s band built for us. We turned myformer bedroom into the family room, and it was hardly ever used. My gradescontinued dropping in school, and the bullying kept getting worse and worse. Onekid named Chris came up with a line that I ended up hearing again and again:“He’s so smart that he’s dumb.” Everyone thought this was hilarious.During this time, my father got me backstage to meet Thomas Dolby, who wasriding high on his hit single “She Blinded Me with Science.” I really enjoyedmeeting him, and I could tell he was totally overwhelmed with everything thatwas happening. He was polite, but very exhausted and distracted. This wasextremely common for the musicians that Dad would take me backstage to meet. Ihad no idea at the time that I would spend much of my adult life going throughsimilar challenges as a public figure—even though the old man had repeatedlywarned me about it in dreams.IF WE CAN DREAM IT, WE CAN DO ITThat Christmas, Michael and I were thrilled when Dad gave us an entire magazinehe had drawn by hand. The front cover had a picture of Mickey and Minnie Mouse,and a title that said, “Guess where we’re going?” Once we opened the book, welearned we were going to Disney World in February. He had drawn images of Disneycharacters, and there was colorful text that talked us through it step bystep—as well as a pouch with a thick color brochure for Disney World in it atthe back. He also gave us each a jigsaw puzzle from GE that featured amagnificent flying city, complete with UFO-type craft flying through it. At thetop of the puzzle, it said, “IF WE CAN DREAM IT, WE CAN DO IT.” I built thepuzzle on the kitchen table and felt it was absolutely true. It was only amatter of time before we had cities and spaceships just like the ones I wasalready seeing in my dreams.We headed off to Disney World in early February and were lucky enough to be ableto skip school while we were gone. Both Mom and Dad got a terrible virus thatgave them diarrhea and they were very sick. Mom spent almost the entire timeflat on her back in our suite, and Dad took us on all the rides while drinkingout of a bottle of Kaopectate that he had wrapped in a brown paper bag. Dad wasthere for a working trip, since General Electric sponsored a ride in EpcotCenter—and we got to go behind the scenes into rooms that only the upper-levelmanagement would normally see.HYBRID SEDANDad had hoped the Disney World trip would improve his relationship with mymother, but things only got worse and worse. Mom started leaving the house everynight for rehearsal with her band Hybrid Sedan after dinner, leaving Dad toentertain us and put us to bed by himself. Mom didn’t come home until after hehad to go to sleep for work the next morning. Dad started telling us storiesevery night. He would ask us for an idea or a topic, and then create a story outof it that always involved two little boys—and we really enjoyed that.THE DAY AFTEROn November 20, 1983, a television movie called The Day After was aired. It washeavily advertised and everybody knew about it. The ads showed horrific scenesof a post-nuclear apocalypse and the people who survived. My parents refused tolet Michael and me watch it, but I wanted to know what the media was showingeveryone, so Michael and I sneaked into the family room and watched it while Momand Dad were seeing it downstairs. The images were absolutely terrifying, andafter just a few minutes, we’d had enough. I knew that if something like thisever happened, it would quickly destroy all life on Earth. Yet, night afternight the TV news made it sound like this could happen at any time—and we mightnot even realize the missiles had launched before we were already dead.I didn’t understand how anyone could think this was a good idea. If you have awar where the Earth itself is destroyed, there is no winner. Everybody loses.And why would the US and the Soviets want to do this if they were also going todie from it? This faceless terror caused everyone to feel incredible stress,fear, and pain, which tended to make them hurt one another. I found out onlyyears later that a vast system of underground bases had been built for our“leaders” to survive a nuclear war, while everyone else died out on the surface.These cities were connected by an underground train system with egg-shaped carscalled “sub-shuttles.” This would allow them to travel anywhere they wanted andsupport many hundreds of thousands of people whom they chose to survive.GO AHEAD, HAVE AN APPLEApple released a wonderful-looking new computer, the Apple IIc, in late April1984, and my neighbor Brett got it right away. He showed it to me and it wasincredible. The IIc could run all the games that we had at school, as well asall the games my friend Eric had on his own Apple IIc at home. I talked at greatlength about how awesome this computer was, but I never imagined Dad wouldactually buy one for me just over a month later. Michael also got to buysomething big that he really liked, and in his case he got a high-endstunt-riding bicycle called a PK Ripper.On the day we went to buy the computer, I was sitting in a restaurant and a verylarge ball of earwax rolled out of my ear. It felt oddly symbolic, as if I weresomehow being told that I would have better ESP—I would “hear” better—once Istarted using the computer. I ended up using the same computer until 1995, whenI first got on the Internet after I finished college. I came home with the wholesystem in a big box, and also got a particleboard computer desk to hold it. Iput the desk together by myself, but did not cover up the screws with the littleround stickers that looked like wood grain. I wanted to be able to tighten themagain if the desk ever started getting wobbly. Just a few weeks later, thosestickers ended up saving me from the worst trouble I would have ever gotten intoin my life.LET’S BURN SOME SUGAR!Soon after getting the new computer, Michael and I were watching a show calledMr. Wizard’s World on Nickelodeon and got very excited. Mr. Wizard held up abottle of white powder, and said, “What I have here is some KNO3 . . . and weare going to use it to burn sugar.” YES! My Pyramid teacher, ProfessorSchottman, had given me a box full of mysterious chemicals from his attic tohelp me do more experiments—and it included a bottle of KNO3. Mr. Wizard mixedKNO3 and sugar together in a little aluminum pie pan, and had a kid light it onfire with a match on the end of a four-foot-long pole while they were wearinggoggles. The mixture fizzed and burned a little bit, creating a small fire andsome black goo—and that was it. “We’ve got to try this right now,” I toldMichael. We ran into the basement, grabbed the KNO3, and got one of Mom’saluminum pie pans out of the kitchen cabinets. Since Mr. Wizard did it allindoors, I thought it would be perfectly fine for us to set it up on the kitchentable. We grabbed all of Dad’s old newspapers out of the garage and created athree-inch-tall stack for the kitchen table. “How much KNO3 do you think weshould use?” “I don’t know, maybe fifty-fifty,” Michael replied.We mixed together enough KNO3 and sugar to create a thick layer of powder thatcovered the entire bottom of the pie pan, and put it on top of the stack ofnewspapers. I tried to light it four different times with matches but it didn’twork. Finally I realized we needed more heat. The match would be a lot hotterwhen it first started, since that’s when the magnesium would be burning, so Ilit one and tossed it in immediately. All a sudden, the KNO3—potassium nitrate,the active ingredient in gunpowder and dynamite—roared to life. Within aboutthree seconds, we had a gigantic three-foot-tall, one-foot-wide cylinder of bluefire that was swirling in an angry rage, looking like some DNA molecule fromhell. We could immediately feel the heat blast on our faces, like the flash-potsat a rock concert. The flames were licking against the glass globe light thatdangled over the kitchen table, leaving soot marks. Michael and I were screamingand crying at the power and the fury we had unleashed, right in the spot whereso many tense dinners had taken place in the last few years. We had no idea ifwe were about to burn the whole house down and could only watch in absolutedisbelief. The tower of fire blasted on for about two minutes nonstop andfinally died out. Nothing else had caught on fire, thank goodness.I grabbed the entire stack of newspapers, which still had some small flames, andran out the side door with them. The oxygen-starved flames suddenly surged overmy right shoulder, but did not burn me. I stomped them out on the driveway. Thehouse was filled with a very thick gray smoke that smelled like rotten eggs thathad burned. Some of the black, molten goo had eaten through all the newspapers,and it had carved a mark in a quarter-inch-wide area of the tabletop, right nextto the salt shaker. As if by some synchronistic miracle, my wood stickers werethe same color as the table. I put one of them over the hole, and it fitperfectly. Every night after that, we were afraid that Dad would see it—but henever did. Our babysitter, Ellen, came by and we opened up all the doors andwindows, using fans to blow all the hideous smoke out. By the time Mom camehome, the smoke was gone, and Michael and I were wailing and begging forforgiveness on our knees. “I think you have already suffered enough,” she said.We all agreed not to tell Dad.EAT THE PAINA few weeks later, Mom sat Michael and me down in the living room and said shehad something important to tell us. Michael was immediately scared, and Ialready knew what she was going to say. “Your father and I are going to getseparated,” she said. “He is going to start living somewhere else from now on.”Michael started crying really hard. I almost wanted to say, “What took you solong?” but I kept quiet. Less than a month later, we went off on anothertwo-week vacation to Cape Cod. Mom took us out there the first week while Dadmoved all his stuff out of the house with his friends. Then Dad came out forvacation on the second week while Mom cleaned up and rearranged the house byherself.Although the vacation was great, and I felt closer than ever to my dad’s friendBob’s family, going home was a big shock. Dad had kept rows and rows of recordsin the living room, both on the floor and on three wooden racks held up withcinder blocks. There was also a huge stereo system on the racks that soundedamazing. Dad had an estimated fifteen thousand records on shelves in thebasement—a huge treasure room of rock. Everything was gone. The living roomlooked completely barren and dead, and there were black scuffmarks on the wall.Then I went up into the family room and realized the color TV I had gotten forChristmas was gone. The Atari was sitting there disconnected and defeated. Iasked my mother what had happened, and she was very upset. “Your father wasgoing to take one of the two TVs, so I told him he could take the little one butnot the big one.” I was very angry at her, and at Dad, for making this dealbehind my back, without even asking me. She apologized and said so many badthings were happening that she just wanted to get it over with, and I should beglad that we still had the big TV. I felt crushed, because that TV had beengiven to me for Christmas—and I still used it.I started eating lots of Oreo cookies, which my mother always kept in a biggalvanized-steel-lined drawer by the kitchen door, to self-medicate from thepain this was causing me. I got very good at opening the drawer so quietly thatshe couldn’t hear it—even when she was seven feet away in the next room,teaching one of her piano students. With my new stealth technique, I felt that Icould get away with eating as many cookies as I wanted. This caused me to gainweight very rapidly—just like Billy’s brother had after their mother died ofcancer. I became extremely depressed, moved back into the “family room,” andstopped taking showers. My mother tried to make a joke out of it at first byrapping, “You smell funky,” in the same way Run-DMC said, “You be illin’.” Istill refused to listen, and it only got worse and worse until she eventuallydemanded that I start cleaning myself up. Even then, I would go days at a timewithout a shower—and this didn’t stop until I went back to school to start sixthgrade. At this time, Mom told us that there was going to be far less money nowthat Dad was gone, and we would have to spend much less in order to survive.Everything was different now, and we needed to be very careful.This was when my first “core trauma” occurred. All of us have had events likethis in our lives, where our childlike wonder and fascination with life collideswith harsh reality. It is a similar but more powerful version of the first timea baby hears the word “no.” These events program our subconscious mind tore-create the same traumas through “repetition compulsion.” I was alreadyaddicted to video games, and we never had enough money to replace my TV.Therefore, lack of money, giving my valuables away, a feeling of being betrayedby others, and the desire to indulge in addictions, such as “comfort eating,”became cycles that kept repeating in my life.Mom became an extreme workaholic, never slowing down, and made all her moneyfrom teaching piano and voice students and playing music gigs. She took on a lotmore students, and that meant I couldn’t stay downstairs at all, three days aweek, after I came home from school—and there was now no TV upstairs. My roomfelt like a prison. She also had hated all the piles of magazines, newspapers,and letters that Dad had kept around the house. All these new rules werecreated. Everything had to be superclean—to the point of being like a museum.Michael and I now had to do almost all the housework and yard work ourselves—andif we left a mess anywhere, we got yelled at.My life turned into a nightmare. We had to eat the same food four or five nightsa week, reheating it each time—and it was usually homemade macaroni and cheese.We hardly ever went to a restaurant. The whole house was now loaded with boobytraps—rules about keeping things clean that would create instant punishment ifthey were broken—and no matter how careful we were, both of us got in troubleevery day. If Mom found one water stain on the bathroom sink, or one tiny crumbof bread on the kitchen countertop, we were severely disciplined—and she feltshe had every right to be angry. I stopped washing my hands when I went to thebathroom because it was nearly impossible to avoid leaving a water stain. Irealized that most people were not like this, but since this was what shedemanded, we had to follow her orders. We already knew she was far too tough tofight against, as that would only make it much worse. My home life soon became adaily struggle of trying to figure out how not to get in trouble and failingconstantly.Due to repetition compulsion, I would end up spending most of my lifesubconsciously attracting people who were highly dominant, and I would be tooterrified to confront them. Identifying and recovering from these traumaseventually gave me the strength to stand up to the grand villains in ourplanetary script, despite the dangers involved.LET’S JUST CALL IT “HUSKY”Mom took us to Rudnick’s, a clothing store on State Street in downtownSchenectady, to buy new pants for school. It was dark, cold, and smelledstrongly of leather. The Olender furniture store next door to it had a “FinalGoing Out of Business Sale” every year or two. Now that we had very littlemoney, I could pick out only one pair of blue jeans. The lady working there wasvery cruel to me, as if that would somehow inspire me to lose weight. She tookone look at me and said, “You’re going to need husky pants.” Somehow, companieslike Lee and Levi’s had decided that it was cool to compare fat kids tothick-looking Alaskan dogs, but I hated the term. I also needed the legs to beshortened, which caused us to have to wait even longer—and the whole thing was ahorrible ordeal.On the first day of school, the huge ex-Marine Mr. Korthas saw me, with hiswhole fifth-grade class behind him, and bellowed out, “You look like you haveeaten well.” All the kids started laughing hysterically, and I was crushed. Iwas one of the only kids in school who was overweight, and now the bulliesfinally had a weapon they could use against me. I was called “lard ass,” “butterball,” “fatty,” “fat shit,” and many other such names on a regular basis.Another kid in my sixth-grade class named Joey started putting me into painfuljoint locks almost every day. He would grin widely through his crooked teeth andlaugh as I begged him to stop—but he was much stronger than I was. I also made anew friend that year, a kid named Shane who had just moved into town. At thetime, no one liked him since he was from a poor family and smelled sometimes.People called him names like “dirtbag,” but we got along very well.BLACK SWEATPANTSNot long after school started, I was sitting at my computer desk one night andaccidentally soiled myself. Nothing like this had ever happened to me before. Igrabbed a pair of black sweatpants—the only other pair of pants I owned thatstill fit—and hobbled into the shower. The pants were in such bad shape that Ididn’t even want to try to save them, and I also did not want to tell my motherabout it. I went downstairs, got a plastic garbage bag, and deposited both mypants and underpants into it as if they were radioactive waste. I tied the bagtightly and threw it out in the garage. I walked right past my mother as I didthis, and she had no idea what was going on.I was too embarrassed to tell her what had happened, and was terrified that Iwould be in trouble for destroying expensive clothing, so I started wearing myblack sweatpants to school every day. Since I had to do my own laundry, I didn’tunderstand that black clothes needed to be washed in cold water, and thesweatpants very quickly faded into a dull brown. This almost immediately causedthe bullying to get much worse. Every day I was violently insulted for my weightand was told I needed to get new pants. Joey would put me in a headlock right inthe classroom and ram my face into his soaking armpit, which smelled like onionsand dog mess, and no one cared. This went on for weeks and weeks, and my mothernever noticed what I was wearing. The torture I went through at school duringthis time was almost unimaginable. I finally broke down crying one night andtold her what had happened. She was very understanding and forgiving, andimmediately took me back to Rudnick’s so I could pick up another pair ofhuskies. I also ended up getting a useless pair of “parachute pants” that made aswishing noise as I walked, simply because that’s what the cool people werewearing—for less than a year.Mom had a Polaroid instant camera and took a picture of me when I had a computerexhibit at the science fair. I was demonstrating an old computer program I hadlearned to write in Pyramid. It would draw a straight line and rotate it incircles like a radar screen, with the center of the monitor as the pivot point.Intricate, curving geometric designs would form in the images it leftbehind—which I learned were called moiré patterns. I had discovered this quiteby accident, and no one could really explain why the patterns were so elaborateand beautiful. Everyone was impressed with my exhibit, but when I looked at thephoto I saw the truth. I had gotten really fat. Somehow I didn’t see it when Ilooked at myself in the mirror. I would only look at my face and had become verydisconnected from my body—but the photograph did not lie. I felt terrible—but itonly made me eat even more.In May, Twisted Sister released the rock anthem “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” whichwas constantly replayed on MTV almost immediately. The whole thing was writtenfor kids who were rebelling against abusive parents and teachers, and my brotherand I loved it. We jumped at the chance to see them live in concert later thatyear, after their second single “I Wanna Rock” was doing just as well—and thiswas the first time I was truly awed by a famous band I got to meet backstagewith my father. They were clearly drinking a lot, but they were all in a goodmood and doing very funny things. They were nice to us, and since we were theonly kids there, we got special treatment. The whole trick was not to act likethey were famous. If you treated them like rock stars, they would cut you off inless than thirty seconds. If you acted like they were ordinary people, you mightget to chat with them for an hour. This was remarkably consistent for everyfamous person I met.When we see people repeatedly in the media, we feel like they are a part of ourfamily. Our limbic, reptilian brain cannot differentiate between the images in aphotograph or film and actual reality. These people become part of our tribe—andwe feel an ongoing pain of abandonment when no actual in-person contact takesplace. Meeting a public figure can be an awesome, almost mystical experience,flooding us with an incredible surge of natural opiates in the brain. We becomeso high that we do not realize how our breathless hyper-enthusiasm is making theother person feel. Some public figures appreciate this type of attention atfirst, but before long they become traumatized by people who refuse to stoptalking or give them any privacy. The most important secret to remember is thatthey are ordinary people having an extraordinary experience. My early trainingin losing the “hero worship” impulse paved the way for me to have directtelepathic contact with extraterrestrials later in life. The druglike high offeeling you have been “chosen” and are “special” can make it impossible toachieve any type of reliable communication. Extraterrestrials and spiritualbeings are ultimately just people who are living their own lives and doing theirbest to help us out—at least when they are on the positive side. Negative beingsfeed on the energy of being worshipped and get a genuine rush from creatingfear, terror, and pain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENHEAVEN AND HELLDad took Michael and me to see 2010 shortly after its premiere on December 7,1984. This was a sequel to Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick’s epic classic2001: A Space Odyssey, which I had never seen. I was thrilled to see ProfessorHeywood Floyd typing on a beach with the same Apple IIc computer I had recentlygotten. In the film, Russia and the US launched a joint mission to investigatewhat had happened to the ship that was left behind at the end of 2001. Theship’s former commander, David Bowman, had become what you might call anascended being. He contacted his mother by moving through the electrical wiresand appearing on her TV, as sparks of starlight kept flickering in his eyes. Hetold her something was going to happen that would affect all of us. When shebegged him to tell her what it was, he smiled and said, “Something wonderful.”The gravity and power of that moment rocked me to my core. It was triggeringdeep memories from so many dreams I had had in the past.The horrible threat of nuclear war loomed in the movie as the two crews wereforced apart once tensions exploded between the US and Russia—but ultimatelythey needed each other to survive. They came upon this mysterious, ancientobject called “the Monolith” floating in space by the abandoned ship, and Icould hardly believe this had made it into a movie. Then it turned out that adark spot on Jupiter was growing larger and larger—and when they zoomed in onit, they found it was made with countless legions of monoliths. The mysterious,godlike objects were consuming the entire planet and transforming it intosomething new.The crews were given a very clear message that they had to leave. The abandonedship’s computer, HAL, sacrificed itself and its ship to save everyone else. Theentire planet collapsed in on itself and exploded, forming a brilliant new sunin our solar system. A message was beamed all over the Earth by some mysteriousforce, which was probably from the ascended form of David Bowman: “All theseworlds are yours. Use them together. Use them in peace.”I couldn’t stop thinking about 2010 for weeks. The old man had told me a verysimilar event was going to happen here, except it seemed to involve the Sun, notJupiter. Those dreams were starting to fade from my memory, but they werecertainly not forgotten. I went out and got the book and loved it—although Ithought it was totally ridiculous that Clarke said everyone on Earth had agreedthe new sun “had to” be called Lucifer. At the time I did not think this had anydeeper significance. Insiders would eventually reveal that Clarke had been givena wide variety of classified information to prepare us for an eventualdisclosure. The Cabal was already aware that an ancient builder race hadgenerated marvelous artifacts in our solar system, and was intimately involvedin steering us through the ascension process. The groups giving Clarke thisinformation had Luciferian beliefs, and some of it found its way into his works.Nonetheless, I do believe that the overall effect was positive, in that itintroduced people to the mysteries of ascension and of ancient artifacts onEarth and in our solar system.I convinced my mother to rent the movie 2001, which made the monolith much moreinteresting. It seemed to represent an ancient extraterrestrial technology thatwas designed to catapult human beings into new levels of evolution. The ending,where David Bowman went through the stargate and became the starchild—the samebeing we met in 2010—had me in total rapture. I quickly read Clarke’s original2001 book as well.MONKEY HILLOn Christmas break, a tough, arrogant jock kid with a square jaw andextraordinary self-confidence whom we will call Brad invited me to go sleddingwith him and some friends. Brad and I had been friends years earlier, since helived a few streets away from me. His parents burned wood for heat and had asign in the house that said, “Never trust a man who doesn’t drink.” Thissledding invitation came out of nowhere; we hadn’t spoken since I went over tohis house and saw him kill a squirrel with his BB gun. One of his friends wasChris, who had coined the phrase “He’s so smart, he’s dumb”—and had just spentweeks telling me to get new pants and saying I was fat.Brad’s other friend was Eddie, who was still taking the drumming class in schoolthat I had quickly dropped out of. Mr. Riccobono had demanded I play nothing butslow quarter notes on my practice pad, left-right-left-right, for twenty minutesa day. I was already playing Native American beats on a drum in kindergartenclass, so this was a staggeringly boring joke. I felt terrible about quitting,but I just couldn’t take the dullness of practicing, and decided I was betteroff trying to train myself. Now the four of us were in Mom’s car on the way toCollins Park, and all they could talk about was the dreaded Monkey Hill. It wasan extremely dangerous, steep slope that had a big ninety-degree turn after thefirst twenty-five feet, and then continued on for about another hundred feetafterward. Immediately to the left of Monkey Hill, there was a thick wall ofvivid-smelling evergreen trees.We all went over to Monkey Hill after only a few runs on the safer and easiertrails. I watched them all do it, and they kept saying it was important to leaninto the turn as you hit it. I immediately decided there was no way I would evergo down Monkey Hill. It was much too dangerous. The next thing I knew, they werepractically demanding I run it on my orange plastic saucer, calling me a pussy.I continued to refuse. They grabbed me and forced me down onto the saucer, aboutfifteen feet to the side of the beginning of the trail. Then, all three of thempushed me to get me going as fast as they could, using the extra fifteen feetlike a runway. I screamed down the top of the hill and hit the ninety-degreeturn at full speed. Leaning didn’t do me any good. The curve turned into a ramp,and launched me into the air. I plunged a hundred feet down through empty space,soaring about fifteen feet above the ground while descending on a smooth,parabolic arc. This caused me to be airborne for a stunningly long time. All Icould do was grip the sides of the saucer in disbelief as it slowly rotatedthrough the crisp-green winter air. I was too shocked and mystified to bescared. It was the closest I had ever felt to the out-of-body experience in mywaking life.I was facing backward when I hit the ground, so I did not know when I was goingto land. I smashed into the hard snow in an upright, seated position, and theimpact was so powerful that my saucer cracked into about twenty-five differentpieces. Many of them were triangle-shaped. My tailbone and lower spine were inagonizing pain and I didn’t even know if I would be able to walk again. I waslying there and didn’t dare move in case something was broken. My entire bodywas throbbing with pain from head to toe. I had a tremendous headache and Icould hear my heartbeat in my ears, along with a ringing. The kids quicklysledded down to see if I was okay.By some miracle, they were able to get me up on my feet and nothing appeared tobe broken—though my tailbone was very sore and I was in so much pain I couldbarely even walk. I hobbled up the hill, found my mother, and got her to take mehome. I had a hard time sitting for several days. She hadn’t seen what hadhappened and was very concerned when I told her why I didn’t have my sauceranymore. I never again went anywhere near Monkey Hill.THAT’S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FORThe great villains in our planetary script were threatening us with instantdeath from nuclear destruction at any moment. Some people chose to look for thepositive and be kind, while others felt compelled to repeat the trauma and painthey were feeling for others. I was still healing from my fall when Eric decidedhe was going to show me what a “white wash” was. In the media, when thegovernment committed a crime and covered it up, they called it a “whitewash.”Right in front of my babysitter Ellen’s house, Eric grabbed me, kicked out myleg, and forced me facedown into a snowbank. He grabbed a handful of snow andshoved it in my face, rubbing it around in circles. This went on for afrighteningly long time. He did not allow me to breathe, and the snow wasfiercely cold. I was screaming and screaming, trying to tell him I was going todie, and flailing my arms, but I had no voice—and he kept going. I was runningout of air and really didn’t know if I was going to make it. Finally he let go.My tortured lungs gasped for breath again and again.After about seven huge, bellowing gasps on all fours, with my whole bodyshaking, I got up on my feet and screamed at him in a bloodcurdling, torturedvoice, saying he had almost killed me. I used the strongest curse words when Iasked him if he was smart enough to realize that the human body cannot livewithout air, and how would his parents like it if they found out their son was amurderer? I wanted so badly to attack him, but I was afraid I might literallytry to tear him to pieces. I also didn’t know if I was strong enough to win thatfight. We stopped walking to school together after that event, but for somecrazy reason I continued to be friends with him. Everyone else hated us and weboth needed protection.About a month later, Eric convinced me to join him in putting two tacks on thechair of Diana, a tall, lanky, and kindhearted farm girl who obviously liked me,as a prank. I absolutely did not want to do it, and it seemed like he wasjealous because no girls liked him. I thought he might try to hurt me again if Isaid no. He put the tacks on her chair while I stood and watched, and I did notstop him. Other kids witnessed the crime. Diana sat down and screamed interrible pain, and both of us were sent to the principal’s office. AudreyFarnsworth made it clear that we were in very serious trouble—and Eric sure didcry, just like I did. This only made me resent him even more, and for a whileour friendship was over.SORRY, MRS. FARNSWORTHI had gotten a Radio Shack electronics kit for the Christmas of 1984. It was aone-and-a-half-foot-wide, three-inch-tall blue plastic box. It had a cardboardtop with electrical components arranged on it. Each component had athree-quarter-inch-tall coil of wire poking up on either side of it. You weregiven a wealth of color-coded wires of different lengths, and by following theinstructions, you could build different types of machines with it. I never tookthe time to build the full radio, but I did several complex projects. The liedetector was by far my favorite. It measured the electrical conductivity of yourskin, also known as galvanic skin response, or GSR. You would hold two whitewires, which were the longest ones, and get a tone that would rise and fall inpitch. If you were telling a lie, you would become nervous and the pitch wouldrise. As you relaxed, the pitch went down.I brought this kit to class one day and ran into the school principal, Mrs.Farnsworth, along with the district superintendent and all the highest-rankingpeople we never saw. It was a great photo op for her to ask me what I had there.Our local leaders gave one another knowing looks as they fantasized about howuseful such a device could be. To my horror, when she grabbed the wires, nosound came out—probably because she had too much makeup on her fingers. “I’msorry, Mrs. Farnsworth, but you appear to be dead.” All the bigwigs explodedinto laughter. Then I used my science buddy to prove that it did squeal justfine when a normal human grabbed the wires. I was genuinely baffled that themost powerful elite I knew in my own school, who had punished me several timeswith withering shame, did not register on my foolproof device as a normalperson. It seemed like a practical joke from the universe, showing me thatpeople in positions of power can become “heartless.” The synchronicity wasobviously helped along by the makeup on her fingers, which the makers of the liedetector had never accounted for.FAMILY HORRORSMy father had become deeply depressed from the divorce and lost a lot of weight.He got a small house in Scotia and we started going there to see him on Fridayand Sunday nights. Dad could cook one meal really well—a London broil grilledsteak with white rice and mushrooms. Otherwise we usually ordered aSicilian-style sausage-and-mushroom pizza. Since Dad loved horror movies, hedecided that we were now old enough to watch R-rated films. Many of them wereextremely terrifying and disturbing. I was too young to get the “morphineresponse,” since I had never seen or experienced traumas anywhere near ashorrible as what these movies displayed. I quickly learned that I had to removemyself from the film and remember that none of it was real. Another trick was toexpect that every single character I saw, no matter how much I was supposed tolike them, was going to die in the most horrible and gruesome way possible. Thatway, whenever they got it, I could just say, “Well, I knew that was going tohappen.” It also bothered me that only the villains in the movies hadsupernatural powers, whereas the victims and the people who fought and defeatedthe bad guys did not. Insiders would eventually tell me the Cabal wasdeliberately financing films like this, so that people would feel that only the“dark side” could produce powerful, ascension-like abilities in humans.Sean, a kid in school, was now avidly reading the Stephen King novels, and toldme how great they were. I ended up buying and reading several of them myself,including Different Seasons, The Drawing of the Three, Pet Sematary,Firestarter, It, and The Stand. Some of these novels were verydisturbing—actually much more so than any horror movie. I was amazed at thepower Stephen King had to create realistic, fully realized characters. Many ofhis villains and stupid characters seemed like adult versions of the samebullies I was dealing with in school—and the short story “The Body” became aclassic film called Stand By Me that depicted similar bullying characters askids. Stephen King’s art seemed to be an imitation of life, and I had the strongsense that he had been called “lard ass” in school just like I was.I made friends with a new kid in school, whom we will call Toby, after Eric hadnearly killed me by asphyxiation. Toby took me out to the Mohawk River, where hewanted us to walk over these huge slabs of ice that had broken up out of thewater. It was very dangerous, and I agreed to do it but tried to be as carefulas I could. Soon after I read “The Body,” in which kids find a dead body in thewoods, Toby actually died. He was riding on the back of a hay wagon on hisparents’ farm, sitting on top of a load of hay that was four bales high, whenthe wheel hit a bump and threw him off the back. Toby landed on his head and waskilled instantly. This was the first time someone I actually knew had died, andit was shocking. I was overwhelmed with grief for several weeks, particularlysince I hardly had any friends. Life suddenly seemed much more fragile than Ihad ever thought. I realized I had gotten very lucky with things like MonkeyHill and Eric’s white wash. I needed to fight back, as otherwise one of thesebullies might actually kill me.The horror movies and Stephen King novels made me enchanted by the idea thatToby might still exist as some sort of ghost. When my mother took me to theKay-Bee toy store in the Mohawk Mall, I found something called the Ouija TalkingBoard, which was sold along with classic board games like Monopoly, Parcheesi,Trivial Pursuit, and Clue. The front cover showed an eerie brown board with allthe letters of the alphabet, and a teardrop-shaped, cream-colored pointer thathad people’s hands on it. I picked it up, read the words, and realized that thiswas obviously being used to contact the dead—and apparently it really worked. Iconvinced my mother to let me buy it.Since you couldn’t do it alone, I waited until the next time my babysitterRachel came over, while my mother was off at a music gig, and we tried it.Rachel went into a deep state of meditation, rolling her eyes back and squintingthem. Her eyelids fluttered, and she let her head nod all the way back while shekept her hands on the pointer. She had no idea what it was saying or where itwas going. I started asking questions and the pointer was definitely moving onits own. I tried to ask questions that I did not know the answers to, and theresults were intriguing, to say the least—but the whole thing also had a verycreepy feeling. I became convinced that I had experienced genuine contact withspirits through this board, and there was indeed life after death. However, Ihardly ever had anyone I could do this with, since it required at least twopeople to work, and I had very few friends.One day a friend of mine came up to me and said I absolutely had to read thisbook he found in the library. It was by Francis Crick, one of the scientists whohad discovered the DNA molecule, which had all the codes for life. With a singlepiece of the right DNA, you could clone a human being. In this book, Crick wasarguing that the DNA molecule was far too complex to have evolved by randommutation. This got me tremendously excited. I could not understand why thisdiscovery wasn’t all over the news, particularly considering Crick had actuallydiscovered DNA in the first place. I spent countless hours trying to understandhow DNA could have been formed by some sort of cosmic intelligence, and at thetime I never came up with a good answer. I continued thinking about it for manyyears and kept looking for clues, which eventually became a major element of TheSource Field Investigations as well as my conferences, articles, and TV shows.WE’RE NOT GONNA TAKE ITBrad, the same kid who forced me down Monkey Hill, now wanted me to sneak out ofschool with him. After the last class at around two forty-five, students wouldpack up, and we were then forced to stand in a group of “walkers” in thegym—while each and every group of “bussers” left, one by one. Brad and Ihappened to be in the last group of “walkers” who were allowed to leave. Wedidn’t actually breathe fresh outside air until about three thirty p.m. Bradsaid this was ridiculous—and just like the Twisted Sister song, “We’re Not GonnaTake It,” Brad had a plan. His friend Oafer got picked up by his grandfather ina Dodge Dart every day at two forty-five. Mrs. Glindmeyer and Mr. Viall just lethim go right on by, and never checked to see if there was a car out there. Allwe had to do, Brad said, was say we were getting picked up—and they never wouldcheck. I was scared, but I decided to try it—and it worked. We got out, duckeddown in front of the windows so no one could see us, and then broke into a fullrun when we hit the road, continuing to sprint down the first part ofSchermerhorn Street. The sweet old lady who worked as a crossing guard halfwaydown the hill never asked us why we were earlier than the others. For the lastfew months of school we did this almost every day—and never once got caught.This became an addictive behavior, and addictions are all about “the hidden.”More and more distortions of reality become necessary if we ignore the signalsand continue down that road. Brad was the first person to influence me to lieand take dangerous risks, as up until then I had always told the truth. Later onhe would talk me into smoking weed.My grades were getting worse and worse, and I was just as shocked as my teacherswere when my scores on something called the COGAT test came back. I didextremely well, putting me at a level that was as strong as most high-schoolseniors. The school year ended with something called Field Day, which I hated,as it included the tug-of-war, the three-legged race, and other athletic eventsI was terrible at. The junior high school building was on the other side of thefence at the far end of the field, and there was a small military baseimmediately off to the left, in a series of steel half-pipe buildings. It wasn’tuncommon to hear soldiers marching outside during the day. I never knew why theywere there or what was going on in them, but I do remember touring one of themonce in Pyramid. It just looked like boring office space with some framed photosof military personnel and flags on the wall.On the last day of elementary school, I was on my bike and everyone else hadalready left. I was only about fifty feet away from where I had done my “ESPclub” four years before. I had all my books and papers stuffed into mytan-colored backpack. A big, sneering kid came roaring up to me on his bike andshot gravel at me as he screeched to a stop in front of me, sliding out his backwheel. He wrestled my backpack away from me, scattered the papers all over thepavement, and demanded that I cry or he was going to beat the hell out of me. Igave him exactly what he wanted, and he laughed and laughed before calling meall sorts of rude names and insulting my weight. Then he sped off. This made meeven more terrified of starting junior high school, where there would be “bigkids” from three different elementary schools—my own Sacandaga, as well asLincoln and Glendaal.THE JOINING OF THE THREEThings got much worse once I started junior high school in the fall of 1985. NowI had a locker with a combination, right next to Shane. I had seven periods ofclasses that required me to go to a different room every hour, with differentbooks. Gym class now required us to go down to an area with a locker room andshowers, but hardly anyone actually used them. We were now forced to play dodgeball, a truly barbaric game. All the jocks would try to slam you in the face ashard as they could with large red playground balls, even though it wassupposedly against the rules. They rarely ever got caught, and even if they sentsome kid to the nurse crying, their only punishment was to leave the game untilthe next round.The teacher would pick two jocks to form teams, and they got to choose whom theywanted one by one. Eric and I were always picked last. The jocks would openlyargue over who would end up with either of us, and let everyone know we werecompletely useless pieces of garbage to them. The whole rest of their team wouldoften join them in their laughter and disgust. There was no recess anymore, andthis was one of the only things I had been able to tolerate about going toschool, as it gave me a chance to lie down in the grass and relax. The onlyother thing I had loved was Pyramid, and now that was gone too.The kids from Glendaal were from wealthy families in the Glenville countryside,and tended to do really well in school—whereas the kids from Lincoln were fromless-expensive row houses in the Scotia highlands, and often had the lowestgrades. The kids from my school, Sacandaga, lived mostly down by the river, andwere right in between Lincoln and Glendaal in terms of economic level andacademic performance. I ended up in all the smart-kid honors classes, which weremuch more difficult, thanks to my COGAT scores—and most of my classmates werefrom Glendaal. On the first day of school, a tall eighth-grader with long blondhair, a denim heavy-metal jacket, and nasty blue jeans hocked his throat andspat on my leg, leaving behind a huge, disgusting yellow glob of mucus. I trulyfelt I had descended into hell. School had become prison, and there was noescape.Even though Brad had been skipping school with me at the end of sixth grade, nowhe acted like he didn’t even know who I was. He had a locker right near mine,but he avoided me at all costs. He wanted to be cool, play sports, and getgirls, and hanging around a kid with a big gut wasn’t going to get him what hewanted. Shane continued to be my friend, and everyone still thought he was a“scumbag” at this point since he was poor and did not have nice clothes.TOO MUCH REVENGEOne day I saw one of the Glendaal kids playing a game called Dungeons andDragons in the library with some other nerds from Glendaal. He was very wittyand seemed extremely sure of himself, to the point of being cocky andoverconfident. It was obvious that he was really smart, and he was just as heavyas I was. We will call him Kevin. He had dark brown hair, brown eyes, and largeteeth, and he was always grinning. I started talking to him, and he quickly letme know he was the smartest kid in school. In fact, if he scored less than a 95on any test, he would be severely punished by his parents, who both worked atthe Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, or KAPL. Kevin and I became fast friends,because we both had an Apple computer with lots of games at home, we shared manyof the same interests, and almost everyone hated us for being smart. Kevinquickly recruited me into Boy Scouts, which allowed me to go on camping tripsthat I really enjoyed. The first one was that same winter, and it was the mostfun I’d had since Cape Cod.I quickly realized, however, that Kevin would do weird and cruel things. Thefirst time I went to his house, he fed his collie dog, Excalibur, a hot pepper,and laughed as she struggled with the pain. More than once, he got angry aboutsomething I said and just completely stopped talking to me—for twenty minutes ormore at a time. He called it “going into his shell,” and I thought it wasridiculous. No one had ever done that to me before, and it was wasting valuabletime I spent at his house—which often involved riding my bike quite a longdistance into Glendaal territory to get there. When he came to visit me at myhouse, he did lots of bad things that got me in trouble—but he didn’t carebecause his parents were not there to punish him. Another time I squirted himwith a bottle used to water the flowers as a joke, and he disappeared. When Icame out of the bathroom, he threw a huge pitcher of water all over me, anddidn’t even care that it had gone all over the floor. He laughed and laughedabout this, and didn’t care when I said it was “too much revenge.”I also found out that there was something very weird about his parents. Theycould not tell him a single thing about what they were doing at work. They wouldalways listen to see if he was around, and if he ever got close they would stoptalking. They also were forbidden from bringing him to work. They were obsessedwith advanced physics and sci-fi movies, particularly if they were aboutextraterrestrials. They clearly believed in UFOs and directed him to all thesedifferent books about them. They also wanted him to study something AlbertEinstein had called the “space-time continuum,” and presented him with the ideathat you could create a “wormhole” in this “fabric” and travel through it. Itbecame clear that they thought extraterrestrials were very dangerous and we wereall being threatened by them. Years later I found out that many so-callednuclear engineers are only using that job title as a cover while they areactually working in classified programs involving reverse-engineered technologyfrom UFOs. They are told that their entire family will be killed if they eversay a single word to anyone. My firsthand experience of seeing how weird,secretive, and paranoid they were made this feel very personal to me.My mother’s band was now rehearsing in the basement, and that meant there was afull rock-and-roll drum kit down there. I started playing the drums again andquickly taught myself how to do basic rock beats. That September, the Parents’Music Resource Center, or PMRC, was formed by a group of senators’ wives, andthey were trying to completely censor any music that did not agree with theirextreme Christian values. This made both my brother and me very angry. When thelead singer of Twisted Sister testified at these hearings, he instantly becameeven more of a hero to us—and we told him so the next time we met him backstage.I decided I needed to get a lot better at drums, and I began taking regularlessons with Hugh, the drummer from my mother’s band. He would bring me up intohis attic, where there was another drum kit as well as all the amplifiers andspeakers. Everything reeked of beer and cigarettes, and there were egg-cratecushions all over the walls. I had many lessons with him, and they were muchmore advanced than what the school wanted me to do, but I was able to followalong.The new super-villain was Josh, a kid who followed me home from school every dayand tried to beat me up. I started walking with Eric and our longtime friendDave again. We banded together for protection against Josh, but it didn’t dovery much good. Every day we tried to run out of school as fast as we could, andJosh came running after us at superhuman speed. Eric attempted to fight back,trying to hit him with his backpack, whereas I tried to talk Josh out ofattacking us. I told him I knew his parents were mean to him, he was in a lot ofpain, and I understood that, because I was too. Every day I had to talk our wayout of being beaten. Josh may have been chasing us to get my counseling each dayas much as anything else—but this was a horrible problem that went on formonths.All through the late fall and into the frosty cold of winter, my teacher, Mr.Empie, made us do something called the Turkey Trot in gym class. We had to runduring the entire class, passing by the military base as we got started. Theidea was that our speed would get better each day. It was very cold, and I hatedit more than anything. I would start coughing uncontrollably and was always deadlast in line, gasping for breath. The kid who always finished first was afleet-footed jock whom some kids called Skeeter, who was also the last manstanding in all of the dodge ball games. He was a true hero to many of theothers, straight through high school, since he was one of our best athletes,even though he was only a little over five feet tall.I quickly learned to avoid getting hit in dodge ball by constantly staying awareof my environment at all times. Every kid who got hit in the head was not payingattention when it happened, and the jocks were specifically watching for that. Iwatched every single kid on the other side like a hawk, and made sure no onecould get me. Eric would deliberately let a slow ball hit him early in the game,turning his back or side into it to make it hurt less—but I refused to go downlike that. Almost every time we played, I would be the last person on one sideand Skeeter would be the last kid on the other. He would hold a ball in one armfor protection while throwing the rest of the balls at me with the other—and allthe kids would get mad at me for surviving so long. It was impossible for me to“kill” him with a ball. Everybody would cheer and clap when Skeeter finally“killed” me, and then the whole ugly cycle would start over again.Empie also made us play a very similar game called “Medic Ball,” in which we hadto pretend we were fighting a war on a battlefield, and the red rubber ballswere now bullets and artillery. I decided that Empie must have been a Vietnamvet and was using us to act out his horrible memories. Once we got hit, we hadto stay down and call out, “Medic! Medic!” until one of the kids with a yellowjersey came over and “rescued” us. The only way a team could win was to “kill”the medics and then “kill” everybody else. When Empie got bored, he would blowthe whistle and point his two index fingers at each other, which he called“opposite sides”—and sometimes he said the words out loud. This meant that thekids on either team could now rush over the middle line, to another line thatgave the losing side only the final third of their space. It was totallydevastating, and mowed the survivors down in seconds—like a huge sickle topplingstalks of wheat. This was usually how Empie helped Skeeter kill me off so theycould start another game. Little did I know that Skeeter would haunt me in mydreams for many years to come.Eric’s behavior got worse and worse. All the bullying was turning him into areal jerk. He started throwing rocks at the bodies of eighteen-wheel trucks aswe crossed Mohawk Avenue, and got Dave to do it, but I refused the peerpressure. He also thought it was really fun to start snowball fights, which Idefinitely did not want. One dark and miserable afternoon, with cold sleetfalling and three inches of slush all over the roads, Eric started a snowballfight with a random kid. He had spiky black hair, a freckled face, and asneering grin. He was clearly a dangerous kid, and he was older than us. As itturned out, even though he was short, he was an excellent baseball pitcher—and apsychopath. The kid found a golf ball–sized piece of rock-solid ice, coated itwith a little snow, and threw it right at my face as hard as he could. He hit meso hard on the forehead above my left eye that he crushed the bone, leaving avisible dent I would discover years later. I had never been hit so hard in mylife, and nearly lost consciousness. I fell to the ground, screaming in agonyand crying profusely. I could taste metal in my mouth. The kid cackled like ahyena and slinked away, victorious. Eric barely even cared that I had beeninjured.On January 28, 1986, my old friend Billy called me up after school one day, eventhough we rarely ever spoke. “The space shuttle blew up,” he said. I rushed overto the television and watched in horror as I saw footage of the Challengerbreaking apart in midair. This was even more devastating because it was aspecial mission for kids, with the teacher Christa McAuliffe on board. Almostimmediately after it happened, everyone started telling a whole series ofhorrible jokes about it, including one in which the weather forecast for Floridaincluded “scattered shuttle.” I quickly realized that people were using thiscruel, sarcastic humor as a way of coping with almost unimaginable pain.Scientific studies have concluded that humor is an evolutionary mechanism. Weconstantly scan our environment and look for mistakes, weaknesses, problems, andfailures. Identifying these issues causes laughter, which rewards us with a hugeflood of endorphins and enkephalins, giving us a significant pain-killing effectand a natural high. This encourages us to continue looking for weaknesses aroundus that can be improved. The obvious problem is that taking pleasure in others’misfortunes lowers our readiness for ascension.The endless bullying had caused me to develop severe depression, which meant mygrades were really going down the toilet. The school kept sending home thesecomputer-printed “progress reports” that had targeted, nasty sentences from theteachers telling your parents exactly how much of a loser you were. Thisessentially caused me to be in trouble with both parents every day, making mylife into even more of a living hell. The report cards came in and my gradeswere just not good enough for them to be satisfied—there were Bs and Cs, withonly a few As. I was also starting to go through puberty, which made me evenmore depressed. Every time my father saw me, he strongly disciplined me about mybad grades—which usually included yelling.HAVE FUNThat summer, Eric and Dave found a huge domed structure hidden in the local biketrails that was made out of tree branches. It was very poorly built, tiedtogether with wires and pieces of old, ripped clothes. It would not do very muchto protect anyone in the event of a rainstorm. A weird little sign on the frontwas made of white and blue straws stapled onto a flat piece of wood, and itspelled out HAVE FUN. There was a dirt floor and a fire pit dug out in thecenter of the dome, which was about fifty feet wide and twenty feet tall.It was obvious that the big kids had built this place to drink alcohol, dodrugs, and have sex, since the HAVE FUN sign had beer-bottle caps on it as wellthat formed the male and female gender symbols. Eric decided that we needed tocompletely destroy this structure, even though it would be extremely dangerousif we got caught. Dave and I begged him not to do it, but he insisted. It tookus about three four-hour days of backbreaking work, in blazing summer sweat, totrash the fort. I was incredibly afraid the whole time we were doing this thatwe would get beaten up or even killed, and worked in complete terror, but Ericdidn’t care and laughed quite a bit as we did it. Somehow we made it out alive.About a week later, I talked Dad and Michael into going to Camp Boyhaven with meon a Boy Scouts trip. We stayed in my cheap three-man dome tent, which was skyblue and barely big enough to hold us. That first night, it started pouringrain, and the tent was absolutely not waterproof. Our sleeping bags werecompletely soaked through. We had to go inside a big tent that was owned by thescouts, where many others were fleeing the rain. The trip was an absolute,horrible disaster—and we never went camping again. The ruin of my own dome tentin the rain appeared to be some sort of “instant karma” for destroying the domedfort the big kids built—even though I was bullied into doing it against my will.By the time I started eighth grade, Shane started sneaking into CorporationsPark, which was a large former military base that had been converted intofactories on the other side of the junior high and high school buildings. Hewould go into buildings that were left unlocked and take things like powerdrills. I was really surprised he was doing this, but he seemed to enjoy thethrill of it. He would run as hard as he could and had become very fast. Hisgrades were very bad that year and he ended up flunking, which proved to be thebest thing that could possibly have happened to him for his social life. Thekids in the grade below us had no idea how everyone else saw him. He took hisamazing running skills and put them to work on the track, turning himself into astar athlete with extreme popularity. I was one of the only people who knew, atfirst, how he got to be so fast. This was the first time I had ever gotten toknow someone as a friend who was engaging in criminal behavior. Shane even stolethings from me later on, including a Metallica CD, but I still forgave him. WhenI asked him why he did it, he said he didn’t think I was listening to itanymore. I struggled for years to understand how the trauma of his childhoodcould have been so severe that he would be okay with hurting his own friends. Idefinitely believed in karma and was shocked that someone would knowingly dothings that would require equally painful, crippling events to happen to themlater on.The bullies in gym class were getting worse and worse, particularly in thelocker room. One kid said he wanted to show me a “super kick.” I told him “nothank you,” but he insisted—and did a full roundhouse kick, which landed in mygut. I nearly went down. A couple other laughing kids then grabbed me and gotthe idea that it would be really hilarious to drag me into the showers andsaturate me with water. I was still holding on to my books and smelled the sharpsourness of locker-room sweat and mold as they carried me by the arms and legs,hovering two feet above the ground. I went limp so they would think I had givenup. They loosened their grip and relaxed, just as I expected they would. Iviolently jerked out of their hands, abandoning my books all over the floor, andI scrambled out of there. I thought for sure they would destroy my books in theshower, but when I came back a few minutes later the books were still there,which seemed like a miracle.That afternoon, I told my mother I absolutely needed to learn how to fight.Things were getting far too dangerous. She had already been encouraging me tofind a self-defense class, and had volunteered to take me and pay for it,because she was genuinely afraid that I might get killed. I went through theyellow pages of the phone book and looked at all the different schools that wereavailable.THE MARTIAL ARTS STUDIOMy gaze was drawn to the wild-eyed face of a tiger with its teeth bared. It wasan ad for a martial arts studio, run by Ronnie LeBlanc. Mom called him up andexplained what had happened to me, and then I got to talk to him myself. He saidthat his school taught you how to survive life-and-death situations, which hecalled street fighting. Most karate classes were teaching “tournament fighting,”which had lots of rules to avoid people getting hurt and was nearly useless inthe situations I was going through. I was sold from this one conversation. WhenDad found out about it, he decided he wanted to take the classes himself, andoffered to pay for it. He started taking Michael and me to these classes twice aweek.Mr. LeBlanc was a five-star black belt in at least three different major typesof martial arts. His wall was lined with plaques showing he had finished firstplace in every martial arts tournament he had ever competed in. We learned howto throw punches and kicks against an eighty-pound bag. This included kickingthe bag up from the bottom and getting it to rise by an entire foot. This causedcrippling pain in my shins that made it hard to walk. The shins eventuallybecame extremely strong due to “bone conditioning,” in which micro-fracturesheal stronger than ever. We had to block hard punches, which created boneconditioning in my wrists. We were also taught how to break every imaginabletype of hold that someone could put you into. There would never be a “whitewash” again. I could slam a bully in three different places and greatly injurehim before he ever had the chance to knock me down.Most important, we were going to learn how to go into a state called “Spirit,”in which your body becomes impervious to physical pain. Even if you get a brokenbone or a huge, bloody gash, you will still be able to finish the fight. One guyin the studio had had his stomach kicked open by a biker wearing a steel-toedboot. His intestine was hanging down like a jump rope, which he didn’t evenrealize until the fight was over. He still managed to finish the battle andescape with his life.In order to develop Spirit, we had to learn something called “The Form,” whichwas a series of movements from the Pangai-noon kung fu style we were studying.They based it all on three animals: the tiger, the crane, and the dragon. Thestory was that at least two thousand years ago, the ancient Chinese studied fiveanimals—the tiger, crane, dragon, bear, and snake—to see how they fought. Thebear and snake were not used in our style. The tiger used “hard” techniques likepunches and kicks—with lots of power but limited accuracy. The crane wouldcoordinate its “hands” and feet to sweep out the legs of its opponent and makecombined attacks. The dragon supposedly used “soft” techniques, in which you hadto hit certain points with extreme accuracy, but the techniques were sodevastating they didn’t require very much force. We would first start learningthe tiger form. As we advanced through the sashes, not belts, we would then bescheduled to learn the crane and dragon forms.Mr. LeBlanc taught us that bullies do not want to feel pain, and will only goafter the “easy kill” whom they can completely dominate with fear. If you fightback and hurt them, then even if you lose the fight, they will almost never wantto try again. He also explained that even big, intimidating biker dudes inleather and chains will cry like little children if they take a really goodstrike or get put into submission with a crippling joint lock. The goal of ourtraining was to devastate the opponent in three seconds or less, and then run.It was only meant to be used in life-threatening situations. We also were taughttechniques that could kill an attacker with our bare hands in one strike, whichI will not reveal here. We were told never to hit someone in a real fight excepton one of the “targets,” which removes the ability of his body to continuefighting by interrupting the activity of the nervous system. Cops have shot athree-inch-wide hole through the chest of someone on drugs like PCP only to bekilled by that person in the several seconds before he died. If you hit such anattacker on one of the targets, however, he will go down.We had extensive coaching on the legalities of fighting, and were told that ifyou killed someone, or even hurt them badly, you had to have absolute proof thatthey had presented you with an equally severe threat. Mr. LeBlanc also said thateven if you were in the right, and had eyewitness proof, you might still end upgoing to jail—but that is better than being killed. Still, the best strategy wasto go into Spirit, strike the attacker in at least one of the targets, and runaway in three seconds or less. Mr. LeBlanc had been in so many life-threateningsituations that he couldn’t watch movies, because he couldn’t stand seeingfights that went on and on. His blood would start pumping, time would slow down,his vision would narrow into a cone in front of him, and he would becomehyperaware. This was all part of what was supposed to happen to you when yousuccessfully went into Spirit—and it is exhausting and very intense.Within a few months we started doing the Form in a style called “Form withMechanics,” in which we focused on doing the movements very slowly and veryprecisely—like a meditation. This led to “Form with Speed,” in which we startedpracticing the same sequence much faster, and with power behind each of themovements. Just a few weeks later we started doing “Form with Spirit.” I wastaught to lock my abdominal muscles down into a wall, so even if I took aperfect punch to the solar plexus, I would not go down. It was extremelyfrightening to see someone go into Form with Spirit correctly, as the techniquewas based on the wild, snarling rage that animals would go into in a fight tothe death—particularly tigers. You ended up making the same facial expression asthe wide-eyed, ferocious tiger in the school’s logo, and the roaring sounds thatemerged were extremely fearsome. Just seeing and hearing this would make no oneever want to fight you.Mr. LeBlanc explained that you were never supposed to be angry while you didthis, despite how it looked. It was the “Spirit of Protectiveness,” intended tosave your own life and the lives of those you love. It naturally happens toanimals so they will have a better chance of surviving a fight to the death,even if they have been seriously injured. Most people never reach this stateeven in a terrible fight, due to how we are programmed to be afraid and to avoidpain. If someone does manage to achieve this state of consciousness, it isusually a blind rage of total wildness, in which the person is unable to move orstrategize effectively. Typically they will shake so much that they can be veryeasily knocked over and defeated. We were taught to enter into this state in asplit second, lock down into our stance, and have complete control and awarenessof our environment once we were in it. Everything went into slow motion, whichmade three seconds seem like plenty of time to finish the fight.I strongly disliked doing it, but he was right—I would feel time slow down to acrawl, I would have the feeling of Kool-Aid running through my veins, and Iwould become hyperaware of the world around me—almost super-aware. Even though Ilooked and sounded extremely frightening, the goal was to be completely incontrol of the experience. The speed and precision of the movements I did inForm with Spirit made me very fast, tremendously improving my dexterity. Just asMr. LeBlanc had said, it became painful to watch movie fights because of howslow they were. I cringed in The Matrix when Morpheus told Neo, “You’re fasterthan this,” and they continued moving like they were trapped in molasses. CGIwas used to make Neo’s arms appear to move faster in one scene, but at theshoulders, where it really mattered, it was still slow. This training alsohelped me develop the ability to play blistering-fast drum solos by the time Igraduated college with a jazz minor.I did feel something like an extreme runner’s high from doing Form with Spirit,and afterward I would be exhausted—but we continued practicing the technique. Wewere also told it was extremely important never to tell anyone that we knew Formwith Spirit, as people would invariably ask you to spar with them. In oursystem, everything involved devastating the opponent in as little as one strike.The goal is to completely shut down the normal functioning of the opponent’sbody. This meant I had to be very careful in a typical school fight, so I couldavoid seriously damaging or even killing someone. The reason I am sharing thiswith you now is I feel it is very important to learn self-defense. I was able towalk fearlessly in any area and know I could take care of myself in anysituation. I realized that fear was a “nudge” that could be greatly reduced, ifnot eliminated with meditation. My out-of-body experience had convinced me ofthe reality of life after death, and therefore I didn’t even have to fear asituation where I might get killed. I would always exist. This trainingultimately gave me the courage to step into the front lines of the battle we areall facing against a global villain who wishes to kill billions of people.FIGHTING BACKMy next fight happened very early in the training, before I even startedlearning Form with Spirit. A skinny kid with long brown hair and crooked teethcame up to me in a classroom when only a few others were there. He startedinsulting my weight with curse words, while laughing and smiling. He wasabsolutely surprised when I suddenly rushed him. I grabbed him by both shouldersand roared like a lion as I slammed his body through about seven desks. His backhit the wall—hard. I had just rearranged an entire quarter of the room, clumpingall the desks together into a cluster on either side of my path. The impactpartially knocked the wind out of him. I kept him pinned there and looked at himwith the eyes of a murderous tiger, letting him know if he did anything else Icould tear him to pieces. He was totally shocked, sucking wind in wide-eyedterror, and he backed off. I let him go and he never tried to bully me again.The word quickly got around that something had changed, and the number ofbullying episodes immediately went way down.By the time I had my next fight, I had been doing lots of work on a techniquecalled “close-quarters fighting,” or “sticky wrists.” The idea was to invade theopponent’s space, so you were only a foot away from his face. This would makehim uncomfortable and he would try to back up to hit you, which would be hisdownfall. You kept both your wrists against his wrists, so you always knew wherehis hands were going. Then we were taught all these fluid movements that wouldallow us to block his hands while still being able to get strikes in at everyopportunity. It was like a martial arts chess game, and a successful punchusually involved curving around one of his arms. We practiced this for longperiods of time at a slow speed; the idea was that it would come naturally byinstinct once you needed it—and would be happening at a much greater velocity.This jock kid, Steve, thought it would be funny to try to slap me outside thegym one day, after he had repeatedly tried to check me pretty hard in the classwith his lacrosse stick. I wasn’t even afraid of him. I started smiling as Ieffortlessly blocked every strike he tried to throw, while repeatedly tappinghim very lightly in the forehead with my fingers, again and again, with both myleft and right hands. By doing this, I let him know I could have completelydevastated him. Other kids saw this and started laughing. I was at least twiceas fast as he was, and he didn’t stand a chance. I laughed like a sarcasticbully as he got more and more upset, and it broke my concentration. He backed upand got one really good slap in on my left cheek—hitting me in the face so hardthat he left red fingermarks. I shoved him back, causing him to tumblehelplessly to the ground. “Don’t ever do that again.” He never did. In fact, hedecided it was a lot safer to be nice to me, and even joked around with me afterthat—but he did knock me over badly in a lacrosse game two years later. Therewas always a payback. Not only did you have karma to worry about, you had thepeople themselves—and their friends."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTTHE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOULThe last time I ever went on a Boy Scouts trip was shortly after that fight.They took us to Plattsburgh Air Force Base, and we stayed in the same barracksand toured all the same buildings we would have seen if we had been recruited ordrafted. My father had warned me severely against joining the military, as adrill sergeant had once told him, “Once you sign on the line, your ass is mine.”We were already wearing military-style uniforms and going through training thatwould increase our rank, giving us visible badges to wear. Boy Scouts was agateway drug to the military—and there was something extremely haunting andterrifying about the base. I still had enough ESP to sense clearly the stench ofdeath everywhere. The men who stayed there feared for their lives and wereextremely depressed about having to leave their homes, friends, and family.About a week later, I went to Kevin’s house, and we decided we were going to setup his tent and camp in the backyard. He insisted that we bring everything outin one trip, and it was exhausting. I tried to help him, but I didn’t understandhow his tent worked. “Go away, David. You don’t know what the hell you’redoing.” I went over to his hammock, fearlessly threw myself into it, and wasfinally able to lie down, after multiple failed attempts on previous visits whenmy fear had compromised me. Now he was working and I was kicking back. He triedto get his dog, Excalibur, to charge me and knock me down, but it didn’t work.“Get off your lazy ass and come help me with this thing!” I did get out, butthen I took plenty of time to clean off the leaves I had left there. I did notlike his abusive attitude at all.Suddenly I heard a whooshing noise behind me. I turned my head and saw a briefflash of silver and light. WHAM! Something hit me in the head—very, very hard.This time it was on the left, right around my ear. The pain wasunimaginable—even worse than the ice rock. The outside edge of my ear was inabsolute agony—as if it was being stabbed with a knife and burned with white-hotfire at the same time. I instinctively grabbed it and started running around hisyard, screaming. He laughed and got Excalibur to chase me: “Go get him, girl!”This collie, who looked just like the TV dog Lassie, was happy to run behind me.When I continued screaming and crying, he started calling me a pussy and sayingnothing had happened, I was fine, and I should shut up. I collapsed on theground and Excalibur started licking my hand, causing huge and disgusting soundsto echo in my ear. I pulled my hand away and it was completely covered in red,top to bottom. You couldn’t see any skin. My white shirt was also splatteredwith red drops everywhere. I was utterly horrified that this vampire dog wasdrinking my blood. It took many years for me to realize that she was trying tohelp save my life by cleaning and sealing the wound.Kevin ran up, saw the blood, and started chanting, “Oh my God, oh my God,” as herushed me into the house. He then made me stay alone in the bathroom with thedoor closed while he called his parents and asked them what to do. He said theyhad an HMO and they could help me. He told me not to look at myself in themirror, and opened out the cabinet doors so they were facing the wall. Then heleft. My skull and my ear were throbbing in unimaginable pain, which made thesmell of the mouthwash, old soap, and mildew in the bathroom much worse. After afew minutes of standing there listening to him freak out behind a closed door, Isoberly turned the mirror toward myself. A perfectly circular ring had beencarved through the flesh and cartilage on the rim of my ear.I did not cry. It was actually a very clear moment. This had happened to me. Itwas real. I had sustained an injury but I was alive and I would be fine. Kevinhad obviously thrown an aluminum tent pole at me because he didn’t feel I wasmoving fast enough to help him. This was another case of “too much revenge”—andnow his ridiculous bullying had failed miserably. His parents told him their HMOcouldn’t do anything for me, and I should call my mother and have her come getme. I told her Kevin had “thrown a tent pole into my ear,” and she thought ithad actually gone down my ear canal, so she was very relieved when she saw itwas only a round circle on the edge. We loaded my bike in the car, went home,and put a gauze bandage on my ear, but for the next three days it swelledhorribly, was extremely painful, and turned a dark bluish-black all over.When Dad found out what had happened, and that we hadn’t told him up until then,he was furious. He rushed me over to a plastic surgeon’s office on Union Streetin Schenectady. I was told that most of the pole had chopped straight through myear from one side to the other like a cookie cutter. The entire round piece inthe middle had enough blood flow to stay alive, but it could easily die—in whichcase he would have to reconstruct it with cartilage and skin grafts from otherparts of my body. I needed surgery ASAP, and I was booked to go back again twodays later. In surgery, I lay there on the operating table like a wounded animaland shuddered in shock as the surgeon injected my ear in multiple places withNovocain—but I did not cry. Each time he pushed the needle in, I could feel itpop-pop-popping through multiple layers of skin and cartilage, and it wasunbelievably painful. At this point all he could do was cut off the extra scartissue of cartilage that had formed around the wound. He also concluded themiddle piece was probably going to live.He told me I needed to massage the scar as much as I could, no matter howpainful it was, because otherwise the swelling could get really bad. He alsotold me I would need to wear a gauze bandage over it at all times for at least amonth, and that if anyone hit me there I might need surgery again. This was afield day for all the kids who hated me at school. I now had a greatvulnerability and a delicious new target for their bullying in addition to myincreasing weight. Everyone started calling me “Vincent Van Gogh” and “Vinnie.”I had kids crying “Vinnie” with joy from all the way down a long hallwaywhenever they saw me. I didn’t dare try to fight anyone, because if they hit meon the ear, they could force me right back into surgery—and it would hurt somuch I would be physically devastated. At one point someone new asked me whatthe heck had happened to my ear, and wondered if I had fallen off my bike. Thekid I had tapped on the forehead said, “Kevin threw a driveway at him.” Everyoneexploded into laughter at his lame joke, since they all knew the story.The whole area was red and swollen like a cherry tomato after the injury firsthappened. I kept the bandage on my ear for at least two months so the kidscouldn’t see it. Thankfully, the little round piece in the middle survived, butI decided that I was not going to cut my hair, at least not until it became longenough that it could completely cover my ear. Dad got a lawyer and we threatenedto file a lawsuit against Kevin and his family’s health insurance company. SinceKevin’s parents would scream at him if he got anything less than a ninety-five,they were absolutely disgusted with me for going after their “perfect” son.Our lawyer was a snarky old Jewish lady with stacks of papers all over her deskand office. A few shards of light tore through the old wooden blinds, revealingall the hanging dust grains and helping to fight the pale fluorescent lightingin the room. No matter what question I tried to ask her about strategy, she keptrepeating, “The less you say, the better” in a strong accent. This did make memad, but it was obviously the one and only thing she was going to tell me to do.My meeting with the insurance claims adjuster was scheduled to occur at Kevin’shouse, which was horrible. Dad went with me and reminded me of what the old ladyhad said. The adjuster had wet, curly blond hair, thousands of gleaming-whiteteeth, an athletic build, tanned skin, and a flawless suit. Kevin’s parentsglared at me with absolute, seething hatred as I answered every single questionMr. Smiles, the adjuster, asked me with as few words as possible—if not singlewords. Everyone knew what I was up to, but Smiles couldn’t do anything about it.He couldn’t catch me. The insurance company paid my medical bills and gave me a$2,000 settlement, which Dad invested into a CD that wouldn’t mature until I wasin college. This was another one of the great traumas of my life. I had to faceoff against one of my best friends and all I got out of it was a small amount ofmoney that I would never see until I was far too old for it to matter. Myparents didn’t have to pay my medical bills, but I lost my best friend in theprocess. Kevin never spoke to me again. I felt no satisfaction in fighting and“winning” that battle. Kevin did have negative behaviors, but he may have becomea better friend if I hadn’t threatened his family with a lawsuit. The greatspiritual teachings tell us that forgiveness stops the wheel of karma—preventingthe same cycles of joy and disaster from perpetually reappearing in our liveswith new sets and characters. The balance between forgiveness andself-protection is one of the great “gray areas” in the ascension path, ripe forendless amounts of contemplation and study.THE IRAN-CONTRA HEARINGSIn the summer of 1987, things got totally bizarre when the Iran-Contra hearingsbegan airing on television as of June 30. I was a fourteen-year-old kid stillliving under constant threat of nuclear war with the USSR, even though they weremaking moves toward peace, including glasnost and perestroika. Here wasLieutenant Colonel Oliver North on national television, openly admitting that hewas involved in financially supporting a cocaine-dealing terrorist group out ofNicaragua called the Contras. Even worse, he was secretly selling weapons toIran, despite it being illegal under US law, since they were considered aterrorist dictatorship. North was instructed to use the Iranian blood money tofund and train the terrorist Contras. This was also illegal under US law. Theadministration hoped that the Contras would fight a guerilla war to topple theSoviet-friendly government in Nicaragua at the time, run by a group called theSandinistas. Apparently, when we were supposed to like a group of terrorists,the media called them “militants” or “rebels,” and that somehow made theiractions okay. Examples of US-supported “rebels” were Bin Laden and the Taliban,back when the Soviets held Afghanistan. A senate hearing in March 1985 revealedevidence that the Contras were in fact terrorists. The International HumanRights Law Group, which gathered 145 sworn statements from twenty-eighteyewitnesses, said, “The documentation shows a pattern of brutality againstlargely unarmed civilians, including rape, torture, kidnappings, mutilation, andother abuses.”24 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber23] During this same time,President Ronald Reagan had referred to the Contras as “the moral equivalent ofthe Founding Fathers.”25 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber24]This scandal was investigated by the US Congress as well as a three-person teamappointed by President Reagan called the Tower Commission. Reagan seemed justlike Mr. Smiles when he got on television, shrugged his shoulders, and said heknew nothing about it, but he understood that his guys were just trying to dotheir part to fight the evil Soviet Union and protect us from nuclear war. Iassumed that Ollie North had been severely bullied, since I knew what thatlooked like. I intuitively felt that they had threatened to rape, torture, andmurder his entire family tree if he didn’t take the fall, blame it all onhimself, and say that it was his idea. Years later, insiders would tell me thatthis happens constantly in the Cabal. Anyone who steps out of line is threatenedwith extreme torture and death for their entire family tree. This is part of howthe Cabal has been able to maintain power for so long. It is difficult fornewcomers to truly understand just how evil this group really is. Reagan andVice President George H. W. Bush were cleared of any and all charges, eventhough handwritten notes from Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on December 7,1985, showed that Reagan knew that arms were being sold to Iran in exchange forthe release of seven American hostages held in Lebanon.Only five individuals were charged for supporting the Nicaraguan terrorists, butthose charges were conveniently dropped after the administration refused todeclassify the documents that proved them, due to “national security.” I sensedthere were some good guys in the Pentagon who were fighting for us, knew whatthese documents contained, and thought they could stop the threat of nuclear warby bringing down the whole administration—but it didn’t work. It would be manyyears before I came into direct contact with people working for this secretalliance.Fourteen officials were ultimately indicted for lesser charges, and the trail ofcorruption went all the way up to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. Eleven ofthese men were convicted. Some filed appeals and got away with it. I was amazedthat George H. W. Bush won the election in 1988, just a year after thisworse-than-Watergate scandal. All Nixon did was bug the offices of theDemocrats. The Reagan administration was caught actively financing, arming, andtraining two different groups of terrorists. Everyone who had been indicted orconvicted was pardoned in the final days of George H. W. Bush’s four-yearpresidency, once it was already too late for anyone to stop him.26[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber25]I decided that if the government could hide or destroy documents and avoidgetting punished, then so could I. Every day I started checking the mail as soonas I came home from school. The dreaded progress reports came in a predictablecomputer-printed envelope with all-capital letters in the window. I was now amaster of mixing up blazing KNO3 and sugar mixtures on the backyard patio, aswell as lighting firecrackers under an old shot glass—which caused the glass torocket up into the air, thanks to the potato-gun effect. I burned those evilprogress reports to a crisp and crushed the ashes. It was a matter of “nationalsecurity.” Now the only thing I had to worry about was the report cards, whichthreatened my administration with criminal charges, indictment, trade sanctions,and an embargo that cut off all my supply lines—and kept me confined in mybedroom prison cell. I was starting to engage in “repetitioncompulsion”—mirroring the negativity I was seeing in the world with my ownthoughts and actions. It took many years to identify this subconscious processand identify how it was working at this time in my childhood.THE FINAL FOUR ROUNDSIn the fall of 1987, I started high school, which was just as terrible as goinginto junior high—if not worse. Now there were three more grades of kids who wereolder than me. I was getting more and more overweight, topping out with 225pounds at five feet nine inches. I had a big belly that some people called a“spare tire,” as well as the equally hideous “man boobs.” If I pulled my lowerjaw in toward my neck, it formed a nasty double chin. Everyone asked me if I hadseen the pool on the third floor—but there was no third floor. This was atypical stunt to harass freshmen on their first day.More and more at this time, MTV was featuring bands with openly satanic imagery,including upside-down pentagrams, demons, and the like. I was surprised thatthis was being so openly promoted, but I had also discovered that this musichelped me release anger and feel better. I would get a cathartic high fromlistening to it, much like Dr. van der Kolk’s soldiers with PTSD who watched awar movie and experienced a high equivalent to shooting eight milligrams ofmorphine. I started wearing nothing but black rock-and-roll T-shirts that Dadwas buying me for twenty bucks each at some of the concerts we went to. My hairwas long enough that I didn’t need to wear the gauze on my ear anymore, and Iwas quickly starting to look like a “metal head.”I felt like I had no friends. Shane had flunked eighth grade and didn’t make itto high school with the rest of us. Eric and Dave were part of a small group Icalled the “geek clan,” and the only thing we had in common was that everyoneelse hated us. Now I could win any fight that someone tried to start, but thatdidn’t mean anyone liked me—so I was miserable. I started drawing weird anddisturbing sketches of suicide, where I killed myself in extremely bizarre,creative, and grandiose ways. I knew I would never actually do it, but Ihonestly felt like I had nothing to live for. I was now mirroring the collectivetrauma of the nuclear “suicide cult” that America had become. School was anightmare. I kept getting bigger and bigger, my skin was a mess, and I wasconstantly depressed.THE SOLDIER OF FORTUNEOn the first day of high school, a new kid showed up whom we will call Don. Hewas chubby like me, had wavy light-brown hair, pale skin, and freckles, and worelarge glasses with a double-bar frame over the top. The bullies in his oldschool had called him Froggy. He was sitting with his head down on the desk nextto me as if he had passed out, which was quite surprising. I could hardlybelieve my eyes when Eric walked in and pounded his fist on this new kid’s desk,causing him to bolt up and start cursing at him as if they knew each other. Istarted talking to Don and found out that he had stayed every summer at the campEric’s family owned, so they knew each other very well. He seemed to be a friendof Eric’s, in a sense, but Eric was just as arrogant and dominant toward him ashe was toward me. We became best friends almost instantaneously, and bonded overour deep mutual hatred of Eric. Sometimes we called him Erico, like he was agangster.I quickly found out that Don was very interested in ninjas, weapons, and themilitary. He subscribed to Soldier of Fortune magazine, which he called SOF, andfantasized over all the pictures of throwing stars, darts, swords, switchblades,nunchaku or “nunchucks,” and various guns and bullets. He was particularlyobsessed with a completely illegal spring-loaded weapon called an “angel blade,”where you hit a button and the knife popped straight out. He talked about howyou could file the nut down and the blade would shoot out of the housing like abullet. He had constant fantasies of violent revenge against the kids who hadbullied him just as badly as they had me. I let him know if he wounded or killedanyone, it would destroy his life. I spent months explaining to him what hadhappened to my father in Vietnam, and strongly encouraged him not to sign up forthe military as he could very easily get killed. Still, we spent countless hourskilling bad guys in games like Rush’n Attack for the new Nintendo EntertainmentSystem, which was much more addictive than Atari. We started walking to hishouse together after school with Eric, Dave, and another kid in our “geek clan”who also lived nearby.Teenagers Who Are Going to Burn in the Lake of Fire ForeverThe other kid I met that year was Jude Goldman, who was in a grade above me.They mixed grades in gym class, so you had two years’ worth of kids who had towork together. Jude was just as weird, creative, and intelligent as I was, withwild brownish-black hair that was long on top and short on the sides. He dyedpart of his mane to make it a blondish-brown color. He was short and thin, hadround Lennon glasses, full facial stubble, and a deep voice. Women invariablyfound him attractive. He rode a skateboard, wore strange and funky clothes,played music, and somehow had managed to stay cool in his grade. He had a veryfast and witty sense of humor that I could keep up with. He started out byteasing me in gym class like everyone else did, but the more we bantered, themore he realized that we had more in common than anyone else in school. Heeventually gave me a tape of the music he had been making at home, which hecalled Organized Noise.I found out that his mother was an ex-hippie and minor movie star who had joineda commune, only to leave it in disgust and convert to become an extremefundamentalist Christian. As a result, Jude hated everything having to do withthe hippie music and culture—but we were still great friends. His mother playedtaped sermons from her preacher nonstop, all day and all night. This guy had alaughably extreme southern accent, even greater than what George W. Bush soundedlike, and was quite a character—the most exaggerated stereotype of afire-and-brimstone Bible-thumper imaginable. Rapture was about to cause hisflock to soar into the air at any moment, while everyone else was doomed toroast in eternal hellfire. We smuggled out a tape and my favorite passage was:“Young people—you’ve watched them—walking into a Christless hell. I’m talkingabout teenagers that are going to burn in the lake of fire forever. You can’thelp them, but you can start praying for them—and get the burden and the griefof their loss to your gain.” His other classic quotable line was, “He’s gonnatake a group of people, not everyone, not everyone, ’cause you’re not gonna makeit.”Jude’s mom constantly yelled at him over the most ridiculously minor things. Hewasn’t allowed to listen to any music that wasn’t 100 percent born-againChristian, and nothing could interrupt the nonstop twenty-four-hour loop ofsermons—so the entire area underneath his mattress was lined with hidden tapesof all his favorite bands. She once found his copy of Prince’s album Dirty Mind,which led to an “emergency meeting” with her church elders. They told Jude hecould never listen to any of Prince’s music again or he would become gay. Afterthat incident, he got much better at hiding his music, and his mother neveragain discovered his precious contraband. His grandparents had enough money tobuy him an Alesis Midiverb, which allowed him to put an echo on instruments andvoices, along with a multitrack tape-cassette recorder and a Casio SK-1 samplingkeyboard. He had bad allergies, and every time he took his medicine his mind gotweird and spacey. This was when he wrote the Organized Noise music. Despiteusing a dirt-cheap keyboard with terrible sounds, he still managed to do somevery unique, interesting, and bizarre stuff. The sampler was the key. Any soundshe could find could be looped and turned into music.The summer of 1988 brought an end to my freshman year, and I was still quitedepressed. I was playing drums more and more, and Jude and I were talking aboutstarting a band since he had a cheap knockoff Paul McCartney–style bass that hehad painted all sorts of words and images onto, including his name. He wasself-taught on the bass and the keyboard and could do enough to get by on eitherinstrument.One of the concerts I went to that summer was Dokken, where I saw the very drunklead singer backstage being surrounded by a crowd of about eleven incredibly hotwomen in miniskirts. From my perspective, any one of them would be a keeper forlife—and everywhere he went, they followed, like baby chicks. He was sayingreally silly things that weren’t very funny, but every time he made even theweakest attempt at humor, they exploded into giggles as if he was hilarious. Healso got huge points for playing Led Zeppelin on the stereo system.Once again, I was seeing the same story. Rock stars were just ordinary peoplewho worked hard, learned how to sing or play an instrument, started a band,wrote some decent songs, got signed, and ended up making the record label enoughmoney that they went on tour. The tours would just about kill these guys. Almostevery band I ever met was extremely exhausted, constantly fighting not to getsick, and prisoners of the tour bus. All the cities just blended together andthe idea of going home seemed like an impossible dream. Tours could go on for anentire year, with dates every two or three nights and no vacations—ending withjust enough time to record another album and repeat the process. Bon Jovicaptured this dilemma perfectly in their classic tune “Wanted Dead or Alive”—andtwo or three times a month I witnessed what guys like this were going throughfirsthand. Even though it was obviously a very hard life, I would have been morethan happy to get my own chance at suffering with unstoppable female attentionand screaming crowds every other night. It didn’t matter what you looked like.Once you were up on that stage, you were in.This was the promise of glory that we were all taught to aspire to by the media.Like addicts, many of us lust for the high of fame and recognition, which hasbecome more of an issue now than ever with the rise of social media. Yet, everytime I met the people who had “made it,” they were totally miserable. Iultimately coined the term “Elvis-Marilyn Syndrome” to describe this. Elvis andMarilyn were two of the greatest celebrities of the twentieth century, known bytheir first names. Yet they both died alone, drug addicted and miserable. I havespoken to various well-known film actors since moving to Los Angeles, and theyall have said that they are treated very disrespectfully by the upper-levelbosses in Hollywood, even when they are succeeding. As soon as one of theirfilms doesn’t sell well, they get dumped—and former celebrities often refer tothemselves as “veterans.” Many famous musicians told me the same story.Recognizing the illusion of celebrity and the truth of Elvis-Marilyn Syndrome,and learning to be at peace with who you are, is a key element of the ascensionprocess. You ultimately have to choose to be happy no matter how many goals andsuccesses you seem to have achieved—and a life of simplicity can be far morerewarding than the constant chaos involved in being a public figure.OUT OF CONTROLThat same summer of 1988, Dad took Michael and me on a trip to Lake George forhis friend Rick Siciliano’s birthday. Rick was the drummer and lead singer inthe Out of Control rhythm and blues band, a local group, and was also aprofessional photographer. He was big, tall, and fairly muscular, had bulgy,animated eyes, and was by far the funniest, wittiest, and most sarcastic personI had ever met. It was impossible to keep up with him; sometimes he would saythings that made me feel terrible until I couldn’t help but explode intolaughter along with everybody else. We all drove up in Rick’s weird-smellinggreen van, and when we were already in the Adirondacks, he brushed his teeth inthe driver’s seat. He tried to spit the toothpaste out the window while goingsixty-five miles an hour. The toothpaste flew all over the side of his van inlong white streaks, and he made a huge joke out of it. You were constantlylaughing until your stomach hurt around Rick.Rick’s first birthday cake was chocolate, with no candles, and Dad shoved it inRick’s face. Everyone roared with laughter, including Rick, who milked it forall it was worth. The second cake was larger and had white frosting withcandles. After Rick got cleaned up, we all went out into his sailboat on thelake—and disaster struck. Clouds rolled in. The wind howled. Lightning crashedand the rain was cutting us apart. In a horrific groan, the normal upright angleof the boat tilted and was now listing very badly, lying nearly sideways on thewater. Dad and Rick had Michael and me hide in the cabin so we were less likelyto get washed away—but that didn’t help us very much.Michael and I were standing on what was supposed to be the sidewall, and wecould look down and see water in the windows that would normally be at eyelevel. For at least fifteen minutes, I absolutely believed we were about to die.We were screaming and crying in terror. We kept looking at each other andthinking we were only seconds from having water explode into the cabin. Even ifwe managed to survive the sinking of the boat with our life jackets, the watermight be cold enough to kill us from hypothermia—and we were much too far fromthe shore to swim back. I reached a supreme moment of clarity, even in the midstof screaming—and realized that I definitely did not want to leave this world. Inthat moment, I prayed to God to save my life, I apologized for the wrongs I haddone and begged for another chance—even though I did not consider myself aChristian. In that sudden instant when you believe you are about to die, it isamazing how quickly you go back to the basics. As soon as I surrendered and madethat request from deep within myself, things changed. Somehow they managed toget the boat upright, and we limped back to shore. I was shattered from nervesand adrenaline, but I definitely noticed the synchronistic timing between myprayer and the solving of the problem. Dad said we had been in much greaterdanger of being struck by lightning than of sinking. The whole thing wasincredibly traumatic for all of us.THIS IS MY SONAs I entered tenth grade in 1998, I decided I wanted to get a class ring, andpicked out a silver-colored choice with a blue aquamarine stone. We had to go tothe local jewelry store to place the order. My hair had become so long by thispoint that the old woman asked my mother what kind of ring her “daughter”wanted. Mom said, “This is my son,” and the whole thing was incredibly awkward.It only caused me to feel even more traumatized and drawn into myself.Luckily, I was struck with amazingly good fortune by ending up in the samechemistry class as Jude, with Mr. Olson as our teacher. We sat right next toeach other, and this was where the great majority of our friendship in highschool actually played out, other than in the lunch room. I ended up having avery hard time with chemistry class, because I could not visualize littleparticles whirling around a nucleus. Normally when I was tapping into ascientific truth, my ESP would kick in with visions of what something lookedlike—but with the chemistry models they were trying to teach me, I drew acomplete blank. It would be many years before I discovered the scientific proofto back up what I did see, which was the lattices of sacred geometry. Over thecourse of a year, I ended up failing the class—I would have to go to summerschool, which was something I never even imagined was possible. Kevin’s parentscouldn’t handle less than a ninety-five. He and I were of comparableintelligence. Failing a class and attending summer school, particularly with howstrict my parents were about good grades, was literally unthinkable—but ithappened.THE SALEM WITCH TRIALS REVISITEDShortly after the school year started, while it was still fairly warm outside,my tenth-grade Honors English class went on an all-day field trip to Salem,Massachusetts. We visited the very place where all the events of The ScarletLetter had occurred; we had read the book in class. The original buildings wherewomen were tortured and executed for witchcraft were still standing. I touchedthe gnarled wood of ducking tanks in which people were put to death by drowningby religious fanatics. I realized that this sort of bullying was still going ontoday, and I was a victim of it myself—though, thankfully, I hadn’t died. Thewhole place radiated with the evil of what had been done—all in the name of God.We were all thrown in together on the long bus ride, and I ended up talking tothe ultimate girl of my dreams, whom we will call Brenda Fisher. She seemed socompletely out of my league that it was ridiculous to even talk to her, but Iwas immensely attracted to her for her sharp wit, her sarcastic sense of humor,and her incredible ability to stand up to the teacher and anyone else who stoodin her way. She definitely appeared to be the most powerful woman in my grade.If anyone had tried to put her on trial for being a witch, she would have tornthem to pieces. I had studied palm reading ever since junior high school, thanksto reading the book Palmistry by Edith Niles, and was able to tell her severalthings about herself that were very accurate. Most people think the lines on thehand are fairly random, but I have cross-checked the data in the book onhundreds of different hands over the years and found it to be remarkably precisein describing the individual’s character, personality, and future. The Salemtrip only confirmed that Brenda was “the one.”SOMEONE IS HIDING IN THERENot long after I got back from Salem, a female student teacher from one of myclasses ran into me in the hallway over by the auditorium. She was disarminglyattractive. For some strange reason, she stopped me in the hallway, gazed intomy eyes without speaking for a minute, took a sudden breath, and then said, “Youhave unusually beautiful eyes.”She then went on to insult me: “There is a beautiful man hiding inside all thatweight and hair, and you should let him come out.” She paused as the seismicwave of shock rippled through me from what she had just said. Then she touchedme on the arm and gave me a million-dollar smile that could melt steel.Admittedly, I was dumbstruck that she would make such a brazen statement, butinstead of getting angry or defensive, I soberly thanked her for the compliment.I soon started having sudden flashes when I looked into the mirror of what myface would look like without the hair and the weight—essentially the way I looknow. Within less than six months I started a rigorous diet that I did not stopuntil I had lost eighty-five pounds.Brad ended up sitting next to me in my tenth-grade French class. He knew mymother had visited a hippie commune called Totem, and I had shown him a big bagof Totem weed hiding in the basement freezer. I now had the complete look andfeel of a pot-smoking fifteen-year-old—the long hair, the black rock-and-rollT-shirts, and the “don’t mess with me” attitude. Brad rekindled our friendshipfor the third time, and every day he relentlessly pressured me to try weed. Hetold me it would set me free and it would be the greatest I had ever felt in mylife. I made the mistake of telling him how fascinated I was by Brenda Fisher. Ihad no idea that he had already made out with her at a party, and possibly morethan that, but he had since dumped her. He reconnected with her, and then toldme the impossible: “Brenda wants to hang out with you. With us. Both of us!” Hewatched as disbelief flickered over my face for several seconds. Then hecontinued by saying, “As long as she gets to smoke some of your mom’s Totem weedwith us. She thinks that would be totally amazing—and hopes you will say yes.”I felt like I was falling into a bottomless pit. I asked him if she would stillwant to hang out with us if we didn’t do drugs—and he said no. Although it was acommon thing for rock-and-rollers to smoke weed, I was just fifteen years old.It was illegal, and at that time no one talked about it having any medical uses.The attitude around it was vastly more suppressive than we see today. In healthclass we were taught that marijuana was extremely destructive—and no one dreamedof taking on all those symptoms voluntarily. It took me almost half a minute ofgaping silence, my mind running thousands of desperate calculations, before Itold Brad I needed twenty-four hours to give him an answer. He just smiled. Iwas the delicious white rabbit that had stepped perfectly into his snare. It wasalready too late.The glow of the pipe lit up Brenda’s stunningly gorgeous face as we shivered inthe cold under the pine tree in late October. She had stolen a metal screen fromher jewelry class. Brad had stolen some copper pipe parts from his mother’sbasement and fashioned a crude but effective pipe out of them, wrapping thewhole thing up in duct tape. A yellow electrical cap with a hole at the endbecame the mouthpiece. Everything seemed to be pulsing with light and geometricpatterns. I was incredibly high, and the only thing I could compare it to wasthe feeling of opening presents on Christmas when I was a kid. Having Brendathere made it the greatest moment of my young adult life by far. She gave me apiece of Wrigley’s Doublemint gum, and—my God!—it was the most magnificentcombination of flavors I had ever tasted. Suddenly I was skiing down a gorgeousmountain—just as the commercials had programmed me to think. As we staggeredtoward the door of her house, she asked me in rapture if I could get her anymore. I managed to throw my arm around her shoulder, lean in, and say, “I canget you anything you need.”Her house was hot and bright and filled with college kids. Brad was much toohigh, and this terrified him. I couldn’t handle it either. When he managed tosay, “Mom wants me back at the house in five minutes, we’ve gotta go,” I said,“No problem”—and we were off, just like that. He insisted we run all the wayhome, just like we used to do after school. There were ice and wet leaves on theroad and I nearly fell several times, but I managed to keep up with him. We werelaughing the whole way as we slipped and slid.I got home and collapsed on the couch. The surge of blood into my head causedthe drug to take off like a rocket ship. I turned on the TV; it was the middleof The Deer Hunter on HBO, with scenes of a snowy wilderness and a pained guyholding a gun. I had no idea what was going on in the movie and I didn’t care.Everything was spinning, the walls were pulsing, and the television seemed likeit was three-dimensional. All sounds appeared to be reaching me through a longtunnel. The gum had become a dead, flavorless mass, but I was chewing it like mylife depended on it. I wanted to go throw it out, but I absolutely could notmove. In a sudden burst of inspiration, I spat the gum out as hard as I could,and it landed on the carpet seven feet in front of me. I laughed for about tenminutes at my staggering comic genius. Then I picked up the phone, called Don,and slurred, “Don, you’ve gotta come over here right now. You’re not gonnabelieve this.” As soon as he saw the state I was in, that was it. He was in."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINELOOKING FOR A WAY OUTDon, Brad, and I were all sharing a water pipe with Brenda, right there in myliving room. We had found the archaic 1970s relic hiding in the basement. Thedevice was dark blue and looked like two tiny lava lamps put together bottom tobottom. Brenda’s flawless face was lit in perfect majesty as she again gurgledaway, only to explosively cough it all out a second later. Thick smoke washanging in the house, but this time it was not KNO3—and I was in no hurry to airit out. Brenda then asked me if it was okay to scrape out the last bits, sinceall of us were completely done, and I said, “Absolutely.” She did as much as shecould, and Don then had a great idea. He turned the pipe completely upside downand tapped out the rest of the cool ashes into her hand. “Oh, Don, you’re agenius!” Before she even finished her sentence, the bong made a slurping soundand hideous brown bong water dribbled over her tight, acid-washed blue jeans.“Oh, Don, you’re an asshole!” Everyone laughed again until we could barely evenbreathe.Brenda came over only one more time after that. I knew I had no chance with her,and Brad never offered to bring her over again. That didn’t matter, as I was nowon an adventure of the mind, and had no intention of stopping. This wasabsolutely real; it lasted for four to six hours, and I knew exactly what allthe hippies were so excited about. I figured it made them feel good, but I hadhad absolutely no idea that it was so powerful. The smell, the taste, thepatterns, the colors, the music—everything was so much greater than I hadrealized. It was an amazing technology, and I had absolutely no right to hide itfrom the others. I had to tell the geek clan—Eric and the others—and set themfree, just as I had done for Don.SPREADING THE WORDEric, Dave, and the others barely said a thing as they sat there in my bedroomwhile I laid out the case. I had already come up with a universe ofrationalizations for my new addiction. They were very nervous as I told them thegovernment was lying to us about this, just as they had about Watergate and theIran-Contra hearings. This is something that God made. It grows out of theground. It is a sacred tool for enhancing the mind and renewing the spirit. Youhave no right or reason to feel bad about anything in your life with atechnology like this at your disposal. It is ridiculous not to do it. People cansmoke their entire lives and be perfectly happy and productive members ofsociety. The symptoms they talk about in health class are just propaganda. Noone said a word during or after my manifesto. I had no idea at the time how fardownward my life was going to go. Very awkwardly, Eric finally said, “We’vegotta go,” and they all got up and left. The next day, it was over. None of themever wanted to speak to me again—except to taunt me by saying, “Hey, pothead” inthe hallway. That was totally fine. We didn’t need them anyway. Inside I felthorribly betrayed and even more alone—but the chemicals fogged it all out of mymind.I tried to get Jude to smoke, but given what he and his mother had been throughat the hippie commune, he wanted nothing to do with it. Besides, he already hadhis allergy medicine. Now we took the band seriously, with Jude on bass, yourstruly on the drums, my brother as the lead singer, and Michael’s friend Andy asour crunch-guitarist. We originally called ourselves Jude and the Sewer Rats,but then my brother was offended by singling Jude out, so we just shortened itto the Sewer Rats. We did not rehearse. Just as with Organized Noise, if wecould fight our way through a song while the tape was recording, that was it—wewere done.Since we had no idea what the heck we were doing, we took simple nursery rhymeslike “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and “The ABC Song” and metalized them. Thisevolved into original material, and long, improvised jams where Jude and I woulddo unusual things that rocked hard and were different from anything on MTV. Wewould listen to each other and I matched whatever he started doing on the drums,adding in interesting fills as we went. We needed a band photo, so tocommemorate the occasion, Jude shaved the right side of my head bald. I made myremaining mass of locks rock-hard with Aqua Net hair spray and wore it toschool, and people were completely shocked—it was one of the most outrageoushaircuts in the building. This attracted tons of attention, and people weretalking and laughing behind my back—but no one dared to face me except the mathteacher. One day, I got a question wrong in math class and old man Causey said,“Maybe if you shave the other side of your head, you’ll be able to thinkbetter.” The entire class cried with laughter.I did not want to “borrow” any more from Mom, so that meant I needed to buy somepot. One day, a long-haired kid named Dennis, who always wore Iron Maiden denimjackets to school, told Jude that he had taken five Vivarin caffeine pillsbefore chemistry class—and you only needed one. Every time Mr. Olson asked theclass a question, Dennis breathlessly barked the answer back so fast he couldbarely articulate the words—but he was correct every time. After class I askedhim if he knew where I could score some weed, and he told me to come to hislocker whenever with twenty-five dollars, and I would be all set.BEN AND THE HIPPIE VANI hadn’t even finished blowing out my first hit of the stuff from Dennis beforeI realized this was much, much stronger than the Totem weed. I leaned back intomy bed and the whole room was reeling. It was wonderful. I had gotten totallyripped off, but I didn’t realize this until Don brought over his older brotherBob, who was a huge football player and very popular with the ladies in Jude’sgrade, the class of 1990. “This guy totally screwed you,” he said. “You need toget in touch with Ben. He’s like a brother to me. He’s family. And he will setyou up. Big-time.”Ben was an excellent mechanic, with bulging pecs, an athletic build, long wavyblack hair tied into a ponytail in the back, a thin, pointy jaw, blue eyes, anda forgotten metal brace on one of his teeth that he had never pulled off. Healmost always had machine-oil stains somewhere on his body, his hands wereheavily calloused, and his blue jeans were filthy. He was very shy andconstantly smiling; he looked like a psychedelic human koala bear. He had workedas a taxicab driver and his claim to fame was being able to smoke a bong withboth hands while driving, and steering with his knee. He had fully restored asputtering vintage Volkswagen hippie van, with blue sides, white trim, and thehuge VW symbol on the front. It was filthy inside. It was perfect.We parked behind the Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, in a wide-open parking lotarea with no one in sight. The Moon was full and clear as I took my first hitoff the new bong—I mean, the water pipe for the use of tobacco. I had justbought it at Orion, the local head shop on Jay Street in Schenectady that reekedof incense. Ben’s stuff was even more powerful than Dennis’s. This was now thegreatest moment of my life. Everything came together—the Moon, the trees, thevan, and the crisp night air. I was totally and profoundly addicted. I washaving a mystical, almost religious experience—and thought no one could hear meas I murmured to myself, “I am going to do this for the rest of my life.”Everyone started laughing. “You’re damn right you are! She’ll never leave youand she always puts out.”I now refer to marijuana as “the five-leaf lesson,” and based on my own personalexperiences, it is not a lesson I care to repeat. I ended up almost completelylosing any ability to function as a happy, healthy adult.DIGGING FOR BURIED TREASURENow it was my obligation to venture into my father’s basement and unlock thetreasures that awaited my new crew of explorers. My brother had already tapedall the Led Zeppelin albums for me off the original vinyl on his record player.Now I went and retrieved albums like Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle, and The Wallby Pink Floyd; Days of Future Passed and In Search of the Lost Chord by theMoody Blues; all the Hendrix albums; Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band bythe Beatles; and Ricochet and Rubycon by Tangerine Dream. I had done theresearch first, by asking my parents which were the best psychedelic albums ofthe 1960s and 1970s, and it really paid off. By far, my strongest experiencescame off the Tangerine Dream albums. In fact, some of those trips were sointense that Don would beg me to turn the music off, because he was literallyclenching his fists in terror until his knuckles turned white. All those worldsvanished when I hit stop, and in a few seconds he would beg me to turn it backon. I never let him down—and away we went.By some divine miracle, Jude had secured an invitation to a private Christmasparty for all the coolest seniors and a handful of cool juniors, even though hewas only a sophomore. The guys all wore tuxedos and the girls wore prom dresses,but this was much better than the prom. The party took place at the huge familyhome of one of the wealthiest kids in town, and his parents actually allowedeveryone to drink alcohol there. Somehow Jude was able to talk them into lettingme in, since I was “his drummer.” I had found an amazing black silk smokingjacket in my closet with a rock-star pattern made out of stylized record-albumshapes. The basement of the party house had a house band of juniors and seniorswho were pretty good; they were playing covers of the popular “hair metal” bandsof the day, including “Talk Dirty to Me” by Poison. The entire basement waspacked, flesh to flesh, with gorgeous girls pressed against guys in tuxedos. Itwas a feast for the eyes and the senses, and smoke clouds hung in the air. Judemanaged to get permission for us to play after they left the stage, and althoughI was very nervous, I used the martial arts training to stay calm and centered.Jude cranked up the distortion on the bass and we launched into a loud,interesting, hard-rock jam, in which he kept trying out new ideas and I followedhim on the drums wherever he went.Everyone was cheering—and when I walked off that stage, I was a newly mintedhero. The kids in Jude’s class, as well as the older ones, had no idea who Iwas, or what my own classmates thought of me. They had seen me in some of theirclasses and now realized that I was a “rock star.” The word quickly got aroundthat I had met all the most famous musicians they worshipped on MTV. In onenight, I went from having hardly any friends at all to being one of theweirdest, coolest kids in school—but only to the classes of 1990 and 1989. Womenwere talking to me with wide eyes, hoping to get their chance to meet thecelebrities I routinely saw backstage. I managed not to gawk at their chests,but it probably wouldn’t have mattered. A very attractive blond girl, who waswearing a tight red dress and was almost as tall as I was, got talking to meupstairs by the big Christmas tree, and it really looked like it was goingsomewhere until I found out she was only thirteen years old. Somehow I had beensingled out by the one girl at the party who was even younger than I was, andshe had obviously gotten in for her looks. I did not want to fall for“jailbait,” so I was nice to her, but made no effort to take it any further.Shortly afterward, a jock called “The Blakester” came up to me. He had the lookand swagger of a young Frank Sinatra, and he was very drunk. He called me Cox,as in the mispronounced end of my last name, Wilcock, and threw his arm aroundme. His breath reeked of stale beer, cheese, and death. “Cox. Cox. Cox. Yougotta dansh.” I didn’t understand what he was slurring. “You gotta DANSH, Cox!You gotta DANSH if you wanna get laid!” The Blakester took the lead, and soon wewere leading a whole group of amazingly hot girls through the most ridiculousdance moves imaginable—like raking, shoveling, swimming, diving, wiggling, anddigging. Once the music finally died down and there were no results, theBlakester gave me the bottom line. I needed to start working out, go on a diet,and lose the weight. As soon as I did that, with the talent he now knew that Ihad, I could snap my fingers and get any girl I wanted. He told me he would beright there by my side, yelling in my face as I did sit-up after sit-up. I wouldhate him more than I had ever hated anyone in my life—only to love him in theend when my whole universe changed and I was “The Man.”After the party, I was instantly promoted up to the “stage” area in thecafeteria, where only the coolest jocks sat. I found out that most of the jockswere drinking every weekend, and a surprising number of them smoked weed aswell. They saw me as being very entertaining, and I told all my best stories ofgoing backstage at rock concerts. Jude was up there too, and we traded off,creating lots of laughs at the table.THE SAFE HOUSESomehow I was able to convince Mom to let me have friends come over and smokeweed at the house. She had told me before that she didn’t want me to try ituntil I was sixteen, but that wasn’t far away now, and she begrudgingly acceptedit. Her main rule was that I couldn’t do it during the week—and no alcohol wasallowed in the house whatsoever. I agreed to those conditions. Brad’s “masterplan” had worked exactly as he had hoped. I now had the ideal weed-friendly“safe house” for gatherings. Shane had gone from being a “total loser” in mygrade to the most popular kid in the class of 1992, thanks to his athleticabilities, weird skater clothes, and persona. Failing eighth grade had been anabsolute godsend for him, and had earned him a cool new name: Baner. Chris, thesame kid who had once shot me down Monkey Hill and insulted me every day aboutmy sweatpants, was now a weekly fixture as well. Don was always there, as wewere inseparable.Jude almost never came over, as he had a hot young girlfriend from an extremelyfundamentalist Christian family. Every time we made plans, she would seduce himwith the offer of a night of secret lovemaking and get him to cancel out at thelast minute. This became a source of incredible pain throughout the remainder ofmy high school years. We would make plans, I would set everything aside to havehim come over as an exclusive so we could work on our music, but he would onlymake it about one out of every seven or eight times. This, coupled with my rapidonset of drug-numbed apathy, killed off our band within a month or two after theChristmas party.DAMAGED JUSTICEOn March 15, 1989, Dad took Michael and me to RPI Fieldhouse to see Metallica ontheir “Damaged Justice” world tour, supporting their hit new album And Justicefor All. They had been a band only the real “burnouts,” like Dennis, listenedto, but then they came out with their video and single “One,” about a soldierwhose mind was trapped in a motionless body, and the band became huge overnight.We saw them right as they were cresting the wave of fame, on the fourth month ofa grueling yearlong world tour with no breaks. I smuggled a ten-inch-long Kodak110 flash camera down the front of my pants, and miraculously the security guardwaved his wand over everything but the camera and passed me through.The show was extremely loud and raunchy, but thankfully the label only allowed asmall group of people to go backstage. The guitarist, Kirk Hammett, was so shyhe hid in the hallway and wouldn’t talk to anyone. The lead singer, JamesHetfield, was extremely tall and staggeringly drunk. When I posed for a picturewith him, he belched loudly, and it reeked of beer and bile. We all laughed,which caused my brother to wiggle the camera and ruin the shot. The drummer,Lars Ulrich, was significantly shorter than I was, and I was dying to ask himsome questions. Although he seemed uninterested in talking to me at first, sinceI was a huge, hairy, sweat-drenched mess, I quickly found out that it was thesame story—they were already burned out, had a very difficult time being famous,and were exhausted from touring. I was a prisoner in high school and they wereprisoners in a tour bus.Lars confessed that he had tried to become a tennis pro, but had failed. He hadbeen playing drums for only three or four months when he started in Metallica,but he could run really fast. He took those feet and danced on the double-basspedals, developing their now signature sound.After the pictures from the Metallica show were developed, I realized I lookedlike a mess, and I needed to try to improve my appearance. I had become hugelyoverweight, with a double chin that remained visible no matter how I was holdingmy head. I had not cut my hair since getting hit in the ear, and before then mymother had always done it. The hair I had now was the result of just letting itgo, and I hadn’t even tried to comb or style it until I shaved the side. I woreit up at school only about twelve times because it created such an intensereaction. Now I wanted my hair to have a more stylized and feathered look, whilekeeping all the length—which would make me look even more like a true metalhead.Baner’s mother was always drunk, slurring her words, but she worked as ahairstylist, and he set up a deal through which she agreed to cut my hair in herhouse after work for five bucks. Don sat there in the linoleum kitchen thatsmelled like a sick dog as I told her I wanted her to take off only two inches,make it look good, and otherwise leave it the way it was. She slurred back,“Just two inches,” and I said, “Yes, just two inches.”I was surprised that it was taking her so long, and it seemed like there was anawful lot of hair all over the ground. Don kept smiling as though he was tryingnot to laugh. To my horror, when it was all over she had given me the ultimatescumbag haircut, also known as the mullet—short on the top and sides, or“business up front,” with a little rat-tail “party in the back.” Now I lookedexactly like the kids who smoked cigarettes on the corner before school, and whowere trying to have long hair but had never really committed to it. I wasfurious with Don for not telling me what she was doing or making any effort tostop her. When I looked at myself in the mirror, I had the exact same feeling ofsobriety and major life change that I had had when my ear was first cut. My earnow had no discoloration, and if you didn’t look closely you couldn’t even tellthere was a scar there. “Chop it off,” I told her. “Chop off the rat tail andlet’s just go with a normal clean-cut look.”I went to school with that haircut the next day, and used what I had learnedabout hair spray to make it perfect. I wore the dressiest shirt I had: a tanshirt with a blue collar. Nothing black. One dressed-up jock kid named Brian wasso shocked he literally backed up seven feet in the hallway when he saw me. Judepassed up the temptations of his girlfriend to visit me that night. It was anemergency, and he told me I needed to do something fast. My long hair had“hidden the weight,” he said, and made me look cool, whereas now I was just “thefat kid.” There was no edge, no story, no reason to see me as a wild rock star.I thought back to what the teacher’s assistant had told me about havingunusually beautiful eyes, and realized Jude was absolutely right. I had lost thehair, and now I needed to lose the weight. I would have to become my ownpersonal trainer, even if I hated myself for driving so hard—just as theBlakester told me at the party. I already knew how to make my body impervious topain for short periods, and now I decided to will my way through a diet, forhowever long it would take. My main goal in doing it, at the time, was to use mynewfound stardom to end up with a girl like Brenda.I started an aggressive, very unhealthy diet. I stopped eating breakfast cerealwith milk and drinking a large glass of orange juice before school. Instead, Idrank nothing but a V-8 each morning, and then filled my stomach with water inbetween classes. This also forced me to run to the bathroom every hour. I wouldrock in hunger all through the day, which transformed school into completeagony. Then I headed back to Don’s house, where we had grilled cheesesandwiches. Mom made her normal healthy dinners, with slices of apple,vegetables, and the main course, which was usually macaroni and cheese. I tookmy five-dollar-a-week allowance and my dollar-twenty-five-a-day lunch money andsaved it all to go toward weed. Skipping school lunch meant I no longer ate thehuge pile of French fried potatoes that, along with sugar-laced ketchup, hadbeen declared a “vegetable” by the Reagan administration, and the pounds startedflying off. I absolutely hated jogging after two years of the Turkey Trot, anddid not do any more exercise than before—not a single push-up, sit-up, orchin-up.I lost most of the weight in the first few months, as much as five pounds aweek. It took six more months to get the last third of it to go away. As soon asI started visibly losing weight, and had a house full of weed buddies everyweekend, Don became suicidal. I didn’t know how serious he was, but it wasn’tlooking good . . . at all. After school on weekdays it was just me and him. Idecided to have him write out what he wanted to say to all the people he wasfriends with, including the girls. I wanted him to apologize to them for killinghimself and say why he felt it was necessary. I felt this would help him workthrough it and realize this was a terrible and stupid thing to do. I was sittingon the floor in gym class when a random mullet kid told me Don had slumped overat his desk, crying out that he had taken eighty-six aspirin and didn’t want todie. They had rushed him out in an ambulance, pumped his stomach, and fed himcharcoal, and he was probably going to be fine. I was very upset that he hadactually tried to do it and never bothered to tell me. He also had refused toleave any statements for me when we wrote out his good-byes.After this failed suicide attempt, Don started buying Marlboro Red cigarettesand drinking alcohol in addition to smoking weed. I tried drinking myself but Idid not like it, and found that hard liquor in particular would just aboutdestroy my stomach and send me into crippling pain. I smoked a total of fewerthan twenty cigarettes in my life and quickly decided they were disgusting, eventhough the first time I smoked one I got so wasted I could barely walk down thestreet. I realized they were always this strong, and people’s bodies simplyadjusted to the nicotine dose. I did not want that to happen to me—but both Donand his brother became totally hooked. That same day I tried my first cigarette,we met a friend of Bob’s who was already out of school and high. I told him Ismoked pot only on the weekends, and he looked genuinely dazzled. “How can youpossibly wait that long? It’s so good I can’t imagine why you wouldn’t want todo it every day.”I scoffed. “That’s never going to happen. I’m not an addict.” However, in lessthan a year he would be right. A lifetime of bullying, and growing up in a sicksociety, had made me a prisoner of “repetition compulsion,” where I keptattracting the same types of tormentors over and over again. Yet, instead ofdoing anything to stand up for myself, I continued to self-medicate more andmore to alleviate the pain they caused me. The more I did this, the weaker Ibecame, and the more I was attacked. It was truly a vicious cycle that just kepton snowballing. The cosmic days of my youth now seemed like a distant, almostforgotten memory.TWENTY-SIX YEARSSomeone told me about a technique involving hyperventilation that got you veryhigh. I didn’t realize it at the time, but it involved creating a “blood choke”to the brain, which I knew from my martial arts training was lethal if it lastedfor very long. Since no one actually put their hands or arms around your neck, Ididn’t realize that this technique did the same thing. I heard about it as afairly vague rumor, with instructions to have your friend push on you for sevenseconds. I recruited Jude for this task, since I wanted to have a psychedelicadventure, and told him, “Forget seven seconds. Let’s go for fifteen.” I wasstanding with my back against an old-smelling thick hardwood door with a roundedtop when he did it—but I never made it to fifteen. My body slumped downunconscious after eleven. I landed on my left foot in a funny way, causing themetatarsal bone attached to the pinky toe to snap about an inch below where thetoe met with the foot—leaving my toe bending well over to the side, almost on aninety-degree angle. I thought it was only dislocated and didn’t realize I hadactually broken it until many years later.I was thrown into a very bizarre situation in which “my life flashed before myeyes”—only it was the wrong life. I experienced what seemed to be twenty-sixyears of time as a series of blindingly fast snapshots. As each one went by, thefull range of experiences for that time was loaded into my memory. I was part ofa primitive community that lived by a river. Almost everyone was illiterate. Ourequivalent of the daily news was a guy who stood up on a platform in the centerof town and told us what was going on, using theatrical storytelling techniques.We had a huge problem with irrigation. We were trying to get the river water togo through brick canals to the crops, but most of the water was seeping outbetween the cracks. I was having ESP experiences and contact with an “old man”similar to my own dreams as a child, and I was taught how to create a gooeymaterial that was burned black and would stop the water from leaking.I had a wife whom I got together with when I was young, and we had kids beforewe really knew what we were doing. She took care of the kids and I was mostlydisconnected and focused on myself and my work. We still had love in our family,but I was always out doing something. I was obsessed with the idea of having anout-of-body experience, and being able to travel wherever I wanted in thisghostly form. I was taught to hold up a lotus-type flower to my face and stareinto it. If I could see my own face in the lotus, I could change places with myastral body, so now I was looking back at the eyes of my physical body. Thelotus pattern would then extend into a tunnel and I could fly through it and gowherever I wanted.My life ended when a group of rogue barbarians invaded, riding animals andcarrying weapons. We were completely outmatched, and I knew they were going tokill every single person in our village. I couldn’t run and I couldn’t hide—so Idropped down, holding a flower, and I tried harder than ever to see my own facein its spiraling pattern. The ground was shaking from the power of the oncominghorde. Finally I started seeing my face—but something was wrong. My eyes lookedjust about the same as they normally would, but I had dark skin and differentfeatures. The flower extended into a tunnel and I started hearing Jude and mybrother shouting my name. I was very confused by what I was seeing, as it was myface, but it wasn’t my face. I decided to fly through the tunnel and go to thevoices instead of waiting for the barbarians to kill me.I slammed back into my body, and I was in very serious trouble. My eyes wouldnot stop going up and down, up and down, from my top left to my bottom right,about two times a second. I also was in terrible pain, but at first I couldn’tidentify it. I started screaming when I realized I had landed on my foot in afunny way, and yelled even more loudly when I wrestled it out and saw my toe offto the side. I frantically ordered Jude to pop it back, which he did—and it hurttremendously. Then I yelled, “Twenty-six years! I was gone for twenty-six years!How the hell did I make it back here?” They had no idea what I was talkingabout. As I regained control of my body and bound my toe to the other two withScotch tape, I explained to them what had happened. I did not believe inreincarnation at the time, though it would become a major part of my life in thefuture. Nonetheless, I could not deny that I seemed to have relived a past lifeat flash-forward speed. The strangest thing about it was that my eyes looked thesame as they do now, though I had been a black man. Although the wholeexperience fascinated me, I realized that I came very close to dying—and I nevertried it again.Around this time, I also started having a highly bizarre thing happen to me asoften as once or twice a month. I would get up for school as I always did, takea shower, get dressed, go downstairs, pack my book bag, have breakfast, and walkout the side door to go to school. Everything outside would be pitch-black. Itwas the middle of the night. “What the hell is going on?” I would come back intothe house and realize that I had been in some kind of trance. I thought I heardmy alarm going off, but it was a hallucination. I went through all the motionsin a robotic way. I gazed at the clock on the microwave but didn’t register whattime it was.During this same time, I was listening to the song “Sister Morphine” by theRolling Stones. When Mick Jagger sang, “Why does the doctor have no face,” I gota sudden flash of a scene in which two “doctors” were standing over me. Theyboth had unusually large heads with tapered jaws, and skinny bodies. There werethree round lights above them in a triangle shape as they bent over to look downat me. I drew the scene for my art class, but I gave them squared-off militaryjaws instead of what I actually saw, and gave their bodies wide militaryshoulders as well. I did not draw any facial features on them, because in thissplit-second flash vision I could not see any. My drawing was good enough thatit won an award and was displayed in the school hallway for a period of time. Istill have it framed and hanging on my bedroom wall. I got a tremendous chillwhen my mother got a copy of Whitley Strieber’s first book, Communion. Thebig-eyed being on the front cover looked very similar to the “doctors” I haddrawn, and in the book they abducted people and performed medical experiments.This creeped me out so much that I would flip the book facedown every time I sawit. The combination of extraterrestrial and square-jawed human features mayindicate that military personnel were part of my experience, thus suggestingthere may have been a “MILAB” or Military Abduction.27[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber26] If I was in fact abducted, I have still neverbeen able to remember any details to this very day. However, my mother did wakeup one night feeling a terrible negative presence in the room, and saw athree-foot-tall being quietly walking out. It had a normal-sized head, not likeone of the Gray extraterrestrials with the large heads, huge black eyes, andspindly bodies—but she was very afraid of it. My art also formed the image ofthe Egyptian “winged disc,” which I would not consciously realize for over adecade.[../image/05_AscensionMysteries.jpg]David Wilcock’s High School Illustration of ET-like BeingsTHE LEFT EYE OF HORUSIn the summer of 1989, one of the “burnout” kids I had smoked with a few timescalled me up and said I had to see something, right now, as I would neverbelieve him otherwise. He just had to show me. We rushed over to the SunnysideRoad bridge, which went over the railroad tracks, where he had been riding hismotorcycle. The suspense was killing me as we climbed down the hill—and there itwas. A gigantic, Egyptian-style Left Eye of Horus was painted on the concreteslope that went all the way up the hill under the bridge. It was easily fiftyfeet wide and thirty feet tall, and was made out of at least four differentpaint colors—a lot of red, some blue, and black for the iris with white for itsreflection. The paint was glossy and fresh as if it had just been done, or wasvery carefully maintained.It wasn’t at all easy to get down there. This would have taken gallons andgallons of paint to produce—and it was flawless. Who would have had the time,money, and energy to do something like this? College kids? And why? What couldpossibly possess them to invest such a significant part of themselves intomaking this gigantic piece of art that no one would ever see except a trainconductor?As I tried to use ESP to tune into whatever this was, I sensed incredible eviland darkness. I had flashes of people wearing robes and masks, chanting around afire. There may have even been some sort of animal sacrifice as well as weirdsex rites. I found that the logical place for a fire had been all too neatlyraked, as if someone had deliberately cleaned it up to hide the evidence.Suddenly it dawned on me that this could be a ritual site for the sameRosemary’s Baby–type group that my parents had seen going into the house acrossthe street. Years later I would speak to multiple insiders who confirmed thatsites like this were used to practice occult religious rites.Now I was consumed with terror. I quickly scanned all the trees to see if therewas a hidden camera. Nothing obvious. “We need to get the hell out of here.Right now.” The burnout kid was right behind me. After we left, we both tried tofigure out why in the hell there was an Egyptian eye there. How could this haveanything to do with a weird, satanic cult that might want to light a fire and doa ritual while they were safely hidden under a bridge? At the time, it didn’tmake any sense. Egyptian religion and Satanism were supposedly two completelydifferent things. I decided that those ESP hits must have been myimagination—but the whole experience haunted me for years to come. I wouldeventually discover that the Cabal’s main religion was Luciferianism, and theyhad adapted the Egyptian trinity of Isis, Osiris, and Horus as being the threemain manifestations of Lucifer on Earth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENHE’LL TAKE YOU UP, HE’LL BRING YOU DOWNNot long after seeing the Eye, I had perhaps the single most powerful dream ofall my years as a teenager. I was first drawn into this beautiful hotel in thewoods, surrounded by snow and majestic evergreen trees. Once I got inside, therewere teenagers everywhere. Everyone was being given powerful drugs, akin to somekind of mushrooms. The drugs prevented them from understanding where they wereor what was going on. In one room, all the teenagers were sitting in a circlearound a one-foot-wide metallic sphere mounted on a platform. A being wasstanding off to the side in a black, hooded cloak, and seemed to be the GrimReaper—but no one saw him. The kids were all completely hypnotized by some kindof technology emanating from the sphere.Seeing the hooded being made me panic. I had to escape before someone drugged melike the others—but I realized certain people were acting as plainclothessecurity guards to prevent this from happening, and none of the doors andwindows would open. I burst into some sort of restricted area, and everythingsuddenly looked very technological—like I was inside an advanced spacecraft.There was a huge, round elevator in the distance, and I felt that I needed totake it. As soon as I tried to move forward, I was attacked by a huge number ofbattle robots that walked on two legs, had two arms, and were very ferocious.Somehow I was able to fight my way through them. It seemed to involve acombination of some kind of advanced weapon I had found as well as ascended-typeabilities.I made it into the elevator, and inside I saw a panel revealing that the hotelwas only the top level of a huge underground base that went many levels down.Somehow I knew the only way out was to confront the leader of this alien menaceon the bottom floor. I was able to get the elevator to take me there, and wasvery surprised by how long it took to go all the way down. The elevator openedout into a huge, dark area. The only visible thing was a massive pair ofornately carved wooden doors. They were easily eighty feet tall, and had lots ofstrange designs carved into them. They also seemed to be covered with barbedwire; they were not made for anyone to get through without approval. I knew thatwhoever or whatever was running this operation was right behind those doors. Isummoned every bit of physical and spiritual strength I had—and was able toblast them open.I walked into an office that looked like it was right out of the White House,complete with the presidential desk. The chair swiveled around and I saw a manwho looked like a politician or senior military official. He wore a blue suitwith an American flag pin on his lapel. He had wet-combed black hair that wasstyled like Ronald Reagan’s hair had been. He admitted they were running theentire facility, and started very aggressively trying to get me to join them. Iwas promised unlimited power and full access to their technology. When Irefused, he started laughing and said I had no choice—since I had nowhere elseto go. Somehow I felt the only answer would be to “create myself.” I bent downand rolled myself up into a ball, going into a deep state of concentration. Iwent out-of-body and was able to build seven luminous energetic bodies around myown—each of which was progressively larger. I then was able to move myconsciousness into the largest one.Suddenly I found myself onboard a magnificent spaceship. I was in a massive,open room with a long, curving wall that was filled with hyper-advanced computerterminals. Each terminal had a huge screen that was about five feet wide andfour feet tall. The images on the screens were holographic, full color, andextremely high resolution. I was seated at my terminal and had an image of theEarth there in front of me. I could clearly identify the underground base I hadbeen in, as it was lit up on the globe. I had access to tremendous powers withthe technology on this ship. I was able to take all the kids in the base andtransport them to a safe place. Then I reached in and removed the base itself,as if it were the size of a pea, and catapulted it back to where it came from.The Earth had been profoundly healed and transformed as a result of my doingthis—almost like it was bathed in light.I awoke from this experience in an absolute state of awe. It made me rememberthe dreams of my youth with the old man, the messages I was given about a masshuman evolution, and the way I felt when I saw 2001 and 2010. I had been able totransform myself directly into a light being. For the first time in years, Iseemed to have gotten much more information than in my youth. Somethingtremendously evil was controlling the US government—and the way to defeat it wasfor us to evolve into an entirely new form. At the time, I wondered if it wasonly a dream, or something more. In time, this would end up being one of themost profound ascension dreams I ever had—and Jude wrote the whole thing up in acomic-book-style series of illustrations.LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDSOne day after school, Don and I were transfixed by an old black-and-whitedocumentary on the Beatles in which we saw vintage footage of people on LSD.They were higher than we had ever gotten. Paul McCartney was talking in the showabout how he stopped doing LSD after a while, and said, “It had done all itcould do for us.” We were huge fans of Sgt. Pepper’s, and I realized that manypeople assumed the song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” was code for LSD, basedon the first letters of each word. All the lyrics were extremely bizarre anddruglike. There were taxis made out of newspaper, tangerine trees, marmaladeskies, and a girl with kaleidoscope eyes who kept showing up. The Beatles wereon to something—and the documentary implied that hippies all knew LSD wasamazing. Both of the classic Moody Blues albums we loved to listen to werefull-length infomercials and recruitment tools for LSD use as well.In Carlos Castenada’s books, psychedelics were used to access spiritualconsciousness—so I felt my mother might have been wrong about avoiding themcompletely. My epic dream said I had to “create myself” in these energeticbodies, and I thought back to my forgotten goal from when I was a kid of wantingto have another out-of-body experience. It had never happened, and maybe thiswas the key to finally getting another chance. Lars, one of the hippies fromTotem, had overdosed on LSD, so I talked to people I knew who had taken it andgot the warnings on what not to do. The basic guideline was to take just alittle bit of anything new so you didn’t get bugged out. It never occurred to methat the teenagers in my dream had been kept prisoner in the hotel by the use ofsome kind of psychedelic drug in the first place.Don, Baner, and I took a quarter tab each of some baby-blue paper LSD, which hadcome in by way of the latest Grateful Dead concerts at Giants Stadium in NewJersey, on July 9 and 10, 1989. Each time the Dead tour came anywhere near wherewe were, there was a temporary surge in psychedelic drugs available from peoplewho would buy it by the sheet and resell it at higher prices—about three or fourdollars a tab. Fifteen minutes rushed by after we took the quarter tab, andnothing had changed, so we each took another one. After fifteen more minuteswith no results, we concluded the blue doses were fake. Since we didn’t want toruin our chances of seeing something happen, we each took another half of adifferent kind we had that was pink, called Soundwaves. The myth was that aftertaking it, you would be able to see waves of sound traveling through the air.Another ten minutes went by, and things were definitely starting to get strange.I was exhaling smoke in my room when my mother suddenly yelled up the stairs:“David, dinner is ready. All your friends have to leave!” This was my worstnightmare come true. The LSD was probably going to hit me right at the dinnertable, since at least one of the two kinds I had taken was not fake—and I hadnever done it before. I went downstairs, where my mother had laid out all theingredients in about ten different bowls on the table to make tacos. I realizedI had forgotten to pee, and rushed back up the stairs, two at a time. As I stoodover the toilet, my heart was pounding—and it hit me. In a thunderous slam, myentire field of vision went completely black—with my eyes wide-open. It was asif someone had closed blackout curtains over my vision, and it was utterlyterrifying.I tried to hold still so I wouldn’t pee all over, and my vision faded back in.Now, everything looked like it was underwater, which I came to call“swimming-pool vision.” There were shimmering sparkles of light everywhere, andthe colors were much more intense than they had been just a minute ago. My bodyfelt extremely strange and distorted. I went over to the stairs and realized Iwas having powerful hallucinations. It now looked like the entire stairwell wasstretching open and closed, becoming wider and narrower in about one-secondintervals, like it was alive. Sparks of light were shooting down the tunnel. Iwas absolutely horrified. I couldn’t believe I was going to walk down thosestairs, but I made the choice. I held my hands against both walls to make surethey didn’t close up on me. The height of each step seemed to be rising andfalling in the same, sickening motion, but they were stable once I stepped onthem, so I just worked my way down very slowly. Once I finally made it to thebottom, I felt that if I didn’t “create” each part of the floor before I steppedon it with my foot, I could fall right through it—so I decided exactly where Iwas going to step, and visualized walking on it before I actually did.By the time I made it back to the table, I was a huge mess. Everything was goingso fast in my mind that the speed of normal human conversation was intolerablyslow. Once I sat at the table I realized I could barely lift my arms, which wasnecessary to make tacos and look normal. My mother put a taco shell on my plate;it was still warm, so it started slowly drooping. I felt like it was a livingmouth wanting to be fed with taco stuff. With an enormous effort, I managed torobotically retrieve a single spoonful of beef and drop it in the middle of theshell, and then a small dusting of shredded cheddar cheese. There was now alittle one-inch ball of meat and cheese in the middle of my taco shell.At this point I got hit with a terrifying hallucination. The meat and cheeseturned into some shrimp-like crustacean creature. It was twitching in the shellin death agony, staring at me, and I couldn’t help but instinctively flinch fromit. Now I became extremely paranoid. The conversation between my mother andbrother seemed incredibly strained, with huge pregnant pauses and lots ofsubtext indicating they thought I was messed up on some drug—and were very upsetabout it. This seemed to go on for an eternity before I eventually decided I hadto get the hell out of there, immediately. When I was a kid I could ask to beexcused from the table if I didn’t feel well. After what seemed like half anhour, I managed to plan out the following sentence in words, tone, and delivery,to sell the part and sound as normal as possible. “Mom, I don’t feel well. May Ibe excused from the table?”She said, “Sure,” and I fled to the basement, where there was a phone. I calledup Don and said, “Dude, I am really freaking out. You guys need to get back hereas soon as possible.” As I spoke to him, the walls were visibly breathing, as ifI were inside the lungs of some strange beast. Mom’s microphone stands wereswaying back and forth like seaweed underwater. I felt like I was inside thebelly of the whale, and it had all started when I had gone down the stairs,which was its mouth. The sparks urging me down the stairs were its saliva.Somehow it all made sense. He agreed they would return quickly, and I realizedthat similar things were also happening to him. I came back upstairs but nevermade it to my room—only the living-room couch. The lampshade was now a canvas ofdazzling visuals, including spiraling triangles within triangles, castles, andmountains I was flying through, and a Centipede–style video game I could playwith my mind. Mom said good-bye to me and headed off for her gig, and my friendsarrived soon afterward. Things got somewhat better after that, but it was stilla very unsettling experience.I reminisced about some of the interesting moments after it had happened, and wedecided to do it again later on. This time we made sure to plan it out better,so there was no chance of having to deal with either of my parents during thetime it was active, which was an exhausting twelve hours. I realized the “peak”didn’t hit until forty-five minutes after you took it, and up until then itmight not even seem like anything was going to happen. Every time it started,all the same unpleasant symptoms came back—a feeling of my whole body shaking, asense of extreme nervousness, a pain in the stomach, horribly sore joints withcertain varieties of LSD, time slowing down to a crawl, and a massive number ofobsessive thoughts I could not control. My mind could be simultaneously caughtin four or five different thought loops, all going around and around atdifferent speeds, and I couldn’t make them stop.There was always the risk of having a “bad trip,” where you could become farmore terrified than you had ever been in your entire life. The only otherexperience I had that could even begin to compare to a bad trip was when I hadalmost died in Rick’s boat. Any one bad trip was much, much worse than that,even though nothing was actually going on—and it lasted for vastly longerperiods of psychological time. In some cases I was hiding in the corner, allalone, and terrified to move—feeling that unseen evil spirits would completelydestroy me if I didn’t stay absolutely still and try not to breathe. The fearthat this caused me was much greater than anything I had ever experienced. Ididn’t even realize it was possible to be that scared before this happened. Oneof my quotes that I shared with all my friends was, “No one is adult enough tobe able to handle a bad trip.” It was absolutely impossible for me to prevent itfrom happening, and every single time I did it, there were periods that werespectacularly terrifying and horrific—and seemed to go on for eternities oftime. I would reminisce with my friends about some of the interesting things,try another round, and then end up right back in that same place, asking myself,“Why in God’s name did I do this again?”I can hear some people saying hippie slogans like “Set and setting, dude, setand setting,” meaning if you do it in the right place, and have the rightmind-set, you can have a positive experience. “It just amplifies what is alreadythere.” Who in today’s world doesn’t have hidden demons they haven’t healed yet?What happens when you get hit with all of them at once, much more strongly thanever before? I have also heard people say, “Clean acid, man, you never tookclean acid.” In my case, I never had a trip that was good from the beginning tothe end, no matter how “clean” the LSD was supposed to be—and I also tried otherpsychedelics, including mushrooms and yellow micro-dots.There were always prolonged periods of unimaginable fright. The best I couldhope for was to reduce the total amount of time I spent in absolute,full-body-shaking terror. This is why many people try LSD only once or twice andnever touch it again. This was also obviously why Lars had ended up the way hedid. With a large or accidental dose, the amount of trauma you could go throughcould literally destroy your mental health in a permanent or semipermanentfashion.I also ended up getting caught in thought loops about the Earth every time I didthe drug, which I called “ecology trips.” Everywhere I looked, I saw evidencethat we were destroying the Earth—and I could not begin to ignore it. Televisionbecame absolutely unwatchable. All the smiling salespeople, marketing language,and slick jingles telling you to “buy now” became the horrific, crushing tonesof a Pied Piper leading us over a cliff into global annihilation. “Three easypayments of only $19.95. For a limited time only while supplies last. Call now!”I would hear ugly, terrifying and dissonant bass notes blended in with themusic, and the feeling of evil was so overpowering that a thirty-secondcommercial seemed like a lifetime of torment.I felt like the trees were screaming and the Earth itself was alive andextremely terrified of us. I thought back to the Eye I had seen under thebridge, and on LSD, the pyramid with the All-Seeing Eye on the dollar billbecame a vortex of darkness. It seemed that there was a tornado of energyemanating from that eye that was making the entire room around me shake—and itwas extremely frightening. I realized we were a mass suicide cult, and could endup killing this beautiful being—which was forced, by design, to just step backand hope that a few of its best people could help to turn things around.Many people have asked me to try ayahuasca or other drugs, telling me, “Oh, it’snot like LSD at all. It is much better, much more profound and spirituallymeaningful. Now that you’ve been clean for years, you’ll have a much betterexperience.” Yet when I have asked them detailed and specific questions aboutwhat happened, I have realized that everyone goes into a psychedelic space,which is a near-death experience—similar to the hallucinations you get in afever when your brain is starting to dangerously overheat and threaten yourlife. You can have really weird and bizarre things happen to you, but just asPaul McCartney said, psychedelics did all they could do for me. I would beextremely weak and exhausted afterward, and I always had a crippling backache. Ialso had residual LSD stored in my fat cells that could cause me to haveflashbacks, such as during exercise or when I was smoking weed—so I never knewexactly what was going to happen to me next.The main thing I got out of it was that we are destroying the Earth, and thesolution requires people who are actually living on the Earth to stop it. Nocosmic beings like the old man in my dreams can just swoop in, wave a magicwand, and solve all our problems. We have to take action. This is our world, andwe have to fight to keep it. This also caused me to see most of the peoplearound me as brainwashed zombies. Everyone ignored the things that terrifiedthem the most. As soon as they saw some proof of how close we were to destroyingourselves, they would just shut down. No one ever wanted to suffer even 10percent as much terror as I would feel in a bad trip. They would do just aboutanything, including completely blocking out a bad experience from their memory,to avoid that pain. Drugs and alcohol helped them stay numb—and I was equallyguilty of it myself. Once I was stoned, I could completely forget aboutsomething that had been really upsetting me even ten minutes before I started.But then, as soon as I came back to reality, the problem had gotten even worse,because I wasn’t doing anything to deal with it. More and more, I was becomingdeeply introverted, paralyzingly shy, paranoid, and fearful.On January 1, 1990—in the early hours of New Year’s Day—a girl I had known sincefirst grade died in a horrible car accident. She was riding in a car with kidsfrom another school, and everyone had been drinking. The police report showedthat the car was going a hundred miles per hour when it struck the concrete wallnext to a bridge on Mohawk Avenue. Worst of all, she was still screaming as thepolice arrived. She burned to death and they were unable to save her. This had aseismic effect on our community—and was a shocking reminder that we were notimmortal. I thought of all the times I had spoken to her over the years, and nowshe was gone. The story was so horrible that everyone quickly forgot aboutit—just as we ignored a seemingly impossible array of threats to all life onEarth.THE GRATEFUL DEADOn March 24, 1990, I ate a full eighth-ounce bag of mushrooms before going tosee the Grateful Dead at the Knickerbocker Arena with my father, his hilariousbuddy Rick, and my kid brother. I thought that since everyone took psychedelicsat the Dead show, I would be fine—but I soon reconfirmed that being aroundeither of my parents while tripping was a horrible idea. I decided to wait aslong as possible, so I didn’t pop the hideous-tasting material in my mouth untilwe were in the car. Michael saw me and thought I had candy at first. I lied tohim and denied eating anything, but he then realized I was doing some kind ofdrugs. The taste reminded me of the essence of moldy, three-day-old sock stench.It was very dry, and I had to chew it quite a bit to choke it down. The driveinto Albany was about an hour, and by the time we stopped at a pizza placebefore the show, it was hitting me—very hard.Right as Rick made a hilarious joke, the cheese on my pizza jumped to life andslithered across the table. I tried not to flinch, but I couldn’t help it.Everyone’s laughter covered it up. Then I looked over at the kitchen and saw aguy in a blue T-shirt and a messy white apron drive a skewer through a live,flailing rat. Its arms, legs, and tail continued going through death agony as helowered it into the frying vat. Everything looked like it was passing through asemitransparent filter of rippling geometric patterns and sparks of light. Thecolors were too bright. I was profoundly uncomfortable and terrified that I wasgoing to get caught.As we got up to leave, I saw a perfect, life-sized image of the Hermit from theTarot cards—a bearded man in a gray, hooded robe, carrying a staff and alantern—standing right near Dad. I could see him clearly enough to make out thecoarse, burlap-like texture of his robe. This seemed like an omen of death andmade me feel even worse. A Mediterranean-looking guy with large eyes and thickeyebrows sitting at a table with his friends was now staring at me, but his facewas all messed up. One eye appeared about four inches higher on his face, wellup into his forehead, compared to the other, which had dropped down below hischeek. I was looking right at him, and this Picasso-like image held steady. Hewas very frightened as he looked at me, and I realized that my face probablylooked the same way to him. I gave him a knowing nod, letting him know Iunderstood, and that he looked just as strange to me. Once I got to the arena Ireally had to pee, and the toilet in my stall melted and disappeared—only to popright back seconds later. During the show, I watched as the speakers seemed tomelt over the crowd, forming a giant, black lake, swallowing everyone. I had todeal with several more hours of the trip after I got home, and I couldn’t get tosleep until after sunrise, which was an inevitable side effect.Although I did do psychedelics after this, I was very careful to never takeenough to produce full-visual hallucinations. The potential for a bad trip wasso high that I didn’t dare put myself through it—but smaller doses weren’t muchbetter.LUCID DREAMINGEver since I first tried LSD, I had hoped to get a fully discontinuousout-of-body experience from it—a journey into another reality. It didn’t takelong for me to realize LSD was not the answer to make this happen. I still kepttrying to see if I could ever get a good trip, but even if I did, I was alwaysaware of being in my body, in this reality, and I felt all messed up.Hallucinations were weird and scary, but I thought back to that night I floatedout of my body and could see that I had still never reached the goal. I was veryfortunate to find a copy of Lucid Dreaming by Dr. Stephen LaBerge in abookstore. The subtitle read “How to Become Awake and Aware in Your Dreams.” Dr.LaBerge taught a technique called “Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreaming,” orMILD. First you had to start remembering your dreams, which involved stayingcompletely motionless when you woke up. You would ask yourself where you justwere and what you were doing. Then, you would replay the dream in your head,over and over again, only now you would imagine yourself noticing some strange,impossible detail and realizing that you were dreaming. Dr. LaBerge explainedthat any time you looked at something, looked away, and then looked back, if itwas a dream it would change—and that was your best way of finding out whether itwas a dream.While doing this, you would also mentally repeat the same sentence over and overagain, putting as much meaning and feeling into it as you possibly could: “Nexttime I’m dreaming, I want to remember to recognize I’m dreaming.” Then, if youwere lucky enough, you would fall back asleep and realize that everything aroundyou had changed while you were still saying those words. At this point you couldtest your environment for changes and other impossible things—and if you foundsomething, then you were now in a lucid dream. Best of all, once you foundyourself in this state, you had full godlike abilities in the dream—includinglevitation and telekinesis. You could directly experience what ascension wouldbe like in your real-time, waking life—and it was absolutely fantastic.I put a lot of time into reading LaBerge’s book, understanding the technique,and practicing it—and after only a few tries, I got spectacular results. I couldsoar through the air, walk through walls, travel anywhere I wanted, and lifthuge objects with my mind. I could also completely change my environment just bythinking about something different. I felt a high that was much greater thananything I had ever gotten from drugs. The first time it happened, I foundmyself in the front doorway of the house, right where I had gotten lost fortwenty-six years and appeared to have the facial features of a black man. Nowthere was a single, bare bulb hanging down from the ceiling, which was obviouslydifferent. A black man was sitting there, drenched in sweat and extremely upsetabout something. The bulb had been shattered, but light was still coming out ofit. I realized that bulbs could not give off light without glass around thefilament—and suddenly I became lucid. It was a tremendously wonderfulexperience. I ran outside and levitated over my house, checking out how thetrees and the roof looked from up there.After one lucid dream, I was hooked. I soon realized I could go wherever Iwanted to go, do whatever I wanted to do, and create whatever I wanted tocreate. In my second or third experience, I found myself in a beautiful pasture,and I manifested a good-sized red barn that was filled to the brim withmarijuana. I walked up to the doors, opened them, and was knocked over in anavalanche of sweet-smelling buds. I then manifested a six-inch-wide salad bowl,put a hole at the bottom, attached a bent pipe to the hole, and then created ablowtorch. I packed it full with weed and took a huge hit—but I did not gethigh. I already was.In another case, I created a magnificently futuristic car and went on a joyride,which included being able to punch it into speeds that were unimaginable in mywaking reality. Each experience was magnificent, absolutely real, and would goon for what seemed like well over an hour in some cases. I would fly throughwindows, explore buildings, see people who couldn’t see me, and feel incredible.I needed enough time to get extra sleep, so I typically practiced this on theweekends—and the results were phenomenal.In one of these experiences I started writing everything down that was happeningto me—and I was shocked to discover that all my words were in perfect French. Inormally could not speak it that well in my waking life, but in the dream it wasvery natural, and I knew it was right. I didn’t always think clearly when I waslucid, though, and in that dream I had hoped to be able to bring all my writtenpapers back with me. When I woke up, they were gone, of course. In another dreamI ended up in the local CVS pharmacy, and put on quite a show, where I levitateda group of large trash barrels and started orbiting them around one another. Itwas a larger-scale version of what happened in the movie E.T. I was alwaystrying to talk to people, show them miracles, and let them know we were in adream and none of this was real—but I always had problems. They would listen atfirst, but then some force would come over them, they would blank out, and walkaway as if they had no idea what I had just said. This happened to the entirecrowd of people who saw me levitate the barrels, and it was very bizarre. Itappeared that I was not in full control of my environment.At least two different times, I was flying around having adventures and gotpulled into a highly advanced spacecraft. People with robes were talking to meand we were standing in front of gigantic picture windows. Absolutely fantasticspaceships of unimaginable size drifted past the window. Dr. LaBerge’s book hadtaught me that everything in a lucid dream is created in your brain and none ofit is real—and since he was a scientist I felt he had to be right. So, eventhough I found myself on these magnificent craft, talking to these robed wisemen like the old man from my childhood dreams, I believed they were all aproduct of my subconscious. I would tell them they were illusions right to theirfaces and they would just laugh and smile politely. They were always very kindto me and encouraged me to continue practicing this technique.I was also congratulated for losing weight and was told I had the power tocompletely transform my life. They complimented me for the things I had done tohelp others. I was told that this was what really mattered where they were. Noone ever shamed me or told me I should quit using drugs. I couldn’t imagine thatany of this was actually real, despite how vivid it was, so after I woke up fromsuch an experience I would always laugh about my “weird dreams,” and say, “Mysubconscious sure has a vivid imagination.” By the year 1996 I had establisheddirect telepathic contact with these same people—and I was absolutely shocked todiscover how real all of it had been. They ended up making house calls, andappeared in front of my brother and one of my clients who had received spiritualcounseling from me, in order to prove they really did exist.BANG YOUR HEADSometime after the Dead show, a guy I hardly knew called me up and asked if Iwas going to Brad’s birthday bash. I was deeply hurt, as Brad hadn’t told meanything about it. Don and I went over and crashed the party, and Brad didn’teven try to explain why we were not invited. There were probably forty or fiftypeople there, including many kids I had never seen before, and they had kegs ofbeer. I decided to drink like everyone else, and before long I had downed fouror five Solo picnic cups of beer. All the weed was being smoked down in thebasement, and this was why Brad had asked me if he could borrow my big reddouble-chambered bong the day before. I took a huge, lung-blaster hit andblacked out. I was not aware of falling backward, but I was dimly aware of theback of my skull dribbling like a basketball against the concrete floor. After acouple of eternal seconds, my vision was flooded with about six faces thatlooked very concerned. They sounded like they were all shouting at me through atwenty-foot-long cardboard paper towel tube.It took a while for me to regain full consciousness, and even though I almostcertainly had a concussion, I just got up and kept on drinking and smoking as ifnothing had happened. I became so drunk that when I went to the bathroom to peestanding up, I dropped my pants all the way down to my ankles, and had to leanagainst the wall to keep from falling over. Right then, the class clown Gerryburst into the bathroom—and started laughing and cheering. The story became thatI had “passed out standing up,” even though I was still conscious.HELL TO PAYAfter this epic mess, I got the courage to reconnect with Brenda since I hadbecome a lot thinner. I told her about our band and the Christmas party, eventhough we hadn’t played in months. She called me at my father’s house after Igave her the number and told her I would be there Friday night. I was upstairsin his office and scrambled to find a pad of paper when she was ready to give meher number and continue the conversation. After I hung up, I realized I hadwritten her number down on a promotional paper from the latest Jeff Healey albumrelease, Hell to Pay, supporting his new album due to be released on May 25,1990. There was a guitar in flames on the paper. My conversation with Brenda hadbeen a little strange, and I got the strong sense that if I ever got togetherwith her, she would be extremely confrontational and abusive. The paper seemedto have the answer written right on it—there would be hell to pay. She had beenin a relationship with the same guy who I had shoved through seven desks in myjunior high school fight, and they had since broken up.Shortly after our conversation, some kid called my father, pretended I owed hima lot of money in a drug deal, and threatened to kill my father and me both if Ididn’t pay up. At the time I didn’t know who it was, but it became obvious whenI was putting this book together. This deeply traumatized my father and made himeven more confrontational than he already had been. Every time I saw Dad, therewould be about fifteen minutes of very aggressive confrontation about my gradesand my overall lifestyle. No matter what I did, it happened every single time Isaw him, four times a week. Sometimes in the car he would get so upset he wouldhave to pull over. This made my life far more challenging than it already was.Between my mother, my father, and the kids at school, I felt like my life was anabsolute prison camp—and the only redeeming thing I had was to get even morewasted.On July 5, 1990, I was backstage after the Robert Plant show at theKnickerbocker Arena, supporting his Manic Nirvana album.28[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber27] It was always a challenge getting backstage atthe Knick, but this time we were let right in. The room was swarming with radiostation contest winners who had gotten the unimaginable opportunity to meettheir top idol. I was standing right next to the door, facing this wildspectacle, when there he was—three feet away from me. I could see everyindividual pore on his face. This was the first musician I had the chance tomeet whom I genuinely idolized. A heavyset guy with a bald head, black hair, anda beard was walking with him. “What do you think?” the guy said. “I’d be bloodyeaten alive,” Plant responded. They both turned around and left. I kept my cooland did not try to bother him—but I felt like I had missed the greatestopportunity of my life. The label had given away far too many backstage passes.Even though everyone there wanted to tell Robert how much they loved him, hewould be absolutely overwhelmed by everyone competing for his attention. Onceagain, I saw firsthand proof that being famous can be tremendously upsetting,even for the most seasoned veterans.A GLIMPSE OF DEATH AT THE CROSSROADSOn August 27, 1990, the legendary blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan told hisbandmates that he had a dream where he witnessed his own funeral. It was a hugenight for him, as he and the band were special guests for a concert at theAlpine Valley Music Theatre. Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Robert Cray were allplaying, and my father was there to interview Buddy Guy and the others for abook he was writing. After the concert, two private helicopters were scheduledto whisk everyone away from the surging crowds—and my father was invited. As faras everyone in the family knew, Dad was going to fly out on one of them.There was a delay with the helicopters’ arrival, and when the first one finallyshowed up, Clapton’s crew got on board. Stevie could not wait. Stevie’s brotherJimmie and his brother’s wife, Connie, offered Stevie the last seat. A half mileafter taking off, Stevie’s helicopter crashed into a ski slope and killedeveryone instantly.29 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber28] Dad had gotten thelast-ever interview with Stevie the day before. We found out only after thecrash was announced that Dad had decided to interview Robert Cray and had turneddown the offer to ride in either of the helicopters at the last minute. Thebearded hermit I had seen near my father at the Dead show could have been asymbol of the Angel of Death himself, in an astral form—and my father wasfortunate enough to avoid his grasp. This was another shocking reminder that weare not immortal—and I could feel that same old hermit chasing me as well. Hewas always right nearby, waiting to claim his prize.Brad, Chris, and Baner had pressured me into smoking with them every day overthe summer, since Mom’s weekend restrictions were not in effect—but I didn’tneed much convincing. I slid into my senior year on a very bleak note. I hadbecome one of the “cool” kids for the class of 1990, but now they had allgraduated. Even though I had lost the weight, and was showing up at variousparties, the majority of kids in my own class still saw me as a geek. My crashdiet had gotten rid of the weight, but my addiction had left me with pale,whitish skin and shockingly dark circles under my eyes. The tension with myfather and mother was at an all-time high. I was fighting, arguing, andapologizing every single day. I wore shirts to school that advertised toeveryone that I was doing drugs, like brightly colored tie-dyes with theGrateful Dead dancing bear on them, filled with circles of different shapes,sizes, and colors. Smoking after school was now a guarantee, since I couldbarely stand to get through the day, and home was no better. I also startedsmoking before school, and before long I discovered that if I went to schoolstoned, I had a reasonably good day, but if I went to school sober, I had a badday. However, I would be so messed up in Computer Math, my first-period class,that I needed to cheat off the kid next to me in order to understand what washappening.YOU CAN’T WIN ’EM ALLI now was on my fifth year of French classes, and was one of the best speakersof the language in my grade. This became a huge asset when I was seated in oneof my classes next to a gorgeous red-haired foreign exchange student fromFrance. She and I started talking in French and things were looking really good.One day, she left her little tan leather pouch of pens and pencils behind on herdesk as she quickly got up and left the room after class. I grabbed it and ranafter her to give it back. This was the first time we had ever spoken to eachother in the hallways. She started talking about the prom, and said she had noone to go with her.Instantaneously, I went into a complete panic attack—much like an LSD flashback.My mind exploded with paranoid, looping thoughts. Even though I had lost theweight, I had done nothing to heal the trauma from countless years of bullyingand being told I was worthless. I didn’t have time to do a full analysis,because she had stopped talking and I needed to say something. I felt that Imust have misunderstood her, and she couldn’t possibly be wanting me to ask herout. I felt that if I did ask her, and she said no, I would be so crushed bythat rejection that I could barely handle being alive. I also had a verynegative view of the prom, believing it to be overpriced—and if I had any money,I was putting it toward weed. Don had railed about the stupidity of “paying ahundred and twenty dollars for cold chicken,” and avoiding the prom had becomemy religion. Now I definitely had to say something, and I was in such a panicthere was no way I could summon up the courage to ask her. “Wow, that reallysucks,” I responded. “I hope you can find somebody.”The next day, she completely ignored me—and it quickly became clear that she wasfurious. She never spoke to me again, and acted like I was the biggest scumbagshe had ever met. Then she ended up getting together with a guy who looked a lotlike me, and everyone found out they were going to the prom. This caused me tosuffer profoundly, and to obsess over what had happened for weeks to come. Itwas the first time that I really saw how badly the drugs were messing up mylife. I had always told my friends that I would gladly quit if I found the rightwoman, but now the right woman had come along—and I was so damaged that I hadmissed my big chance.For me, a major part of the ascension process is looking honestly at theproblems you have, and being courageous and powerful enough to confront them.This epic failure with a woman was what led me to understand the saying “You getout of your life what you are willing to put into it” when I was in college. Ifyou lack the courage to take a chance, you never get to see the life you mighthave had. Healing can be an extremely difficult and painful process, as itforces you to go back and identify your original wounds—and see how they arerepeating in the present. In order to get better, you are forced to confront allthe most difficult challenges life presents you with. My other big saying incollege was “Spiritual growth is the hardest thing you will ever do—but also themost rewarding.”THE BOX BUG-OUTOne day after school I got very stoned with a group of people I barely knew. Twoof them were hard-core burnouts from the corner, and the other two were theirgirlfriends. We had two bowls going in opposite directions, so sometimes I hadtwo pipes in my hands at the same time—and I would smoke both of them at once.On the way home, I started having LSD flashbacks. I ended up back on my street,and was seeing the houses all laid out on either side of the road. Garbage canswere lined up in front of the houses. I realized that I hardly knew who any ofthese people were. They were right there all around me, but each of us wasliving our lives in complete isolation.Everyone was living in a box. They would get in a box and drive to another box,where they worked inside a box—a cubicle. Then they got back in the box, droveback to the first box, and turned on another box with dancing, colored lights,which provided them something called “entertainment.” They ate out of a box,threw away the trash in another box, and slept in a box. Then when they died,they would sleep forever—in a box. All the boxes were lined up—the houses andthe trash cans—betraying the truth for all those with eyes to see. The secretwas hiding right out in the open. I felt I had made the greatest discovery sincethe theory of gravity.The full weight of this realization was still hitting me when I walked into thehouse, sat down at the kitchen table, and looked at the clock. Right then, thecool blue digits spelled out 3:33. At that moment, my consciousness radicallychanged. I felt an incredible, surging pressure in my ears, like a subsonicfrequency. Reality suddenly seemed to have been pinched off and turned intosomething far more energetic. I felt myself soaring over my body at the kitchentable, and had the distinct sensation of being in both places at once. Thedigits 3:33 were beaming into my face as I had this incredible experience. Itseemed that the numbers themselves were a very important part of whatever washappening to me. At the time, I did not understand it—but this proved to be myfirst major experience with “numerical synchronicity,” in which I would seerepeating patterns of numbers in the most bizarre, unpredictable circumstances.This would happen five or more times a day and would become a major part of myawakening later in life. Synchronicity would give me messages that I was notalone—and I had powerful, positive spiritual friends who were guiding me andhelping me through life.At the time, I was jamming the gas pedal to the floor and redlining the engineon the road to nowhere—but my spiritual friends had me covered. No matter howbroken, damaged, and beyond all hope I seemed to be, there was a greater forcelooking out for me and protecting me. However, before it could fully revealitself, I had to lift myself out of my own private hell. I still needed to sinka lot farther down before I would finally decide to take better care of myself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENJAILBREAKThe ugly truth was that Don was now paying a lot more than I was to support ourhabit. I could contribute only ten dollars a week, between my five-dollarallowance and the dollar a day I saved from my lunch money. He had become amanager at McDonald’s, working many hours a week. He had hardly any time to dohomework, which caused his grades to suffer. One night, he was high at work,slipped on a bun, and slapped his entire right forearm against the grill on theway down. His arm was horribly burned, causing him to be bandaged up withenormous blisters—and he was unable to work for three weeks. After that, he quitthe job and went into telemarketing. The company changed its name every sixmonths to a year, and was trying to convince senior citizens to donate money sodisabled, institutionalized children could see a magic show. Once you donated,they never, ever stopped bothering you, even if you asked them to take your nameoff the list. Don started doing this every day after school, and it washorrible, as almost everyone he spoke to was filled with hate and would hang upon him. He told me I really needed to pull my own weight and not depend on himto pay for our stuff, and he was right—so I joined him at All-Star Productions.YOU GOTTA FEED THE NEEDEvery day after school, we would smoke weed in Don’s basement, split a hugeeight-cup pot of coffee into two large Pyrex measuring cups, and slam them downbefore heading out to the bus stop, which was right near his house. Don was nowlosing weight just as I had done, and we called this the “Caffeine and CannabisDiet.” We caught the number 52 bus into Schenectady and then used our transferslips to catch the number 5, which took us up State Street. We would pull theyellow cord at our stop, but were not allowed to stand in front of the buildingif we got there early. Instead, we would walk through the cemetery, which wasright next door, and smoke more. One of the graves had fallen in, which wasquite frightening, and it was very creepy to walk around in there, but it wasour best option.The woman running the operation, whom we will call Dee Dee, was enormouslyoverweight. She had a very short gray haircut, a massive double chin, a heavilyupturned nose that made both of her nostrils fully visible, and piercing,heartless blue eyes that constantly scanned you over the top of her grannyglasses. Her potbellied, balding husband, Frank, was hunched way over,completely crushed by her dominance. She ruled over us with an iron fist. Eachweek we were given cash payments in a tiny manila envelope with the amountwritten on the outside. I worked at a little card table and her daughter wasbehind me. Every night Frank would call out, “Five o’clock, time to smile anddial,” as our shift began.Most people would either yell at us or hang up, but some of them were friendlysenior citizens who apologized because they were on a fixed income. I ran thewhole thing like a robot and hardly had to think about what I was saying,freeing up the rest of my mind to go wherever it wanted. I usually got a fewsales a night—some twenty-fives and some tens. Dee Dee’s daughter wasunceasingly friendly on the phone, and did far better than the rest of us. OnTuesdays and Thursdays, Dad would drop me off there after martial arts class,causing me to miss the first ninety minutes of my shift—and I also had Fridaysoff so I could see Dad for the weekend. I made sixty-eight dollars a week on theaverage. Every night I was there, we would work straight through until nine p.m.I wouldn’t make it home until about nine forty-five, by the time I was done withthe bus rides and the walking, so I had to get all my homework done in studyhall in order not to fall behind.This was an extremely depressing and horrible job, but when I did get some realinterest, I felt genuinely happy that I would be helping disabled children havea better life—even just for that one day. I ended up working to help adults andchildren with disabilities for well over a year after I graduated college. Oneof the biggest things on my mind during this time was what schools I was goingto apply to, because I definitely did not want to get stuck working a job likethis for the rest of my life. The idea of not going to school was absolutelyunthinkable, given the incredibly frightening pressure my parents had put on me.I found a copy of Rolling Stone in my father’s stack of magazines that listedthe top ten “party schools” in America, and one of them was only ninety minutesaway—a State University of New York (SUNY) school in New Paltz. I applied for itand got in, since my SAT scores were good and I wrote a creative, insightfulessay about how I wanted to use my education to become a professional writer andpsychologist.Best of all, New Paltz was the closest school to Woodstock—and Grace Slick ofJefferson Airplane had christened the wide-open athletic prairies in the back asthe Tripping Fields. I would be going to school at one of the religiouspilgrimage sites of the Woodstock hippie movement, so it seemed perfect when Igot accepted. I wanted to party, and Rolling Stone told me this was where theparty was. Little did I know that I would end up in the single most alcoholicsuite within the single most alcoholic dorm in one of the single most alcoholicschools in the country, according to Rolling Stone magazine itself. I only foundout about the infamous nature of the suite I lived in from university staff whenI was in my senior year. I still held out for other schools that were moreprestigious, but New Paltz was the only nibble I got—so the choice was made forme.THE CURSE OF CONNIEI started a new band in my senior year of high school with a blues guitaristnamed Jim who had blond hair and a crew cut, and was athletic but definitelycountercultural. We had a few jams at the house and it sounded reallygood—almost like some of the classic Led Zeppelin acoustic blues songs. Beforelong, I found out that Jim had been a punk rocker who had worn studded blackleather and chains, Doc Marten twelve-hole combat boots, and an enormous greenmohawk haircut, with the sides of his head shaved bald, and multiple earrings ineach ear. He had had a terrible LSD experience in a cemetery where a friend ofhis had lain on top of a grave, and a horrible demonic figure had seemed to takeover his friend’s face and body. The demon had then leered at him and tried toattack him. This traumatized him so deeply that his life started fallingapart—and ultimately he was sent to a place called Conifer Park. It was animposing brick institution way out in Glenville, shrouded in pine trees.Within our drug community, everyone called this place “Connie,” and it wasconsidered to be a terrifying dungeon of hell. Your parents would shell out tenthousand dollars for you to leave school and be imprisoned and indoctrinatedthere for an entire month. If you got busted, a judge could force you to go toConnie and your parents had to pay for it—and it cost almost two thousanddollars more than my mother made in half a year. Worst of all, some people whowent to Connie were actually brainwashed into not wanting to get high anymore,and Jim was one of them. He was reaching out to me, smiling a lot and telling meI would be much happier without weed. I felt I was looking at a man who had beencompletely mind-controlled by whatever cult they had formed over at Connie, andI gave him the nickname Jimmychrist, which became the unofficial title of ourband. Jim was such a good musician that I was willing to listen to him roll outhis manifesto each time we met—but once he realized I wasn’t going to stop,Jimmychrist quickly fizzled. We still sat together in school for lunch, but thatwas about it.Don and I had gotten some gooey black opium in a little square of pink plasticwrap as a one-time deal. It wasn’t very powerful and smelled like incense. Wewere smoking it in the basement belonging to a bodybuilder we will call Paul oneafternoon when Paul told us about a bad dream he’d had. He was smoking a pipewhen it suddenly turned into a sickle of death, and began slicing out hismuscles. I knew dreams conveyed powerful meanings, and it probably was true thatweed was reducing his muscle mass. Suddenly, his fundamentalist Christian motherburst in the door, smelled the smoke, and knew exactly what we were doing. Sheglared at Don and asked him what he was hiding in his hand. He said, “A bowl,”and showed it to her with a chuckle. She started screaming, ordered us out ofthe house, and sent Paul to Connie. That was it. After Connie, Paul completelystopped smoking. He had obviously been brainwashed and we felt very bad for him.We were extremely relieved that his mother didn’t try to send us to Connie aswell. We got lucky.Not long after this, we were smoking with Baner and his cousin while Baner wasstaying at a friend’s house. Somehow the cousin’s mother tracked him to ourlocation, and she showed up downstairs while we were all smoking. She saw thather son’s eyes were red, smelled the smoke on him, and he was caught. Shescreamed in Baner’s face, ordered her son to get in the car, and hauled him offto Connie. Once again it seemed like we had narrowly escaped the jaws of death.If she had bothered to come upstairs, she might have spotted us and called thecops, and that would have been it. We would have all faced criminal charges, andthe judge would have either made us “voluntarily” go to Connie or end up in ajuvenile home, which was probably even worse—and could lead to a criminalrecord.The stress of working the full-time telemarketing job and doing all the classesat school became far too much for Don to handle. He completely gave up on goingto class, and like me, he was wearing brightly colored tie-dye hippie clothingto school. Don went even farther than I was willing to go, and wore veryattention-grabbing tie-dye pants with a spiraling pattern of bright white, blue,and pink. He became quite a spectacle for the kids in school, as every day therewould be sightings of him walking around across the street—going to the DairyQueen, smoking cigarettes outside, clutching a cup of coffee, and buying moresmokes at the gas station next door.I started going down to the senior lounge during study hall, and brought mymother’s old Rider-Waite Tarot card deck from the early 1970s to school. Mom hadstopped using them after someone got the Death card when asking about a friendof theirs, and that friend later died in a car crash. I didn’t consider accurateprophecies to be a bad thing—in fact that was exactly what I wanted. Ithoroughly studied both of the books Mom had on giving Tarot card readings,memorized the meaning of every card, and had gotten good at it. Every day Iwould give people Tarot card readings and the results were very impressive,earning me quite a reputation as a freak. People would often try to hide thereal issue they were asking me about, but as soon as I started to interpret thecards they drew, their eyes would widen in amazement. I identified relationshipproblems, issues with their schoolwork, arguments with their friends and family,dreams for their future in college, and even major secrets that would havegotten them in trouble if anyone ever found out. Their palms would addadditional corroborating details. Some kids got so freaked out that they stoodup and walked away, saying, “I can’t do this. I can’t do this!”CRAZY HARRY: AN ADVENTURE IN SEVEN DIMENSIONSI wrote my first fiction story during this time, and would often work on it inschool. Instead of using my computer, I wrote it longhand into a spiral-boundnotebook, which made it look like normal schoolwork. The slowness of longhandwriting made me consider the words far more carefully. My story was based onsome visions I had from using LSD and other psychedelics, as well as theCastenada books and movies like Altered States and Prince of Darkness. The maincharacter was Harry, an anthropologist who had gone to investigate an allegedUFO crash site and found a brain-shaped cactus growing in the crater. Althoughhe could not identify what it was, a Native American shaman told him it was avery rare and special sacrament, and he ended up eating some of it. The cactuscaused Harry to get stuck into a massive, LSD-style trip that never ended—but hestill was trying his best to go to work and live a normal life. The problem wasthat this drug caused him to see what was really going on all around him—boththe good and the bad.Harry was seeing swimmy, geometric patterns all around him, and was plagued withlittle demonic creatures that were everywhere. Most people could not see them,but under the influence of the brain cactus he knew where they were at alltimes. He was really starting to lose control, and would scream and throw thingsat them whenever he saw them. They did whatever they could to terrify him anddrive him crazy. The creatures could only get into his house through a mirror,so Harry had taped cardboard over all the mirrors in his house for protection.On the positive side, he had made friends with one of his houseplants, who hadkind words of encouragement for him—but by far his greatest ally was John, his“house ghost.” This was a being who was assigned to be his guardian angel, moreor less, and watch over him. The house ghost knew Harry had the potential to usehis newfound abilities for positive purposes, but first he had to help Harry gethis life together. They were fighting a spiritual battle—and Harry would beneeded on the front lines.After Harry left for work, John removed the cardboard on one of his full-lengthmirrors and used it as a portal into an alternate reality. Here he was morecomfortable—and could get his own equivalent of the daily news. By John’sleaving the mirror uncovered, a very large and menacing eight-foot-tall demonmanaged to get into Harry’s house—and made the whole situation much moredangerous. The demon was jet-black in color and had reptilian-human features.John was then given an emergency super-charge of new energy in order to fightthe demon. An older, wiser being sat in between two crystal obelisks, and gaveJohn permission to get a major energetic upgrade for the battle. The obeliskswent from obsidian black to bright white and then struck John withlightning—causing him to experience a massive consciousness shift akin toascension.Once the story reached this point, I couldn’t see the rest of it—and it remainedunfinished. I let Brad borrow the notebooks for a couple of days and he wasamazed at the quality of the writing. He told me it was great and I should domore. At the time I had no idea there was any deeper layer to what I waswriting—although it did fit in nicely with the dreams I had as a child.GULF WAR FEARMONGERINGI was still watching TV when I had the chance, such as on weekends, and themedia was involved in tremendous fearmongering. The president of Iraq, SaddamHussein, had invaded the little country of Kuwait, and now the US wasthreatening to attack him if he didn’t withdraw. Every news program I saw aboutthis said that a war was inevitable—and would create a “domino effect,”escalating into biblical Armageddon in the Middle East. Every country would beswept up into the battle, and it would lead to a nuclear war that would destroymost, if not all, of the life on Earth. Every talking head on televisiondescribed this scenario in meticulous detail, complete with charts and graphs,and made it sound as if there was absolutely nothing we could do to stop it.Then, to make matters even worse, the Bush administration was going to strikeIraq as early as January 15, even though we were told this would quickly lead toglobal thermonuclear disaster.My response to this stress was to use drugs and alcohol even more. On the veryminute it became January 15, 1991, the US attacked Iraq in an absolutely massivebombing campaign they called “Shock and Awe”—which sounded exactly like Hitler’sblitzkrieg, or “lightning war.” I ended up standing on a popular intersection ofRoute 50 near the local military base and protesting the new war with our localAmnesty International club. We made picket signs and shouted chants like “NoBlood for Oil.” A surprising number of people honked their horns and waved insupport. Not one person did anything hateful toward us. Even as the governmentwas perpetuating fear and anger, trying to make everyone feel that this war wasessential for our safety and survival, we were getting a surprisingly highamount of goodwill. We could clearly see that the public did not want war, andthey were not falling for the fear-mongering stories being fed to them in themedia.THE SOUND OF HADESShortly after the war started, I was sitting alone on the couch one night whenthere was no work, and I felt a sudden, very strong compulsion to look at thetelevision. It was eight p.m. exactly. Normally I would just feel glad that Irealized it was prime time, and see what there was to watch. Now I was lookingat things a little differently. I already knew that the TV and VCR were givingoff a high-pitched noise, since it bothered me tremendously on LSD—and the pitchhad suddenly changed in frequency. This would be inaudible to most people, butunder the influence of psychedelics I could hear the electricity humming throughthe walls and was very sensitive to sounds that most people’s minds would blockout. This change in pitch happened precisely at eight p.m. I had the sameincredibly cosmic feelings as I had had when I saw the 3:33, except this time itwas extremely negative. I did not turn on the TV.This was not a one-time thing. After I discovered it, I was able to catch ithappening again and again, right at eight p.m., without being under theinfluence of any drugs—and it really freaked me out. Subliminal messages weresupposed to be illegal—but here they were. Someone was doing this—and once youstarted watching television, you were inundated with terror about the Gulf War.From then on, any time I wanted to relax in the living room alone, I wouldunplug the TV and the VCR completely, which was the only way to kill the sound.This also made the commercials seem even more sinister to me than they alreadywere.MISSING OUT ON ALL THE BEST THINGSI started talking to a girl named Debbie, who was very attractive. For a whilewe seemed to be really getting along very well—until I told her I was amarijuana smoker and invited her to a party. She became very upset and wrote mea letter saying she wished she could make me stop. This was quite a shock. Isaved her letter and still have it in my files. It was another sign that I wasonly getting farther and farther away from my goals the more I smoked.Another shocking wake-up call happened on one of the last days of high school,when we had just gotten our yearbooks and everyone was writing their good-byesto one another. A brown-haired, exotic-looking girl I had been very attracted tofor years wrote me a long letter on the right half of an entire page. She spokeabout me in very glowing terms, but the “big reveal” was at the end: “PS. . . .You have absolutely gorgeous eyes.” Although she wanted to pay me a compliment,I was devastated to hear this only after having known her for six years. I hadignored every signal that would have been bright, flashing neon signs for mostnormal guys, including her coming to the house for some of my parties—eventhough she never smoked.TOO MANY CLOSE CALLSOne day I was driving with Don and Bob and Ben in the hippie van. We wereheading up State Street in Schenectady, and all of us were smoking weed.Suddenly, two cop cars simultaneously turned their sirens on. They were behindus and seemed to have arrived out of nowhere. My body surged with so much panicI thought I was going to have a heart attack. Ben pulled the van over, crushedin defeat. All of us felt as if our lives were over. We had enough drugs in thecar to be charged with at least a misdemeanor and felt we were minutes away fromstarting our new lives as convicts. The cop cars then raced on past us, withtheir sirens and lights blazing. All of us breathed out a massive surge ofadrenaline. We were very happy that we didn’t get caught, but we had alreadydied a thousand deaths in the time it took for us to realize that we were notthe ones being pulled over.Things were getting worse and worse for me toward the end of the school year. Iwas completely burned out from going to school, working the telemarketing jobevery night, and having a daily marijuana and caffeine habit. I had Fridaynights off from my job so I could visit my father for the weekend, but there wasa two-hour gap before he would pick me up when I could smoke. That afternoon Ihad a very nasty confrontation with my mother about the house not being cleanenough, followed by a phone call from my father during which he really yelled atme about my grades. I felt completely dead and numb inside. Bob, the bigfootball player, showed up and just walked into my room—but I had nothing tooffer him. I just stared at the wall, my eyes glazed over, and smoked. I did notlook at him or say anything. “You’re a drug addict, man. You need to get somehelp.” That got me talking. Him, of all people. I became very defensive—but whenI thought back on that moment later on, I realized he was right. More and more,I was losing control.THE SENIOR PSYCHEDELIC PICNICWe had a senior picnic on the last day of school before graduation, and Idecided to say good-bye to my prison by taking a yellow micro-dot. This was adrug that was given to patients with severe psychiatric disorders in hospitals,and it was deliberately tiny so it could be inserted in food or swallowed veryeasily. We had certain people on the inside who were smuggling it out andselling it, calling it “mescaline”—and one dot was a very intense trip. As Iwalked along, I was seeing a shadowy, demonic being—like a living cloud ofdarkness—jumping around on the athletic bleachers. It definitely seemed to knowI could see it and it was trying to distract me and capture my attention. Rightthen, a Frisbee slammed into my chest at top speed. It hit me in the sternum,which is the vertical bone in the middle, and pinged off me with a loud noise,flying another twenty-five feet. I was so messed up I just kept on walking, anddidn’t look at the people who threw it or say anything—which made me seemextremely weird to say the least.I told one of the mullet-wearing drug-dealing kids from the corner that I hadtaken a yellow hospital micro-dot. He was on his bike, as was another kid, andhe challenged me to a bike race—even though I didn’t have a bike. We left theschool grounds, since none of us wanted to be there, and I ran with them all theway to the railroad tracks. The micro-dot seemed to eliminate any pain fromathletic exertion, and since my job was to follow them, I held it together eventhough my mind was extremely altered. Once we got to the railroad tracks, westarted smoking—and then a beaver appeared about twenty-five feet away andlooked at us with great curiosity. The guys paused for a few seconds, as if theywere checking to see if this was really real—and then they all started pickingup rocks and trying to kill the beaver. When I refused, they pressured me intothrowing some as well, so I made sure to miss by a huge amount. Thankfully, theywere both too stoned and uncoordinated to hit the beaver, and it quickly fled.We then had another bike race as we returned to the now-empty school, and I wentback inside. I still hadn’t cleared out my locker, and this was my last chance.Everyone else was still outside at the picnic. I walked up to locker number2168, just like always, and rolled in the combination that had been my life forthe last four years: 36-24-36. I pulled up on the latch, opened the door, andlooked at myself in the little mirror. I could hardly believe what I saw. Mypupils were so dilated as to be almost completely black. My skin was extremelypale. I had huge dark circles under my eyes. I was twitchy and had troublestaying still. And worst of all, I was drenched in sweat, and my hair lookedtotally crazy, fanning out in all different directions with drops of liquidfalling off it everywhere. I looked like a severe drug addict, strung out oncrystal meth. It wasn’t good—at all.Then, to make matters even worse, my old AV teacher with the thick glassesshowed up. John was in his late twenties or early thirties, had short blond hairthat once had been very long, and was definitely a geek. Now he walked up to meand he could see I was very, very messed up. He told me to take care of myselfand that I really should get out of there and go home. I knew he was telling methat if anyone saw me like this, I would be immediately arrested. I was so closeto freedom that it would be a shame to ruin my whole life on the very lastminute of the very last day of school. This caused me to have a tremendous panicattack, because I knew he was right. I completely abandoned everything in mylocker, leaving it for the cleanup crew to deal with—all the books, all thehomework papers, any pens or supplies, any clothes, my mirror, you name it—and Ifled. This moment would haunt me in my dreams for the next twenty years, as Iabandoned two pieces of jewelry I had spent countless hours sculpting in class.If I’d had any idea at the time how much that trauma would repeat in nightmares,I would have risked everything to save my art.GRADUATIONWhen I received my high school diploma on stage at the Proctors Theater inSchenectady, it felt completely hollow and empty, despite the roar of the hugecrowd. I had made it out of prison with a degree, but I was a complete mess.Worst of all, I had won the Martin J. Mahoney Award for Personal and AcademicProgress. This was almost certainly because I had lost weight and cut myhair—but in reality, I had just learned to hide my addiction much better thanbefore.During the ceremony, a girl from my homeroom made it very clear that I couldhave had her as my girlfriend if I had bothered to pay attention to all thesignals she was sending me. I was kicking myself inside. Here was yet anotherexample of how disconnected I had become from the things that mattered. Iplanned out my whole night as my friends and I drove away in a car with canstied all down the back on strings, clattering away as we honked the horns andcreated chaos. I ended up tripping, drinking, and smoking at the graduationparty I went to. I hardly remember anything that happened to me that night,other than drinking wine coolers and seeing some kids peeing into the gas tankof the car in the garage. Don had not graduated, and had decided he would justget his GED later on—no big deal.That summer, my whole crew decided to take LSD together and go to anotherpostgraduation party. Brad, Baner, Don, and I were all dosed out. Someone hadtold Don and Baner that you could drink as much as you wanted when you weretripping and you would never get drunk. They ended up playing an extremelydangerous drinking game called Anchorman, in which you bounce quarters into aglass. The “anchorman” on the losing team ends up drinking whatever is left of afull pitcher of beer that his teammate could not finish.30[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber29]Both Baner and Don suffered near-deadly alcohol poisoning from playingAnchorman. Don had gone into a very bad trip, scaring everyone in the party byasking them if they wanted to see a huge Islamic assassination knife called agukari. He ended up being banished outside the house. Then he threw up all overhimself, covering his favorite tie-dye outfit in red, horrible-smellingbeer-and-pizza vomit. He had definitely acted very threatening toward me earlierin the party, when he was going through the worst part of his trip, and I didnot want to see him.Baner was camped out with his head over a toilet, and had three beautiful womenthere to nurse him. By this point, the number of women he had slept with wasover eighty. He figured out the approximate number only after an extensiveinterview from Brad during which he tried to recall each girl one by one. Hedrunkenly waved one finger at me as I walked by, smiled, and did not speak. Hiseyes were barely able to open. Girls started telling me that Don was begging formy help outside and I really should go out and see him, so I finally did. I hadno idea how bad it was going to be. Don was so drunk he could barely move, andwas sprawled out on the wheelchair-accessible ramp, with one of his legs drapingover the side. The gukari had gone missing and we never saw it again. After Igot his ruined jacket and long-sleeved shirt off, leaving just a T-shirt andpants, I rinsed them off in the bathtub and dragged him into the house.This was where things got crazy. Don was so severely alcohol-poisoned that hehad become blind. His field of vision was completely black. He couldn’t see myface or anything in front of him, even with his glasses on—although he couldhear my voice. His heartbeat was irregular and he was terrified that he wasgoing to die. Since I was having a wildly intense bad trip, this seemed to go onfor thirty hours’ worth of psychological time.He was crying and begging me to call his girlfriend, even though by this pointit was one forty-five a.m. I told him if he did that, both of us were going tojail or Connie. I knew he had vomited out the alcohol already, and I tried toget him hydrated. The most shocking aspect of what happened was that everyonejust stepped over us as if we weren’t even there. Not one person asked me if Ineeded anything or if he was okay. I had what seemed like countless hours toreflect on how disconnected we are from one another. I finally walked him homeat sunrise, and thankfully there was no one out on the roads that Sundaymorning—only the birds and the squirrels. It took well over an hour to get himhome because he could barely walk, and I was still under the influence theentire time. I never got a chance to sleep before having to spend the whole daywith my father at an outdoor concert. I felt my life slipping away. It was onlya matter of time before I either died or got arrested.In order to keep my parents happy, I took a depressing job at Eat at Joe’s, ahot dog and ice-cream vendor at the Rotterdam Square Mall. One slow night Idecided to drink seventeen cups of oily black coffee in a row to see if I couldget high from it. I became extremely agitated and nervous, started breathing toomuch, and then crashed tremendously after about an hour and a half. I soonbecame so tired that I could barely move my arms. A gallon bucket of chocolatesauce dumped all over the floor because I did not have enough strength to carryit.Right then, a hefty guy with a baseball cap came up with an army of kids andordered nine different ice-cream cones. He listed off the order at an extremelyhigh speed, as if I had a photographic memory for flavors, sprinkles, andsauces. I was so overwhelmed that I told him “one at a time” in an irritatedtone of voice. That night, I dropped LSD at eleven thirty p.m. and had ahorrible experience. I was unable to sleep as my heart slammed in my chest andthe ceiling squirmed. I had to go back to work the next afternoon, had neverslept, and was still under the influence. My manager looked like the ultimateheroin junkie, with pale skin, very dark circles under his eyes, and severalmissing teeth. He went into a total psychopathic rage, screaming at me with amurderous, demonic face, because the ice-cream guy had come back to complainabout my attitude. I apologized in stunned terror and continued working there asif nothing had happened.That same summer, MTV was airing a very sarcastic, shaming commercial—and forme, it was the last straw. There was a black screen with dramatic music and aseries of words. Each set of words would appear long enough to read, fade out,and then the next set would appear. In total, it said: “These are words. Theycould be doing something funny, or cool, or interesting. But they’re not.They’re just sitting there. LIKE YOU.” This made me very angry. I worked hardand watched MTV only when I had some precious time to relax. Television hadnothing to offer me, and I quit. I didn’t own one when I went to college and Ididn’t care. Now I am glad to be a force for good by starring in Ancient Alienson the History Channel, and sharing information that can help wake people upfrom the lies and myths of mainstream reality. Television is a tool forcommunication, and we still need more shows that help raise our collectiveconsciousness. One of the greatest secrets many insiders revealed to me is thatthe laws of physics respond directly to our thoughts and beliefs. If enough ofus believe we can fly, we may authorize the laws of physics to allow that tostart happening on a large-scale level.We continued taking martial arts classes right up until I was going to startcollege. Dad decided that he and Michael would stop going after I left. Ourfinal test was to receive three perfect punches, with focus, directly into thesolar plexus while we were in Spirit, holding our basic stance. A perfect punchto the solar plexus is bad enough, but once you add focus it will dangerouslyknock the air out of your lungs if you are not trained. When the time came, Itook a huge, sharp inhale through my nose, locked my abdominal muscles into awall, punched into my stance, and went as strongly into Spirit as I ever had. Myconsciousness was dramatically altered. Time slowed down. I had “tunnel vision”and the feeling of electrical tingles all over my body. Huge impulses ofmovement surged through my body as each punch connected—but I did not feel pain,and I did not break my stance. I had passed the final test. I was ready.NO ONE NOTICED THE WAR WAS OVERI was going through a short summer orientation at New Paltz in 1991 when theSoviet Union collapsed. I was eating lunch in the Hasbrouck Dining Hall as tankswere advancing on the Kremlin. This was the end of the threat of nuclear war aswe knew it—or at least it greatly reduced the risk. The media had built the USSRup to be the greatest super-villain of all time, equal to the US in everyway—and now it was falling. Most of the incoming freshmen were drinking and afair number were smoking weed—and no one seemed to care. I was one of the onlypeople actually watching what was going on. Everyone else seemed bored,depressed, and uninvolved in their lives. I almost wanted to jump up on thetable and yell at everyone: “Do you see what is going on here? Do you understandwhat this is? The greatest super-villain of the twentieth century—our nuclearnemesis—is collapsing right before your eyes! Can I get a hip-hip-hooray?”That was much too radical of an idea. If these kids couldn’t see what washappening, and that this would make our planet much safer, there wasn’t much Icould do for them. This was a party school, and the majority of kids weredrinking and doing drugs. Insiders later told me that this scene was exactlywhat the Cabal wanted. By traumatizing the public repeatedly enough, most peoplewill resort to alcohol, pharmaceuticals, and other drugs to numb the pain.Eventually their senses become so deadened that even a very positive burst ofnews cannot penetrate the gloom. They no longer pose any threat to tyranny andwill just lie there and let themselves be conquered. Psychologists call this“learned helplessness.” I also realized that the military-industrial complexmust have seen this collapse coming, since the USSR had been fragmenting for atleast the last year and a half. My parents always told me you need to line up anew job before you quit the old one. The elite’s new job was Iraq—but the“domino effect” never happened. Although many nations sent troops to support thewar effort in Iraq, there was no Armageddon in the Middle East. I took anotherbite of my sandwich, chewed quietly, and continued watching the little screenalone."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEHITTING BOTTOMAt some point back in the 1960s, the New Paltz administration wrote updescriptions for each of the dorms you had to choose from as a college freshman.Allow me to translate what my eyes saw as I read each one. There was Deyo, themulticultural dorm; Bevier, the jock dorm; LeFevre, the fraternity-sororitygateway dorm; Crispell, the dork-study dorm; and DuBois, the party animal dorm.I was later told that the original written descriptions seemed to fit thedifferent types of students quite well, and people naturally sorted themselvesout. There was no question that I was going to live in DuBois, which everyonecalled “Doobie Hall”—and on my first day, I moved into Room B of Suite 212.THE THREE-MAN WRECKING CREWSuite 212 DuBois was a four-room suite, where we all shared a large common area.Each room was occupied by two students, so there was never any real privacy.Most freshman suites only had three rooms, but we got lucky because we were onthe corner facing the stream. This gave us a much larger common area that wasperfect for throwing huge parties. Somehow we acquired battered old couches anda large, oval table, so about fifteen people could sit comfortably by the windowand still leave a large space over by the bathroom. If you packed people intothe suite tightly, you could probably squeeze about a hundred drunk kids inthere—which we later proved scientifically. The cards were stacked against us,as New Paltz had a freshman class size of two thousand and a graduating classsize of two hundred. The numbers did not lie. Nine out of ten of us were notgoing to make it. I didn’t dare let myself become a statistic due to how much Ifeared my parents’ wrath.My new suitemates were almost all from New York City, which was far moredangerous than my own upstate area. To them I was the equivalent of a redneck.They immediately sensed weakness in me and took huge advantage of it. Everyonehad just escaped prison, and it was time to celebrate. All but two of mysuitemates started walking down to the corner store and buying forty-ouncebottles of malt liquor every night but Monday and maybe Tuesday. This was quitesurprising, as no one in my school drank such nasty stuff. I thought it wassomething homeless bums would use to get drunk, because it was so cheap and thebottle was so large. I discovered that it was basically beer spiked with hardliquor, meaning it had twice as much alcohol as normal beer. Drinking one “40,”as they called it, was nearly equivalent to downing a twelve-pack. Some of thehardest drinkers were actually buying two bottles a night, and would nearly makeit through both of them. Everyone usually bought Old English, or “OE,” but someused another brand called St. Ides.The frothy brew tasted absolutely terrible, and they all needed an incentive topound it down. This came in the form of a very loud drinking game called ThreeMan that they played almost every night. Each person took a turn rolling twodice, and there were very complex rules. The first person to roll a three becamethe Three Man, and the game began. Any time a three or a one and two wererolled, the Three Man had to drink. If you rolled a seven, the person to theleft of you had to drink. If you rolled a nine, everyone would cry out,“Social,” and they all had to drink. If you rolled an eleven, the person to theright of you had to drink. If someone rolled a four and a one, everyone had torush to touch their noses, and the last person to do it had to drink. You werenot allowed to point your finger, say the word “drink,” or drop the dice off thetable. Instead, you had to point with your elbow and say “consume.” If you brokethese rules, you became the dreaded “shitty,” which meant you were expected toget so drunk you would soil yourself. Every time the dice didn’t add up toanything useful, this unlucky soul had to drink. Anyone who rolled doublesgained the power to curse someone with this role.How do you get homework done when a huge crew of college kids are playing ThreeMan in your living room? You don’t. I knew I needed to get an education, as Ifeared terrible reprisal at home if I did not pass. So, by the second or thirdnight, I realized I had a huge fight on my hands. There was incredible bullyingand peer pressure to get me to play Three Man. And, on those few occasions whereI actually agreed to do it, they would try to make me the designatedpants-pooper as soon as possible. This caused me to get up and walk out on thegame more than once, which infuriated them and was akin to betraying God.Our floor quickly became so covered with rotting beer that you had to peel eachfoot up in order to walk, making a ripping noise. There was a disgusting ragcalled the “Mung Towel” that was used to mop up beer spills. The Mung was neverwashed, and radiated putrescent odors from its lair under the couch. I decidedthere was only so much filth I could tolerate, so I swept the floor and cleanedup all the food garbage, cigarette butts, and empty beer bottles that litteredthe room each morning. This was a marvelous miracle for my alcoholic suitemates,who had now turned the most-hated guy in the room into their slave—by his ownfree will. Never again did they clean up a single piece of the waste they leftbehind. If I went on strike and refused to do it, they would just re-inhabit thefilth each new night and play Three Man again, doubling the amount of garbage.It was absolutely impossible to get them to clean up after themselves, no matterhow hard I tried. There were no fights involved, so my martial arts trainingcould not defend me.Never before had I been bullied so often or intensely. I hated myself every timeI cleaned up the suite, only to have them repeat the process each night. Myreaction to this trauma was to start smoking weed a lot more often. The ThreeMan crew called me a drug addict and I just laughed. Luckily I had gotten awork-study grant, which allowed me to work up to twenty hours a week on campus.The cramped office in the Humanities building that first offered me the job hadthe happy smell of old paper. The lady there had dark-colored librarian glasseson a string, short black hair with wisps of gray, and a warm smile. “What job doyou want to do?” she asked me. “Whatever makes the most money,” I replied. Theanswer was Warehouse 2 Receiving Department, where I would deliver shipments ofsupplies to all the different departments on campus. It involved far more hardlabor than any of the other jobs, and this would help me build muscle mass.“I’ll take it.”THE PSYCHEDELIC DELIVERY MANMy class schedule gave me the chance to work five days a week, from one to fivep.m. The warehouse was huge, and had rows and rows of shelves with schoolsupplies on them. Two pallets were laid out near the front and all the day’sorders were placed on them. My job was to use a pallet jack to move them over tothe loading dock and carry the boxes down into the truck. The boss was ahard-drinking, overweight man who was nearing retirement age and still wore atight military crew cut. The deliveryman, Billy, was disabled, causing him to bementally “slow,” and the boss had been drinking buddies with Billy in highschool. Billy’s eyes were too close together and they looked unusually largethrough the thick lenses of his black-rimmed 1950s-style glasses. Billy had ashort military haircut, always wore the same baseball cap, had a giganticGermanic jaw and a very pronounced Southern accent—which is extremely rare inNew York State. He still lived with his mother, and always had a story aboutsomething he or she had seen on TV that illustrated how stupid certain peoplewere.Billy ended up becoming like a father to me, and we made a great team. I endedup working with him for all four years I was in school. His extreme accent, slowtalking speed, and offbeat sense of humor made the time I spent with himhilarious, surreal, and psychedelic—and during that first year I always smokedbefore work. I was never allowed to drive the van—that was Billy’s thing—and Ididn’t want to. I even learned to appreciate the country music that would alwaysbe playing, though I turned it off when Billy would go in by himself to deliversomething small. The song that played the most during that first year was“Rodeo” by Garth Brooks. Each day we had to visit up to twenty differentbuildings. Billy would come up with a funny story, either something he saw onthe news or some campus gossip, and retell it at each stop. I played along andset the joke up beautifully, so no one knew I had already heard it ten othertimes. Billy had almost gotten into a relationship with a woman in the musicdepartment, and there was always strained conversation and a wistful sadnessafter we would make a delivery there—but he would still deliver the joke to thebest of his ability, hoping for one more chance.The receiving job introduced me to many of the campus staff, a variety of guysin the maintenance crew, and the truckers who would make deliveries. I was trulysurprised to discover that many of these adults were just like children—onlythey were using different types of drugs and alcohol and working adult jobs. Ihad thought that people would “grow up” after high school, but I realized I wasalready more mature than most of the truckers and maintenance crew were. Thepeople who worked in the campus buildings were not so obviously immature, buteven there I realized they had massive insecurities, anxiety problems,ignorance, and prejudices. This came as a great surprise.THE PCB TIME BOMBI also noticed that most of the buildings had large power transformers next tothem on the ground level. There were ominous-looking yellow stickers that saidWARNING: CONTAINS PCBS, and then went on to describe that this was an extremelydangerous environmental toxin. If the transformers burned, the fire departmentwas not supposed to hit them with water. Electrical fires become much worse whenthey get wet. Furthermore, if these transformers ever burned, special protocolswere required to avoid an environmental disaster. Burning PCBs would turn into adeadly chemical called dioxin, which could kill the human body if inhaled in aslittle as one particle per billion. The stickers were small and easily forgottenby most people—and I was getting incredibly ominous ESP hits off these stickersevery time I saw them.I told Billy that we should warn the fire department about this, because thetransformers had been there for more than twenty years and they could easilyhave been forgotten. “They know what to do,” he told me. “Don’t worry about it.”That didn’t make me feel any better—but I never took personal responsibility toeither call the fire department or remind them about it in person. I washorrified when my urgent visions came true right after the semester ended, and Iwill tell you what happened a bit later in our story. This tragic event became apowerful wake-up call for me to take my ESP more seriously and use it to helpothers. Years later, I bravely published prophecies on my site that accuratelydescribed events like 9/11 and Fukushima in advance. Although these events stillhappened, the clear, documented prophecies on my site demonstrated that humanbeings do have this ability. That in turn means that we need to rethink manyassumptions about reality that most people still embrace as if they were ferventreligious beliefs.THE HASBROUCK BLAHThe environment in my suite was so toxic that I soon began smoking five or sixtimes a day to cope with the stress. The first one was around twelve thirty totwelve forty-five, giving me just barely enough time to hustle over to my job. Iwould do it again at five fifteen, right after work, and again at six fifteenbefore I left for my one meal of the day in the Hasbrouck Dining Hall. I wouldthen have my strongest session at seven thirty to eight p.m. in order to fightwhat everyone called the “Hasbrouck Blah.” Two of my hard-drinking suitemateswere also weed smokers, and encouraged me to start doing a “late-night light-up”at some point after ten p.m. to help me get to sleep with all the noise goingon. They also told me to try the “wake and bake,” where I did it when I firstgot up—but this didn’t stick. After all, I wasn’t a drug addict.One night I was so high in the Hasbrouck Dining Hall that my hand went limpwhile I was holding on to a drinking glass. I tried to catch it on the way downand it shattered, causing a deep cut into my pinky. I wrapped it in a napkin andnever got stitches. It never fully healed properly until I started playingfingerstyle guitar in my late thirties. I also tried to cut my hair when I wasreally high, so all my money could go to weed. I got the front and sides lookingright, but then blindly went after the back, grabbing pieces haphazardly andchopping them with the scissors. I ended up with bald patches on the back of myhead. One of the girls from the suite next door, who was always playing ThreeMan, gave me a haircut—and ended up shaving the sides and back of my head bald,leaving me with hair only on the top. This increased the bullying even more, andmade the two of us look like a team, as she had the same hairdo—popularized byRobert Smith from The Cure. Everyone immediately called me “Beaker,” like theparanoid, flame-haired character from The Muppet Show.My first class was the Modern World, and after a week or two it was a ghosttown. You could already see who the 90 percent would be who would nevergraduate, as they never made it to class. However, before long I ended upchoosing to sleep in, since I was so busy getting wasted each night. As long asI studied, I could pass the tests, and attendance was obviously not required. Myalarm would go off, I would wake up, turn it off, decide I was too tired, andset it again for my next class.“CIVIL WAR”: NOT JUST A SCIENCE-FICTION STORYOne of my classes was called the Art of the Short Story, and it was my favorite.I had always gotten an A on every written assignment in school, no matter howlittle time I gave myself to finish it. I ended up writing a science-fictionstory called “Civil War” that got rave reviews from the professor, apart fromsome minor errors I had in sentence mechanics and revealing too much at thebeginning. I was influenced by the books I was reading at the time, such as theCarlos Castenada series, which proposed that the soul was an egg-shaped energybody composed of different strands that corresponded to various aspects of thepersonality. The full vision I had for the story was far greater than what I wasactually able to put into words, but I did fairly well in capturing the essenceof it at the time. Here I will fill in more of the details that I was seeing inmy mind, but that never made it onto the page when it was first written.Although this story seemed to be nothing more than an elaborate exercise inscience fiction and movie-like storytelling, I was dazzled years later todiscover that it had many correlations with the material I would end up readingin the Law of One series. The Law of One was an intuitively derived series of106 question-and-answer sessions between an alleged ET intelligence and aphysics professor named Dr. Don Elkins. Much of my life’s work has been devotedto validating the scientific model presented in the Law of One series—whichpresents a vastly more interesting view of reality than what most people nowtake for granted.My story opens with an old man falling asleep on the front porch of his house inthe desert. A silvery UFO sweeps overhead and lands on the hard-baked earth,causing him extreme terror. Deep memories begin stirring within him. Although hecannot remember what this object is, he knows something is seriously wrong. Heis in terrible danger. An extraterrestrial slowly climbs out of the ship andcreeps toward him, thinking he is asleep and hoping for the element of surprise.This was going to be a murder, not an abduction. The man silently clutches hisshotgun while pretending to still be asleep. Once the frightening being getswithin range, BOOM—the farmer suddenly springs up and blasts it to bits with hisshotgun.Ancient memories start flooding the man’s mind as he runs toward the UFO. If hecan make it inside and take control of the ship, he will gain access to itsincredibly advanced technology. He pauses for a moment to touch the remarkablemetallic surface of the disc, marveling at its appearance. He reaches up to pullhimself inside. As he heaves his body up into the craft, a hand shoots out andgrips him with painful force. To his horror, a copilot is waiting inside. He isthrown into the interior of the craft and has no time to enjoy looking at itsremarkable technology, as now he is in a fight to the death. He struggles andwrestles on the ground with the being. In this frenzied state, he studies hisattacker and realizes it cannot breathe our atmosphere. It is wearing a spacesuit that is supplying its own breathable air.He grabs a breathing hose on the extraterrestrial’s suit and violently rips itout, causing air to hiss loudly. At this moment, an unspeakable tragedy strikes.The old man was so focused on ripping out the hose that he didn’t see thecopilot reaching for his weapon. The copilot fires off a shot—and disintegratesthe old man’s body from the neck down.Any normal human being would have died, but the old man was something verydifferent. Much to the horror of his attacker, the old man’s head is nowfloating in the air, hovering by some mysterious force, and very much stillalive. The old man laughs and smiles at the being. It is too late. He opens hismouth and releases a foggy green mist, which travels through space as if it werealive and conscious. The mist quickly fights its way into the extraterrestrial’sbreathing hose. WHAM!The old man suddenly regains consciousness inside the extraterrestrial’sbody—and he is in serious trouble. The body is deeply damaged and on the brinkof death from losing its air supply. In a frantic panic, he reaches for the airhose and is able to reattach it. He takes a long, luxurious breath of air thatwould have smelled quite foul to him just moments before. He tries out his newarms and legs and notices this body is much stronger and more flexible. Ancientmemories return to his awareness—and the results are remarkable. He had spenthis entire life thinking he was an ordinary human being just like everyone else,but now he remembers that he is far more than that. He is an ancient relative ofthese same beings that had just tried to kill him.His mind reels with ecstasy as the memories come flooding back. Finally he cansee his ancient homeworld once more. There were staggering towers and domes ofcrystal. The technology was incredibly advanced. The skies were filled withextremely agile and beautiful craft. Teleportation technology allowedinstantaneous travel anywhere you wished. You could eat any meal you wanted andcreate any object you wanted with materializer technology. Everyone wore “smartclothes” that kept them clean and protected them from danger.Despite these wonderful advances, he knew he was living in a sick society. Apowerful elite ruled over everyone with ruthless force. Their laws and beliefscould not be questioned, and anyone who disagreed with them was tortured orkilled. They were obsessed with invading and conquering other worlds, andbelieved it was their divine right and their destiny, as they were the elite.Once they conquered a new world, they would bring them advanced technology,written language, mathematics, and civilization. They would establish themselvesas the ruling elite and get these people to mine the supplies and raw materialsthey needed to help build their technology.The problem was that not everyone liked what was going on. Even the threat oftorture and death was not enough to prevent a massive rebellion from growing. Asizable portion of the public simply did not want to make war. They usedemotional arguments to encourage patience, forgiveness, and tolerance of others.They spoke of love, brotherhood, and fellowship, and the need to respect others.The elite realized they had a huge problem on their hands. This revolution wasspreading and it was all based on these petty, ridiculous emotions. More andmore of their subjects were coming to adopt the new beliefs. Something had to bedone.The elite had been experimenting with a technology that allowed them totransmigrate the soul of a being from one body to another, or even into acomputer system. They had discovered that the body was animated by an energeticcomponent that was pure information, and could live on its own without the body.The information itself was alive. The information was sentient and conscious.The personality was not just a function of the body and brain—much of it wascontained in this energetic body. One of their scientists had discovered thatthis energy body was divided into different strands of light, and each strandcorresponded to some aspect of the personality structure, such as the emotions.This led to what the elite felt was an incredible idea. They could use theirtransmigration technology to remove certain parts of the energetic body fromtheir subjects, while leaving the others intact. Emotions were a deadly weaknessthat needed to be completely removed. Only then would logic and reason prevail.Logic dictated that the needs of the collective outweighed the needs of theindividuals they conquered. They were a superior race and every planet theyinvaded would heavily benefit from their glorious endowments. In secret, theydeveloped a highly classified program where they could strike against their ownpeople, and remove the emotional strands of their energetic bodies—eliminatinglove, hate, joy, sadness, hope, and fear. Without the burden of emotions, theywould be far more effective as a conquering race.Their only problem was that they could not destroy these strands of the soul.The strands existed as pure information that could travel anywhere in theuniverse and could never be destroyed. Their only option was to create a vastcontainment facility to keep these fragments imprisoned in an eternal stasisfield, deep underground. Massive treatment centers were set up, and everyone wasforced to go through the process. They were unaware of what was going to be doneto them, and by the time the word spread around it was already too late. Theyemerged from the treatment chambers having the cold, hard logic of a predatoryanimal—and laughed in victory about the weakness they had finally shed.The emotional strands were all held in the containment facility under a powerfulforce field, sentenced to an eternity of confinement. However, the elite’s planhad a critical flaw that they did not fully understand until they actuallyimplemented it. The emotional strands maintained enough of the spark of divinitythat they became self-aware—and formed their own identities and personalities.They were able to learn, grow, and develop on their own, much like children.They were aware of what had been done to them and knew they were now being keptin a terrible prison. And more than anything, they wanted to be free.No one was entirely sure how long they had been trapped in there, as they hadbeen entirely cut off from the outside world. Their parent civilization hadbecome far more effective without the burden of emotions and was conqueringmultiple worlds. The people inside the prison were intensely focused on devisinga means of escape—and finally they discovered how to do it. Since they existedonly as energy, they were ultimately nothing more than a portion of the universethat vibrated at a certain frequency. The prison was built to contain energythat existed at that frequency only. If they could increase their vibrationalfrequency to a high enough level, the prison walls could no longer contain them.Once the concept was introduced, it was discovered that the vibrational upgradeprocess was extremely difficult. Years of intense meditation and focus wererequired—but it did work. As each soul freed itself, it could then flythroughout the galaxy and go to any other inhabited world it wished. It wouldspend time scanning the people and looking for someone who was sensitive andintelligent enough to be a good match. This being could then merge with thatperson, forming a soul connection. The person’s conscious mind would change,becoming more advanced—without really knowing why. The person would notunderstand exactly what had happened to them, but they would realize that theywere different. They would now have unusual insights, powerful experiences,psychic abilities, and a sense of never quite fitting in. The elite soon becameaware that this had happened, and began a massive, systematic plan to hunt downthe survivors and exterminate every person who had experienced this merger—nomatter how far away in the galaxy they were.The ancient plan of the survivors was to recapture one of the ships from theirhome civilization. Once they had access to this technology, they could disarmthe protective grids around their world and return to free the rest of theirpeople who were still imprisoned. Once the walls of the prison broke down, thepeople would immediately reunite with their civilization. They had spent eons oftime going through a spiritual evolution, and thus they would be returning witha much higher viewpoint than they had before.The old man was the very first among their people to finally succeed in takingon a body and regaining control of a ship. He felt the awesome gravity of therole he now found himself in. He used the ship’s computer to send out atelepathic beacon to all his fellow survivors scattered throughout the galaxy.Now was the time. In a stunning, resplendent moment, they left the bodies theyhad been sharing consciousness with and portaled themselves into a specialholding area in the ship. This was essentially a miniature version of theunderground containment facility on their homeworld, and could hold their entirepopulation quite comfortably in a very small space, since they existed as pureenergy. The old man slid his hands over the controls and made a quick portaljump back to their home planet. Our story ends as they are about to deactivatethe prison’s energy grid, release themselves into the atmosphere, and reoccupythe bodies they had been expelled from. This stunning moment would propel theirentire species into a new level of evolution—and finally bring an end to thewars they had been working to eliminate before they were captured, removed, andimprisoned.This ascension-styled ending was heavily influenced by the Jim Henson movie TheDark Crystal, but I was very happy with it—and the professor thought it wasterrific. Years later much of this story would take on far greater significancethan I could have ever imagined while I was writing it.FONDUE IS FUNAlthough I was having a great time in my worlds of fantasy, the reality of mycollege experience was that I had never suffered so badly in my entire life. Mysuitemates saw my emotions as weaknesses, and were systematically trying to wearme down until I became a numbed-out alcoholic just like they were. As I waswriting this book, I realized that my short story was partly a subconscious,symbolic retelling of what I was going through on campus, and could be analyzedas if it were a dream. In the early stages of developing the ability to predictthe future, your data comes in heavily symbolic and “encrypted” forms. Anotherconfusing thing for newcomers to understand is that single symbols in a dreamcan have multiple meanings, and each of those meanings are relevant to theoverall message. It takes a great deal more work to refine the technique to thepoint where you can pinpoint specific details very precisely—and by 1996 I wouldbecome quite good at it.I was the old man from the country in my story. The Three Man crew were theextraterrestrials driving around in their shiny vehicles. They were activelytrying to destroy me, and had almost succeeded in turning me into an alcoholic.At the time, I felt that if I could get them smoking marijuana, it would starthealing their emotions. Hence in my story, the old man was able to affect themind of the extraterrestrial through the power of a green-colored smoke, evenafter he seemed to have been defeated. My short story may also have been anotherprophecy of toxic smoke being released from the PCB-laced transformers just amonth later—triggering a profoundly unpleasant but powerful emotional awakeningthroughout the drug-addled community of students on campus. Everyone wasextremely terrified that they were breathing toxins, and no one trusted thegovernment. This in turn broke the denial and forced us to deal with oursuppressed emotions, caused by a lifetime of growing up in a mass nuclearsuicide cult.So many outrageous and upsetting things happened in this one semester alone thatI would need a whole book to explain them in detail. My suitemates started goingto drinking parties off campus, and occasionally I would go with them for anadventure. One night we all went to a party where you could spear little piecesof bread and dip them into cheese and chocolate fondue. I drank about five winecoolers while I was there, as well as smoking a lot of weed. When I got back tothe suite, I became horribly sick. All my suitemates gathered around thebathroom, cheering and laughing and taunting me as I retched. I was routinelytaking care of anyone who vomited with the same skill and grace that my motherhad shown me, and I was horrified that they were treating me this way. I criedin disbelief at what was happening, and they just kept on laughing.In this same semester, my suitemates started bullying me even more about women Ihad hooked up with. This was especially hurtful as I later overheard a girl whoI had slept with talking with her friend, who was saying very insulting thingsabout me. “He is very immature. He doesn’t know what the hell he is doing withhis life. He has a massive drug addiction and refuses to see it for what it is.I’m afraid he’s only going to get worse and worse and may even end up killinghimself.” Although this caused me to feel furious inside, I realize now that Ihad gotten angry because it was the truth. She was breaking through my denial,and I couldn’t ignore what she was saying. I was destroying myself faster thanever, and it was extremely obvious to everyone around me. Somehow I knew thatreconnecting with my emotions, no matter how painful that might be, was the keyto healing myself and finally understanding the cosmic dreams and visions of myyouth. My fiction story was a symbolic blueprint of what I would need to do toheal and reunify myself.WINTER WONDERLANDBen, Don, and Bob came to drive me home in the hippie van for the winter breakof my freshman year. It had no heat, and my legs were in terrible pain from thecold. I ended up staying out until five a.m. every night smoking weed andoccasionally drinking, and wouldn’t wake up until two p.m. the next day. Thisinfuriated my mother. She tried to demand that I get up earlier, but I refused.I had already made my “jailbreak”—and even if she yelled at me, it was only acouple of weeks before I was right back to freedom.During break, a car lost control on the ice and skidded into a telephone polenext to the campus. The pole was completely knocked over, severing all theelectrical wires. This caused the current in the transformers to keep buildingand building, with no way to discharge. They were filled with PCB-laced toxicoil from General Electric as a coolant—just as the warning signs had said. Thetransformers became hotter and hotter until they finally overheated andexploded. Deadly dioxin gas was released into the air. The clueless firedepartment had no idea what they were getting themselves into, and fought thetransformer fires the way they always did—by dousing them with tens of thousandsof gallons of water. If I had acted on my prophetic visions from as little as aweek and a half beforehand, our entire campus may have been spared a horrificcatastrophe. If the firefighters had used special fire-retardant foam instead ofwater, the transformers may never have overheated enough to release deadlydioxins into the atmosphere, the soil, and the groundwater supply.By the time someone figured out what had happened, it was an enormousenvironmental disaster. A few students were still on campus. A rapid-reactioncrisis team arrived wearing full-body toxic-waste moon-suits, complete withround glass eyes and gas masks. This was very similar-looking to the suit I hadimagined the extraterrestrials wearing when I wrote my story, complete with theclosed-loop internal breathing system. These moon-suited men had forciblyremoved anyone still inside the dorms—just like the ET had come to attack theold man on the porch. The victims were stripped bare naked in the winter cold,and hosed down in three different rubber swimming pools, one by one—much likethe old man’s entire body was sprayed with phaser fire in my dream anddestroyed. Symbolically, the trauma and humiliation of this experience was aform of death for these kids, as they didn’t even know if they were going tosurvive the chemical exposure. The water in the pools was then deposited intoxic waste drums to be processed and disposed of.This was a government-run New York State institution, and they should haveclosed school for at least an entire semester, but in doing so, they would havelost millions of dollars in revenues from that one semester alone. Many studentswould have transferred to other universities and the school would have gained ahorrible reputation as a toxic waste dump, damaging their future revenues aswell. So, in what I view as a staggering example of government conspiracy andcorruption, they ignored our terrified emotions, saw them as weaknesses that hadto be stripped away, and ordered us all to return to school as of February 15.This was curiously similar to the ET civilization stripping everyone of theiremotions in my short story.Three of the buildings had been gravely damaged with toxic fire-hosewater—Coykendall Science Building, Bliss Hall, and Parker Theatre—and remainedclosed. The buildings needed to be thoroughly decontaminated, and dioxin-lacedwater had also leached into the soil, requiring its careful removal. Two otherdormitories, Capen Hall and Gage Hall, had been contaminated with dioxin-lacedsmoke, but were reopened and declared safe. Independent tests commissioned byEric Francis Coppolino revealed dioxin in the air ducts.31[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber30] Coppolino singlehandedly took on theadministration with independent journalism, through publications printed anddistributed locally. I ended up working for him in 1996, and during that time Ihad an incredibly influential ascension dream. Eric became a very successfulprofessional astrologer and changed his name to Eric Francis. Few people wereaware that he was the heroic Eric Coppolino who had blown the whistle on theawesome scope of this scandal just three years before.It is hard to explain how terrifying it was to return to this place and see rowsupon rows of huge fifty-gallon toxic waste drums painted blue. The doorways intoCoykendall, Parker, and Bliss were wrapped up in plastic, like in the movie E.T.We were constantly seeing men walking around in terrifying, stark-whitemoon-suits with the round glass eyes and sinister-looking gas masks. Ominousyellow POLICE LINE strips were wrapped around the perimeter of the affectedbuildings from tree to tree. Police cars were parked right on the grass,twenty-four hours a day, just to make sure no kids were actually drunk andstupid enough to wander into a toxic waste dump.The experience of seeing this sober was bad enough, but on LSD it created theworst trips I’d ever had. I literally felt as if every tree was screaming, whichwas probably true because they had all been poisoned with a deadly toxin. I wasamazed that all of us just went back to school and continued numbing ourselvesout with drinking and smoking like nothing had happened, even as our emotionswere reeling from the shock of what we were seeing all around us every day. Justlike in my story, it now felt as if all of us were being held in a toxiccontainment area that we were unable to escape from—which happened to be thecampus itself. I was equally guilty of choosing to see myself as a prisonerthere. I was so terrified of my parents’ reaction if I had delayed my educationfor even one semester that I never even considered the idea of getting out. Somekids did decide to go somewhere else, but there were so many new people it washard to tell who was missing, particularly since we all had new classes eachsemester.CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL ISSUESBy far, my greatest education that year came from a sociology class with thedeceptively boring-sounding title Contemporary Social Issues. This was a classthat exposed what people now call the Illuminati, the Cabal, or the New WorldOrder. Names like these were never used in class. Instead, they were only calledthings like “big business,” “the oil companies,” or “the military-industrialcomplex.” Our textbook was called Crisis in American Institutions, and wasfilled to the brim with an astonishing collection of government cover-ups andconspiracies that were very real and easily provable. No one was talking aboutthis stuff in the mainstream media, and that was only another indication of howserious the problem was.Our professor revealed how the oil companies had systematically destroyedeverything in America that could compete with the automobile. Publictransportation was attacked and defunded by politicians whenever possible.Light-rail and high-speed bullet-train systems were perpetually blocked. Evenbus transportation was systematically suppressed, leaving only a small,miserable fleet that only the poorest people dared to ride. New York City hadmanaged to get a subway system before this suppression was fully under way, butmany other cities had been completely thwarted. The goal was to make itimpossible for people to survive without having their own cars, which increasedoil profits. A bus or a train could transport many more people with far lessfuel than an automobile.We learned that Ford had discovered a problem in their new compact car, thePinto, that caused it to burst into flames when hit from behind—even in arelatively low-speed collision. The Ford engineers concluded that a three-dollarwire mesh called a baffle could be fitted around the gas tank, and would preventthis from happening. Ford did a cost-benefit analysis and decided that it wouldbe less expensive to fight the lawsuits from all the families whose loved onesburned to death in Pintos than it would be to do a mass recall and equip eachcar with the cheap new part. Nor did they decide to install baffles on the newcars either, as a three-dollar increase in production cost was considered to beunacceptably high. Ford’s calculations failed miserably. The entire scandal wasexposed, and they hemorrhaged far more millions of dollars in lawsuits than theywould have spent doing a full recall and adding the parts to the new cars. Theentire Pinto line was completely discontinued. Anyone can go and verify thisdata for themselves.We heard about the savings and loan scandal, where the government used publicfunds to back the most outrageous and ridiculous business ideas imaginable.Multimillionaires could try anything they wanted, take incredible risks, and notlose any of their own money when the projects inevitably failed. They werebailed out with public funds and given lavish “golden parachutes” and severancepackages. We were told that this one scandal alone added up to an astonishing$100,000 that was stolen from every American—and hardly anyone involved everwent to jail for having done it.Last, we learned that American corporations had secretly built up and supportedHitler’s war machine. Even though America was supposedly at war with Hitler, hewould never have been able to expand so quickly without America’s direct,intensive support. I will never forget the moment I heard that Ford MotorCompany was secretly building Hitler’s tanks. The class was speechless. If anAllied bomber destroyed one of Hitler’s tank plants, Ford Motor Companypersonally repaid Hitler to rebuild the plant as soon as possible. Another classthe following semester revealed that Boeing secretly built all of Hitler’sbombers. American workers were designing passenger airliners for Boeing,thinking they were doing their part to help keep their country strong duringWorld War II. The airliners were then shipped to South America, where the seatswere stripped out and the planes were repainted into a blank color. From there,the planes were transported to Africa, where they were modified to becomebombers. They were then sent to Germany, painted to look like bombers Hitlerbuilt, and sent off to battle to kill innocent young men from the same extendedfamily that had just built them.This was high treason on an unimaginable scale. My success in the class dependedon learning and remembering these shocking truths. Our lessons raised even morequestions than they answered. How could this have happened right under ournoses? How could they possibly have kept it a secret? If this much informationwas available in one class, then how much more is there that we don’t alreadyknow? And why? What could possess a concentrated group of power elites to wantto create mechanized slaughter on such a vast, industrial scale? I thought backto the Eye under the bridge, the symbol on the dollar, and my parents’ shock atseeing couples enter the pitch-black house across the street without knocking. Ithought about Rosemary’s Baby and how similar my parents thought it was to whatthey had witnessed. My mind was giving me the answer, but my heart didn’t wantto face the possibility. This was like the worst bad trip you could imagine—butit was the real world. I was taught in martial arts to face the attacker, tonever back down, as that would get you killed. Once you know the truth, the realquestion becomes: What are you going to do about it?The scope of evil I was hearing about in this class was only further enhanced byseeing the toxic-waste drums and workers in moon-suits as I walked back to thedorm. The combined power of these experiences shattered any denial I still hadabout the world we were really living in, and the negative groups that werecontrolling it. If my alcoholic suitemates, the maintenance crew, and the localfire department represented humanity in any way, then we were screwed. The mediawas lying to us and covering up the truth. No one ever heard about thesescandals in the news, except for occasional bursts like Watergate and theIran-Contra hearings. The media followed the rule of “if it bleeds, it leads,”keeping us all so traumatized that we used alcohol and prescription drugs tonumb ourselves from the pain. The same power elite also owned the prescriptiondrug companies. The more overwhelmed and depressed they could make us, the morethey could profit off us as our drug pushers. Iran-Contra had already revealedthe government had its hands in illegal drug cash as well—arming, training, andfinancing coke-dealing terrorist groups in South America.I ended up taking this alarming class with my weed dealer—a charismaticrock-and-roll lead vocalist we will call Randy who patterned himself after JimMorrison. He wore tie-dye T-shirts, a tangle of bear-claw necklaces, blackleather pants, and a black leather cowboy hat when he was performing. He alsogreatly enjoyed bullying me. When we reconnected a year or so ago, he said thathe saw me as a “wolf in training” and wanted to make me strong. Even though Ihad martial arts experience, I was dependent upon him for my stuff—and I snappedinto a codependent, obedient role just as I felt forced to do with my parents.He told me if I ever turned him in, he would dedicate the rest of his life tohunting me down and killing me—even if he had been in prison for ten years.Despite these serious threats, I continued to buy from him—and once we had thisclass together, we both realized there was a much more threatening wolf circlingthe herd of human sheep.One night after a particularly intense class, Randy and I were sitting in hisliving room, smoking some weed with the TV on. Neither of us was drinking ortripping. We were half watching a show called Mystery Science Theater 2000, inwhich a guy with two puppets made fun of terrible old B movies. Both of us hadnodded out and were barely even conscious. The high-pitched whining noise fromthe TV suddenly got noticeably louder and higher in frequency. We instantlysnapped to attention, leaning toward the television with focused, urgentconcentration. Right then, a slick, polished commercial came on for a new showthat was about to debut on NBC. It was obvious that a great deal of money hadbeen invested in that commercial—definitely six figures, if not more.“Did you catch that? Do you get what just happened?” I was in shock. Randylooked at me, his eyes wide with disbelief, and agreed. “It was like two handsjust reached right out of the TV and made me turn my head to look at it, eventhough I was nearly passed out,” he said. Then I continued: “Did you notice thatthe high-pitched noise it always makes had changed right before that happened?”Now the full realization—and horror—washed across his face. “Holy God damn,David, you are absolutely right. I try to tune out that sound, but it definitelydid change—and I instinctively looked to see why.” He then said a bunch ofthings that I cannot politely repeat in this book. He was flabbergasted. “Ifthey’re going to finance Hitler and build up his killing machine, why they hellwouldn’t they mess around with the TV to make us watch their war propaganda?”That was the last time we ever watched TV together. It quickly became clear thatthe problem was much, much worse than anyone could even imagine—and what we werehearing in our class was only the tip of the iceberg.CRISPELL HALLOne night after spring break, the new guy in our suite saw me walk into theroom, decided he didn’t like my face, and hurled an empty forty-ounce maltliquor bottle at it from about eight feet away. I was already starting to duckdown before it ever left his hand, thanks to my martial arts training. Withoutit, the glass might have exploded in my face—and could have even blinded me.This guy had shaved both sides of his head, with long hair on the top. He wouldliterally spend twenty minutes at a time staring at himself in the bathroommirror, touching his chin, grinning, and cocking his eyebrow. The only album heever played was Blood Sugar Sex Magik by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, at topvolume—so we all heard the complete album every few days, as his stereo was muchmore powerful than anyone else’s. He had no idea that I was a trained martialartist. I got so angry that I was terrified I would kill him if I stayed in theroom, so I ran out, as I was trained to do after a fight. This was the firsttime my suitemates really stood up for me—but only briefly. They had startedgoing out to the bars in the second semester, after an initial “front loading”with a game of Three Man. Every night they tried to force me to go, but I almostalways stayed in my room. They hated me for refusing to join them.One night they stayed in for a punishingly long game of Three Man. Theringleader, having recently defended me against the new guy, said, “Hey, man,why don’t you share some of that stuff with us? Don’t hog it all for yourself.”I had an extremely powerful strain of weed that reeked of skunk and citrus, andwas happy to give them as much as they wanted. Everyone got about two puffs inbefore a mass disaster rippled through them like a blast wave. They were alreadyextremely drunk, and the skunk weed sent them right over the edge. People werepuking in the bathroom, on the floor, in the water fountain in the outsidehallway and even in the stairwell. Those of us who did not play Three Man couldhardly believe how boldly they had been slapped down by the hand of fate. Iremembered how they had all mocked me when I was throwing up. None of them everasked me for weed again. Karma had finally come around full circle, though itcertainly did not have the effect of healing their emotions—unless you sawthrowing up as a way of breaking through the denial that what they were doingwas healthy or normal.Shortly after this epic event, I walked into one of my classrooms late. It wasquiet. Too quiet. Everyone had a blue piece of paper on their desk. What theheck was going on? I suddenly realized, in horror, that it was a midterm exam. Ivaguely remembered hearing the professor tell us it was coming, but I hadn’twritten down the date—and I hadn’t studied. Thankfully, I did make a habit ofpaying attention in class and taking notes, and I was able to pass the test. Igot through that first year with an overall grade point average of 2.6, whichwas enough to keep me from flunking out of school. I was utterly exhausted fromall the bullying and nightly displays of extreme alcoholism, and decided to moveto the super-geek study dorm, Crispell Hall, with the only three guys in thesuite who did not play Three Man that semester. The marijuana hardly even got mehigh anymore. If I smoked, I felt fairly normal—not even as good as I usually donow. If I didn’t smoke, I was horribly depressed. I was seriously starting tothink I should quit, but I had no idea how I could. I felt that if I stopped, mylife would go right over the edge—but at least in the study dorm I wouldn’t haveto suffer from alcoholic bullies.VINYL JAMMy parents absolutely insisted I work a job that first summer after I startedcollege, even though I desperately needed a vacation. Both Don and Ben wereworking at a factory that made vinyl liners for belowground swimming pools. Thisjob proved to be even worse than telemarketing. There was an ominousfour-colored chemical-hazard diamond posted outside the building. Each of thefour quadrants of the diamond—red, blue, yellow, and white—had a number in it,indicating how severe of a risk we faced in each of four major areas. Thediamond said you needed to wear a respirator to enter the building—but no onetold us that, and none of us did. The smell of vinyl inside was easily twentytimes stronger than what your bathroom smells like after you buy a new showercurtain. The ventilation fans were so loud you had to yell to be heard, and someguys wore earplugs, which we were all supposed to be doing. It was alsoextremely hot, making it impossible not to sweat. The workers would throw theirfood garbage underneath the enormous assembly table and no one ever cleaned itout, so the place was constantly swarming with fruit flies.I started out as a beader, which was the lowest, most hated job in the place.All I did, all day long, was melt a one-inch-wide, one-eighth-inch-thick stripof vinyl onto the edge of swimming-pool liners others had made. The machine thatmelted the vinyl together was gigantic, and had enough electricity runningthrough it on each hit to illuminate ten thousand lightbulbs. It was alsothoroughly dangerous. If you touched it when it was down, you got hit with abolt of electricity. One of my shocks created a little white puffball thatsuddenly sprouted up out of my thumb. I quickly batted it away in horror and wasleft with a small brown crater that hurt for days.If an assembly tech took the guard off the machine and hit the pedal, which wassupposedly illegal but nonetheless useful in order to do pool stairs, it couldslam down on his finger and destroy his fingertip. Several of the “vinyl lifers”who were working there had missing fingertips, and almost everyone in thefactory had been to prison at least once. When they found out I was going tocollege, I was relentlessly bullied, though nothing like elementary and juniorhigh school had been. One of the workers there discovered his body was crawlingwith cancer, and he was only in his early forties at the most. No one wanted tobelieve the vinyl could be responsible, even though the bosses always stayed upin an enclosed room with a separate ventilation system. Twenty years later, Ilearned I still had vinyl in my system.It seemed like every single person who worked there was drinking after work, andthat most of them were probably doing other drugs as well. The feeling in thefactory was one of intense desperation, and you didn’t need to be intuitive topick up on it. I started at eight a.m., had a half hour for lunch, and left atfour thirty. One of the bosses caught me smoking weed outside the building oneday and he didn’t even care. The pay was very low considering how dangerous,toxic, and stressful the work was, and I didn’t need the money. I worked the jobonly because my parents insisted that I have one. One day, a guy smashed hisfinger in the machine and was walking around in a daze after it happened. Heglided right past me in a trauma trance, holding it out in front of him. The topof his middle finger was now two inches wide and looked like something out of acartoon. Albany Med rescued the fingertip and he was back less than a weeklater.THIS IS POETRY . . . THIS IS PASSIONNo matter how much I had suffered in college, this job was much worse—but if Ibecame unemployed, I was subject to intense daily harassment from both of myparents, which was far worse than the heckling in the factory. My only time torelax was on weekends. One Saturday afternoon, Don and I convinced Jude to dropacid with us. This proved to be a very rough and powerful trip—and was also thelast one I ever took. A man we will call Mr. Henry, from across the street, wasa Vietnam veteran with severe PTSD who had become a massive drunk and couldbarely take care of himself. He still had the military haircut. His skin wasdeeply pockmarked from years of severe acne. He reeked of alcohol and festering,pustulant sores, and he was severely overweight. He came over in a drunkenstupor and was acting less like a human and more like an animal, as he couldbarely even talk. I kept having hallucinations of him being a bull, completewith the horns. Don and Bob had a punching bag in the backyard, and Mr. Henrywas hitting it as hard as he could without falling over. His body rippled withsevere tension that released after each blow to the punching bag. As he did so,he kept saying, “This is poetry. This is passion.”By the end of this experience, I had come to a profound realization. My body wasextremely damaged from all the marijuana I had been smoking over the last fouryears. I was looking more and more diseased all the time, with pale skin andfrighteningly dark circles under my eyes. There was nothing poetic or passionateabout what I was doing. People were telling me I looked like I had just walkedout of a concentration camp. If I kept on going, I was either going to die, endup like Mr. Henry, or end up like the guys at the vinyl factory. I had nearlygotten busted several times, and once I had a criminal record it would be muchharder to find a job. I remembered having dreams as a child that I was going todo something positive with my life, but I didn’t see how it was possible unlessI started taking better care of myself. Quitting marijuana felt like theequivalent of taking away the only thing I had ever enjoyed—something I hadbuilt my entire life around. I couldn’t imagine actually stopping, but I wasthinking about it.STORIES FROM THE LOVE BROTHERSJude and I poured all that tension and uncertainty into a new music project wecalled Stories from the Love Brothers. The whole album featured songs in which Iwas wrestling with the idea of whether or not I was going to stop smoking. Therewas a song about the factory called “Vinyl Jam,” and another song called“Joneser,” about guys who are constantly asking you for things, such as drugs,money, food, and shelter, and giving nothing back in return. The real highlightof the album was a song called “Garden of the Broken Clock.” We recorded itlive, in one take, with nothing planned out in advance. Jude was playing thepiano and I was using a guitar as an echoing rhythm instrument. I did it all asa spoken-word piece, and had no idea what I was going to say when we started. Inhindsight, this definitely appears to have been the first time I verballychanneled my own “higher self” in such a direct and accurate form. More thananything else, the words that flowed out of me during these brief few minuteswere the main tool I ended up using to maintain the strength to quit.It started out with Jude saying, in a hypnotic monotone, “I once had thisgarden, and in this garden laid a broken clock. This broken clock lay,lifeless . . . lay lifeless on the ground.” In a dreamlike fashion, hissubconscious was obviously talking about me, as the “broken clock,” and howmessed up I had become. Shortly after he said this and paused, I began talking,with an unusual degree of confidence, authority, and clarity. The old man frommy dreams appeared as a character I was talking to as the narrator. However, inthis case the man was a future version of myself, complete with a white beard. Idescribed how I was having a dialogue with him and he was giving me spiritualadvice. In the song, my character asked the old man how I could control myaddictions. “God helps those who help themselves,” he responded—and thenrepeated it several more times.Suddenly, I had a seemingly accidental verbal fumble, and said, “God helps thosewho end themselves.” This triggered a whole new section, where Jude’s pianomusic became extremely powerful. In further dialogues with the old man, mycharacter concluded, “If you are ending yourself, then you must not loveyourself.” The old man responded by saying, “Exactly. Every drink you drink,every cigarette you smoke, every drug you take, you’re stepping a little closerto death. . . . God helps those who help themselves, and you, my son, havesought out such help.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENTHE GREAT EXPERIMENTI was still smoking when I started my sophomore year of school at the CrispellHall super-geek dorm in 1992—but the weed barely made me feel any better. I hadslashed my use down to about only once every day or two. Every time I did it, Istarted having chest pains as if I was going to have a heart attack. When I wasworking at the factory, I felt as if my life was over. My mind was constantlyfilled with paranoid delusions that I would have to work there for the rest ofmy life—until I fell over dead from drug addiction and cancer. I pinned all myhopes on just surviving long enough to make it back to college. I felt that onceI got back there, I would be in paradise. The campus had wonderful trees, aglorious stream, and beautiful women everywhere. I still had never had agirlfriend and was hoping for the best. I visualized a world of happiness, evenecstasy, by getting myself out of the worst prison I’d ever been sentenced toand returning to the glory of the campus.Once I got back to school, it was just the opposite. I didn’t feel the least bitbetter in school than I did in the factory, which was shocking. My short-termmemory was completely gone. Within minutes of leaving my room, I couldn’tremember if I had locked the door or left the hot plate on. I was having panicattacks on an hour-by-hour basis. I was constantly depressed, and even smokingmade me feel only slightly better after a high of about fifteen minutes. My bodywas utterly exhausted, to the point where I could barely handle the stress of aten- to fifteen-minute walk to class. I would feel as if I could barely move mylegs—and I noticed that other burned-out-looking students were shuffling alongthe same way. I still subscribed to a science magazine that came to the oldhouse, which I believe was either Science Digest or Hippocrates, and my motherforwarded each issue to my dormitory. What I read in that magazine completelychanged my life.IT’S ALL ABOUT THE CHEMISTRYI found out that happiness doesn’t just come naturally to the body. Happiness isnot like a thought or an idea. You only feel happiness when the brain createscertain chemicals and releases them into the gaps between brain cells. Happinessoccurs during the time these chemicals remain in your synapses, before theybreak down and get reabsorbed. Your brain only makes a small amount of thesechemicals at a time, and stores them at a steady rate—like water filling up in atank. We then get addicted to various things that cause an unnaturally largeamount of this “water” to splash out of the tank all at once. Some people getaddicted to sex. Some people get addicted to work, stress, or fear. Some peopleget addicted to bullying and creating drama, such as in an intimaterelationship. Some people get addicted to staying up late and pushingthemselves, so they don’t get enough sleep. Some people get addicted to sugar,wheat, dairy, and other unhealthy foods. Some people get addicted to caffeine,nicotine, or alcohol. Some people get addicted to prescription drugs. And someget addicted to other drugs—including marijuana.Any of these addictions can create a situation in which our brain is eventuallyburning these chemicals faster than they can be replenished. Once this happens,you reach what psychologists call depression. If you then develop five or moreof the following symptoms, you have what is called clinical depression:Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, or tearful (in children and teens,depressed mood can appear as constant irritability)Significantly reduced interest or feeling no pleasure in all or most activitiesSignificant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increasein appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected)Insomnia or increased desire to sleepEither restlessness or slowed behavior that can be observed by othersFatigue or loss of energyFeelings of worthlessness, or excessive or inappropriate guiltTrouble making decisions, or trouble thinking or concentratingRecurrent thoughts of death or suicide, or a suicide attempt32[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber31]Other than suicidal thoughts, I was having all the classic symptoms of clinicaldepression. In order to fit the diagnosis, the problems needed to “be severeenough to cause noticeable problems in relationships with others or inday-to-day activities, such as work, school or social activities.”33[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber32] All this applied to me. I still was unable tofeel confident around women. My work, school, and social activities had allsuffered dramatically. As I was learning in my psychology classes, mostpsychiatrists were handing out prescription drugs like candy, telling theirpatients that nothing was really wrong with them. It was all just a chemicalimbalance—and there was a drug to treat that.Thankfully, this was not what the article suggested. Some people could be helpedby taking these prescription drugs, but it could also become another addiction.If people suddenly tried to stop taking them, they could have such a badreaction that they would become suicidal—and might actually go through with it.The article said you needed to cut the problem off at the root. You had toidentify the addiction that was causing you to destroy certain chemicals calledenkephalins and endorphins—such as serotonin and dopamine—and find a way to stoprepeating the pattern.In my case, it was very simple. Although I had a variety of addictions, the mainway I was destroying all my serotonin was through smoking weed. I had finallyreached the point at which there was so little serotonin left in my brain thateven when I smoked, I could barely get high—and the rest of the time I sufferedclinical depression. The article discussed this exact situation in detail, andsaid the only way out would be to completely stop using drugs. Once I finallyfreed my brain from the torture of being chemically forced to release serotoninin huge amounts, I would have to go through a period of time where I did notfeel any happiness whatsoever. During this time, my brain would refill the watertank, as it were. Once I had healed my neurochemical system, normal things inlife—like a blue sky, beautiful trees, a long walk, playing music, a niceconversation, or an attractive woman—would make me feel good, without any drugs.Many people were never able to wait long enough to see what would happen oncethey had healed.ONE LAST CRASHAfter discovering the truth, I went through one final “crash,” where my old lifecollapsed in on me all at once. There was a girl named Jenny who really seemedto like me, and was acting like my counselor as I talked about my desire to stopsmoking. I then found out she was working every decent-looking guy in mybuilding and wanted to use me to get weed. Someone pulled the fire alarm and Isaw her outside, wrapped in a blanket, with another guy. She ended up slammingher door in my face on a Monday not too long after this, and I again felt aparalyzing force around my heart—as if I were going to have a heart attack. Thenext night I allowed other students to pressure me into going to a party when Ireally needed to read my assignment for class. One girl who I was not at allattracted to, whom we will call Liz, kept hitting on me very strongly and Ifinally had to leave. Then on Wednesday, I was disgraced in my Science-Fictionclass after the teacher called on me, his star pupil, and I had to admit Ihadn’t read the book. It was just one burst of bad luck after another.That Friday night, my roommate drank two 40s while watching the film The Doors,in which Val Kilmer played Jim Morrison, and which documented his steep declineand death from drugs and alcohol. My roommate thought the 40s “went down smooth”and he would be fine. I watched the last section of the movie with my suitematesand was stunned at how I had all the same patterns as the greatest drug addictin music history. My roommate ended up vomiting all over the bathroom floor. Forthe first time in my life I genuinely became wild and abusive in yelling atsomeone. In a hail of profanity, I jabbed my finger at him and told him I didn’tcare how messed up he was, he was going to clean up every last goddamn drop ofvomit off this floor. He kept saying he was sorry in a voice that sounded likeBarney the purple dinosaur.Then I walked into my room and noticed that my bed was completely unmade. Thiswould never have happened, since my mother had trained me to have militaryprecision in the way I folded the sheets. Liz was sitting on my roommate’s bed,very drunk and happy. Their shoes were side by side. I began yelling at her,accusing them of having had sex in my bed, which she denied. I asked her why inthe hell my bed was all messed up and she kept saying, “I don’t know, I don’tknow.” The suite smelled so bad that I thought I was going to throw up. One ofmy roommates was so drunk he was eating pizza and didn’t even notice. I ended uptelling my buddy Chris that we had to get out of there, and go hang out at hisdorm in Bouton Hall. Thankfully, his roommate had a girlfriend he would oftenstay with and there was an open bunk for the night. As I lay there in bedstaring at the ceiling, my mind was racing. Addictions could make you have sexwith people you would never be interested in when you were sober. You could getsomeone pregnant. You could end up declining in health, stability, and sanity,and end up trashing your whole life—or even dying. Right there in that bed, Imade the decision. That was it. I was done.The next morning the smell was mostly gone, but I had to deal with a terriblesituation. My weed dealer, Randy, was trying to train me to take his place so hecould move out to the mountains in Gardiner and live off the risks I would taketo sell for him. I had given one ounce to a friend of mine, and it was thelargest amount of weed I had ever handled. I told him the price was $200, and hedemanded that he pay only $180 or he wouldn’t take it. I ended up giving it tohim and adding the extra $20 out of my own pocket. My ATM card had broken inhalf, so I couldn’t get Randy the rest of his money, and he was furious with me.Things got very bizarre when I realized that he had completely stopped callingme for four days. I then discovered that my telephone cord had been smashedunder my roommate’s bed, which was why the phone wasn’t ringing. I went down tothe office and got a new cord, and at the exact moment I plugged it in, it rang.I picked it up and it was Randy. He wanted his money right away, and I told himto come on over and get it, since I now had a new card. He had threatened tokill me in the past if I did not pay him, and that was the last thing I wanted.Randy came over and insisted that I give him something to smoke. All I had leftwas a disgusting, tar-soaked “roach”—the burned end of a joint. I didn’t wantany of it myself, but he was starting to suspect I had become a “narc” andinsisted I do it. The concentrated resin caused both of us to suffer anunusually high amount of paranoia, and Randy soon said he needed to get out ofthere. As soon as Randy left my room, I heard an explosively loud walkie-talkieechoing in the suite. Now I was dying inside. I had gotten so close—and on thevery last day I ever planned on using, I was busted. The campus police must havebeen tipped off to listen in on my phone call after I nervously asked the stafffor a new cord. They heard us discussing our meeting, where I needed to repayhim for the $200 of “books” he had given me—in the middle of the semester. Nowthe police were right outside the door. They would find the $200 in his frontpocket, with my fingerprints on it. The room reeked of smoke and incense. I wasdone. It was over.I knew that the police could not legally enter into my room to arrest me. Therewas a campus law that the cops were not allowed to step past the threshold ofyour door unless you permitted them to, even if they had probable cause. Theycould knock, but you didn’t have to let them in. The legend in the drug culturewas that the cops would wait for you to come out of your room, or use tricks toflush you out. My mind was rocked to the core with paranoia as I heard even morewalkie-talkie sounds in the suite. This was it. I sat there paralyzed in fear,appalled at my stupidity and bad luck. Finally the phone rang—and it was Randy,down on the ground floor. He sounded very grim and extremely nervous. “Canyou—can you come down and let me in?” I knew exactly what was happening. He hadcops standing on either side of him, telling him what to say. They had orderedhim to flush me out of the room, so the officers who were still in my suitecould arrest me. The trap had been sprung. I had no choice. This was checkmate.And this time I wasn’t looking at Connie, but prison. Selling an ounce of weedwas a felony. I took a deep breath and accepted my fate. “Okay, I will do it,” Isaid, with a note of finality. Then I hung up.When I eventually left the room, there was a maintenance guy in the bathroomwith our shower-stall parts spread out on the countertop. He had a huge toolbelt, a busted old red T-shirt, and a biker-style mustache. His skin wasthoroughly pockmarked and he looked like a severe abuser of alcohol and othersubstances. It was a common thing for people to hide bags of drugs in ashower-curtain rod, as that way if it got discovered by the police, it wasn’t intheir room and they couldn’t be blamed for it. This guy gave me a very dirtylook, and I knew it was over. He was looking for my stash and was angry that hecouldn’t find anything, since I would never have used that trick—it was too easyfor someone to steal it. Why else would this guy be ripping apart the shower?The cops were standing on either side of Randy by the downstairs phone, and werewaiting for me to walk outside the building. That way they wouldn’t cause asmuch of a scene and could just load me into the car without parading me down thehalls in handcuffs, past all my friends. They were obviously watching all theexits so I had no possibility of escape.I was living on the third floor, and I started walking down the stairs to myappointment with destiny. My mind was racing with thoughts at a very fast speed,just like the time-slowing effect of Form with Spirit. All the darkness andnegativity I was feeling was the equivalent of an extremely bad trip. Each timeI stepped on a new stair, I had another thought about how my life was completelyover. I had been given visions of doing great things for the world when I was achild. I was told I was going to be a spiritual leader. I had worked to developmy ESP and had stopped practicing it. I had missed my chance to save our entireschool from an epic environmental catastrophe when I could have warned the firedepartment with one phone call. I had learned there was a terribly evil force onEarth and I still hadn’t done anything to stop it. Now I was going to be sent toprison. My life had fallen apart, exactly as the power elite had hoped it would.Even with my martial arts training, there would be no way for me to avoidextremely horrific torture in prison. Once I finally got out, I would have acriminal record. Any hope of a future as a psychologist or spiritual leaderwould be heavily tainted—if not destroyed.My last act as a free man was to ping the fire bell with my middle finger,making a clear tone—as I did every time I passed it. Randy was standing in frontof the glass, glaring at me. He didn’t have a key and couldn’t get in withoutme, unless someone let him in. I was ready. I took a deep breath, opened thedoor, and confronted him aggressively, which he did not expect. “Okay, where arethey?” I said.“Where is who?”I barked back, “Don’t screw with me, man. The cops. Where are the cops?”Now Randy got a sinister, sardonic look. He hissed back, “There are no cops,young David, I just want to know why the hell there is a guy in your bathroomripping apart the shower.” He used several curse words that I will not includehere.I couldn’t even believe this was happening. I had to double-check to make sure.“You mean there are no cops?”“No, there are no goddamn cops!”I was so thrilled that I rushed him with a huge victory hug. I nearly cried withrelief. Then I remembered that my Greek suitemates thought the shower was tooweak, and had removed the shower head—causing a much larger amount of water togush out. Crispell actually had staff who would periodically check on thebathrooms. They had discovered this crime and called it in to maintenance forrepair. That’s all it was. The stench of vomit probably explained why the guygave me such dirty looks.I was astounded by the fact that I hadn’t gotten busted. I had believed it washappening with every fiber of my being, and the thrill of not getting arrestedfelt like an incredible miracle from the universe. I ended up telling one of myfriends the whole story; he worked as a resident assistant in the building. Hetold me he was going to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that night and invitedme to come. “Well, I’m not an alcoholic,” I told him. “I never even liked it. Myproblem is smoking weed.” He told me that I didn’t have to be an alcoholic tobenefit from it. This was a great group of people and I should check it out. Noone was going to pressure me, and if I didn’t like it I could go right back todoing whatever I was doing. This was very different from Connie—and best of all,it was free.HAPPY ANNIVERSARYThat first night was an incredibly powerful experience. They were celebratingtwo sobriety anniversaries—one for a younger white guy with long hair who hadfive years, and one for an older black guy who had eleven years. Everyone wassmiling, radiant, and extremely happy—and there wasn’t a hint of bullying in theroom. Both the men and the women treated me with love, kindness, and respect.The main feature of the night was hearing the stories of both men. Each of themhad been through traumas that were much worse than anything I had endured. Theywere waking up in ditches on the side of the road, covered in their own vomitand urine. The eleven-year guy had run out on his wife and kids for days at atime, and had come very close to dying on numerous occasions.They talked about “hitting bottom,” which was a moment where you realized yourlife was completely falling apart, and you had no other choice but to stop. Theyalso said that most people have to hit bottom over and over again before theyfinally decide to change—and each new bottom is even worse than the one before.Eventually, if you didn’t decide that enough was enough, you would either end updiseased, institutionalized, or dead. I had already come dangerously close tobeing institutionalized in prison or in Connie, and had several brushes withdeath, so everything they were saying made perfect sense. I decided that verynight that I would never use any type of mind-altering drugs again—and I neverdid. The five-year guy gave me his number and said I could call him any time,particularly if I felt I was in danger of hurting myself. When I went back to mysuite I felt absolutely inspired and transformed. I talked to my next-doorneighbor, another refugee from Doobie Hall, about my bed being messed up. Headmitted that he had done it as a prank. I was stunned at the synchronicity, asI had absolutely believed that my roommate had had sex with Liz in my bed. Itseemed as if all these setups had occurred to make sure I would really get themessage and go to the meeting.I decided to do a “ninety in ninety,” meaning that I would attend ninetymeetings in ninety days. There were plenty of attractive young women to meet andbecome friends with, although I was advised not to get into a romanticrelationship for the first year, because I would still be vulnerable during thistime. The five-year guy told me most people feel very depressed for the firstthree months, which was why it was necessary to go to a meeting every day. Onceyou got through three months you would feel some degree of happiness. In sixmonths you would feel even better, and after a year you could have a happierlife than you had ever dreamed of while you were using. I told him all aboutwhat I had read in the magazine; it gave scientific proof for everything he wassaying. Even though I would not feel any happiness during those first threemonths, I would have a support system that would help me ensure I didn’t slideback into addiction again. And I didn’t.THE EXPERIMENTERSI felt so charged up with positive energy from that meeting that it was like apsychedelic experience—but very pure and sacred, without all the paranoia,terror, and shakes. My mind was bursting with ideas and inspirations and I feltI had to capture them on paper while they were fresh. I looked at the wholesequence of events that had led up to my epic decision, and it all seemed tostretch the idea of coincidence to the breaking point. One of my psych classeshad just introduced me to Jung’s concept of synchronicity, and now I had aperfect example of it right after I had learned what it was. Why did my cardsnap in half at the worst possible moment—causing a frightening delay in payingRandy? Why did my roommate’s bed kill the phone cord at the worst possiblemoment, making Randy even more angry as the delay stretched on for days? Why didI never think to call anyone during that time? Why did the Greeks remove andthrow away the shower head? Why was Randy calling at the exact moment I pluggedthe new phone cord in? Why did the maintenance guy show up right as Randy wasgetting his money? Why did the maintenance guy’s walkie-talkie never make asound until the exact moment after Randy left my room? And why did I have mysingle most upsetting heartbreak with a woman right before all this happened?Some form of cosmic intelligence seemed to have orchestrated all this withastonishing precision. It appeared to be an incredibly well-constructed exampleof synchronicity. Someone was trying to get my attention. I ended up spendingall weekend writing a paper I called “Earth as an Experiment.” Some kind ofmemory block seemed to drop, and I was able to remember many of the things theold man had told me in the dreams of my youth. I wrote about Earth as if it werea rat maze—but most people didn’t even realize they were in it. They weredistracted by “false food pellets” that would make them feel good for shortbursts of time—such as addictions. They would make their home where the falsefood was, and would go no farther. Others would realize they were in a maze, andthat there was a genuine solution to the puzzle. The goal was a spiritualtransformation that I decided to call “the Upgrade,” which I later realized wascalled ascension. It would change the very essence of what it meant to be human.I also wrote that this entire system was being observed and managed by“experimenters,” who had already experienced the Upgrade long ago. They leaveclues in the maze that lead us toward the Upgrade—but they will never push. Theydon’t expect most of us to solve the puzzle, or even discover that we are in amaze. That is impossible—at least in our present environment. Instead, theirgoal is to reach out to those few individuals who see the truth for what it is.We are all surrounded by hidden laws of cause and effect, whether we realize itor not. There are no accidents. None of the biggest events in our lives happenrandomly. If we cause pain, fear, and stress to others, the experimenters ensurethat we will repeat those same experiences, perhaps in a slightly different way.It will never be completely obvious. We always have the option of doubting thatanything is going on, but no one gets to break the rules. Similarly, if wegenerate love, positivity, and support for others, the experimenters createsituations that guarantee it will be returned to us—and transform our lives intosomething wonderful.That same weekend, I also decided it was time to take my dreams seriously. Onthe very next morning after I went to my first meeting, I started writing mydreams down in a college notebook. The date was September 22, 1992, and I havebeen documenting my dreams and analyzing their meanings ever since. Once I hadcommitted to sobriety, I began having nightmares that I had smoked again. I feltlike if I didn’t stay sober at this point, after all that synchronicity,something much worse would knock me back in line. I would awake in terror, onlyto be greatly relieved when I realized it didn’t actually happen. I also hadmarvelous ascension dreams of flying, and of my body turning into light. Thesedreams would continue to get more and more vivid and intense as the years wentby.That semester I had signed up for a Lifetime Fitness class—and to my horror, wewere forced to jog every day, just like the Turkey Trot in junior high school.Every time I started running I would cough almost uncontrollably. It would forceme to stop and bend over as my body heaved. Huge amounts of dark yellow-brownmucus were coming up every time. I thought back to all the autopsies of smokers’lungs they had showed us in health class, and realized that my own lungs mustlook disgusting on the inside. The running was finally giving my body a chanceto release an incredible amount of oily tar that had built up over the past fouryears. This had dramatically reduced how much oxygen I could get into mybloodstream, which in turn made me constantly exhausted and weak. So, althoughit was very painful and I hated it, I embraced what was happening and kept onrunning.QUEEN VICTORIAA beautiful Scandinavian woman with blond hair and blue eyes named Victoria wasin my jogging class. We became fast friends when she found out I had decided tosober up and go to meetings. We started running side by side, and she would waitfor me and encourage me when I coughed up all this psychoactive resin. At theend of one of our classes, she stopped, gazed calmly into my eyes, and said,“You have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen on a man.” Finally, after allthis time, this was my big chance. I thanked her for the compliment and askedher if she wanted to have dinner sometime. She said yes.We ended up going to a local Chinese restaurant together. She revealed that shewas twenty-four years old and married to a fifty-four-year-old wealthy man. Shedesperately wanted to get away from him and be with me instead. I was so shockedI didn’t know what to say.We walked back to my room, sat down on my bed, and she started making out withme. Her lips and her skin felt impossibly soft and delicious, and her perfumewas transcendent. I backed away. I just couldn’t do it. I was terrified thatthis guy would use his money and connections to come after me, either to hurt meor even have me killed. She was going to get caught. Cheaters always did—it wasonly a matter of time before fate would strike them. That was just another trapwithin the grand maze the experimenters had set up for us. And beyond that, Idid not want to get involved with a married woman. It was risky, and I wastrying to clean up my life—not trade one dangerous addiction for another. Iapologized to her and told her I couldn’t be romantic with her unless she wasalready getting a divorce. She was devastated but she understood, and said sherespected me.The next morning, I had an outrageous dream. I was back in the elementarygymnasium, right where we had been forced to stand for forty-five minutes untilBrad and I began sneaking out of school. Now instead of dodge ball, Victoria waswildly attacking me and swinging at me with a knife. She was laughing andlaughing like it was some kind of a joke. She obviously did not care whether shehurt me in the process. All I had to defend myself was a green jersey, like wehad used for the MedicBall game. I was holding the jersey with both hands andtrying to use it to capture the knife as she kept swiping at me.The dream ended before I had succeeded in disarming her. I was terrified—and assoon as I woke up and wrote it down, the message was obvious. She wanted herhusband to be the money guy and have me as the boy toy. This put me in extremedanger, since her husband could easily afford to have me killed—but she totallydidn’t care. All she wanted was sex with a young man she was attracted to. Thiswas an early and powerful clue that there was some kind of intelligence behindmy dreams. Perhaps it was the old man, whom I now had reason to believe wasactually a future version of myself. This intelligence could point out things Ineeded to know that would help me grow into a healthier, happier person.Sometimes I would be too blind or naïve to see these things myself, but thedreams would be there to help me understand what was going on. I also listenedevery day to the new album Jude and I had made, and the spiritual messages I hadput in it—particularly in “Garden of the Broken Clock”—kept boosting myconfidence.A MEETING WITH THE ANCIENT GOLDEN BEINGAfter passing this incredibly difficult and painful test with Victoria, I wasrewarded with a fantastic dream. I ended up inside a magnificent undergroundtunnel with a hundred-foot-high ceiling. The tunnel was perfectly squared-off,as if it had been laser-cut out of the rock with sharp edges. The rock had apolished look to it. All along the walls, all the way down, there were beautifulEgyptian-style hieroglyphic carvings, inscriptions, and scenes embossed in therock. Then an extremely tall being appeared to my left, dwarfing me in size.This entity was roughly seventy feet tall. The being was wearing a robe, and itsentire body, including the clothing, looked like it was made out of brilliant,sparkling gold. It also had an extremely strange head, which appeared to havebeen carved out of stone. There was a face on the front, a face on each side,and a face on the back. The faces looked like some of the Mayan inscriptions youwould see on pyramids in Mesoamerica.This being was not aggressive. It treated me with great respect, but also had anoticeably parental feel. It never said a word. It just silently walked next tome and led me down the hall. I was awestruck by the depth and quality ofEgyptian-style designs in the tunnel walls. As we reached the end of the tunnel,we seemed to go through some kind of a portal—and this was where the dream gotvery bizarre.We were now back in the bedroom I had shared with my brother during the time myparents divorced. I had moved my desk into the room at first, and then took itwith me when I later moved back out. The being brought me right up to my desk,which was filled with all sorts of papers and personal items from my past. Itsilently pointed at my desk—and said nothing. “I don’t understand. You want meto look in my old desk?” The being continued to stand and point, silently—and Iwoke up.I realized this was some sort of invitation from the people I had called theexperimenters. If I wanted to work with them, and stay sober, I would need toreview the events from my childhood—the cosmic things as well as the bullying.Only then would I be free from “repetition compulsion,” that prison of the soulwhere you unknowingly run right into the next situation that will re-traumatizeyou as soon as the current one ends. I never really finished that homework untilI wrote this book, beginning with a full-life-review outline I created in Canadathrough weeks of deep meditation and research. I was shocked to realize thateven after all this time, with all I have studied and learned, I was stillrepeating the same patterns—just with friendlier faces. The Tibetan ascensionteachings often focus on “cutting the cords,” which involves lovingly separatingyourself from every pattern that anchors you to your original traumas. Only thenwill you have enough spiritual strength to be ready for a full ascensionexperience.I decided to take the invitation from the mysterious golden being in my dream,and continued going to support-group meetings every day. I often would share my“war stories” with the group, but since I only had gotten drunk on a relativelysmall number of occasions, and you were not supposed to mention drug-relateditems, I started running out of material. I also tried going to NarcoticsAnonymous, but it wasn’t at all a good fit. A jacked-up military guy would pushagainst his elbow joint intensely as people shared their horror stories. A womanwith fading skin and a cigarette-hardened voice broke the rules about mentioningspecific drugs, and said, “You know how you’re in the doctor’s office, and assoon as he leaves the room you wanna open up that drawer and look for works?”THE MOMENT OF TRUTHOne of the sayings I would always hear in AA was “People, Places, and Things.”The idea was that you were supposed to avoid the people, places, and thingsassociated with your addiction. Otherwise you could be tempted into doing it allagain—which could lead to hitting a much harder bottom down the road. I wenthome for Christmas break and was discussing this idea with my mother at thekitchen table I had flamed out with KNO3 years before. “That rule doesn’t applyto me. Don and Bob are my friends. They live right up the road. I need to go seethem and tell them the good news. I got cleaned up and now I am having some kindof spiritual awakening. Maybe I can help inspire them.” Mom urged me not to doit, but I said there wasn’t a thing in the world that could make me go back atthis point.Don and Bob were both smoking Marlboros and drinking Budweiser as I explained indetail everything that had happened to me. Their response was so shocking that Iended up making it the first personal story I shared in The Synchronicity Key,chapter 3. Here it is:My friends glared at me through the stench of old beer and cigarette smoke as Itold them that I now believed I was here for a spiritual purpose and that Iwould help many people. Stony silence erupted into a full-scale verbal assaultas soon as I finished. Apparently I was going to fight my way into a dead-endjob, marry a vicious and unattractive woman, slave my life away for kids whowould only hate me more and more as they got older, and ultimately die alone ina nursing home surrounded by staff who could barely wait for their nextcigarette break as I groaned for their attention.Was this it? Was this life? Was I crazy? Were they right? How could they be socruel—after all the years we’d shared together? I could barely even hear whatthey were saying as I observed this withering assault of sarcasm andhumiliation. I warned them several times that I could not tolerate this, but onand on they went. Finally, I stood up in the middle of a sentence and walked outthe front door—without verbalizing any anger or hostility—never to return. Oneof them reconnected with me as I was finishing this book—for the first time intwenty years—and we had a good conversation that helped us arrive at a point ofmutual forgiveness.After a ten-minute walk, I stood at the crossroads between my friend’s streetand mine. I was utterly devastated, fighting back tears. I felt inspired to holdmy arms out to the sky and speak.You . . . whoever or whatever you are. I know you’re out there. I know you canhear me. I know I’m here for a reason. My life has a purpose. You’ve shown methat. I believe you—and I trust you. I know I’m not crazy. I have made mychoice. I will dedicate my life to helping others who are suffering. I thank youfor helping me—and now I want to help you.I was staring at a small patch of stars in the night sky as these words coursedthrough my mind. Right as I said, “I want to help you,” a huge, yellow-whitemeteor streaked directly across the area I was looking at. It was real. It wasabsolute. It was undeniable. It was astonishing. It was the biggest, brightestmeteor I had ever seen, even after many sleepless nights of sitting out in alawn chair as a boy, watching the occasional flickerings of the Perseids orLeonids. A tremendous surge of ecstatic energy roared up through my body, and Ifelt a magnificent spiritual presence. Tears of joy streamed down my face. Ispoke to the universe—and got an answer. It was, and still is, one of the mostprofound events in my life.As The Synchronicity Key continues from there, I share several more examplesthat are equally remarkable. A comprehensive scientific case for synchronicityand ascension is then revealed. As the meteor streaked by that night, I felt mywhole body soaring up into the air, while still standing there at the same time.I could hear a train rushing by in the distance as tears of ecstasy streameddown my face. Trains would become very consistent ascension metaphors in mydreams.While I was still smoking weed, I had felt guided to be the “Keeper” of the pathbetween my house and Don and Bob’s place, and had cleaned it up on every walk.The garbage was replenished on a daily basis. That night I had picked up everypiece of trash I had seen on the way back. When I saw the flash of light andthis huge surge of energy rocked through my body, I completely lost control ofmy hands. The empty cigarette packs and abandoned food wrappers fell all overthe road. I was extremely high, without any drugs, as I picked them all back upagain.THE TREASURE CHEST OF MATERIALISTIC DOOMIn college I always got cash out of an ATM in the Student Union building. I hadsaved every receipt and stuck them all in an old Norelco clamshell case that hadheld an electric razor I no longer used. After being torn down by the brothers,I sat at my desk—just as I was asked to do in the dream—and opened the blackbox. There was a centimeter-thick stack of ATM receipts in there. I went througheach of them one by one—and that was when it hit me. I had spent about $2,700getting high in just over a year. I was extremely meticulous and almost neverspent my money on anything else, including a haircut. Now I realized that if Ihad saved this money, I could have been driving a car right then, instead ofhaving to ride the Adirondack Trailways bus to get back to school. Having a carwould have made it much easier to go on off-campus dates. I took out one of thereceipts and wrote “Treasure Chest of Materialistic Doom” on it. Then I closedthe black box so it was sticking out prominently as a label. Every time I sawthe box I remembered what I had given up by allowing my habit to continue.I had finally broken the compulsion to repeat my trauma and self-medicate thepain I was feeling. Little did I realize that a much greater gift was about toarrive—the first of an ongoing series of incredible disclosures of highlyclassified information about extraterrestrials, UFOs, ancient bases throughoutour solar system, and the truth of ascension. Additionally, the spiritualcontact I had experienced in my dreams, in my allegedly fictional stories, inthe OBEs and lucid dreams that took me on board spacecraft, and in the streak oflight in the sky, was soon to go much farther than I could have ever possiblyimagined. I would end up receiving direct contact with extraterrestrial life,and getting extensive guidance on how to prove, scientifically, that we are in acosmic battle between good and evil. Ascension is not only a possibility, it isan absolute fact—and as you go through the initiation needed to graduate, youare helping to cocreate our fantastic future."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENDISCLOSUREThe ninety-day guideline proved to be remarkably correct. I had been sober forexactly three months, to the day, when I saw the shooting star and felt energysurge through me. That event felt so profound that I couldn’t stop thinkingabout the implications. I now was strongly considering that UFOs and ETs werereal, had been mysteriously guiding me throughout my life, and that I was beinginvited to have contact somehow. That propitiously timed shooting star seemed tosuggest there may be truth behind the epic dreams and visions I was experiencingabout the Upgrade or ascension ever since I was two years old. This energeticevent also occurred right at the beginning of a new music project I had startedworking on with Jude. We had access to much better sounds by collaborating witha saxophone player named Daryl and a younger guy named Paul, who had a greatstudio.THE FORGOTTEN PLANET HAINOur recordings included one very mysterious track where Jude was playingkeyboards and I was verbally describing a mass, worldwide UFO sighting. Iborrowed an idea from Ursula K. Le Guin’s classic science-fiction novel The LeftHand of Darkness, which we had been assigned to read for my Science-Fictionclass, and which is considered to be among the top two or three sci-fi novels ofall time by most critics. Le Guin’s novel proposed that human beings were allover the galaxy and they had originated on an ancient planet she called Hain.They had seeded themselves throughout a variety of planetary systems but theirdescendants had long since forgotten this in many cases. Some of the survivingraces were telepathic and one of the main characters in the story starteddeveloping this ability near the end. I now know from insiders that many sci-fiwriters were contacted by government-affiliated groups and given various piecesof classified information to disclose as fiction. They were invariably sworn tosecrecy and told there would be severe, if not lethal, consequences if they evertold a soul. Others were contacted telepathically by extraterrestrials who aresteering our evolution. Le Guin may well have been approached.By the end of our song I had reached a very deep meditative state and felt theneed to resolve the searing tension in the music. I took on a haunting,authoritative voice and said, “Masters of the forgotten planet Hain, coming outof space to Earth. To see us. To understand. Rectify. And to judge.” Each time Ilistened to this I felt incredible sensations, as if I had spoken something thatwas far more than just fiction. In another track from those same sessions, Ireferred to the Face on Mars as well as the pyramids I had briefly heard someonesay were there, and spoke about how we would evolve dramatically if it became anestablished fact that these had been built by an ancient civilization. I nowknow that human life is written into quantum mechanics itself, and is not justthe result of a common planet of origin, as Le Guin suggested—but theserecordings did tie in many intriguing concepts. Fiction can help prepare theimagination to accept exotic new truths later on. Le Guin’s book did articulatethe prevailing classified theory for why there appear to be so many humansthroughout our galaxy.SHWANKSVILLE DELIRIUMWe also did tracks with Daryl that sounded like Nine Inch Nails–type“industrial” music, but with a gritty, urban saxophone. We worked on thesetracks in Jude’s apartment in a less-than-friendly part of Albany. One afternoonwe were so stressed out trying to mix our songs on a four-track cassetterecorder that we almost felt delirious. We went to get some food and soon couldbarely contain our laughter. A woman in front of us in line had a really funnynasal accent and kept talking about a place she called Shwanksville. We couldn’tstop laughing about it when we got home. We combined the way we were feelingwith her funny word, and said, “That’s it! That’s the name of our band.Shwanskville Delirium!”One of our songs was based on a poem Jude had recently written called “Ram YourFace.” There was no singing, just an intense verbal delivery that alternatedbetween speaking and screaming. It was about a highly dysfunctional relationshipin which the abuser was acting just like a tyrannical government. This was 1993,and later on I was quite surprised to discover that it was a possible prophecyof 9/11, eight years in advance. Here are the key lyrics: “Ram your face againstmy fist. Burn, feel, comprehend where we stand. Metal to metal, soul to soul,meshing to fusion. Scraping our sanity. Again you attempt manipulation. Failingto maintain utter control, crushed in defeat, you try to reach me with patheticthreats that would beckon my fate. The reason I fear you is I cling to thepast.”This may not sound that convincing at first, but the name of our band was onlyone letter off from Shanksville, a small town in Pennsylvania where a hijackedairliner crashed on 9/11. The world was going to go into a “Shanksvilledelirium,” and the planes would ram into the towers, causing metal to touchmetal, soul to touch soul, meshing to fusion and burning—just as the lyrics hadsaid. The result would immediately begin “scraping our sanity” on a collectivelevel. The lyrics also suggested a knowledge of the Cabal that may have beenresponsible for doing this, in that they were attempting manipulation, hadfailed to maintain utter control, and were perpetrating these attacks to try toprevent themselves from being crushed in defeat. Multiple insiders would laterconfirm this was the case. The lyrics also imply that once we stop clinging tothe past, we no longer need to fear these people. Other songs from thosesessions suggested the power elite were hiding the truth about UFOs and ancientcivilizations. The photo we used for the album cover featured two dreamlikefingers held up vertically in black and white, looking somewhat like the TwinTowers with smoke around them. My 9/11 prophecies would get much strongerbeginning in 1996, as we shall see.YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN FOR THISAs I started the spring semester I was beginning to feel genuine happinessagain. And then one fine afternoon, I had a conversation that changed my life soradically, in less than two hours, that the only other thing I could compare itto was the out-of-body experience. Everything I had experienced since myearliest UFO dreams as a child was transformed from fantasy into reality, rightthen—with the deafening thunderclap of proof. The flash of light I had witnessedin the sky now seemed to be only the beginning of a deeper message. I was aboutto find out that UFOs were real.In college I had become friends with a guy we will call Ian, who was from aneighboring school and who was a guitarist. He has never wanted to come forwardwith his story since I became a public figure, fearing threats to his life. Ianand I would also get together with his friend Mike, who played keyboards. We hadtalked about starting a band but never really did very much with the idea, andusually just laughed a lot. One day, not long after the semester started, Ianshowed up at my door unexpectedly. He was not smiling. When I asked him what wasup, he said, “You need to sit down for this.” I brushed it off at first, but hewas very serious, so I did exactly as he asked.“I don’t know how to tell you this, so I’m just going to start. Aliens arereal.”I immediately started laughing, accused him of trying to play a joke on me, andcomplimented him on his acting skills, saying maybe he had chosen the wrongmajor.“This is not a joke, man. You know I am a physics major. I just got out of atwo-hour private conversation with my physics professor, who is the head of thedepartment. He told me extraterrestrials crash-landed at Roswell in 1947 and thegovernment has been covering it up ever since. He worked in the higher echelonsof NASA throughout the 1970s. He said it was considered ‘common knowledge’ inthe higher levels of NASA that we are not alone in the universe, andextraterrestrials are regularly operating in our airspace.”“Okay, let’s just say you are telling me the truth. Why the hell haven’t theytold us?” I asked him.“He explained that too. He started out by telling our entire class that Roswellreally happened and NASA knew about it ever since they were founded. Peoplepanicked so much after War of the Worlds, a classic radio broadcast thatsimulated a mass alien invasion, that the government felt our society wouldcollapse if they ever told us the truth. He said he was allowed to tell us likethis, but that if anyone asked him about it again he would deny ever saying aword. Apparently NASA doesn’t mind if people learn about it here and there. Themain thing is they can never allow it to become front-page news on the New YorkTimes. Our class was utterly speechless as he laid this all out. I am his beststudent and I immediately asked for a teacher-student conference after the classwas over. He went on for two hours and told me much, much more than he had saidto the rest of the class.”“Like what?” I asked him.“Okay. I learned about the propulsion system the discs use. They have a particleemitter that first shoots out a particle going three-quarters the speed oflight. Then a trillionth of a second later, it shoots out another particle atlight speed. The faster particle bounces off the slower particle like a billiardball and shoots back to the ship, striking it on the side of the disc. Thishappens trillions of times per second, and each time the light-speed particleshit the ship, they create thrust. When you get trillions of those particle hitsper second, it allows the ship to quickly accelerate to near light speed. Theemitter can shoot particles from any part of the disc’s round edge, so it is agreat design because it can very easily make turns and travel in any direction.”I was stunned to hear this, as the physics seemed very logical—and something Iwould never have thought of.“What kinds of beings did they find inside? Did he say anything about that?” Iasked him.“Oh yes. He said they found three different types. The first one was like theGrays. They had large heads, large black eyes, thin bodies, and pale whitishskin. Some of them are around our height and others are shorter. He also saidthere was a second, shorter type that looked like a Gray, but the entire headwas only a helmet. Underneath it had a very different and much morefrightening-looking face, which they called ‘a monstrosity.’ He had noinformation on exactly what it looked like.”I was reeling from the implications of all this. I imagined that the“monstrosity” was some sort of reptilian-looking humanoid. “What about the thirdtype? You said there were three.”His eyes widened. “That’s the weirdest part of all. The third type looks almostexactly the same as human beings on Earth. There are only subtle differences,like they might have violet-colored irises or pupils that are diamond-shapedinstead of round.”“Well, if an extraterrestrial spacecraft crashed in Roswell, then that wouldmean our guys got their hands on some really advanced technology. Have they doneanything with the wreckage?” I asked him.“Absolutely. Like you can’t even imagine. He said that a variety of our favoritetechnologies were taken from this and other crashes and were ‘reverseengineered,’ as he called it. This includes solid-state transistors, computerchips, LED lights, lasers, holograms, fiber-optic cables, infrared night vision,Velcro, Teflon, and Kevlar, which they use to make bulletproof vests. They wouldtake something from one of the ships, hand it to a corporation, tell them it wasa ‘foreign technology,’ and ask them to figure out how to reproduce it. He alsotold me that in secret they have ‘smart materials’ that can repair their owndamage, generate anti-gravity, and create free energy. It has something to dowith the atoms all fitting together in a perfect geometric lattice. We will havehuge advances in materials science in the future and be able to custom-designcompounds at the molecular level to do exactly what we want.”“Did he say anything about the future? Anything about some kind of massivechange in our civilization?”“Yes. He told me they are going to keep releasing more and more of this stuff astime goes on. In the next twenty years, the amount of technology in the everydayworld will utterly have transformed our lives beyond what we could have imaginedtoday.”That was 1993, and by 2013 Ian’s NASA prophecy was already quite visible. TheInternet had transformed from a painfully slow dial-up curiosity to our dominantmeans of communication, media, and entertainment. We used to laugh at the two orthree kids who would tap away on loud keyboards in the Crispell Hall studylounge and brag about using “email” to communicate with people in foreigncountries. Smart watches and smart devices have now become vastly more powerfulthan “tower” computers that were two cubic feet in volume, required bulkymonochromatic screens, and plagued you with constant fan noise. We certainlyhaven’t gotten anti-gravity, free energy, or “smart materials” yet, buttechnology did indeed make a quantum leap.It is also interesting that the target date the professor gave us—twenty yearsafter February 1993—was almost immediately after the Mayan calendar end-date ofDecember 21, 2012. NASA apparently told him our society would be going through amajor transformation at that exact time. This also correlated nicely with ArthurC. Clarke’s date of 2010 for the movie where our entire solar system wentthrough a dramatic energetic transformation. This was only the second time I hadencountered that time frame—but it was definitely not the last.I never bothered to try to go meet the professor, since he said he would deny itif he was ever asked again. I thought back to Watergate, the people my parentssaw walking into the house across the street, the Jim Jones mass suicide, theIran-Contra hearings, the Eye under the bridge, the weird signal from thetelevision set, and all the astonishing conspiracies I had learned about insociology class. I had been on the front lines of a battle against governmentlies and secrecy on my own college campus, where they had completely hidden thedangers of the contamination that had occurred and forced us to go back toclass. I was absolutely certain that the government could be lying aboutsomething this big—and I became completely obsessed with learning as much aboutit as I possibly could. Out of respect to the professor’s family I am not goingto release his name, but I did look him up recently and confirm that he has nowpassed away, and that he did indeed work for NASA in the 1970s. Remarkably,other whistle-blowers validated everything he said and added a great deal more,as we shall see. This disclosure, barely over a month after I had the energeticsurge experience, set me on fire for the truth.Before long I started going down to the Elting Library in New Paltz with abackpack and would hit the 000 section—the very beginning of the entire DeweyDecimal System for cataloging books—and grab everything that looked interesting.Many of these books hadn’t been checked out in years—some even for ten ortwenty. It seemed appropriate that these books on the paranormal were at theorigin of the entire library, as I felt they contained the key to humanity’sbeginnings. I would go down there with a backpack full of books I had alreadyread and come home with another load of new ones. I quickly started burningthrough an average of five books a week. I read everything I could find on UFOs,extraterrestrials, angels, pyramids, Stonehenge, Easter Island, Atlantis,ancient civilizations, Nostradamus, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, ghosts,mediumship, and the Bermuda Triangle.The professor had said NASA already had working anti-gravity and free-energypropulsion systems. They also knew exactly how to build a flying saucer using aparticle emitter that could reach near light speed. That meant it was almost acertainty that they already had top secret craft that could easily travelthroughout our solar system—and possibly beyond. It also meant some of the UFOspeople were seeing could be built by humans here on Earth. Once I dug into theliterature, I realized that there were hundreds, if not thousands of examples ofhigh-quality UFO sightings going back to the late 1940s. Though our governmentmay have developed their own working prototypes after Roswell, there were alsocontinuing reports of sightings going back for millennia. If even one of thosesightings was genuine, then that meant we were not alone in the universe.Intelligent civilizations have been visiting us since the dawn of humanity onEarth.I became so addicted to research that I completely stopped going tosupport-group meetings. I had no desire to ever do drugs again—and never did. Inhindsight I realize that quitting the meetings was a bad idea, as I quicklybecame a “dry drunk,” as they call it in Alcoholics Anonymous. I still had manyof the problems of an addict—I had just changed what I was addicted to. This wasa subtle problem, not an outrageous one, and it would take me many years todiscover how these patterns had continued repeating. Most of it appeared in theaddictive behavior known as codependency; I would attract people into my lifewho took unfair advantage of me and were disrespectful, or even outrightbullies. However, I did become far healthier and far more successful, both on apersonal and academic level, almost immediately. I had found my great passion inlife. Most of my college classes were fairly easy, and I spent as many hours aday as possible doing research into UFOs and ancient civilizations.UFOS FOLLOWING LUNAR ASTRONAUTSThe book that started it all off for me practically leaped off the shelf when Isaw it. The title was Our Ancestors Came from Outer Space.34[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber33] The author was Maurice Chatelain, who had beenthe director of communications for the Apollo Moon missions. His job was todesign and implement the radio-wave systems, including a network of ground-basedparabolic dish antennas, that allowed Mission Control to maintain contact withthe Apollo astronauts. He openly admitted that the Gemini and Apollo astronautsall saw UFOs following them on their missions, as you are about to read. Best ofall, right in the introduction he hinted that they had discovered something onthe Moon that was “not anticipated,” and that he still could not talk aboutit—meaning it was not just UFOs, which he openly discussed:During these missions several strange things happened. Some still cannot betalked about and some I will mention without revealing my sources of informationand with the utmost reserve, because I personally was not there when theseincidents allegedly took place. It could be, for example, that both the Americanand the Russian space programs did bring back discoveries that were notanticipated.In the next chapter we will examine some of the stunning physical evidence thatChatelain may have been referring to. Early along in the book, Chatelain wentinto detail about how he became the director of communications for the Apolloprogram:[Defense contractor] North American submitted the best technical layout [toNASA] for both development and production of the Apollo spacecraft, andtherefore had been awarded the contract. . . . I was among the very first menwho presented themselves to North American, and since I was already known in theindustry as a radar and telecommunications specialist, I was immediately offeredthe task of designing and building the Apollo communication and data-processingsystem. Nobody specified my duties or functions, because no one at that timeknew what these systems would be like. But that, again, was of no importance inview of the rush to land on the Moon.35 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber34]Chatelain gave more detail on the next page:When the Apollo project started, there was no communication equipment powerfulenough or sensitive enough to make voice transmission possible from earth tomoon, not to mention transmission of television pictures over that distance.Such things had to be invented, perfected and built. . . . All these stationshad to be in contact with each other, and all of them had to report to theApollo Space Flight Center in Houston, Texas. . . . How I was put in charge ofall this within a few months after I started my new job at North American I willnever understand, but that is of no importance now. The only thing that reallycounts is that . . . everything functioned much better than we thought it wouldat the beginning, or even better than we ever expected. I think that it musthave happened because of some divine influence, not by human intelligence alone.Since that time I firmly believe in benevolent divine intervention in humanaffairs.36 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber35]Just as I was finishing this book in spring 2016, I found out about WilliamTompkins, an aerospace engineer who validated Chatelain’s theory ofextraterrestrial intervention in the development of the Apollo program. In hishighly technical book Selected By Extraterrestrials, Tompkins extensivelydocuments his work with Nordic human ETs who had blended into NASA. The Nordicshelped Tompkins design the rockets and systems that became the Apollo program.37[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber36] Once the Apollo missions were underway,Chatelain heard some very interesting rumors: “. . . the astronauts were notlimited to equipment troubles. They saw things during their missions that couldnot be discussed with anybody outside NASA. It is very difficult to obtain anyspecific information from NASA, which still exercises a very strict control overany disclosure of these events.” That sounded familiar. In the nearly twentyyears since Chatelain had written his book, nothing had changed—at leastaccording to Ian’s physics professor.Chatelain went on:It seems that all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distanceand sometimes also quite closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrialorigin—flying saucers, or UFOs. . . . Every time it occurred, the astronautsinformed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute silence. I think that WalterSchirra aboard Mercury 8 was the first of the astronauts to use the code name“Santa Claus” to indicate the presence of flying saucers next to space capsules.However, his announcements were barely noticed by the general public. It was alittle different when James Lovell on board the Apollo 8 command module came outfrom behind the moon and said for everybody to hear: “We have been informed thatSanta Claus does exist!” Even though this happened on Christmas Day 1968, manypeople sensed a hidden meaning in those words that was not difficult todecipher.Chatelain also indicated that these ETs did not just observe NASA:There was even some talk that the Apollo 13 mission carried a nuclear deviceaboard that could be set off to make measurements of the infrastructure of themoon . . . [with] several recording seismographs placed in different locations.The unexplained explosion of an oxygen tank in the service module of Apollo 13on its flight to the moon, according to rumors, was caused deliberately by a UFOthat was following the capsule—to prevent the detonation of the atomic chargethat could possibly have destroyed or endangered some moon base established byextraterrestrials. Well, there was a lot of talk and there still is.38[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber37]RUINS ON THE MOONIn that last quote, Chatelain directly alluded to there being anextraterrestrial base on the Moon. In April 1995, he published an article inwhich he admitted that the Apollo missions found “several mysterious geometricstructures of unnatural origin” on the Moon.39 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber38]This was one of the first things I read just a few months after getting onlinein late 1995 to do UFO research. The Internet was so small back then that if youtried to search for a particular name or topic, particularly in the UFO field,you might find only a few choices—if any. Once I began developing my own websitein 1999, I was frequently frustrated when I would search for information on aparticular topic of interest and every link that came up was from my own site.In the same article that featured Chatelain’s confession, Apollo astronautGordon Cooper was quoted as saying something amazing.Astronaut Gordon Cooper, also a former Air Force colonel, granted a secondinterview to Sam Sherman of Independent International Pictures Corporation, whois producing a film titled Beyond This Earth. In it Cooper said, “[I] had workedon a UFO system with someone who had been in touch with extraterrestrials andwas able to gain some knowledge.” This person had made a small UFO prototype andwas working on a 50-foot model with financial backing from an Arab country whenhe died. . . . Cooper also talked about a friend who actually viewed the ETbodies at Roswell. . . .”40 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber39]By this point in 1996 I had already read many books about working anti-gravityspacecraft that had been developed by the military-industrial complex. NikolaTesla apparently had a working anti-gravity system, as I detailed in The SourceField Investigations. A German scientist named Viktor Schauberger had foundnatural anti-gravity in the movement of rivers, allowing salmon to swim straightup through waterfalls over astonishing distances. Schauberger had replicatedthis natural phenomenon in a water turbine he called “the Repulsine,” and thetechnology was seized by Nazi Germany in the 1930s. This was machined into aworking engine they called die Glocke, or “the Bell,” that was used to powerUFO-type discs. Bob Lazar came forward as a whistle-blower and revealed he hadbeen hired to try to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial craft that was in thepossession of the US government. Although he was not successful, he learned agreat deal about how they worked.Furthermore, I read that anyone who tried to build these types of devices ontheir own would be threatened and either bought out or shut down—sometimes withlethal force. So when Gordon Cooper, an American hero, said that he was incontact with a man who was developing his own UFO with big Arab money behind it,I wasn’t at all surprised to find out that the man ended up dead soon afterward.It was also quite revealing to read that extraterrestrials had apparently beenin direct contact with this man to help him develop the technology. This samearticle featured another piece of data that perfectly validated what Chatelainhad said about NASA covering up the truth.During a May 6, 1995, radio interview on WOL-AM in Washington, D.C., DonnaTietze, a former photo technician at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houstonduring the Apollo moon missions, revealed that a co-worker in a restricted areahad the job of airbrushing UFOs out of lunar photos before NASA offered thephotos for sale to the public.41 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber40]Donna Tietze also said that “anomalies” were stripped out of all Moon photosbefore NASA offered them to the public as well42[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber41]—suggesting the presence of ruins or activebases on the surface of the Moon, just as Chatelain’s insiders had said. DonnaTietze ended up speaking at the Disclosure Project in 2001 as Donna Hare.43[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber42] I was fortunate enough to attend and I got tomeet her in person.Another Disclosure Project insider named Karl Wolfe testified to being shownpictures of a variety of buildings and domed structures on the Moon at a secretNASA briefing in mid-1965. Wolfe’s testimony is presented in the DisclosureProject Executive Summary Briefing document as follows: “Karl Wolfe was in theAir Force for 4 ½ years beginning in January 1964. He had a top secret cryptoclearance and worked with the tactical air command at Langley AFB in Virginia.While working at an NSA facility he was shown photographs taken by the LunarOrbiter of the moon that showed detailed artificial structures. These photoswere taken prior to the Apollo landing in 1969.”44[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber43]When Wolfe addressed the media at the National Press Club on May 10, 2001, hedescribed what he saw in a private room at the NSA facility in mid-1965 asfollows: “About 30 minutes into the process, he said to me, in a very distressedway, ‘By the way, we’ve discovered a base on the back side of the moon.’ Andthen he proceeded to put photographs down in front of me. Clearly in thesephotographs were structures—mushroom-shaped buildings, spherical buildings, andtowers. At that point I was very concerned because I knew we were working incompartmentalized security. He had breached security and I was actuallyfrightened at that moment, and I did not question him any further. A few momentslater someone did come into the room. I worked there for three more days and Iremember going home and naively thinking, ‘I can’t wait to hear about this onthe evening news.’ And here it is, more than 30 years later, and I hope we hearabout it tonight. And I will testify under oath before Congress.”45[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44]The Executive Summary document also includes Wolfe’s personal reflections ofwhat he felt after seeing these photos: “I didn’t want to look at it any longerthan that, because I felt that my life was in jeopardy. . . . I would have lovedto have looked at it longer, I would have loved to have had copies. I would loveto have said more about it, discussed it more, but I knew I couldn’t. I knew theyoung fellow who was sharing this was really, really overstepping his bounds atthat point. I felt that he just needed somebody to talk to. He hadn’t discussedit, couldn’t discuss it, and he wasn’t doing it for any ulterior motive otherthan the fact that I think he had the weight of this thing on him and it wasdistressing to him.”46 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45]With only three days left to finish this book on the final editing pass, I wasfortunate enough to get an extended interview with William Tompkins, theninety-four-year-old aerospace engineer who wrote Selected By Extraterrestrials.In his book, Tompkins provides extensive documentation to prove that he servedin the navy and later worked for defense contractors. Here is what he told methat NASA found on the Moon, in our interview:The first missions that we did going around the moon with the astronauts werejust preliminary missions before the LEM had to go up there and land. Here wehave these three guys in there, and they have cameras. As they go around themoon, they see all these structures—both on the view side facing us and thenreally elaborate structures on the other side that we can’t see. So theyphotograph this stuff. NASA does. And holy cats, what’s that all about?Everybody at NASA is looking over the photographs and trying to figure out whatis going on. We make another orbit a couple of weeks later, and, oh my gosh. Didyou see the height of that building? . . . [It] has to be three miles high. Andwait a minute! What did we see? No, hold on, back off. Wait a minute. They werejust building that thing. It was only ten stories high. . . . And in threeweeks, it’s three miles high? Who is doing that construction? . . . Do yourealize it would take us ten years to get half the height of that building?Now wait a minute. Look again. Do you see that big rectangular structure? It’sfloating! It’s not even on the [surface of the moon]. It’s got to be at leastfour or five miles high and ten miles wide! Now what in the hell is that? You’vegot to be kidding me. And it’s translucent! You can see rooms inside. You cansee the elevators! Well, holy cats. Don’t let anybody find out about this. Doyou see what I am trying to say? . . . We are watching this being built. Guyswith amateur cameras, if they watch this and they have a big enough camera andtelescope, they can see this building being built in a few days by some massiveproduction method developed by extraterrestrials. . . . It is insane! . . .There are bridges being built in several bays all the way across what would be adeep cavern, and can be five or six miles long. This bridge is built in a fewdays. Bang, bang, bang, bang, and it’s all done. . . .[NASA found] all different types of ruins. It was not like in Egypt, whereeverything is the same type of structure. . . . Not like in Los Angeles, whereyou’ve got rectangular buildings and highways and everything is generally thesame. Up on the moon, the old buildings that were there were not of any one typeof structure and construction. . . . What was accepted was that there had tohave been numerous different civilizations operating there.47[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46]I understand this may seem hard to believe, but Tompkins was able to validatedozens and dozens of highly classified data points I had heard from otherinsiders.NASA IS A DEFENSE AGENCY CLASSIFYING SECRETSOver the years, these new insiders provided dazzling confirmation of the data inChatelain’s book, and extended the scope of what Ian’s professor had revealed.Though Chatelain only hinted at “mysterious geometric structures of unnaturalorigin” and an extraterrestrial lunar base in his book Ancestors, it was obviousthat something had set him on fire about ancient civilizations. Most peoplethink of NASA as a benign, even boring group dedicated to peaceful spaceexploration, sharing everything they find with the public—but NASA’s owncharter, the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, reveals it was built tobe a defense agency that will withhold information for national securityreasons:Section 305 . . . (i): . . . The National Aeronautics and Space Administrationshall be considered a Defense Agency of the United States for the purpose ofChapter 17, Title 35 of the United States code. . . .Section 206 . . . (d): No [NASA] information which has been classified forreasons of National Security shall be included in any report made under thissection [of the act] . . .48 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47]Why legally define NASA as a defense agency that can withhold classifiedinformation if there isn’t anything out there that the US government felt theyshould be defending us against? Isn’t space supposed to be an empty, lifelessvoid? Apparently not. They do have something to hide. Donna Tietze’s associatewas hired to strip out the good stuff, and Chatelain said the astronauts weresworn to secrecy. Karl Wolfe feared for his life just from getting the chance tosee a picture of artificial structures on the Moon, since he understood howaggressively NASA defended its most classified secrets.DDT—DECOY, DISTRACT, AND TRASHMultiple insiders said that NASA and other groups used psychological operationsto discredit whistle-blowers. Dr. Steven Greer, the director of the DisclosureProject, revealed this was called a DDT campaign—for “decoy, distract, andtrash.” Paid government employees would create fake data known as“disinformation,” which would appear to be similar to what the insiders weresaying—and perhaps even more interesting. This data would be released into thesame media that the whistle-blowers were featured in, as if it were true. Thiswas the decoy. Then if the plan was successful, the public’s attention would bedistracted by the new information, fulfilling the second stage of the plan.People would start enthusiastically spreading the information to their friends,family, and coworkers. Then in the third stage, obvious mistakes in thedisinformation would be revealed. Now everyone would laugh at the people whospread the data, and would believe all of it was fake. This was the trash phaseof the DDT campaign.When I got to meet Donna Hare, Karl Wolfe, and others who had come forward, Icould tell they were extremely afraid for their lives. They were willing to beheroes and fight for the truth. They did not profit from disclosing thisinformation. In fact, many of them lost their jobs and were ostracized bycolleagues, friends, and family. The sarcastic, mocking language I read onlinewhen people tried to discredit these witnesses sounded just like the bullies Ihad to defend myself against in grade school. The truth was so outrageous tomost people that they would look for any possible weakness they could find in aninsider, and then attempt to use that to suggest the entire story was bogus. Somuch disinformation was being released on the Internet that I would have tofact-check every single thing I read. It was obvious that an incredible amountof money was being spent on deceiving the public.The proof finally appeared in a set of Snowden documents that Glenn Greenwaldpublished in February 2014. Unfortunately, this story did not garner anywherenear as much attention as the initial wave of disclosures, but a wealth ofevidence was provided nonetheless. According to Greenwald, “One of the manypressing stories that remains to be told from the Snowden archive is how Westernintelligence agencies are attempting to manipulate and control online discoursewith extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction. . . . Theseagencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp onlinediscourse, and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the Internetitself.”49 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber48]The group doing this is called the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group, orJTRIG. Greenwald continues:Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to injectall sorts of false material onto the Internet in order to destroy the reputationof its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques tomanipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considersdesirable. To see how extremist these programs are, just consider the tacticsthey boast of using to achieve those ends: “false flag operations” (postingmaterial to the Internet and falsely attributing it to someone else), fakevictim blog posts (pretending to be a victim of the individual whose reputationthey want to destroy), and posting “negative information” on variousforums. . . . The title page of one of these documents reflects the agency’s ownawareness that it is “pushing the boundaries” by using “cyber offensive”techniques against people who have nothing to do with terrorism or nationalsecurity threats. . . .These GCHQ documents are the first to prove that a major Western government isusing some of the most controversial techniques to disseminate deception onlineand harm the reputations of targets. Under the tactics they use, the state isdeliberately spreading lies on the Internet about whichever individuals ittargets, including the use of what GCHQ itself calls “false flag operations” andemails to people’s families and friends.50 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber49]I have been subject to a magnificent number of these campaigns since I beganposting disclosure-related material online in 1996. I would read every one ofthe most incredibly venomous and spiteful hate comments directed against me on adaily basis. The comments did not pause for evenings, weekends, or holidays. Itwasn’t until August of 2011 that I finally broke the “repetition compulsion” Iwas stuck in after suffering years of bullying as a child, and began protectingmyself from seeing these comments. Up until then, I had spent fifteen yearsingesting a daily diet of the most staggeringly horrible abuse, including severepersonal insults and an endless array of death threats. Every single tacticdescribed in the Snowden documents was used against me repeatedly. Hardly asingle day would go by without reading letters and comments that were boilingover with hatred. It took a great deal of discipline to remain positive andupbeat about myself and the work I was doing in light of these ongoing attacks.My life immediately improved when I conquered the addiction to reading them andwent back to following my passion, while doing my best to reach the highestquality in every bit of data I released.ASTRONAUTS SPEAKING IN CODEIf multiple NASA insiders are claiming that major secrets about the Moon arebeing hidden from us, then the astronauts would have to have protocols to avoidleaking the truth in their radio communications. One example would beChatelain’s revelation that the term “Santa Claus” was code for a UFO. Some ofthe transcripts of conversations the Apollo astronauts had with Mission Controlsuggested they were indeed seeing UFOs and mysterious structures on the Moon,51[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber50] but were instructed to use code phrases such as“Barbara” to refer to the artifacts. They were also warned to “Keep It LessObvious,” which appears to be the hidden meaning of the code word and acronym“KILO” that Mission Control used with the astronauts.KILO is only one of a variety of cryptic phrases used in this next exchange,where the landing of the lunar module appeared to have exposed an unusuallybright spot by blowing away some dust that was over it. This may have actuallybeen the surface of an ancient, intelligently constructed floor for a lunarbase. Remember, any spot above a relatively small level of brightness should notexist on the Moon—nor should there be lights that are flashing. Notice howmysterious the conversation gets in the official Apollo transcripts once MissionControl orders the astronaut to “go to KILO.” Suddenly, everything they aresaying about the “big anomalies”—i.e., large and unexpected things on the lunarsurface—is in a bizarre code. Then the astronaut breaks the code and states inplain language that he is seeing a light flash again:DMP (LUNAR MODULE): Where are your big anomalies? Can you summarize themquickly? . . .CMP (COMMAND MODULE PILOT): Hey, I can see a bright spot down there on thelanding site where they might have blown off some of that halo stuff.CAPCOM: Roger. Interesting. Very—go to KILO. KILO.CMP: Hey, it’s gray now and the number one extends.CAPCOM: Roger. We got it. And we copy that it’s all on the way down there. Go toKILO. KILO on that.CMP: Mode is going to HM. Recorder is off. Lose a little communication there,huh? Okay, there’s bravo. Bravo, select OMNI.Hey, you know you’ll never believe it. I’m right over the edge of Orientale. Ijust looked down and saw the light flash again.CAPCOM: Roger. Understand.52 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber51]Although these subjects were very interesting to me, we haven’t even begun todiscuss the greatest gems that I found in Chatelain’s book. He didn’t just leakinformation from insiders—he dedicated his life to researching ancientcivilizations and looking for proof that could validate what he had heard.Reading the results of his investigation was one of the most significantspiritual awakenings I had ever experienced up until then. It triggered alifelong interest in developing a new scientific model that could explain hisdiscoveries."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENCHATELAIN’S “BIG YEAR” ENDS WITH A BANGAll the seeds of my future were being planted in my imagination as I readChatelain’s book and opened my mind to the “big picture” of what he wasrevealing. There was a wealth of intriguing data in the book, but by far whatgrabbed me the most was something he called the “Constant of Nineveh.” Thiswasn’t just a fascinating relic of ancient technology and mathematics thatshouldn’t exist—it was a scientific revolution in the making. Chatelain alsodiscussed a 26,000-year cycle in the Earth that was a focal point for manyancient cultures. It was often divided into twelve “ages of the zodiac”measuring 2,160 years each, adding up to an exact total of 25,920 years. BothThe Source Field Investigations and The Synchronicity Key explore this cycleextensively. The more I read about this cycle, the more fascinated I became—asmultiple ancient texts claimed that the Sun would release a great surge ofenergy at the end of the cycle. This energetic surge was apparently themechanism that would trigger a mass ascension event on Earth.THE CONSTANT OF NINEVEHChatelain explained that when Sumerian clay cylinders were found in the libraryof King Assurbanipal in Nineveh, in what is now Iraq, not all of the cuneiformwritings they found were words and sentences. Entire cylinders were found thatcontained nothing but gigantic numbers. The archeologists ignored this,believing the Sumarians were just ancient savages obsessed with numbers, butChatelain looked into it and really studied them.Chatelain knew that in order to have a successful space mission, you had to makevery accurate calculations—and the only way to do it was by counting time inseconds. He had routinely juggled huge numbers in seconds for NASA, and startedanalyzing the discarded Sumerian data. His attention was drawn to the number195,955,200,000,000. This is approximately 6.2 million years of time in seconds.Chatelain discovered that you could produce this massive number by multiplying70 by 60, taking the product and multiplying it by 60 again, and cycling thisprocess a total of seven times. This reads as (70 × 60)7, or seventy times sixtyto the seventh power. Chatelain soon realized that with this one number, hecould calculate the exact time it took any planet, comet, or celestial object inthe solar system to make one full cycle around the Sun. Each object in our solarsystem would orbit our Sun in an exact number of cycles that would fit perfectlyinto this number—like twelve eggs in an egg carton:Every period of revolution or conjunction of all the solar system bodiescalculated by the Constant of Nineveh corresponded exactly down to severaldecimal points with the values given in the modern tables of United Statesastronomers. . . . I have not been able to find even a single period ofrevolution, or conjunction of a solar system planet or satellite, that would notbe an exact fraction down to the fourth decimal point of the Great Constant ofthe Solar System.53 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber52]Chatelain included a table in the book that had the exact number of cycles ittook for every planet’s orbit to fit into the Nineveh Constant, along with manyplanetary conjunctions and a variety of other celestial measurements. Halley’sComet makes exactly 81,000 cycles around the Sun during this 6.2-million-yearlength of time, and Pluto makes 24,998 cycles—which is only two Pluto-years awayfrom a perfect 25,000. Chatelain believed that since our data on Pluto was sospotty, further analysis would prove it fit into the Nineveh Constant withexactly 25,000 cycles. The fact that this massive, 6.2-million-year cycleintegrated all the motions in our solar system, down to four decimal points ofaccuracy, completely blew me away. Theoretically, all the planets would arrangeinto a perfect straight line at least once every 6.2 million years as a resultof this phenomenon.The planets were not supposed to have such a precise relationship with oneanother, and yet there it was. Chatelain had proved it, and as the director ofcommunications for the Apollo missions, he was uniquely qualified to be able todo so. NASA had decided he was the most competent, skillful man on Earth to beable to crunch the massive numbers needed to enable the lunar astronauts tocommunicate with Mission Control. Right away, I realized that there must be somegreat harmonic principle that was causing all the planets, comets, and orbitingbodies to work like this—similar to the gears in a fine Swiss watch. It was evenmore outrageous that we had not discovered this new science in modern timesuntil Chatelain came along, but somehow the ancient Sumerians knew it very well.They were obviously not a primitive society, as most people had been led tobelieve. Their scientific knowledge was far more powerful than most people hadgiven them credit for.THE HIDDEN SECRET OF THE PRECESSIONChatelain also spoke about a 26,000-year cycle called the precession of theequinoxes. It was a slow wobbling movement in the Earth that caused the apparentpositions of the stars in our night sky to drift by one degree every seventy-twoyears. He indicated that many ancient cultures seemed to be obsessed with thisnumber. I would soon find a wealth of evidence suggesting that a massiveenergetic event occurs at the end of each 26,000-year cycle. Multiple ancientteachings tell us the Sun will release some sort of visible light that is verydifferent than usual once we reach this point. The end of the cycle was widelybelieved to be somewhere around December 21, 2012, as I exhaustively detailed inThe Source Field Investigations. Since we have clearly not experienced thisevent yet, it is entirely possible for there to be a decent margin of error whenwe are talking about something that occurs only once every 26,000 years.Multiple sources have also confirmed that this event is not set to occur on anyfixed date, but occurs in response to a mass shift in consciousness on Earth.This epic solar and energetic flash may well produce ascension for those who areready for it—and thirty-five different ancient cultures had the science of thiscycle hidden in their mythologies, as we will soon discuss.Chatelain found that this magical 26,000-year cycle also fit perfectly into theConstant of Nineveh: “When I divided the Nineveh number by the cycle of theprecession of the equinoxes, also called the Big Year, I had the greatestsurprise of my life! The sacred number of Nineveh divided exactly into 240 BigYears of 9.450 million days each.” This book was translated from French, andevery other source calls it the “Great Year,” not the “Big Year,” so this waslikely to have been a simple error in translation. Chatelain revealed that this“Great Year” is perfectly integrated into a vast clockwork of orbits that areall interconnected with flawless precision. His breakthroughs revealed that ourcurrent scientific models of planetary and celestial orbits are in need of amassive overhaul. Ascension is built into the clockwork of the universe itself,and will propel us into the next level of evolution like a massive bell ringingon the hour. And somehow, the supposedly primitive Sumerians had alreadydiscovered this truth.LOST CIVILIZATIONS AND THE “USUAL INTERVAL”The vast majority of the books I read argued that a major disaster hadcompletely wiped out an ancient, highly advanced civilization that had spreadacross the entire globe. It was very common to hear the books refer to thiscivilization as Atlantis. The name Atlantis came from the Greek philosopherPlato, who revealed it in his works the Timaeus and Critias, from approximately400 BC. Plato got his information from Solon, the wisest of the Greeks, who wasfortunate enough to gain entrance into the highly secretive Egyptian priesthood.The priests told Solon about a powerful cycle of time that they called the“usual interval,” which is almost certainly the 26,000-year cycle. The priestsindicated that each cycle would end with a catastrophe that would destroy entirecivilizations. We were already experiencing a variety of natural disasters whenI first read this in 1993—far more than in our recorded history—so it very muchcaught my attention. The priests said the destruction could be “by fire,” whichthey called a “conflagration,” or “by water,” which could cause a great flood.In this next passage, the Egyptian priest is speaking directly to Solon. Thestory may seem hard to follow at first, but I will explain what it means afterthe quote:The Myth of Helios, explained as a natural astronomical event: There is a story,which even you have preserved, that once upon a time Paethon, the son of Helios,having yoked the steeds in his father’s chariot, because he was not able todrive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, andwas himself destroyed by a thunderbolt. Now this has the form of a myth, butreally signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around theearth, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs afterlong intervals. . . .54 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber53]This was very confusing to me when I first read it. Clearly it was talking aboutsome sort of massive energetic event, here described as a “great conflagration”or fire, which repeats after “long intervals” of time. Once I read Fingerprintsof the Gods by Graham Hancock in 1995, this made more sense. Hancock reported onthe work of two great historians, Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Dechend,who found thirty-five different ancient examples of the 26,000-year cycleencoded into mythology through symbolism.In Plato’s example, Helios represents the Sun. The horses are symbolicallypulling the Earth around the Sun, causing its normal orbit to occur. Thensomething suddenly changes the Earth’s orbit, and the horses can no longerfollow their normal course. We are then told that once the Earth’s orbit isdisrupted, there is some sort of energetic release that burns up everything onthe Earth—which could again be a symbol for a solar event of some kind. TheEgyptian priest then translates the myth for Solon, saying it signifies a “longinterval” of time that causes “a declination of the bodies moving in the heavensaround the earth.” This is a very precise description of the precession of theequinoxes.The Zoroastrian scriptures mirror many other sources in saying this change willbe very positive. Their word for this solar event is Fraso-kereti, whichliterally translates as “making wonderful.”55 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber54]In the Zoroastrian tradition, this event will be helped along by a messianicfigure called the Saoshyant, who arrives with a variety of angelic beings thatdefeat the negative forces on Earth.56 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber55] TheHindu scriptures have a very similar-sounding story involving the arrival ofKalki the Destroyer, who has supernatural powers and vanquishes all evil afterthe great Samavartaka fire erupts at the end of an age.57[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber56] The Mahabharata describes the Samavartaka fireas being rainbow-colored in appearance:And there rise in the sky deep masses of clouds, looking like herds of elephantsand decked with wreaths of lightning that are wonderful to behold. And some ofthose clouds are of the hue of the blue lotus; and some are of the hue of thewater-lily; and some resemble in tint the filaments of the lotus and some arepurple and some are yellow as turmeric and some of the hue of the crows’ egg.And some are bright as the petals of the lotus and some red as vermillion.58[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber57]The ancient legend of this solar event continued on into Greek and Romanphilosophy texts, where it is referred to as Ekpyrosis. This word has at leasttwo alternate spellings: Ekpurosis and Ecpyrosis. This is due to differences intranslating Greek characters into Roman letters. The Wikipedia entry on thesubject at the time of this writing happens to be more thorough than anydictionary definitions:Ekpyrosis is a Stoic belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by a greatconflagration every Great Year. The cosmos is then recreated (palingenesis) onlyto be destroyed again at the end of the new cycle. This form of catastrophe isthe opposite of kataklysmos . . . the destruction of the earth by water. Theconcept of ekpyrosis is attributed to Chrysippus by [the Greek historian]Plutarch.59 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber58]Indiana University professor James Albert Harrill wrote a surprisingly detailedpiece linking these Greco-Roman philosophical teachings to later writings in theChristian Bible and other texts:Apocalyptic scenarios of eschatological [end-times] destruction and renewalappear in many early Christian writings. . . . For example, the apostle Pauldeclares the wrath of the Day of the Lord (1 Thess 1:10; 4:13–5:10; cf. 2 Thess2:1–12) and the ultimate transformation of “all creation” (Rom 8:18–25). TheGospel of Mark promises its audience that heaven and earth “will pass away” inthe imminent end times (13:24–31; cf. Matt 5:18; Luke 16:17; Isa 13:9–13). Theseer of Revelation envisages . . . a “new heaven and a new earth” replacing “thefirst heaven and the first earth,” which “had passed away” (21:1). The Gospel ofMatthew speaks of a “renewal of all things” following the final judgment(19:28). And the Didache warns its audience about “the fire of testing” intowhich all human creation will soon enter (16.5).60[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber59]Modern spiritual teachers such as the Bulgarian mystic Peter Deunov (1864–1944)presented very similar-sounding messages, perhaps inspired by these voluminousancient prophecies. According to Deunov, “The Fire of which I speak, thataccompanies the new conditions offered to our planet, will rejuvenate, purify,reconstruct everything: the matter will be refined, your hearts will beliberated from anguish, troubles, incertitude, and they will become luminous;everything will be improved, elevated; the thoughts, sentiments, and negativeacts will be consumed and destroyed.”61 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber60]THE “STREAM FROM HEAVEN” AND THE LAW OF KARMAIn Plato’s account, he next says that the priest indicates that the Egyptianshad records of many different lost civilizations that had come and gone. He alsorefers to this solar event as a “stream from heaven” that “comes pouring down”after “the usual interval.” He clearly states that only people who are“destitute of letters and education” remain in the aftermath.At this point you may be wondering what in the world you have gotten yourselfinto by reading this book. Let me say right now that I did not write this bookto create fear, nor to push any specific religious or spiritual texts. Everymajor spiritual teaching about this event suggests that only the most evilpeople on Earth will experience a negative time line like this, due to the factthat they have invited it through their own free will and karma. Unless you area truly dark, manipulative, and controlling person, you will never see aworldwide catastrophe—at least not in any physical sense. Instead, theexperience is one of unspeakable joy and wonderment—a quantum leap in spiritualevolution. And if you do feel you may be treading too closely to the negativeside, there’s still time to change the road you’re on—as Robert Plant sang in“Stairway to Heaven.”The subjects of karma, the afterlife, and reincarnation are extensivelydiscussed in The Synchronicity Key, with nearly seven hundred academicreferences to help prove the points. The book ends with a series of highlyrevealing quotes from the Muslim holy text the Koran, all of which clearlypredict that this mass energetic event will take place. Here are two of the mostprovocative quotes:When time suddenly disappears, in the eternal moment of illumination thebrightness of the heavenly orbs will be split open and dissolved intotransparent light. . . . Those who fail to live in constant expectation of themystic Day, regarding this teaching as myth or imagination, will be severelydisappointed when the Last Day actually arrives and they are not spirituallyprepared. (Meditation on Holy Qur’an 77:8, 15)62[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber61]Upon the mysterious Day when time ends, all manifest Being will tremble at thefirst thundering blast of Divine Resonance that will utterly stop theworld. . . . This momentary terror will disappear when each soul realizes itsspiritual body to be perfect, limitless and holy. (Meditation on Holy Qur’an79:6, 13)63 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber62]The Synchronicity Key discusses how reincarnation was a hidden secret ofChristianity as well as an openly accepted teaching in many other religions. Theteachings tell us that we keep reincarnating after each lifetime until we growenough that we are ready for the next level of human evolution. Reincarnation isalso a scientifically provable fact. Dr. Ian Stevenson interviewed more thanthree thousand children who had accurate memories of their past lives that wereconfirmed by doing research to verify their claims. Dr. Jim Tucker used forensicface-matching software to prove that children who accurately remembered theirpast lives also looked very similar to the people they claimed to have beenbefore. This data strongly suggests that our facial features are carried fromlifetime to lifetime by an energetic aspect of our consciousness, which directlyaffects how our faces look as we grow.If you believe in the law of karma, and you consider deeply the horrific crimesthat certain world elites have perpetrated, you may begin to understand why anegative time line like this might exist. If each of us must re-experienceeverything that we put others through, how do we balance out the actions of aperson who has committed mass atrocities—and may be indirectly or directlyresponsible for the rape, torture, and murder of hundreds, if not thousands ofcitizens? A surprisingly large number of people have been hypnotically regressedto the “life between lives,” or have had a near-death experience, and theirreports of the afterlife are very consistent. No matter how negative we may bein our physical lives, our souls are extremely pure and understand what we arereally here to learn. Some people may deliberately choose, on the soul level, togo through a mass catastrophe. That way they can discharge all the negativekarma they have built up and have a fresh start for the next cycle. They may becompletely unaware that anyone on their planet had been given a “free pass”where they got to avoid these events entirely.The spiritual sources I came into direct contact with, beginning with the Law ofOne series, taught me very clearly that you do not mess with karma. It is anabsolute law that is upheld with the most rigorous, exacting precision. As wewill see, I had an astonishing example of this occur in my own life in 1996,when the future was predicted with remarkable clarity—and taught me quite alesson. My surprising introduction to the Law of One will be featured later inthis book, and I hope you will be able to share in the wonder I felt when Irealized how many mysteries it solved.YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS NO BETTER THAN THE TALES OF CHILDRENEventually I would read many different sources, some ancient and some modern,that tell us a certain number of people stay on the Earth to physicallyexperience a mass energetic event like this, whereas others go throughascension. People who are not ascending, but have not invited negative karma,appear to be moved ahead in time to a point when it becomes safe again.Apparently they have no memory of what happened to them, as otherwise they mightbe very disappointed that they did not get to “graduate.” Keep all this in mindwhen you read what the priest said about the survivors of these catastrophes:And whatever happened either in your country or in ours, or in any other regionof which we are informed—if there were any actions noble or great or in anyother way remarkable, they have all been written down by us of old, and arepreserved in our temples.Whereas just when you and other nations are beginning to be provided withletters and the other requisites of civilized life, after the usual interval,the stream from heaven, like a pestilence, comes pouring down, and leaves onlythose of you who are destitute of letters and education; and so you have tobegin all over again like children, and know nothing of what happened in ancienttimes, either among us or among yourselves.64 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber63]In this last excerpt, the priest chastises Solon for trying to sound like aknow-it-all because he can report genealogies of kings going back generations.The real truth is that humanity is far more ancient than we realize—and it risesand falls in cycles on the Earth, measured by the “usual interval” of 26,000years:As for those genealogies of yours which you just now recounted to us, Solon,they are no better than the tales of children. In the first place you remember asingle deluge only, but there were many previous ones; in the next place, you donot know that there formerly dwelt in your land the fairest and noblest race ofmen which ever lived, and that you and your whole city are descended from asmall seed or remnant of them which survived. And this was unknown to you,because, for many generations, the survivors of that destruction died, leavingno written word.65 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber64]THE SECRETS OF THE MONOLITHArthur C. Clarke’s 2010 featured an energetic release from Jupiter, not the Sun,that transformed our solar system but was not catastrophic. His classic workChildhood’s End also features a major energy release, this time from the Sun, inthe grand finale. This solar release transforms humanity into a new level ofevolution. And let’s not forget the monolith that appears in 2001. It is anancient, twenty-foot-tall, mirror-polished black stone rectangle that firstappears when humans are no more evolved than apes. It causes one of the apes tobecome more intelligent and get the idea to use a bone to kill another ape. Thisappears to signify the first moment humans learned to use tools. Then the apethrows the bone into the air and it becomes the spacecraft we see in the rest ofthe film. This seems to indicate that we are now on the verge of the nextmassive burst of human evolution as a result of having developed space travel. Amarvelous gift is waiting for us once we progress enough to make it out intospace.The second monolith in 2001 is dug up on the Moon. This is far more interestingin light of the evidence we are now discussing. Multiple insiders have confirmedthat NASA already knew there were ancient ruins on the Moon, and used Arthur C.Clarke to tell us the truth disguised as fiction. Once sunlight hits thesharp-edged black slab for the first time since the astronauts dug it out in2001, it sends out a beacon to another monolith. This time, the object isfloating in our solar system near Jupiter. The Odyssey spacecraft goes out toview the monolith, and its captain, David Bowman, ends up going through a wildstargate experience once he flies out to explore it. The stargate thentransforms him into the next level of human evolution—the Starchild. Hereappears in 2010 as an ascended being who can travel through electrical wiresand project an image of himself on a television for his mother, and he tellsher, “Something wonderful is going to happen.”THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRAWhen the monolith first appears in 2001, we hear a gripping orchestral scorewith very dramatic horns and booming drums. This composition was written byRichard Strauss in 1896, and is called Thus Spoke Zarathustra.66[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber65] This title appears to be a major clue.Zarathustra is the correct Persian name for the religious leader often referredto as Zoroaster in the Western world. Zoroastrianism is the oldest religion onEarth, after Hinduism. The Zoroastrian scriptures go into great detail about theSun giving off a massive energetic release at the end of a long, repeating cycleof time. In the Zoroastrian version it is very clearly stated that this producesan ascension-type event, which they call “Fraso-kereti,” as we said. Clarkefeatures the exact same type of event in Childhood’s End and 2010. This suggeststhe name of Strauss’s composition was a deliberately planted clue for those whowere paying attention.Strauss’s composition was also inspired by a work of the philosopher FriedrichNietzsche with the same title. According to the official Kennedy Center website,Strauss said, “I did not intend to write philosophical music or to portrayNietzsche’s great work in musical terms.” The Kennedy Center goes on to say,“Instead, this sixth of his pioneering series of tone poems (composed in 1896)was meant to suggest ‘the evolution of the human race from its origins, throughits various phases of development (religious and scientific), right up toNietzsche’s idea of the superhuman [Übermensch].’”67[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber66]None of this appears to be a coincidence. Richard C. Hoagland, whom we will meetin the next chapter, admitted to having detailed off-the-record conversationswith Arthur C. Clarke about what he really knew. Hoagland also had a man on theinside feeding him highly classified information, whom we will call Bruce. I wasfortunate enough to meet Bruce at a conference in 2007 where Hoagland hadinvited me to speak. Bruce had strangely blue eyes, a gravelly voice, and asarcastic, humorous personality. Bruce threw his arm around me as I was walkingout of the room after my talk and said, “You’re about eighty-five percentcorrect.” When I asked, “What is the other fifteen percent?” he said, “That’sgoing to take some time. Let’s go have dinner on me and I will tell you.” I soonfound out that Bruce had worked directly with US presidents in at least twodifferent administrations. In August 2014, Bruce told me far more of what hereally knew and said it was “authorized by the United States government.” Hetold me they do not want to release this information all at once, but insteadchoose to use private individuals like myself. That way the people who want toknow the truth will gradually find out, and a mass panic will be avoided.The NASA insiders definitely seem to believe we are heading into a massevolutionary event. However, their interpretation of what will occur seems to beheavily colored by their own occult religious beliefs, which are rooted in theteachings of secret societies. They apparently see an event like this as a“useful” mass catastrophe. They also seem to willfully reject the information ofmany positive spiritual teachings, including Christianity, and believe that onlythe occult elite will benefit from whatever they think is going to happen.Most people will automatically laugh at this entire discussion since it seems sooutrageous. The idea of a change this epic in scope seems completely beyond ourimagination. We get so captivated by the day-to-day world of our lives that theidea of a stunningly discontinuous change in the foundation of our veryexistence seems impossible to comprehend. Even the people who do believe itoften backslide into habitual thought patterns about the “real world.” The ideathat this change could be coming in our own near-term future makes thediscussion even more outrageous. Nonetheless, I have been receiving informationabout the Ascension Mysteries my entire life. I was introduced to these conceptsover many years, beginning with dreams, synchronicities, and the seeminglyscience-fiction content of various movies, TV shows, and books. I didn’t startencountering the hard data until I was nineteen years old. And as I have said sooften at my conferences, wouldn’t you want to know about it in case it really istrue? Is it right for the government to withhold information that maydramatically affect the lives of every person on Earth—and which appears tovalidate every major religion and spiritual teaching in existence?SCHMITT’S STONEHENGEYears after I read Chatelain’s book, I would discover another interesting cluethat the NASA astronauts had found ruins on the Moon. Dr. Harrison “Jack”Schmitt was an experienced professional geologist whom NASA had brought in tohelp study the lunar surface. According to Chatelain, “Schmitt, a geologist, wasthe first civilian to visit the moon, all the other astronauts having beenmilitary men.”68 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber67] Schmitt spent considerabletime learning the systems the Apollo astronauts were using. He was assigned tothe three-person Apollo 15 backup crew in March 1970, and was supposed to bepart of the prime crew of Apollo 18. In September 1970, Apollos 18 and 19 werecanceled, and humanity’s last official mission to the Moon would be Apollo 17,launching in December 1972. The community of professional geologists advisingNASA felt so strongly about the need to have a PhD geologist examine the Moonthat they successfully pressured NASA to include Schmitt on Apollo 17.NASA astronauts got to design the patch for each mission in collaboration with aprofessional artist. They would typically come up with multiple designs beforesettling on the one they felt was the best. The three Apollo 17astronauts—Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and Harrison Schmitt—handed theirsketched ideas to professional artist Robert T. McCall, who then createdconcept-art illustrations that were submitted for final review.69[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber68]Schmitt proposed two different designs that included strange images ofStonehenge on the patch. On the first design, Stonehenge towers above thesurface of the Earth and is practically touching the Moon, with the Sun shiningright in between. There is a clear beam of light between Stonehenge and the Moonthat passes through the Sun and then goes off to the left and the right, forminga four-part cross—almost like an energy portal or stargate. This was three yearsafter the movie 2001 had emerged, in which the ship’s captain, David Bowman,went through an elaborate stargate experience at the end of the film.In Schmitt’s second patch idea, the final stage of the Apollo rocket that fliesthe astronauts home from the Moon is seen rising from a barren-looking grayworld that looks more like the Moon than the Earth. A Stonehenge-like circlerises prominently off this barren world. The stones seem very large and no othersigns of surface features are anywhere on the globe, suggesting it is picturingthe Moon, not Earth. The lander then flies up with the image of a spiral galaxyprominently behind it. This may have been Schmitt’s way of suggesting thatwhoever built this lunar Stonehenge was from elsewhere in our galaxy—or even aneighboring one.[../image/1.jpg]Robert McCall’s Sketches of Harrison Schmitt’s Apollo 17 “Stonehenge” PatchesIn an interview that NASA’s main artist conducted for the Johnson Space CenterOral History Project, Robert McCall said, “Jack Schmitt was the geologistastronaut on that mission, and he thought Stonehenge would be a wonderful imageto include.”70 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber69] This is a little-known piece ofApollo history that supports the insider testimony of Maurice Chatelain, DonnaHare, Karl Wolfe, William Tompkins, and several others I would get to know verywell. Schmitt may have gotten a little too enthusiastic with his patch ideas,knowing he was spilling the beans on something of massive importance, and hisideas were rejected. Thankfully, NASA was unable to hide all the photographicevidence of advanced ancient ruins on the Moon, as we will see in the nextchapter. Some very compelling data managed to survive from both the Russian andAmerican space programs."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENTHE LOST SURVIVORS FROM THE MOONOn November 20, 1966, NASA’s Lunar Orbiter 2 was drifting twenty-nine milesabove the Moon’s surface, over the Sea of Tranquility, when it captured astunning image that rocked the Russian and American media and scientificcommunities. Eight huge towers of different heights appear to rise up off theMoon’s surface. Curiously, they all seem to have the form of an Egyptianobelisk. In London, Paris, and New York, large Egyptian obelisks are on publicdisplay, each commonly called Cleopatra’s Needle. The Washington Monument inAmerica’s capital city is the largest version, standing at 555 feet tall. Thisheight may well have been deliberately chosen for secret ceremonial purposes;666 might have been too obvious for a statue that was intended to commemoratethe masculine aspect of Lucifer.Most people never stop to think how odd it is that the United States would honorits first president with a gigantic obelisk, symbolizing the Egyptian sky-godOsiris. Although I do not believe these gods were originally negative, in theoccult tradition of the Cabal, Osiris and Isis represent the male and femaleaspects of Lucifer. Most people are also unaware that the Statue of Liberty issecretly meant to represent Isis, complete with the beams of light radiatingfrom the top of her head, indicating that she has become ascended. It isimportant to point out that Cabal people believe they are “the just” and willascend when this mass solar event takes place. They see everyone outside theirgroup as “the wicked,” and believe this event will physically destroy them. Theyeven contort quotes out of the Bible and believe that stealing our money is Godtaking from “the wicked” and giving to “the just.”The Cabal members believe their strength is due to their selective combinationand practice of a wide variety of secret mystery-school teachings from ancientcultures all over the world, including Babylonian, Egyptian, Celtic, and Sufi.Cabal members often refer to everyday people as “the profane.” They feel we arenot worthy of learning the sacred Mysteries, as they are often called—with thefirst letter capitalized. They fear that if ordinary people gained access to theMysteries and began practicing the teachings, they could develop ascendedabilities and use them to hurt others, potentially becoming a great threat. Thetorch held by the Statue of Liberty secretly represents the “Sacred Fire ofAntiquity,” the knowledge of the Mysteries, and the book she holds in her otherhand contains the Mysteries themselves.In 2011, two Arizona State University scientists openly proposed that we mayfind evidence of extraterrestrial settlements on the Moon. Universe Todaycarried the story and used a corrupted photo of the towers captured by LunarOrbiter 2 at the top. The original 1966 photo was not damaged and was far morerevealing, as we shall see. The corrupted photo has a sharp line running downthe middle, right next to the tallest tower, which the original did not have.Furthermore, the black levels have been cranked up, making the shadows of thetowers very difficult to see—unlike the original, where they were staggeringlyobvious. Nonetheless, this announcement was a positive step forward, and maywell have been part of the gradual disclosure process:Two researchers at Arizona State University (ASU) have made a rathercontroversial proposal: have the public and other researchers study thehigh-resolution photographs of the Moon already being taken by the LunarReconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), to look for anomalies that may possibly beevidence of artifacts leftover from previous alien visitation. The theory isthat if our solar system had been visited in the past, the Moon would have madean ideal base from which to study the Earth. . . .Of course, it has been said by some that such artifacts have already been foundand known about for decades but hidden from the public by NASA, et al. . . .There are actually a handful of anomalies from various missions that would beinteresting to see at much higher resolution via LRO, such as the well-known“Blair Cuspids” photographed by Lunar Orbiter 2 in 1966. . . .71[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber70]This article did not take into account the fact that NASA deliberatelyairbrushes artifacts and UFOs out of their images before they release them tothe public. They do not want us to see these anomalies with any detail—at leastnot until they feel it is advantageous for them to release the information.Therefore, we have to do the best we can in analyzing those few images that havemanaged to escape the ongoing censorship efforts that are in place.TRANSPARENT ALUMINUMIt is astonishing to find Egyptian-style obelisks on the Moon, and we willsurvey much more of the evidence as this chapter goes on. This changeseverything we thought we knew about ourselves, our lives on Earth, and thegreater cosmos that surrounds us. Multiple insiders have confirmed that theseobelisks and towers are made out of a clear glass-like material—as seen on thecover of the American edition of this book. The actual material has beenanalyzed and is an advanced, transparent aluminum alloy. Bruce first told methis in 2014, as part of his “authorized disclosure.” Just over a year later, aUS Naval Research Laboratory scientist named Dr. Jas Sanghera announced hisdiscovery—or perhaps his authorized release—of a transparent aluminum alloy. Theexistence of this material appears to have been deliberately leaked in the filmStar Trek IV: The Voyage Home. In this article from Ubergizmo, the authorreflects on his fondness for the movie and how fascinating it is that thismaterial now exists in the “real world.”It seems that transparent aluminum is as real as it gets today, thanks to USNaval Research Laboratory scientist Dr. Jas Sanghera who described it as“actually a mineral, it’s magnesium aluminate. The advantage is it’s so muchtougher, stronger, harder than glass. It provides better protection in morehostile environments—so it can withstand sand and rain erosion.” . . . Shouldthe cost come down in due time, then consumer applications will also benefit,including smartphones and watches.72 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber71]In this next quote from Total Security Solutions, the authors discuss howtransparent aluminum works far better than current bulletproof glass. Anarmor-piercing bullet of .50-caliber size will travel three inches throughbulletproof glass but can make it only half as far through transparent aluminum.Even better, transparent aluminum weighs half as much and needs to be only halfas thick as traditional bulletproof-glass armor:In addition, transparent aluminum armor can be produced in virtually any shapeand can also hold up to the elements much better than traditional bulletproofglass, which can be worn away by blowing desert sand or shrapnel.73[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber72]This article also reveals that the US Navy is working on a version they callSpinel, while the military-industrial complex defense contractor Raytheon isproducing their own version called ALON:Developed by Raytheon, ALON begins as a powder, which is then molded and bakedin very high heat. The heating process causes the powder to liquefy and coolquickly, leaving the molecules loosely arranged, as if still in liquid form. Itis this crystalline structure that provides ALON its level of strength andscratch resistance comparable to rugged sapphire. Polishing the aluminumoxynitride strengthens the material and also makes it extremely clear.74[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber73]Almost every insider I have met has indicated that the major defense contractorfirms are intimately involved with the UFO cover-up and reverse-engineering oftechnology. The gradual release of transparent aluminum into our society appearsto be a further fulfillment of the prophecy of Ian’s physics professor. He hadtold us we would see stunning breakthroughs in materials science, creatingcompounds with geometric crystalline structures that were much more useful andpowerful than anything we had ever seen before.Transparent aluminum weighs very little. This means you can build elaboratestructures with it without the risk of them falling over under their own weight.The transparency of the material would also allow you to create gigantic domesthat would permit sunlight to pass through. The dome could then be pressurizedwith an atmosphere, thanks to the abundant water ice on the Moon. This wouldprovide a safe and habitable area for people to live, providing it was given aradiation-proof coating. If the dome was thick enough, it would also create animpressive shield against enemy attacks, given that transparent aluminum issignificantly more effective than bulletproof glass.The towers in the Lunar Orbiter 2 image are extremely tall, extremely skinny,and have pointed tops, exactly as obelisks do.75[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber74] It is highly unlikely that any naturalgeological processes could have created such huge towers on the surface of theMoon. Millions of years of meteorite strikes should have pounded the life out ofany natural feature that would poke that far above the horizon. There is aconstant stream of particles and chunks of rock hitting the Moon, traveling at avery high speed, and their effect is much like a sandblaster. Yet, as we justread, transparent aluminum is extremely resistant to sandblasting.Unfortunately, Orbiter 2 was pointing straight down when the classic photo wastaken, so we cannot see the sides of these objects. Nonetheless, the shadowsthey cast are remarkable—and have been subjected to extensive scientificanalysis.THE VALLEY OF MONUMENTSAccording to a Washington Post article on November 23, 1966, “The six shadowswere hailed by scientists as one of the most unusual features of the moon everphotographed. . . . On seeing the picture, one scientist wanted to call theregion the moon’s ‘Valley of Monuments.’ . . . Scientists said they have no ideawhat is casting the shadows. The largest shadow is just the sort that would becast by something resembling the Washington Monument, while the smallest is thekind of shadow that might be cast by a Christmas tree.”76[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber75] NASA said the Sun was eleven degrees above thehorizon, and therefore estimated the “largest protuberance” was approximatelyfifty feet wide at its base and between forty and seventy-five feet high.77[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber76][../image/07_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Original NASA Lunar Orbiter 2 Image LO2-61H3, Showing Lunar ObelisksBoeing made the Lunar Orbiter 2 spacecraft that took the photo, and a Boeinganthropologist named William Blair openly stated that this image reminded him ofan aerial survey map from a prehistoric archeological site. A Los Angeles Timesarticle from February 1, 1967, quoted Blair as saying, “If such a complex ofstructures were photographed on earth, the archeologist’s first order ofbusiness would be to inspect and excavate test trenches and thus validatewhether the prospective site has archeological significance.”78[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber77]Blair noticed that the towers had a curious geometric alignment, which lookslike the stars in the belt of the constellation Orion to even the casualobserver. The three main pyramids on the Giza plateau in Egypt are also built toperfectly match the positions and magnitudes of the stars in Orion’s belt, asRobert Bauval discovered in the mid-1990s. Since Egypt has obelisks that seemsimilar to whatever we are seeing on the Moon, this suggests the intriguingpossibility that the people who built the Egyptian monuments may have also hadbases on the Moon. Or the Egyptian settlers may have had records from survivorsof a lost civilization that had lived on the Moon. These survivors may have evenbelieved they were descended from ancient ancestors in the constellation Orion,and had traveled to our solar system from this nearby group of stars long ago.Russian scientists created a detailed analysis of the obelisks’ geometry in theTechnology for Youth publication. According to an article in Argosy magazine,“Soviet space engineer Alexander Abramov has come up with a rather startlinggeometrical analysis of the arrangement of these objects. By calculating theangles at which they appear to be set, he asserts that they constitute an‘Egyptian triangle’ on the moon—a precise geometric configuration known inancient Egypt as an abaka. ‘The distribution of these lunar objects,’ statesAbravov, ‘is similar to the plan of the Egyptian pyramids constructed byPharaohs Cheops, Chephren, and Menkaura at Gizeh, near Cairo. The centers of thespires in this lunar abaka are arranged in precisely the same way as the apicesof the three great pyramids.’”79 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber78][../image/08_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Russian Geometric Analysis of Lunar Obelisks in Technology for Youth magazineTHE COLLAPSED RECTANGLESince the Moon has no atmosphere, you would either have to live inside abulletproof structure or go underground. Otherwise you would be constantlypelted with rocks of different sizes, from micro-meteorites right on up throughthe much larger and more dangerous chunks that form craters once theycrash-land. On Earth, most of these rocks burn up in our atmosphere as meteorsbefore they ever hit the surface. On the Moon’s surface you would also beexposed to radiation from the Sun without the shield of an atmosphere to protectyou. Transparent aluminum is difficult to manufacture in large quantities, andwould also require an effective radiation-proof coating. Building a base belowthe surface would be much easier, comparatively speaking. This means we wouldend up seeing a large, hollow area, probably square or rectangular, below thesurface. If such a structure were many thousands of years old, the roof wouldgradually be pounded in by meteorite strikes. Over time, the geometric structureof the room below the surface would become visible.Remarkably, Blair noticed the Moon’s surface had collapsed in a highlyartificial-looking rectangular shape right in the middle of all these toweringspires. This suggests that we are seeing the remains of an ancient undergroundbase whose roof had fallen in on itself.According to the Los Angeles Times in a 1967 article, “The anthropologist alsodiscovered in the photo, he says, what appears to be a large rectangular shapeddepression or pit directly west of the largest spire, estimated to be as tall as70 feet. Blair says the shadow cast by this depression seems to indicate four90-degree angles and resembles the profile of an eroded pit structure.”80[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber79] Based on this evidence, Blair suggested theseobjects might indeed be artificial in origin81[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber80]—but the whole thing was kept very quiet on anyofficial level, just as our other NASA insiders reported in the previouschapter. After these exciting news articles came out, no one ever heard about itagain.The official NASA photo of this area has had the black levels cranked way upafter its original release, making the shadows from the towers almost impossibleto see, since they blend in with the background. There is also a veryfrustrating line in the middle of the official image that did not appear in theoriginal photograph that was published widely at the time. This line cuts intothe largest tower and further confuses the eye. Nonetheless, in the darkenedimage we can easily see not one but two rectangular depressions, positioned atninety-degree angles to each other. These depressions are almost exactly thesame size and shape, suggesting two different underground rooms that were builtbased on a common design.[../image/09_AscensionMysteries.jpg]“Official” NASA Lunar Orbiter 2 Image of Lunar Obelisks, Showing RectangularPitsDR. MARK CARLOTTO DISCOVERS MULTIPLE RECTANGULAR AREASIn 2002, Dr. Mark J. Carlotto used a digital elevation model to conclude thatthe tallest spire was about fifty feet in height—far higher than anything wewould expect to appear naturally on the Moon. Dr. Carlotto has thirty years’experience in satellite remote sensing and digital image processing.82[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber81] Carlotto also created synthetic stereo imagesto get a three-dimensional view of the terrain: “Of particular interest is alarge rectilinear depression adjacent to the objects. This depression appears tobe the deepest part of a larger network of rectilinear collapses of thesurface.”83 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber82] In simple terms, this means therecould be a whole series of different rooms hiding below the surface of the Moonin this area. Over the course of thousands of years of meteorite strikes, therooftops have gradually been pounded in, revealing some of the hidden geometryunderneath.Carlotto’s analysis reveals that the two main rectangular depressions we see areboth about 100 to 150 meters in size, making them comfortably sized areas for abase that could house a small group of people. The tallest tower could be usedto help ships come and go, just as we have in our own airports. Carlotto’s imageprocessing techniques also pulled out an entire network of additional rooms thatare not as visible to the naked eye. He uses the word “lineaments” to describelines on the Moon’s surface that indicate the possibility of further undergroundrooms whose rooftops have fallen in since they were first built.Carlotto concludes: “In summary, the key features that suggest that theseobjects and their surrounding terrain may be artificial in origin are: thepresence of multiple objects, conical or pyramidal in shape, that do not appearto be typical rocks or outcroppings; perpendicular alignments between five ofthe seven objects; a network of rectangular collapses of the surface; horizontaland vertical lineaments (and) correlations in alignments between these objects,the orientation of the rectangular depression, and the direction oflineaments.”84 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber83]It is also intriguing to note that this area is only three hundred kilometersnorthwest of where Apollo 11 landed, which means the Apollo astronauts couldhave easily gotten a closer look at the towering objects as they flew in. Afifty-foot-tall obelisk would have been easy to spot while orbiting at a lowaltitude. The astronauts may also have been able to view it from the ground,such as with a telescope, and possibly could have used the rover to drive in fora slightly closer look—though it is unlikely they would have had enough power todrive three hundred kilometers, which would be a 186.4-mile trip each way. Therover’s maximum traveling speed was only eight miles per hour, and there weremany obstacles that prevented it from driving in straight-lined paths. HarrisonSchmitt was probably well aware of the Blair Cuspids when he designed his“Stonehenge” patches for NASA’s Apollo 17 mission. In order to become an Apolloastronaut, he would have had to go through classified briefings and be sworn tosecrecy about what he was told. These photographs, and an explanation of whatthey might be looking at, could easily have been part of Schmitt’s briefing.THE MYSTERIES OF FRAME 4822An even more impressive piece of evidence we have for Chatelain’s “mysteriousgeometric structures of unknown origin on the Moon” was discovered by Richard C.Hoagland. In 1995, Hoagland was going through the official catalog of Apollo 10photographs when he noticed that one frame, AS10-32-4822, was completely black.Most people would naturally assume this was caused by a camera malfunction, butHoagland wondered if something interesting was being hidden. He ordered the 4822frame from the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at Goddard SpaceCenter, and much to his surprise, the negative he received in the mail was notblacked out at all.[../image/10_AscensionMysteries.jpg]A Series of Geometric Structures on NSSDC Frame 4822. Far Right in Ken JohnstonVersion Cut Out of “Official” VersionThe first thing Hoagland noticed was a small square crater off to the left. Inthis case, it looked as if someone had cut a perfect square area out of a hill.Nature doesn’t make squares like this, and this area could have been built bypeople who wanted to have protective walls around their base, and then perhapshad used transparent aluminum for the rooftop. As Hoagland continued inspectingthis area, he realized there was another, slightly smaller square crater to thenortheast of the first one. Then, directly above these artificial-lookingcraters, he saw what may have been an entire row of squared-off buildings. Inthis case, it appeared that their rooftops had not collapsed in, but had becomecovered with Moon dust over many thousands of years. Each roof had the hint of afour-sided shape—as if they were originally given transparent-aluminum rooftopswith a wide, shallow pyramid structure.[../image/11_AscensionMysteries.jpg]NASA Image of the Ukert Crater, Showing Degraded but Symmetrical TriangularFormationThis series of structures appears directly next to the Ukert crater, which isalso highly bizarre in its own right. The inside of the crater has a blacktriangular shape that is remarkably symmetrical—very close to an equilateraltriangle. This could also be the result of artificial construction. The shape isno longer sharp and distinct, with the sides of the triangle being somewhatrounded, but this could be the result of prolonged erosion from meteorite hits.The triangular shape would make it easy for people piloting spacecraft toidentify their landing area, just as conventional pilots look for a runway.There may well be ancient corridors linking this “cosmic parking lot” to the rowof buildings that appear to have been constructed right next door.THE CASTLEThe most stunning formation in this same image was a short distance over on theright-hand side, near the Manilius crater. Hoagland dubbed it “the Castle,” andit is unbelievably impressive. If you were to show this picture to anyonewithout telling them where it was from, and ask them what it was, they would sayit was an aerial picture of a geometric building—perhaps a military base. We seea series of long buildings, parallel to one another, intersecting at perfectninety-degree angles and forming an overall triangular shape from the overheadview.4822 IS QUITE POPULAR[../image/12_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Close-up of Apollo 10 Frame AS10-32-4822Hoagland publicized this image in a small, private newsletter. One of hisreaders, amateur astronomer Alex Cook, subsequently ordered his own negative offrame 4822 from NSSDC, and developed it in his college photo lab. Surprisingly,he received a different photographic angle of the same area than what Hoaglandhad gotten. This image was taken perhaps a second or two after the first. Cookcontinued ordering copies of 4822, and to his shock, ultimately ten differentcamera angles of this same area were sent to him—all filed under 4822. Hoaglandconcluded that the number 4822 was used as a code so that insiders could easilyorder copies of these images, but most people would never think to go lookingfor them. If a normal civilian asked for a copy of frame 4822, the archivistwould release only the blacked-out version. However, after twenty-plus years hadgone by, the current archivist apparently didn’t know or remember the protocol,and just quickly grabbed whatever came up first as 4822 in the master file.Hoagland realized that Apollo 10 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Thomas P. Staffordwere probably ordered to take multiple seventy-millimeter Hasselblad film imagesof this area as they went by with their handheld camera. This is the same filmnow used for IMAX. By doing so, they could create a rudimentary animated movieof the base—complete with stereo images to bring out the three-dimensionaldepth. When Hoagland visited the NSSDC and asked to see the original of frame4822, he was told that they couldn’t find the negatives, as they had been“stolen.” Much more detail can be found in Richard Hoagland and Mike Bara’s NewYork Times bestselling book Dark Mission.85 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber84]KEN JOHNSTON FINDS ANOTHER 4822[../image/13_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Additional Detail from Apollo 10 Frame AS10-32-4822Hoagland’s work took another quantum leap forward with the introduction of KenJohnston. This was another development that took place just a few months after Ifirst got online. On March 21, 1996, Hoagland gave a long-anticipated pressconference in Washington, DC, at the National Press Club. A number of majormedia organizations were present, including C-SPAN, USA Today, the AssociatedPress, and the New York Times. Sadly, the audience was very hostile, and whenHoagland brought up information he had already revealed in the past, he wasshouted at and asked if there was anything new. What happened next was reportedby Michael Lindemann of CNI News.Hoagland made good on his promise to bring in several other credible spokesmento discuss the evidence for moon anomalies. Chief among these was former NASAand Boeing aerospace engineer Ken Johnston, who worked with NASA executive Dr.Thornton Page during the years of the Apollo moon missions. Johnston said thathe had seen photo evidence, including some 16mm movie footage, that convincedhim there was something anomalous on the moon. He said that he and Thornton Pagewere the first people to view 16mm film from the Apollo 14 mission that showed 5or 6 lights in a crater on the dark side of the moon, as well as a strange plumeof smoke. Johnston said he showed the movie footage to other NASA personnel thenext day, but when he got to the point where he had seen the lights in thecrater, those frames seemed to be missing. Johnston asked Page about the missingfootage, and Page said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Johnston isconvinced the footage was taken out and either hidden or destroyed.86[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber85]Johnston was ordered to destroy many original copies of Apollo Moon images, buthe saved a full set of them in Oklahoma City, within a university libraryarchive. We are all very fortunate that Johnston did not destroy all theoriginals in the archive. NASA did not want any of these images getting out tothe public—at least not unless they had been doctored. The most stunningdiscovery out of Johnston’s original imagery was found on the Apollo 10photograph AS10-32-4822. This was yet another photograph hidden away under the“4822” code number. NASA is supposed to give each photograph a different number,but this was not the case with 4822. In a photograph shown at the press club, wesee an image on the left that is from the official NASA archive at Goddard SpaceFlight Center. The image on the right is from Ken Johnston’s own original thatcame from the Johnson Space Center. The difference is remarkable. Ken Johnston’soriginal clearly shows a bright white dome, shaped like the tip of a bullet,sitting on a hilltop. The dome is perfectly symmetrical, and is so bright thatit appears as if light is reflecting off it.87 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber86]The official image has had all traces of the dome conveniently removed.RUSSIAN MEDIA PUBLICITY EXPLOSION[../image/14_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Enterprise Mission Comparison of Goddard (L) and Houston (R) “4822” Images,Showing Reflective DomeIn 2007, I coauthored a two-part paper with Hoagland that features a wealth ofNASA photographs of the Moon with strikingly artificial-looking objects in them.The article was written to celebrate the fact that the Russian media gaveHoagland’s latest press conference a significant amount of favorable coverage. Avariety of color images are included in the article that do not translate wellto a black-and-white printed book, so I encourage you to go take a look at it onHoagland’s website, EnterpriseMission.com.88 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber87]Hoagland was able to compare two different NASA images of the samearea—AS14-66-9301, in which astronaut Edgar Mitchell is pictured, andAS14-66-9279, which is taken of the same area but is just a few feet over to theright. In the second image, the leg of the lunar lander is visible and Mitchellis no longer in the shot. Hoagland was also able to find an original version ofAS14-66-9301 in Ken Johnston’s archive, and it had much clearer detail than whatwe see in the official version.Taken together, these images reveal a stunning array of glass-like ruins rightbehind where astronaut Mitchell was standing. Since this material is almostcompletely transparent, it was nearly invisible in the photo, but with somesimple Photoshop adjustments, remarkable details emerge. There appears to be astructure made of three primary pillars in the middle of the image. It alsoappears that a series of glass-like reflections are occurring inside. I wasgreatly surprised when these images came out and was happy to lend my efforts toHoagland’s campaign. The Russians did their own digging and found three newexamples of photos that had obvious signs of tampering.[../image/15_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Enterprise Mission Comparison of Versions of AS14-66-9301 and AS14-66-9279,Showing a Matrix of Glass-like RuinsThe most stunning image discovered by the Russians was GPN -2000-001137. In ourarticle, we posted a direct link to the original on the Great Images in NASA, orGRIN, website, which is an official NASA resource. When you download the image,all you appear to see is a NASA astronaut posing next to an American flag, witha jet-black background behind him. A pale image of the Earth is visible in thebackground, adding a dramatic flair. The image is still accessible on NASA’swebsite at the time of this writing.89 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber88] By doinga simple enhancement of the image in Photoshop, the Russians were clearly ableto demonstrate that the area around the Apollo astronaut had been deliberatelyairbrushed black. This is almost completely invisible to the naked eye and isonly detectable with advanced image-processing software.[../image/16_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Airbrushing around Apollo 17 Astronaut Harrison SchmittThe strangest thing about the airbrushing is how geometric it is. It begins atthe top left, above the astronaut’s head, with a horizontal line. It then dropsstraight down, forming a square. Then a triangular area is airbrushed outimmediately next to it, with the bottom of the triangle touching the top of theastronaut’s head. Another area projects out from the front of the astronaut’shelmet. Skeptics may argue that this was a simple fix to eliminate glare comingoff the astronaut’s suit, and that may be possible, but it may also be hiding alarge object. The next image found by the Russians, 2000-001131, reveals obviouslines where material has been cut out of additional copies of the samephotograph with a razor blade and then glued on top of the original. This againsuggests there was something very large behind the astronaut in the image thatthey were covering over, just as Donna Hare had indicated. Since the lines inthis shot are too fine to translate to print, I again invite you to visit“Russian Media Publicity Explosion” online and see it for yourself.90[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber89]THE “SOLAR PANEL”Now we will return to our original frame 4822, in which we see squared-off areasnext to the Ukert crater on the left, and the stunningly geometric “city” on theright. Our “Russian Media” paper included another peculiar image from this sameshot, which looks, to me, like a giant solar panel.91[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber90] Whatever it is, it clearly appears to betechnological and is by no means a natural formation. This may have been used togenerate energy or radio communications for the nearby bases.[../image/17_AscensionMysteries.jpg]The “Solar Panel” from NASA’s “Missing” Frame 4822THE STUNNING RUSSIAN IMAGES FROM ZOND 3For me, the single most impressive images of all are also some of the oldest.The Russians were the first to officially launch a probe into space withSputnik, on October 4, 1957. Two years later in 1959, they launched Luna 3,which reached the Moon on October 7 and broadcast until the twenty-second, atwhich time contact was lost. Seventeen low-quality images were produced, givinghumanity our first view of the dark side of the Moon. The Russians followed upwith Zond 3, which was originally intended to be able to orbit Mars. Zond 3 waslaunched on July 18, 1965, and made it to the Moon thirty-three hours later. TheRussians focused their initial efforts on capturing the final 30 percent of thedark side of the Moon that Luna 3 had missed. The camera was programmed to takeone picture every two minutes and fourteen seconds, for a combined total oftwenty-eight images in one hour and eight minutes.[../image/18_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Gigantic Tower on the Dark Side of the Moon in Russian Zond 3 ImageThe investigative website Ancient Code reveals what happened next: “In one ofthe images of the far side of the moon, a mysterious tower-shaped structure canclearly be seen protruding from the lunar surface. In its vicinity, no othersimilar structures are seen, and Ufologists believe that the mysterious ‘tower’seen in the Zond 3 image is a crucial piece of evidence supporting their theorythat there are alien structures on the far side of Earth’s moon. The image ofthe Tower on the moon was obtained on 20 July 1965. . . . At the time, the probewas about 10,000 kilometers above the Moon.”92 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber91][../image/19_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Gigantic “Glass” Dome on the Dark Side of the Moon in Russian Zond 3 Image(bottom right)There is a stunningly obvious, symmetrical, bright white tower rising up fromthe surface of the Moon in the image, which was taken early in Zond 3’ssequence. The tower is perfectly perpendicular to the Moon’s surface, suggestingit is a genuine structure and not a photographic defect. Based on the size andcurvature of the Moon’s surface, Hoagland has estimated this tower to be astaggering twenty miles in height. The bright white glow again suggests atransparent-aluminum structure that is capturing and reflecting the sunlight.This does not appear to be the result of a “camera malfunction,” a “stain on thelens,” a “photographic defect,” or “noise,” as skeptics have attempted to claim.What most people fail to realize is that just a few minutes later, Zond 3captured another equally stunning image from the same area. The Moon had nowrotated enough that the tower was no longer on the horizon and thus is notvisible. We can easily see the same craters that were in the previous photo, andwe can also see a massive dome on the horizon that is farther south, capturingthe sunlight. There are two clearly geometric lines of glass-like material thatboth rise from the lunar surface at the same steep slope before leveling off toa flat top. The ceiling of the dome is parallel to the Moon’s surface, as wewould expect if it were a genuine artificial construct and not just a cameraglitch. When you have two geometric sides with the same slope angle and height,and which connect to a flat top parallel to the surface, you have the structureof a flat-topped pyramid, or mastaba. Since this structure appears to be madeout of transparent aluminum, we can see through it when the sunlight is catchingit at this angle. There is also a thicker area in the exact middle of the dome,suggesting the presence of two additional geometric edges, thus making it a truefour-sided pyramid-type object, just like a mastaba. Again, the size of thispyramid-like dome must be absolutely colossal—perhaps twenty miles in height.Skeptics have tried to say that it is merely the result of inferior Russiantechnology not being able to stitch the space probe’s images together properly,but this seems highly unlikely when we consider the overall weight of evidence.Both of these mysterious images appeared quite close to each other, just a fewframes apart, on a side of the Moon that normally never faces the Earth. Ifthere are extraterrestrial or classified human bases there, they could bebuilding far more elaborate structures on the dark side of the Moon and no onewould see them. Indeed, one of my top insiders, Pete Peterson, has been told byRussian intelligence that the back side of the Moon now looks like Manhattan atnight from a satellite view. There are stationary and moving lights all over,and it is literally teeming with activity. This again may seem impossible tobelieve. If this information does become widely known, all of us will have quitethe “learning curve” and psycho-emotional adjustment to go through in order tointegrate this new information into what we thought we knew.[../image/20_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Close-up of Gigantic “Glass” Dome on the Dark Side of the Moon in Russian Zond 3ImageWith a transparent-aluminum dome like this, people could live on the surface ofthe Moon, breathe a normal atmosphere, see the Sun, grow plants, and have a nicecivilization inside. They could have buildings, roads, and even rivers and lakesby melting the abundance of water ice that can be found. Plants and animalscould be selectively taken from a planet like Earth and brought in. Theflat-topped pyramid shape would enhance the health of everyone inside, as I haveargued in The Source Field Investigations. We will review some of that data aswe go on. A pyramid-shaped roof of such colossal size would also be visuallystunning for the people living inside, giving it a sense of spiritualsignificance. Others may wish to live under the surface for greater protectionfrom attacks, a more climate-controlled environment, or perhaps because theydidn’t have enough money or status to be able to live in the lush, outdoorsyatmosphere created in the domes.THEY HAD TO COME FROM SOMEWHEREAlthough this is fascinating data, we still haven’t answered the question of howthese people ended up trying to survive on the surface of the Moon in the firstplace. Why would they try to grow plants and live their lives under glass domeson such an inhospitable sphere? This is not a place where a civilization wouldnaturally evolve. This is a group that clearly would have migrated there fromsomewhere else and used advanced technology in order to make it livable. Werethey at war with a group that considered a healthier, happier place like theEarth to be their own exclusive, protected territory? Where did these lunarcolonists come from originally? This question ultimately forces us toreconstruct the history of our solar system—which begins with something theinsiders call the “Ancient Builder Race.” In order to set up the story of theAncient Builder Race, it is first necessary to reveal the big picture of whatthe highest-level insiders shared with me. Only then will the full scope of thestory be something we can appreciate."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENTHE “BIG PICTURE” IS EXTREMELY COSMICAncient ruins, far older than any civilization we know of on Earth, alreadyexist on the Moon. Skeptics may try to knock down individual images orwhistle-blowers, but the combined strength of high-level insider testimony andverifiable NASA data is very compelling. Someone had to have built thesestructures. Everything we thought we knew has to be completely rewritten if anyof this is true. There are so many unknowns that the mind becomes exhausted andthrows away the information, since it is too stressful to try to take it all in.I attended multiple Hoagland conferences, as a guest and as a speaker, andinvariably people would ask him to explain who built these monuments and wherethey are now. Hoagland did not know. He said it was still a mystery. Thisgreatly frustrated the audiences. It wasn’t until 2014 that Bruce startedtelling me more of what he knew from his own level of the UFO cover-up.I originally intended this book to disclose Bruce’s information, and I am stillgoing to give you all the most significant details. Once I began talking toother insiders about this data, including Corey Goode, however, I learned evenmore. The big picture that will start to unfold in this chapter is so cosmicthat it is hard to even imagine. It took me a great deal of time and effort, andtremendous personal risk, to gather and release this information. Each of thedata points I am about to share with you have been cross-validated with multipleinsiders, some of whom we will meet as we go along.The best way to approach such a huge story, at first, is just to keep an openmind to the possibilities instead of trying to fight every little detail withrigid skepticism. I have noticed that when radio show hosts try to rigorouslyargue with me on the minor details, I never have the time to actually share thestory so that listeners can make up their own minds. All of us have beentraumatized by countless decades of being lied to. It is all too easy to get a“morphine response” by attacking whistle-blowers and attempting to tear themapart. Yet, this addiction may be holding us back from the greatest quantum leapin human history.SEEING IT IN PERSON IS BELIEVINGDenial can cloud our minds when we look at pictures like the ones we saw in theprevious chapter, even if they are extremely high-quality images. We may decidethat they are “inconclusive,” “tricks of light and shadow,” or even“pareidolia,” a fancy word that indicates how the mind looks for patterns inchaos. The paid skeptics love to invoke pareidolia for every single anomalouspicture of off-planet artifacts, no matter how high quality it is. It makes themsound superior and intelligent, as if the scientific priesthood has struck downthe heretics who are seeing “Jesus on a potato chip.” However, if NASA and othergroups had classified Roswell-type craft and could go and visit these sites inperson, they obviously got a much closer look. Standing in front of a massivecrystal tower and putting your hands on it would erase all doubt. Then you couldbegin conducting a very sober assessment of who built these artifacts, when theybuilt them, how they built them, why they built them, and where they went.Multiple insiders have revealed that these groups have direct access toextraterrestrials who can provide the details. Not all of theseextraterrestrials can be trusted, but certain themes are very consistent.There is compelling evidence that the Apollo missions were intentionally landingnear these interesting sites as well. According to Bruce, Daniel, Jacob, andother insiders whom we will meet in this chapter, the astronauts who actuallytouched the ruins with their own hands and walked inside them were not on anyApollo missions, and those other missions have never been made public. This wasalluded to in 2001, because no public mention was made of the monolith theastronauts had found on the Moon. Though the insiders felt they could notofficially tell us the truth, they wanted us to share in the excitement throughfantasy. Nonetheless, I feel it is a great tragedy that this marvelouslyexciting adventure has been kept so thoroughly classified. Groups like theNational Security Agency are hiring agents to ruin the lives of anyone who triesto tell us the truth.I was quite stunned when Colonel Philip Corso came forward in 1997 with hisclassic book The Day After Roswell. Corso was handed boxes of parts from crashedextraterrestrial craft, including from Roswell, and was assigned to hand offvarious components to different defense contractors. They were told it was“foreign technology” and asked to reverse-engineer it. The technologies heclaimed to have developed through this method were almost exactly the same onesthe physics professor had revealed to Ian four years earlier. This included aseries of small round wafers that turned out to be computer chips. I wasabsolutely stunned to get such a remarkably precise validation of what I hadheard, in the form of a mainstream, published book. It greatly ignited my questto find more insiders and learn as much as possible from them.DANIEL: THE FIRST MAJOR INSIDERAfter meeting a majority of the witnesses at the Disclosure Project in 2001, thefirst highly connected insider I met, in December 2002, was a man wanting me tocall him Daniel, after the character in Stargate SG-1. Daniel won a science fairin high school by designing a computer with its own operating system in the1970s, well before this was a common practice. He was recruited by thegovernment, who paid for his college providing he agreed to work for militaryintelligence. I suddenly remembered being invited to a science fair called “TheImagination Celebration” when I was in seventh grade. It was held inside a largehangar at a military base in Schenectady, New York, and was run by a majordefense contractor. I competed with hundreds of other kids to see who couldinvent something that solved a physics problem, using simple ingredients likerubber bands and wooden tongue depressors. Daniel confirmed that if I had wonthat contest, I might have been “mentored” and pulled into the intelligencecommunity after I had graduated, just as he was.He claimed to have worked on a project code-named Phoenix III from 1981 to 1983.Most people know it as the Montauk Project, as it took place at a military baseon Montauk Point, Long Island. Daniel revealed that Preston Nichols and PeterMoon’s 1992 book The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time was fairly accurate,but that subsequent books were increasingly filled with disinformation. I hadalready read the first book by the time I met him and thought it was nonsense. Iactually laughed in his face when he told me he had worked at Montauk. However,he had vastly detailed information that went far beyond the scope of what hadbeen published. This was very humbling and mind-expanding, as his data wasextremely consistent. Daniel held up under every effort I made to deconstructand debunk his information.In this program, a seat from a crashed and recovered ET craft was hooked up to amassive power supply at Montauk. It turned out that the seat amplified theconsciousness of the person sitting in it, providing they had the ability tofully quiet their mind in meditation. A series of twenty-two sine-wave graphsshowed the activity of the person’s mind. Once the person quieted their mind,the graphs would remain still. Then the technicians would zero out the graphs,turning knobs to make them all flat lines. This tuned the chair to theindividual, and that was when the magic would start to happen.A properly tuned chair allowed the operator’s thoughts to create physicalmanifestations. Any object the operator thought of, such as a wooden chair,could be made to physically materialize in the room. The objects would remainsolid for a period of time before gradually fading away. The operator could alsotelepathically influence the minds of others, even on a mass scale. At one pointthey influenced a massive number of animals to rush into the center of town in afrenzy. This technology appears to have been leaked into fiction in the X-Menmovie series. A chair called “Cerebro” appears in a large, spherical room, andvastly enhances the psychic abilities of whoever is using it. Most of the X-Menmovies feature this chair as a prominent part of the storyline.LAYERED TIMEEven more strangely, the chair operator could think about a particular place inspace and time, and a portal would open up that would allow travel to thatlocation. In a UFO, the pilot merely thinks about where he or she wants to goand a portal opens up to take them there. The insiders involved in the PhoenixIII project began sending people through these portals, and many lives were lostbefore they figured out how to ensure their safe return. Portals would alsoappear at random throughout the base, including in the cafeteria, while theywere working on stabilizing the system. Daniel reported seeing shimmering areas,each like a desert mirage. Inside the middle of these areas, he would seeseparate locations. He might be looking at a solid wall in the cafeteria andthen see a shimmering portal into a grassy, green field that was nowhere nearthe area he was working in. If he were to walk into the portal he would end upin the field.They soon realized that these portals could take people through time as well asspace. This led to all sorts of research with unanticipated consequences. Oneman was crazy enough to go back in time and kill his father, whom he trulydespised. Everyone was shocked when he returned from this trip, havingsuccessfully murdered his father, and he was still alive. However, about twodays later the man was struck by a car as a pedestrian and killed instantly.Several repetitions of similar types of experiments caused the military defensecontractors working in these classified programs to create a theory of “layeredtime.” They concluded that if you go back into the past and change an event, youcreate a new time line, or a new layer, that sits on top of the layer that isalready there. Both layers can coexist. The layer that our future snaps into isthe layer that has more energy associated with it. If a new layer is createdthat creates too many paradoxes in our existing “main” time line, natural eventswill occur that heal those problems. The layers always find a way of merging.This caused the insiders to conclude that time itself is alive and conscious,and has its own healing mechanisms. Once the man had killed his father, hisdeath helped to merge the layers and solve the paradox.Daniel also said they had something called a time vector generator, or TVG, withwhich they would pump massive amounts of energy into the area of an alternatetime line in the hope of making it stronger than the existing one. The energythey were sending into the time line is what the Russian scientists call“torsion fields,” and the basic science behind these fields is extensivelydescribed in The Source Field Investigations. The vintage show The Time Tunnelwas loaded with genuine disclosure about these experiments, and the show’ssignature tunnel with alternating rings of black and white looked very similarto a genuine TVG. Multiple experiments with TVG units proved that theseclassified programs did not have as much control over time as they had hoped tohave. Time was extremely elastic, meaning that whatever time line we werealready on would tend to remain consistent. New layers would usually be canceledout through balancing events, and would never interfere with our own time linethat much.THE ENERGETIC WALL OF ASCENSION IN OUR FUTUREThe ET chair produced a series of more than four hundred different waves througha huge set of fiber-optic cables. Each wave was graphed and analyzed separately.Daniel’s main job was to analyze these graphs and determine how to generate thewaves electronically, thus eliminating the need for a human operator—but theseefforts only met with limited success. One of the waves allowed them to pinpointexactly where someone was in time. It was a regularly curving sine wave thatcounted out twenty-year intervals between each peak. Any time they sent someonethrough the portal, the person would experience a dazzling “wormhole ride” likewe have seen in various science-fiction movies.When they sent people into our future, they would hit a bizarre energeticbarrier at a certain point. This was called the “Full Out,” because suddenlytheir consciousness would become greatly expanded and depersonalized. They wouldfeel as if they had merged with the galaxy and had access to omniscientintelligence. Time seemed to melt into infinity. Anything people saw after thispoint appeared to be completely subjective, based on their own expectations aswell as those of the person in the chair. Different people could view the sametime and get different results. The moment this energetic “wall” would collidewith our solar system was calculated to be sometime in December 2012. Theinsiders were well aware that this corresponded precisely with the end-date ofthe Mayan calendar, and this was a huge source of fascination to them.It does appear that this energetic wave is a physical cloud our solar system ismoving into. Once we hit the full power of this wave, Daniel’s own sources hadconcluded the Sun would release an energetic flash that activates a massspiritual evolution in humanity. They used time-viewing devices we will discussin a second to go and view this event, but once they got there all they couldsee was white light. Since the time this research was done in 1981–83, the“wall” has moved into our future. It appears that we were not ready for this tohappen as a planet yet, and the event will be held off until a critical mass ofpeople are ready for it. Much of this has to do with healing our trauma andbecoming more loving, forgiving people—just as the great religions have taughtus. Since this is a dynamic, evolving process, any effort to produce a specificdate is mere guesswork.THE STARGATE NETWORKDaniel also fascinated me by revealing that the television show Stargate SG-1was chock-full of truthful information he had encountered at his job. There isindeed an ancient stargate network that allows travel from place to placethrough the “cosmic web,” as it has been called. A series of plasma filamentsconnects each star to its neighbors, and these filaments also serve astraversable wormholes. Proof of these filaments was deliberately presented inThe Source Field Investigations after I had heard all this.A very ancient and highly advanced extraterrestrial race that Daniel called “theElders” had apparently built this stargate network. Other groups continuallymaintained it. I was told that each planet with intelligent life is given itsown stargate. The network is intended to allow for peaceful exploration andcommunication with a wide variety of worlds, which is a natural part of theascension process. You cannot bring any inorganic materials through, such asweapons. Travelers would have to wear drawstring pants, as even elasticwaistbands would deconstruct. This caused great humor in the early trials, astravelers would arrive at their destination and have their pants fall down.Bruce said this organic bias was disclosed in The Terminator, in which thepeople sent back through a portal to our time had to come in naked. Obviously,no android would be able to travel through a stargate, because only organicmaterials can make it through the portal. Your dental fillings would receive abio imprint after being in your body for a period of time, and would still makeit through the portal on the other side. Some soldiers tried sleeping with theirguns and carrying them at all times, hoping to create a bio imprint, but thisnever worked.There can be more than one gate on a given planet, but only one of these gateswill actually take you to other worlds. The other gates can be used to transportyou from one local area to another. In the case of Earth, our main gate wasapparently dug out of the desert in Egypt in 1927, exactly as documented in theStargate SG-1 television show. The government people who found it were soconcerned about invaders coming through the gate that they buried it in the icein Antarctica, where it apparently still resides to this day. That way anyonetrying to come through the gate will be instantly frozen to death. The gate hasan intelligent alarm system that would warn you if you were about to go into anenvironment that would kill you. This alarm can be ignored, but to travel insuch an event is to die.Daniel also said that our classified programs were able to mathematicallyanalyze the gate network. Each inhabited world has a particular gate address,which is a series of seven groups of digits. You can travel very far distances,including to areas well outside our galaxy, through the use of these addresses.Carl Sagan was aware of the ancient stargate network and disclosed it in thebook and movie Contact. The main screenwriter of that film, Jim Hart, was soimpressed when he saw my 2012 “Enigma” video on YouTube that he contacted me towork on a film I was developing, entitled Convergence. He had no idea that CarlSagan was working from actual classified information when he wrote the Contactstory. Convergence has been through many rewrites and our latest draft isnearing completion as I finish this book.The first three digits of any stargate address are single numbers between 1 and9. The next three sets of digits are between 1 and 99. The final set of digitswill be between 1 and 999. Almost any number you dial, except perhaps for thehighest numbers in the final three-digit set, will take you to an inhabitedworld. If you are traveling locally, a three-digit number will suffice. Thelocal gate address for Mars is 605, and Earth is 606, so keep that in mind ifyou ever get lost. Some of the higher three-digit numbers do not have planetsassigned to them in our local area. Once the people on a given planet ascend,their number is reassigned to new planets. Now that enough time has passed andno other insiders have come forward with this information, I will finally revealour entire gate address after all these years, according to Daniel’s testimony.It is 7.5.3.84.70.24.606.Our local gate address of 1 is an inhabited asteroid that orbits a pulsar. Thisunique energetic configuration has made it very stable over long periods oftime. The people who live there have visited Earth for thousands of years, andintroduced themselves to the Vikings as the Aesir or Asgard. The term Asgard waslater misinterpreted by early 1950s telepathic channelers as “Ashtar,” and theAesir became known as the “Ashtar Command.” The Aesirian “god” Thor had adevastating “hammer” that was actually a particle-beam weapon, and the mysticalland of Valhalla was actually the Aesir homeworld. With the testimony of CoreyGoode now in place, the Asgard may actually be an ancient advanced civilizationliving inside the Earth. Several of these inner-Earth human groups have tried topass themselves off as extraterrestrials in order to protect themselves againstaggression from the military-industrial complex. They may live and work in bothareas.Daniel also said that the extensive analysis of this ancient stargate system ledto the development of the IP address system that is now used for the Internet.Each computer or device that accesses the Internet has its own IP address. Thisis a series of four three-digit numbers. The Defense Advanced Research ProjectsAgency (DARPA) developed this protocol as a direct result of their extensiveinvestigation of the mathematics of the stargate network.A trip through the ancient network involves a vigorous cosmic “wormhole ride,”which is exceptionally traumatic for people from our planet to experience. We donot yet have enough spiritual development and stability to handle the trip. Mostpeople become extremely unwell after doing it, and their mental health is unableto recover from the shock. This was termed “transdimensional disorder.”Apparently the wormhole experience created by the Montauk chair was easier tohandle than the ancient stargate network, but that too could still createproblems for people.THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASSBy the time I met Daniel, I had already read about a technology called ProjectLooking Glass from three other sources. Looking Glass was allegedly a complexdevice that allowed the user to peer through time. Daniel confirmed theexistence of Looking Glass and said that a sphere of white light appears in thearea you are viewing. It may or may not be visible, depending on a variety offactors including the consciousness of the people in the area. Daniel said thissphere of light was called an OBIT, or Outer Band Individuated Teletracer. Hesaid the outer band was a part of Earth’s hidden energetic field that theinsiders had identified. Suddenly I had an idea. “Let’s look it up online rightnow!” We ran over to his laptop and typed the full term into a search engine.Both of us were quite astonished to discover that an episode of the televisionshow The Outer Limits had this same title. It aired on November 4, 1963. TheInternet Movie Database has a description of this show that reads, in part, “TheOuter Band Individuated Teletracer, or O.B.I.T., is a remarkable technology thatcan track and monitor any individual, anywhere, for any length of time!”93[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber92] Daniel revealed that a great deal ofinformation was being released through fiction. That way, if anyone ever triedto come forward, they could simply be accused of borrowing ideas from a movie,book, or television program.I interviewed Daniel extensively, over many hours. I was constantly looking forholes in his testimony and could find none. Any time I asked him for furtherdetails on a specific area, I often got far more information than I hadexpected. Daniel eventually published his own website in 2011, featuringadditional details, including some highly technical information.94[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber93] This early experience taught me how to sort outthe real insiders from the fake ones. A few people did try to pull a hoax on me,but once I drilled in deeply with questions, they couldn’t invent new storiesfast enough. I would soon pick them apart through cross-examination and thenbreak off contact. I deliberately withheld enough information from the public soI could evaluate new insiders. I would also put new insiders in contact withother established insiders to “vet them out.” The real insiders would invariablyvalidate many data points I had never put online, and had never seen anywhere inthe public domain.HENRY DEACONAfter the stunningly bizarre disclosures from Daniel, five long years went bywhere no new insiders came forward, other than people who had information thatwas more widely available. Soon after YouTube allowed streaming videos to beuploaded to the Internet free of charge, Kerry Cassidy and Bill Ryan createdProject Camelot. They interviewed a variety of intriguing whistle-blowers andreleased the videos at no cost. In some cases the videos gathered millions ofviews, matching or exceeding the performance of all but the most populartelevision shows.Certain insiders refused to go on camera or even audio with their testimonies.The most fascinating whistle-blower in this category was a man going by thepseudonym Henry Deacon. I ultimately played a key role in his coming forward fora brief period of time, only to have him disappear again afterward. In the earlyyears, our only means of hearing what Henry said was from Bill and Kerry’swritten notes. Henry claimed to have worked in what some UFO researchers havecalled a “breakaway civilization,” where our own military-industrial complex hadsecretly colonized space. Various ancient bases, such as the ones we just saw onthe Moon in the last chapter, were pressurized and reoccupied, and others werebuilt from scratch. Local materials could be used to make a pourable concretethat would be molded with plastic bags to form the foundations for buildings.I contacted Project Camelot and shared everything I knew from Daniel in exchangefor gaining Henry Deacon’s contact information. Henry Deacon became the firsthigh-level insider who gave me extensive details about working in classifiedspacecraft and off-planet bases. He told me he was astonished at how many of theinteriors of spacecraft in the movie 2001 looked similar to areas he hadpersonally worked in—if not nearly identical in some cases. He also claimed tohave worked in a base on Mars, saying that ancient ruins not unlike those on theMoon had been discovered there and reoccupied. This was a startling validationof something Daniel had told me, in which he claimed to have been shown aclassified photo of an astronaut standing and waving next to a pyramid on Mars.The pyramid was so large you could see only a sharp-edged sloping wall that wentup from the ground at an angle in the photo. Henry confirmed that there wereancient pyramids on Mars, as did Corey Goode, who gave me a vivid description offlying over them. Henry claimed that he worked at a Mars base with 200,000personnel, and only 10,000 of them were from Earth. In the cafeteria there was abig picture window that looked out on a stunning view of red rocks similar tothe Grand Canyon. He said that the base was going through a massive expansionduring the time he was there.THE CORRIDORThe way Henry traveled to work was extremely interesting. He claimed to haveused something called “the Corridor,” which was a stargate-type device. He wouldshow up for work at a military base and go through a series of checkpoints. Thefinal barrier featured two soldiers at a desk in front of a long, cylindricalhallway. In addition to showing proper ID, he had to have an extended, normalconversation with the soldiers to prove his identity. He would then walk downthe Corridor and go into an elevator at the end that had an oversize door. Theinterior of the elevator had a brushed-metal appearance. He would then take anordinary-looking metal key and insert it into a small panel with a lock that wasmounted on the wall of the elevator. The door would close at a painfully slowspeed, taking as long as thirty seconds. The door would then immediately openagain and he would be on Mars—or wherever else his badge told the elevator tosend him. The trip was completely painless and almost unnoticeable. There was nowormhole, no sensation of movement—just an instant transfer.Ordinary soldiers were on the base and did not know what the elevator could do.There was a stairwell to the left of the elevator that went up to the secondfloor, and the elevator did function in the normal sense if you hit the button.Most soldiers believed it was simply used to transfer heavy equipment and wereunaware of its greater function. When I asked Henry why they used suchsimple-looking things as an ordinary elevator and a traditional metal key, hesaid it was designed to “reduce psychological impact.” By keeping everythingordinary-looking, people would just do their jobs in a businesslike fashion.He was required to take a medication called Lorentzil in order to stabilize hishealth from the effects of transdimensional disorder. This is listed in an 1896medical dictionary as Loxopterygium Lorentzil, which is the technical name forthe red quebracho, a tree that grows in Mexico and South America.95[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber94] The bark of the tree contains an alkaloidcompound known as Loxopterygine, which is listed as being an “anti-periodic,”96[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber95] meaning it helps prevent periodic returns ofillness and disease. This therefore appears to have been a South Americanmedicine used by shamans, who developed the ability to do conscious astralprojection. Multiple insiders have said that you can also get transdimensionaldisorder from spending too much time in out-of-body experiences. Henry hadhealth problems as a result of leaving his job quite suddenly and losing accessto this medication.Henry called this a “modern” stargate system. He did also confirm the existenceof an ancient stargate network, though he was unaware of the gate addressnumbers. At one time he visited a highly guarded area in Iraq that had a largestone ring just like what we see in the Stargate movie and television series.Obelisks stood on either side of the ring. Apparently this ancient gate wasstill used for certain purposes, and was kept under extremely high security.Henry also confirmed that working stargates have been on Earth for at least thelast ten thousand years, and possibly significantly longer. A variety of ETshave been coming and going from Earth using these portal systems all along. Healso confirmed that they have to follow a “Prime Directive” to concealthemselves from us until we have reached a point where we are ready to see themas a collective.THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THEREHenry claimed to have personally seen approximately forty-three different typesof extraterrestrial species. All of them were humanlike in appearance. Theywould vary in size from only a foot tall to over twelve feet in height. Theywould have different features, including a full variety of pastel skin colors.Some had larger heads and larger eyes. Different groups required differentgravitational fields, and they would be assigned to certain areas in the Marsbase where the floor had panels that generated the appropriate amount of gravityto satisfy their needs. When I asked him what it was like to interact directlywith these beings, he said the feeling was usually one of extreme spiritualbliss. You would often experience mind-to-mind communication and feel anexceptional sense of happiness and light.Henry always referred to them as people, not aliens. Some had jet-black skin.Others had skin with pastel colors that could be yellow, pink, red, orange,blue, or purple. Some had skin that was pure white. Others had varying depths ofgray. One group that he said was from Alpha Centauri had dark green skin, andthey photosynthesized light. He only ever met women from this group, and saidthey had black hair and Greek features. A neighboring planet in the same systemwas largely a desert, and had people with reddish skin who looked much like theMayans. These two civilizations had warred in the past and the relations betweenthem were still quite frosty. The tallest group of ETs he saw were in thetwelve-foot range, and were treated with fearful respect. They wore colorful andelaborate leather battle armor, such as bright red and black outfits with lotsof ornate features, and masks. You were not allowed to look at them when theycame into the room.I repeatedly tried to get Henry Deacon to tell me what he did at these jobs, butit was very difficult to get him to release information beyond a certain point.He did tell me that he was trained to repair certain types of advancedequipment. He would travel to various bases in our solar system and performmaintenance as required. He kept reaffirming that the work they were doing wasvery important for the survival of the human race, and that was part of why hedid not feel comfortable going into details.COMING FORWARDI released many specifics from Henry Deacon’s information, and the ProjectCamelot audience was stunned when he came forward at a conference on July 12,2009. A group of insiders were speaking in Zurich, Switzerland, and I was amongthem. Henry was brought in and traveled with me at the event. Our cover storywas that he was my “Uncle Mark.” It was quite a sensation when he took to thestage during NASA astronaut Dr. Brian O’Leary’s presentation and revealedhimself.97 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber96] Although he did not go into greatdetail about what he knew, he showed everyone his US passport. It was brown,unlike the normal navy-blue color, and said OFFICIAL PASSPORT. I surveyed it inprivate, along with a variety of other forms of proof of his military service,and confirmed that it was authentic.I spent more than eighty hours speaking to Deacon and would often laugh at howaloof he was about everything. He was given a huge stack of briefing documentswith nowhere near enough time to read them when he first started. Once he wastrained for his particular job responsibilities, it quickly became his ordinary,daily routine. He had been taught to think that speaking about any of hisexperiences would get him killed, so he would often avoid my questions and tellme that it wasn’t interesting enough for him to talk about. Yet, over the courseof many conversations, I managed to pull an incredible amount of data out ofhim. I never expected he would actually come forward. He later regretted everdoing it and refused to speak any further. He never profited from anything hehad done, nor was he looking for any public acclaim.Henry’s data included information about the “high-energy cloud” our solar systemwas moving into. He was aware that spacecraft had been sent out to view thecloud and study its energetic properties. He confirmed that it was expected totrigger a dramatic evolutionary event on Earth, including an epic solar energyrelease of some kind. Later insiders had testimony that lined up remarkably wellwith everything he had said.Henry was very pleased with my scientific research on interplanetary climatechange, as presented in The Source Field Investigations. I used official NASAsources to prove that the Sun, planets, and satellites in our system arebecoming brighter, hotter, and more magnetic at a remarkable speed. He was alsoaware that NASA was rigorously preventing anyone from officially connecting thedots as I had done. They were apparently afraid that religious zealots would usethe data to confirm their beliefs, and would then create widespread fear andpanic. However, Henry also believed their energetic buildup would create arelease that would have positive effects for humanity. The initial stages couldbe very disorienting and confusing, however, as we adjusted to the sudden,massive consciousness shift this change would cause."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENPETE PETERSON, THE TESLA OF BLACK OPSJust a couple of weeks before the Zurich conference in June 2009, Kerry Cassidysent me a recording of a phone call she’d had with a man named Pete Peterson. Atthe time of this writing in 2016, Pete is seventy-four years old. When I heardhow intelligent and well versed in classified information this man was, I saidwe needed to get to him right away. Otherwise he could be threatened or evenkilled, and we would lose our chance. I financed the airfare, car, and hotelrental to Pete’s location almost immediately. Bill flew in from Switzerland andwe all interviewed Pete for three straight days, with audio recorders runningthe entire time. On the final day we taped a three-part video interview that waslater released.98 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber97] Since that initial meeting in2009 I have continued speaking to Pete at least once a week on the average,usually for two hours per conversation. Although there is repetition, I am stillconstantly learning new things.Early along, Pete confirmed that the supersonic pitch of the television setcould indeed be changed to attract attention, just as I had observed. I foundout that at least eight different strategies were actively being used tosubliminally manipulate TV viewers. In the old days of VHF broadcast television,when the picture quality and reception were often fairly poor, a secondary imagemight be placed underneath the main one that was only 10 to 15 percent asbright. This could convey information directly to the subconscious. Images,words, and thoughts could also be planted through various other hidden means.“DO NOT QUESTION GOVERNMENT GOD”When I was a kid, if you stayed up late enough watching TV, you would see ashort video that played the National Anthem while showing images of flags wavingand various national landmarks. It always felt very creepy to watch this forsome inexplicable reason. Afterward the broadcast would suddenly die, creating alonely mess of moving black and white dots called “snow” and a loud hissingnoise. On November 11, 2009, an anonymous individual uploaded a YouTube video ofone of these old clips, saying, “I salvaged this reel of film from a TV stationthat used to sign off with it during the 1960s.” The uploader later posted acomment indicating the original reel was found in Alabama, dated 1963, and theclip was probably broadcast in several states during the 1960s.99[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber98] Two years after the video was first uploaded,someone discovered that it contained subliminal text, and the news quickly wentviral.100 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber99] The words to the National Anthem arespelled out, appearing on the screen from left to right. However, as the wordsfirst materialize, a different set of words appears beneath them with the samebasic font.The hidden words never appear all at once, and you need to slow the video downto a quarter of its normal speed to see the messages. The disguised text appearsin approximately the same area as the words that then remain on the screen. Thesubliminal commands that appear in the video are as follows:TRUST THE US GOVERNMENTGOD IS REAL GOD IS WATCHINGBELIEVE IN GOVERNMENT GODREBELLION WILL NOT BE TOLERATEDOBEY CONSUME OBEY CONSUMEBUY ULTRA BUY NAOMIWORSHIP CONSUME OBEY BELIEVEDO NOT QUESTION GOVERNMENT“Ultra” and “Naomi” are both names of alleged mind-control programs. Some peoplehave attacked this video as a hoax, but it seems very unlikely that theirarguments are valid. The 1988 movie They Live depicted a society in which wordssuch as “OBEY” and “CONSUME” were hidden in subliminal messages, and this wasalmost certainly an early attempt by whistle-blowers to tell us what was reallybeing done. As we will see, there is a robust international alliance working todefeat the Cabal, and certain insiders are giving me ongoing briefings from thisgroup. Our best written analysis of the National Anthem case appeared on theVigilant Citizen website as of May 13, 2015.101[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber100] The same film clip was still used in sign-offsin the 1980s, such as from Chicago station WMAQ, but there are no subliminals inthose surviving copies. By the 1980s, people had VCRs and these subliminalswould have been easily discovered. However, the 1960s version is wider,featuring buildings you cannot see in any of the 1980s footage, and it is anoriginal copy that never appeared on the Internet before 2009. Furthermore, the1960s version has white text with a shadow that goes to the bottom right, whilethe 1981 version has yellow text with a shadow that reflects up to the topleft.102 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber101]The author concludes that although we cannot absolutely prove it is real—atleast not yet—it cannot be ruled out as a hoax either. An original tape of thevideo would need to be produced and confirmed. The anonymous individual whouploaded this was probably well aware that any attempt to come forward would besuicide. The reason we have trouble accepting something like this is what I callthe “man in the bedroom effect.” We have been taught to admire our leaders, votefor them in elections, and trust that they are doing their best to protect usagainst our enemies. If they are subliminally telling us that they are God, thatwe must worship and obey them, that rebellion will not be tolerated and we mustnot question them, our sense of betrayal and horror is total. It is akin towalking in on your partner while he or she is in bed with someone else. In thatcase you cannot deny what you are seeing. In cases like this, it is far easierto attack and discredit the messenger, by any means necessary, than to face theuncomfortable truth.Pete never saw this video but did confirm that these techniques and commands area valid example of how mind control technology is used. If nothing else, thevideo is a great exercise in showing what can be done, and the techniques thatare used to manipulate us. Many of these techniques are significantly moresophisticated than what we see in the video, and apparently they work very well.I first heard about all this in my college sociology class, as we are about tosee. I was stunned by the number of specific examples I was required to studyand learn. I was also tested on how to spot these messages in printedadvertisements. Once you learn what to look for, it is not that difficult tofind them.SEX, DEATH, AND DR. WILSON BRYAN KEYPete said subliminals can be embedded within audio tracks as well. Sophisticatedtechniques allow speech to blend in with the music in ways that are almostimpossible to detect consciously, but are easily picked out by the mind. The keyto this technology is that the subconscious can only understand basic, childishcommands. Therefore, corporate stores that are in the know will play music thatrepeats basic commands at a slow, hypnotic speed, such as “I am a good person.Stealing is bad. I do not steal.” Pete also said it was common for American carcompanies to secretly alter the images of trees as they whizzed by incommercials. The existing leaves and branches would be manipulated to formimages that were provocative to the subconscious, such as images of naked women.This would cause potential buyers to associate the car with manliness and thesatisfaction of their most basic primal instincts.This confirmed and enhanced some of the unpleasant things I learned in mycollege sociology classes. Dr. Wilson Bryan Key has written multiple books inwhich he clearly exposes this subliminal advertising at work. Websites such asSubliminal Manipulation feature a variety of Key’s original examples as well asnewer ones, in both photo and video form.103 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber102]The pictures are extremely shocking, and words like “SEX” are very easy to spotin many cases. Provocative websites exposing details like this can usually beretrieved from Archive.org if the Cabal takes them offline.104[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber103]One of the strangest things Key discovered was that images and depictions ofdeath were used quite often in subliminals as well. This appears to be anotherexample of “repetition compulsion.” Many of us are heavily seduced by the ideaof our own death in the subconscious mind. We are drawn to those things thatcould kill us, as we get high from repeating the trauma of other brushes withdeath in the past. This again can be seen in Dr. Bessel A. van der Kolk’sdiscovery that soldiers with PTSD would receive a high equivalent to injectingeight milligrams of morphine while watching a movie featuring scenes of combatdeath. On Wednesday, February 21, 1990, just a year and a half before I had myfirst sociology class, Dr. Key gave a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology (MIT) that was written up in their official publication, The Tech, asfollows.Subliminal messages often concentrate on the taboos of society—sex, death,incest, homosexuality, and at times, pagan icons—according to Key. He claimedthat, in one liquor advertisement, the images of a fish, screaming faces, a rat,a volcano, a lizard, and several other death symbols were embedded in ice cubes.Other examples Key showed included a man with an erection in an RJ Reynolds’Camel advertisement, a battered skull in a Bacardi drink, and the word cancer ina cigarette advertisement. Key maintained that these messages do not appear byaccident, coincidence, or as the work of an individual artist.”105[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber104]There are so many high-quality examples of this phenomenon hiding out in theopen that federal criminal trials should already have begun. The problem is thatwe do not live in an open and free system. There is powerful institutionalcorruption in place that prevents these crimes from being taken seriously. In2007, right at the dawn of free online streaming video that anyone could upload,a McDonald’s logo flashed for one single frame of Iron Chef America on the FoodNetwork. A YouTube video went up exposing it, and the network was forced topublicly apologize, saying it was a “glitch.” They denied doing any subliminaladvertising.106 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber105] Mental Floss combined thiswith seven other obvious examples in a popular article from 2015.107[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber106] Dr. Bryan Wilson Key produced many hundreds ofprovocative examples in his books, lectures, and videos.In a Tufts University paper from 2003, Dr. Key wrote, “A recent estimate heldthat 10–20% of mainstream US advertising contained sexual information. . . .Include the subliminal dimension of communication, however, and the input ofinformation into the brain (without conscious awareness) of sexual materialeasily approaches 80–90% of commercial media. In this all-pervasive ocean ofsexualized people, products, ideas, and information, few consumers even suspectan enormous, bizarre, invisible environment has been created to milk them out oftheir money, allegiances, and power.”108 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber107]MR. DOAs you can see from the Project Camelot videos, Pete is stunningly articulateand extremely well versed in science.109 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber108] Icould easily have filled this entire book with his testimony. Pete claims thathis grandfather was one of Nikola Tesla’s main lab assistants, and he wastrained in the secrets of Tesla technology from a very young age. He wasrecruited by the government as a boy after developing a very effective rocketsystem. He was then trained by all the best scientists available within theclassified world, earning multiple PhDs’ worth of information in a variety oftechnical fields. He became one of the top scientists and technologyproblem-solvers within the classified world, and was widely considered theirsingle most valuable and prolific inventor. Ronald Reagan gave him the nickname“Mr. Do” as a result. Sadly, almost all his world-changing inventions remainclassified to this day.Pete worked directly with top neocons like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, andended up having a change of heart that led to his coming forward. He felt he had“mud on his wheel of karma.” The Project Camelot interviews we did with Petebarely even scratched the surface of how much he really knew as the years wentby. Pete goes into so much technical detail on any question that it ismind-boggling. There is no such thing as a short conversation. He can discoursefor three hours on advanced physics, mathematics, or technology and never repeathimself. Never once have I caught him in any obvious lies. At any time I couldcome back to a story he told me five years ago and gain new information byasking different questions. I was deeply honored when he told me I am one of thethree smartest people he has ever known. One of them died and the other onebetrayed him. Pete has also introduced me to several other insiders. One of themdeveloped eight different anti-gravity systems by analyzing crashed wreckage andhaving in-person consultations with extraterrestrials.HOLY GOD DAMNPete was there during the formative stages of the same secret space program thatHenry Deacon was a part of. He helped design some of the craft and othertechnologies they use. This included advanced computer chips that are far morepowerful than anything we have in the commercial world, featuring photon-basedtransistors instead of those using electrons. Pete’s chips have a staggering 144cores each, running at speeds vastly in excess of any current technology. Thechips can be printed on conventional multilayer silicon wafers at dirt-cheapprices. Since photons have quantum nonlocality, they process countlesscalculations simultaneously. Eighty-five percent of the components of a typicalsmartphone can be eliminated with just one chip, and it requires so little powerit can be run off a lemon with wires stuck into it. This technology was recentlydemonstrated to officials who were not in the know about these discoveries atthe Pentagon. They gave the chip a random, unexpected calculation that their topsupercomputers would take three weeks to crack, and left. Pete’s chip hadalready solved the puzzle by the time they came back from the bathroom. Thesechips are so powerful that they demonstrate what Pete’s insiders call“electronic intelligence.”Pete also was involved in a program in which the nervous system was mapped outin meticulous detail. He discovered that we have a dimple in the middle of eachshoulder blade where a huge cluster of nerve fibers all intersect before goingon up to the brain. He said this serves no practical purpose for the body, otherthan that it feels terrific when the area is massaged. These nerve clusters arebelieved to be a product of intelligent genetic tinkering with the human body,such as by extraterrestrials. Pete and his insiders feel we were meant to usethese areas once we learned how to access them. Special energetic fields canpump visual information, sounds, and thoughts directly into the brain throughthese areas, which they call “ports.”This system was depicted in the movie The Matrix, when Trinity downloads theinformation on how to fly a helicopter as her eyes flutter, and Neo downloadsinformation that suddenly allows him to excel at martial arts and fightMorpheus. The main difference in The Matrix is that people “jack in” through aport at the back of their heads, rather than in the shoulder blades. Pete saidthat if you are given information in this manner, it can cause headaches anddisorientation. The data then begins showing up in your mind over the course ofthe next few days or weeks. At first it seems dreamlike, and it graduallysurfaces in your conscious awareness as something you know and understand. Wehave the potential to vastly increase our intelligence and learn multiplelanguages through the use of this technology.This system can also be used to project people into a vividly realisticvirtual-reality environment. Middle and high-level Cabal members routinelyexperience this technology, as does everyone in the secret space program. TheseVR systems were depicted in The Matrix as well as the Divergent film series, andto a lesser degree in Ender’s Game. Images can also be pulled out of the mindand projected, as was depicted in Minority Report. When I first started talkingto Corey Goode, one of many stunning correlations we had with our insiderknowledge was on the subject of these ports. Corey was well aware of them, andtold me many of the things Pete had said before I could even get the words outof my mouth. He revealed that he had used these same systems extensively whilein the space program.Classified fighter-jets no longer need windows thanks to this system. Vision isnothing more than electrical signals from the retinas of your eyes that are thensent to the brain. In this case, two metallic nubs push against your ports whileyou sit in a special chair. Energetic signals are pumped into your visual cortexjust like the electrical signals from your eyes. Your visual cortex is floodedwith information that is just as accessible as what you see with your eyes. Yourvision becomes exceptionally crisp and clear, and you can then zoom in on anyarea like binoculars. Pete managed to produce a demonstration of this technologyfor a wealthy corporate leader who was blind. The man was brought to an airfieldand seated in a specific fighter-jet. When he tried out the system, his exactquote began with “Holy God damn.” I cannot print the last word he said.AEROSPACE COMMANDI found out that our government already has cloaking technology that can makenaval vessels, aircraft, and spacecraft invisible, and in the classified worldthis is called “masking.” Our skies are routinely filled with masked craft thatwe cannot see. This includes gigantic aircraft carriers that are literallyfloating cities, using a combination of anti-gravity and conventional propulsionto remain airborne. The insider Bob Dean got in trouble for leaking thisinformation in a Project Camelot video from April 2010. Here is what he said:“They don’t want us to know about the Aerospace Command here, would you believethat? Trillions of dollars a year are going off to a military command that theAmerican people don’t even know exists? . . . It used to be in Nebraska. It usedto be in Colorado Springs. Now the headquarters . . . I swear to God theheadquarters is in orbit! There is a four-star Air Force general, who, last Ichecked last year, was commanding: Lance Lord. Interesting name. . . . It’s ajoint services Space Command that the American people don’t even know exist. Itputs NASA to shame.”110 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber109]Peterson was absolutely astonished to see these flying super-carriers appear inThe Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He said that what we seein these movies is exactly the same as how they really look. Two of thesecarriers usually fly with a large flying black triangle that serves as amassive, multilevel aircraft carrier. In my epic article “Cosmic Perspective onthe Defeat of the Cabal,” I give detailed photographic comparisons and ananalysis of how they line up with Pete’s testimony.111[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber110] He said that many of our best technologiesfrom the 1980s are now appearing in movies. James Cameron’s movie Avatar wasloaded with images of genuine technology, including the robotic chassis that aperson can stand in and manipulate. The same device appears in the movie Aliens,in which Sigourney Weaver uses it to battle the queen.Another Project Camelot whistle-blower was the computer hacker Gary McKinnon,who used his skills to look for information on UFOs.112[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber111] He hacked his way into NASA, the Pentagon, andvarious other government organizations. The Huffington Post UK published aprovocative article about the evidence he discovered. “When Gary McKinnon hackedinto U.S. Space Command computers several years ago and learned of the existenceof ‘non-terrestrial officers’ and ‘fleet-to-fleet transfers’ and a secretprogram called ‘Solar Warden,’ he was charged by the Bush Justice Departmentwith having committed ‘the biggest military computer hack of all time,’ andstood to face prison time of up to 70 years after extradition from UK. . . .McKinnon also found out about the ships or craft within Solar Warden. It is saidthat there are approx eight cigar-shaped motherships (each longer than twofootball fields end-to-end) and 43 small ‘scout ships.’”113[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber112] In Selected by Extraterrestrials, WilliamTompkins describes his efforts to help design these cigar-shaped craft. He alsoconfirmed the existence of the Solar Warden program.In his Project Camelot interview, McKinnon said, “What I surmised is that anoff-planet Space Marines is being formed. And if you actually look at DARPA, theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, literature at the moment and in thelast few years, a lot of government and space command stuff is all about spacedominance. It is really, you know, the final frontier. Yeah, so I think it’snatural for them to want to control space and to be developing a space-goingforce in secret. I think [they are] most likely using technologyreverse-engineered from ETs.”114 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber113]THE BRAIN DRAINPete also revealed that the so-called “Brain Drain” in the 1950s and ’60s wasvery real. He claims that 55 to 60 million of the most intelligent and talentedscientists from around the world were recruited into the secret space program.Twenty-five percent of them were from the United States and Canada, and theother 75 percent were international. They would cut all ties with their familyand friends on Earth, fill out a series of postcards to cover a few years oftime, and then never have contact with anyone here again. Groups on Earth wouldthen send out the postcards at the appropriate time intervals.Advertisements for these jobs were openly distributed in Brazil. The ads saidthat you would be leaving the country for an exciting high-tech assignment andwould no longer have any further contact with your family or friends. It did notsay exactly what the work would be or where you would end up going. Once thesepeople arrived at their new homes, they were encouraged to have children, and asa result their population has greatly increased since the 1950s. People continueto be recruited into this “breakaway civilization” out of military,intelligence, and other areas. As Corey Goode revealed, many of them areselected and trained from very early childhood. In total, the number of peopleworking out in space could now be well above America’s own population of 300million.UNDERGROUND BASESSome of these people also work in vast underground facilities. Pete waspersonally aware of approximately 250 different underground bases that werebuilt around the world. Each of these facilities was built to hold a maximum of65,000 people. Pete got to tour one of them and was impressed. They are usuallybuilt inside natural limestone caves in the earth. There are trees, roads, andbuildings inside, as well as a domed roof with artificial light. When I askedhim if there was anything “off” about it, he said you could always hear thesound of ventilation fans, and there was a persistent smell of machine oil inthe air. You could also see seams and rivets in the domed ceiling. Peteconfirmed that injections would be given to people that would make it lethal forthem to return to the surface. In order to leave, you would need to get aspecial shot that would cover you for however many days before you wereauthorized to return. If you extended your stay past that number of days, youwould quickly die. Pete was offered the chance to live and work in one of thesefacilities and he refused. He also told me if I revealed too much I might bepulled into one of them, never to return.Bob Dean also leaked information about these bases in his April 2010 interviewwith Project Camelot. “I’ve been in underground facilities that you wouldn’tbelieve—massive, massive—all over the country. There’s one under Fort Huachuca,which I may have told you once before, that is gigantic. . . . My only criticismat the time was that some of them were so luxurious for the politicians thatthat ticked me off. I felt that the politicians didn’t deserve those luxuriousfacilities. We’ve got massive underground facilities all over the country, allover the planet. We’ve got official military relationships with the off-planetintelligences. We have a major facility in the middle of Australia. It’s calledPine Gap. The point I’m getting at is that our military, our Shadow Government,is deeply involved with extraterrestrial operations.”115[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber114]The Cabal’s plan was to have a full-scale nuclear war, in which nuclearsubmarines fired off all their ordnance. The Cabal would make sure that alltheir friends, colleagues, and family members were taken underground before thewar started, and they planned on living down there until the Earth becamehabitable again. In those cases they would not be forced to take the shots.Modern nuclear weapons were not designed to create any lasting radiation, so anextended stay underground would not be required. Each of these cities has adocking station in the ocean where the breeder reactor in a nuclear submarinecan plug in and power the entire facility for many years. The subs thereforecontinue to be useful after they have fired off all their missiles.A vast system of underground passageways called the “sub-shuttle” systeminterlinks these cities together, even underneath oceans. The shuttles travel bythe use of high-intensity compressed air, and are extremely fast. Inflatableairbags inside the shuttle cushion you from the impact of turns. The ride can besickening enough that every seat has a vacuum-powered chute to capture vomit assoon as you lean into it. The sub-shuttle system was disclosed by Phil Schneiderin the early 1990s. He was personally aware of 129 underground facilities, allinterconnected by the sub-shuttle system, and claimed to have worked on thirteenof them. Not long after coming forward, Schneider died on January 17, 1996.116[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber115]The Disclosure Project witness Daniel Morris, who later came forward with hisreal last name as Salter, said the following about Phil in this quote from hisSeptember 2000 interview: “There are other people who have been eliminated forwhat they know. One was a friend of mine, Phil Schneider, who worked out here inNew Mexico building the tunnels. The biggest one that he was involved with wasthe Dulce underground facility. . . . I know that Phil loved this country and hethought these programs were bypassing our form of government. . . . No Congressever voted on any of these black projects, and he believed the American peoplehad a right to know what they were spending their money for and what we werecapable of doing. And he started talking, so they got rid of him.”117[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber116]THE SEEKER AND THE ALLIANCEAs the years have gone by, Pete has validated almost everything that otherinsiders have told me about the space program, and added significant additionalinformation. He revealed that a gigantic, Moon-sized sphere drifted into oursolar system in the early 1980s, terrifying the Reagan administration. None ofthe ETs they were in contact with, at places like Area 51, had anywhere nearthis level of technology. They called this sphere “the Seeker.” It waspredominantly white, but its surface had geometric lines much like a soccerball. Huge portals would open on its sides, creating eight-hundred-mile-wideholes into an interior that was too dark to see very clearly. Ships would fly inand out of the portals and explore our planets and moons. The Seeker came intoour solar system and began circling each of the planets, one by one. Iteventually left when it got to Jupiter.Although Pete has hundreds of amazing stories that I have been able to validate,there is nowhere near enough space in this book to document all of them. Themost important thing he shared with me is the existence of an alliance thatformed to end the UFO cover-up. The two most prominent movies that reveal theAlliance’s agenda and prepare us for disclosure are Iron Man 3 and CaptainAmerica: The Winter Soldier.118 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber117] A surprisingmajority of the people in the Pentagon want the secrecy to end, particularlyafter 9/11, which is widely known to have been an inside job. The Cabal is stillusing lethal force to prevent the truth from being revealed. As a result, thepro-disclosure elements of the Pentagon have quietly worked with foreigncountries to create an international alliance. I have extensively covered thebattle between the Cabal and the Alliance on my website, and the story isconstantly shifting and evolving as time goes on. This is considered a “shadowWorld War III,” and the Cabal is losing the war very rapidly. At the time ofthis writing, major treaties are being signed and an official announcement isexpected.DIVINE INTERVENTIONMost interestingly, we have learned that an extremely advanced extraterrestrialforce is consistently preventing the Cabal from killing large numbers of people.This goes all the way back to the dawn of the nuclear age. Missiles and entirenuclear facilities have consistently been powered down by UFOs that appeared.Some of these stories did leak to the public through other insiders, as we areabout to see. Space-based “Star Wars” weapons were deactivated in the 1980salmost as soon as they went up. Entire facilities of nuclear missiles had allthe warheads completely melted down into nonradioactive material. The guidancesystems on the missiles were so scrambled that they could not fly. This happenedon multiple occasions. The Apollo astronaut and American hero Dr. Edgar Mitchellpublicly confirmed the overall story in 2015, and the media widely reported onit. Here is an excerpt from The Mirror:[Dr. Mitchell] told us military insiders had seen strange crafts flying overmissile bases and the famous White Sands facility, where the world’s first evernuclear bomb was detonated in 1945. . . . “My own experience talking to peoplehas made it clear the ETs had been attempting to keep us from going to war andhelp create peace on Earth.” Mitchell also suggested he had heard similarstories from people who manned missile bases during the most tense parts of thetwentieth century. “I have spoken to many Air Force officers who worked at thesesilos during the Cold War,” he continued. “They told me UFOs were frequentlyseen overhead and often disabled their missiles. Other officers from bases onthe Pacific coast told me their [test] missiles were frequently shot down byalien spacecraft.”119 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber118]On September 27, 2010, Robert Hastings held an event at the National Press Clubin which seven US Air Force veterans shared their personal testimony about theseencounters. It is very likely that Dr. Mitchell spoke with some, if not all ofthese insiders. According to Hastings’s website, “To date, Hastings hasinterviewed more than 150 military veterans who were involved in variousUFO-related incidents at U.S. missile sites, weapons storage facilities, andnuclear bomb test ranges. The events described by these individuals leave littledoubt that the U.S. nuclear weapons program is an ongoing source of interest tosomeone possessing vastly superior technology. . . . Hastings believes that UFOsare piloted by visitors from elsewhere in the universe who, for whatever reason,have taken an interest in our long-term survival. He contends that these beingsare occasionally disrupting our nukes to send a message to the American andSoviet/Russian governments that their possession and potential large-scale useof nuclear weapons threatens the future of humanity and the environmentalintegrity of the planet.”120 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber119]Less than a month after Hastings’s epic event, on October 23, 2010, acigar-shaped UFO appeared over the largest nuclear missile installation in theUS. The F. E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming, lost the ability tocommunicate with fifty of its Minuteman III missiles as this happened. This wasthe largest single failure of nuclear missiles in the entire history of theUnited States, compromising one-ninth of the entire arsenal, and it lasted forseveral hours. According to a PR Newswire article that was initially featured onReuters, “The confidential Air Force sources also report that their squadroncommander has warned witnesses not to talk to journalists or researchers about‘the things they may or may not have seen’ in the sky, and has threatened severepenalties for anyone violating security.”121 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber120]According to Peterson, sometime in the late 1980s or the very early 1990s, allthe remaining missiles in both the US and the USSR were completely ruined. Thiswas apparently the final straw that led to the collapse of the USSR and the endof the Cold War. The Project Camelot insider Bob Dean independently confirmedthese details to me about a year after I had first heard them from Pete. In a2010 interview with Project Camelot, Dean leaked some of the intel when he said,“There is not going to be a nuclear war because [the ETs are] not going to allowit. The planet is too valuable—the flora and fauna in this zoological garden istoo precious. And they have already intervened several times. They made theirpoint during the Reagan administration; they made it to Gorbachev when he was inoffice. They’ve made the point many times. They made it at Rendlesham Forest,Bentwaters, when they melted the warheads.”122 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber121]Although the US still has missiles, they now contain advanced particle-beamsystems exactly like we see in Captain America: The Winter Solider, since anyattempt to make nuclear weapons is blocked. It is highly unlikely that theseparticle-beam systems will ever be permitted to be used either, since they areextremely destructive—as the Captain America movie so compellingly illustrates.However, certain tragic events such as the BP oil spill and the Fukushimadisaster are still “authorized” by the advanced ETs who watch over and manageour planet. In certain cases, our collective free will permits these events tooccur in order to provide a global wake-up call. This then leads us to takeaction, rise up against our oppressors, and save ourselves. The ETs cannot justsweep in and rescue us. They are allowed to do part of the work, so that it ispossible for us to solve the problem ourselves, but we have to finish the job.The vast majority of planned mass atrocities are blocked, though, since theCabal is still constantly trying to start World War III, to create masscatastrophes that would lead to incredible loss of life, and to otherwise wreakhavoc on Earth. As one example, the Cabal tried to send black-ops scuba-divingsoldiers in to blow up an oil refinery in the Persian Gulf, creating another BPoil spill. They were carrying backpacks with bombs in them that they were goingto plant on the rig. This would almost certainly have led to an epicArmageddon-type war in the Middle East once the Western powers had denied anyresponsibility for the catastrophe. The elected officials very likely had noidea that this was being planned. The soldiers hit an energetic wall in thewater that was like stretchable elastic. They couldn’t go over, under, orthrough it, and finally gave up after twelve hours of struggle.The amount of “divine intervention” that has stopped wars from taking place istruly mind-boggling, according to Pete and other insiders. Advanced, exoticcraft have been deactivated or have completely disappeared. Entire undergroundfacilities have had all their employees portaled out and were then completelydestroyed. This included a base near Washington, DC, that the Cabal members ofthe US government were planning on fleeing to in the event of a publicdisclosure. The entire East Coast of the United States shook with a 5.5magnitude earthquake when this base was destroyed. It was quite the shockingsynchronicity that this event occurred on August 23, 2011, the same day that mybook The Source Field Investigations was released. The publisher was all excitedabout our big debut, and on that very day the ground heaved under thepublishers’ feet, causing their knees to buckle if they were standing.123[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber122]It was also very interesting and symbolic that the top of the WashingtonMonument obelisk cracked in this same earthquake. This again seemed like apotent symbol of the impending full defeat of the Cabal. I wrote about thedestruction of this and another base under the Denver International Airport onSeptember 16, 2011.124 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber123] I subsequently foundout that at least twenty-four other bases were destroyed thereafter. Thedestruction of bases appeared to come to a halt shortly after the beginning of2012, after a new treaty between the Cabal and the benevolent ETs was agreed to,which increased the speed of the disclosure process. A wealth of revealing NASAdata started appearing thereafter, as we will discuss in upcoming chapters.Three years after the first two bases were destroyed, in 2014, Russian nationaltelevision aired a prime-time, three-hour documentary in which I was interviewedabout these events. It was the most popular show in the history of thatparticular production company, with 21 million viewers.125[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber124]During this same time, tanks that were going to roll into Syria would not start,only to work fine when they were brought elsewhere. Bomb-bay doors on airplanesabout to release massively destructive weapons were jammed. Guns would not fire.Even bladed weapons were jammed in their sheaths so they could not be pulledout. On three different occasions, the Palestinians planned to invade Israel,and Israeli soldiers intercepted their communications and were waiting for them.When they tried to fight one another, none of their guns would fire and theycould not release their bladed weapons. These hardened warriors fell to theirknees, held their arms up into the air, and cried, believing it was a divinemanifestation.Despite all the negative press about him in the Cabal-controlled West, VladimirPutin has been a key figure in the Alliance, working directly with the positiveelements in the Pentagon. A positive ET group apparently gave Putin some oftheir peace-keeping technology. Corey Goode revealed that this technology causesmetal to suddenly enlarge while it is activated. As soon as the beam is turnedoff, the metal returns to its normal size. Putin has demonstrated the ability tocompletely power down any and all US military hardware, including the latest,greatest Aegis-class aircraft carriers. Every effort is being made to preventloss of life, and to create a peaceful transition that leads to disclosure.IT’S NOT FUN TO BE PRESIDENTPete confirmed that George W. Bush was given a very tiny earpiece so that hecould be told what to say by a team of insiders. Many amusing verbal mistakes,commonly known as “Bushisms,” resulted from this.126[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber125] Perhaps the most obvious example is “Familiesis where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream.” This was spoken in LaCrosse, Wisconsin, on October 18, 2000.127 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber126]Obama refused to use such a device, and instead was told he must speak from ateleprompter. Pete also revealed that a very provocative meeting took placebetween Obama and the surviving former US presidents on January 7, 2009. Upuntil this point, Obama did not know what he had gotten himself into. Accordingto Pete, he was taken into a half-hour private meeting with George H. W. Bush inwhich he was severely verbally abused and threatened.The Washington Post confirmed that a private meeting did take place, as follows:“A real team of rivals gathered for lunch at the White House yesterday, asPresident Bush and three former U.S. commanders in chief put aside theirpolitical differences to offer recollections and advice to President-electBarack Obama. . . . Neither the White House nor the Obama transition team sharedmany details from the lunch, including what they ordered from the menu. No aideswere present during the meal, officials said. Obama also met one on one withBush for about 30 minutes beforehand.”128 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber127]Up until that meeting, Obama did not know much, if anything, about the Cabal. Hewas told that he and all of his family would be tortured and killed if theyresisted. Obama apparently staggered out of this meeting into a room in theWhite House that he thought was private. He held his head in his hands andcried, saying he had been made into a scapegoat. According to Pete as well asJacob, who we are about to meet, an intelligence agent was in a nearby phonebooth and witnessed the entire event. Pete also said the vast majority ofinsiders working for the Alliance know that this happened. US presidents aregenerally given very little access to the real secrets, and the Cabal ismasterful at trying to pin the blame on elected officials, thereby divertingattention from themselves."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENJACOB AND THE SECRET SPACE PROGRAMThe next significant insider arrived six months after Peterson, and we will callhim Jacob. Up until Corey Goode came along, Jacob was by far the highest-levelinsider I knew. He has extensive involvement in the secret space program and the“breakaway civilization” that has resulted. When I first met him, even though Icould tell he was quite a character and had a great sense of humor, I wasn’timpressed and thought he was a fake. That challenged him to prove himself, whichhe certainly did. During our first private meeting, Jacob showed me stunningproof that he had access to highly classified secrets. He stayed at my housemore than once for days at a time, and our conversations were fascinating. Onhis first visit, he showed me a classified photo of ruins on Mars. These werehighly intricate, obviously artificial, and looked very different from anythingI had seen on Earth. Most strangely, all the words on the sides, with arrowspointing to different features in the photo, were in German.Jacob also showed me hundreds upon hundreds of pages of blueprints for a vastunderground base. It would have cost well over a million dollars to draw up suchdetailed blueprints. The amount of detail in the illustrations, and in histechnical descriptions of everything he was showing me, was stunning. Thisfacility would feature a series of condominiums on the surface. Hidden elevatorswould allow the people living in them to quickly go underground whenever needed.He had calculated how many people the facility could hold, and realized it wouldhave far more space than was needed in the event of a global disaster. When hetold his superiors that he wanted them to rescue ordinary people as well asinsiders, they canceled the project and withdrew all their funding.Jacob then opened up Google Earth and showed me a series of provocative basesaround the world that he said were even more interesting than Area 51. Veryquickly he zoomed over some of the most barren areas on Earth and revealedsurprisingly complex airfields in the middle of nowhere. One of them was DiegoGarcia, a small island in the middle of the Indian Ocean that is officiallylisted as a joint US/NATO military base. Jacob said there were facilities forboth humans and ETs in these bases, and they went many levels below thesurface—exactly as I had seen in my epic ascension dream from high school.THESE ARE NOT HAPPY PEOPLEAnother shocking thing Jacob showed me in our first private meeting wasphotographs taken inside the Oval Office on President Obama’s first day, January20, 2009, right before he went in. This was slightly less than two weeks afterhe had been threatened and told the truth about the Cabal at the presidents’luncheon. Jacob was well aware of that incident and confirmed all the detailsPete had shared with me. Multiple shots were taken of Obama’s new desk fromdifferent angles. On top of the desk was a manila envelope that had the number“44” scrawled on it in pen, signifying that he was the forty-fourth president.The envelope contained a series of briefing documents that told Obama what wasreally going on. The documents identified the Cabal as a group of powerfulinternational bankers, and told him he was to follow their orders precisely—orthere would be dire consequences for him and his family. Jacob also had candidpictures of a pale George W. Bush riding in his limousine after he had heardabout 9/11; I had never seen any of these pictures in the media. During thissame event, Jacob showed me dozens of pages of bank accounts for top Cabalfamilies such as the Rothschilds. I saw usernames, passwords, account numbers,and balances, and they were often in the billions. As time went on, there werealso numerous occasions on which Jacob would leak insider information to mebefore it appeared in the headlines. In some cases I would reveal thisinformation publicly beforehand.It quickly became obvious that Jacob worked for the group most people call theIlluminati, which means “the Enlightened Ones.” The big secret was that theywere the hyper-wealthy power structure controlling the real space program, andthe bases other insiders had visited. They had UFO-type craft that wereroutinely coming and going from the Earth. Jacob did not support much of whatthey were doing, and would often tell me things he apparently wasn’t supposed tosay—which he called “talking out of school.” He said he still worked for thembecause he felt their efforts in space were vital for the survival of everyoneon Earth. There were negative ETs trying to destroy us and he wanted to makesure they did not succeed. At one point I asked him if anyone had been able totake control of a UFO, like I had written in my short story “Civil War.” Helaughed and confirmed that this did occasionally happen. Most people were notable to get the ship to go very far, but a few did manage to take a joyridebefore they were detected, intercepted, and brought into custody.I was invited to join them and told I would be able to travel into space, meetETs, and have incredible experiences. I was also promised fantastic sums ofmoney if I accepted the deal, as well as guaranteed safety in the event of anycataclysmic disasters. In total, I had five different offers like this come infrom various sources. I was told that I would be put in control of accounts thatwould quickly mature into the hundreds of millions of dollars. In exchange forthis, I would have to begin putting out messages that were favorable to theCabal and their philosophies. This would include framing Lucifer as a positiveforce, bringing us wisdom, freedom, and sexuality. I consistently refused theseoffers over the years, as I have strong disagreements about things like the“need” to reduce population. Nor did I agree with the idea that Lucifer was abenevolent, misunderstood liberator of humanity. It was very edgy to talk toJacob at all, but I got an extremely thorough education in the process. He wasnot a Luciferian and joked that since Lucifer exists outside of time, he shouldjust go away and come back later. Jacob can get anyone laughing within minutesand is an endless repository of fascinating information and entertainingstories.THE BLACK JESUSOne of the most surprising stories Jacob ever told me concerned a man theycalled the “Black Jesus.” He said this was highly classified and he wasdefinitely “talking out of school” to tell me about it at all. Apparently in the1960s a man appeared in Africa who had full ascended abilities. He could readpeople’s minds, materialize objects out of thin air, communicate telepathically,levitate himself, and teleport his body from one location to another. He was aspiritual teacher who emphasized love, peace, service to others, and forgivenessas the common core that unified all the great religions. The Cabal does not wantanyone to develop these abilities, and if they find out that someone has them,they will hunt those people down and terminate them with prejudice. The Cabalmade several attempts to assassinate this man. He consistently regenerated hisbody after each attack, no matter how lethal it seemed to be.Finally the man was told that they had given up. He was far too powerful. Therewas nothing they could do to stop him, and they were going to surrender. Theyinvited him to a major world summit and told him they would reveal him to all ofhumanity so he could share his message. He was brought on board a militarytransport aircraft. Once airborne, he was shot repeatedly. His body was dividedinto many different sections, each of which was stored in a super-high-techenergy-shielded container. Jet aircraft rushed up to the plane in sequence andscrambled the containers all over the Earth, as far apart as possible. Thecontents were then thoroughly and completely destroyed. It was hoped that thiswould prevent him from being able to regenerate himself.After this was done, the man materialized directly into the offices of thepeople who had ordered his murder. There were no visible signs of damage to hisbody. He said, “Your desire to prevent me from living on Earth is so strong thatI am forced to honor it, for now. I will be leaving you shortly. However, in thefuture many more people will develop abilities just like me. Once that happens,you will no longer be able to stop us from making this world a peaceful placefor everyone.”MR. X AND THE BLUESThis mirrored the story of the first Project Camelot insider, who went by thepseudonym Mr. X and was interviewed with a disguised video shoot in May 2006.129[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber128] He reported having a job with aCalifornia-based defense contractor in the 1980s where he had to sort throughand categorize a huge amount of classified documents. According to the write-upon the Project Camelot website, “Working long hours in a locked vault, he openedlarge mail bags full of photos, videotapes, alien artifacts, and volumes of topsecret eyes-only documents that told the story behind Roswell, alien visitationand the government’s careful handling of documented evidence of reverseengineering of alien craft.”130 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber129] Among thosedocuments were pages from the 1950s that described a series of meetings betweenPresident Eisenhower and a group of benevolent extraterrestrials.Pete revealed this ET group had dark blue skin, large heads, and large blackeyes, and were simply called “the Blues.” This was not the same group that latercontacted Corey Goode and were identified as the Blue Avians. The Blues promisedus complete protection from negative extraterrestrials and a gradual rollout offantastic technology. In exchange, we would have to give up our nuclear weapons,allow a formal education on the science of spirituality to occur, and permitopen interaction between humanity and benevolent ETs.The Blues’ offer was rudely and sarcastically dismissed. According to thedocuments Mr. X saw, the Blues told the US government that they would disappearfor now, but that at the end of the year 2012, they and their allies wouldreturn in a “mass landing.”131 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber130] Once they choseto reveal themselves, there would be nothing the Cabal could do to stop them.Other insiders have confirmed that this date has been pushed forward, since weare not ready for it to happen yet as a collective, but it very likely willstill occur within a reasonable time window. This mass contact event appears tobe a key component of the ascension process. Mr. X later decided to comeforward, reveal his true identity, and share much more of what he knew. He thendied of a massive and unexpected stroke on December 13, 2008. He was onlyforty-eight years of age, and had a one-year-old son.132[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber131] I deeply regret that this happened, and wish Ihad gotten the chance to meet him before he passed away.BRINGING THE INSIDERS TOGETHERI set up a direct three-day-long meeting between Jacob and Pete Peterson inPete’s hometown that was very fascinating to participate in. At one point duringthe dinner I heard a loud tink noise in the room. I immediately asked everyoneelse if they had heard that funny noise, but they were distracted enough by theconversation that they had missed it. The next time I pushed down with my fork,my plate neatly parted into two pieces. The next day, a massive pipe burst in myhouse and spilled water all over the kitchen. Both of these events appeared tobe warning shots intended to threaten me, and probably involved the use of aparticle-beam technology. I chose not to be intimidated.[../image/21_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Image of David Wilcock’s Plate of Food Having Split in Half While in a DinnerMeeting Featuring Insiders Jacob and Pete PetersonI also got Jacob in touch with Hoagland’s top insider Bruce for a short visit ina restaurant in Los Angeles. Although Bruce worked directly with US presidents,he was not briefed on many of the things Jacob was involved in. They still gotalong and shared common knowledge. People who have been through these sorts ofprograms can immediately identify other insiders. Jacob would say, “They cansmell it on you.” Jacob and Henry Deacon also stayed at my house at the sametime for a few days during a subsequent visit. Whenever I brought these peopletogether, it was very clear that they shared many common pieces of information.Code names and things I did not understand were exchanged at rapid speeds, andit was clear they were sharing hyper-complex inside information. Jacob and HenryDeacon went off for an extended two-hour private conversation in my backyard atone point, and I would have very much appreciated to have heard what they said.Up until Corey Goode came along, Jacob was the most highly connected spaceprogram insider I had ever met. He claimed to have personally traveled to abouttwo hundred different off-planet bases, including many that were far outside oursolar system. This was done through the use of the portal system in what somehave called the “cosmic web”—the sequence of plasma tubes that interlink allneighboring stars together. Jacob couldn’t understand why people were sofascinated with Mars, as he said it was a “dreadful” planet, and many otherplaces were much nicer to visit. He did tell me that he was once ordered to killsome fifty-foot-long sandworms on Mars that would attach themselves to the sidesof the bases. They had somehow evolved to be able to eat metal and otherminerals. The job was relatively boring, and required the use of a weapon thatshot out a foot-long metallic projectile, shaped like a small javelin. The workwas somewhat frightening if the worms spotted you in an open area, as they couldrush toward you at a decent walking speed and were quite deadly if they gotclose.OUR INTERSTELLAR COMMUNITYJacob said there are approximately five to six thousand intelligentcivilizations within a thousand-light-year radius from our solar system. Heclaimed to have personally seen more than four hundred different types ofextraterrestrials at a total of about two hundred different off-planet sites. Hesaid some of these ETs were human or humanlike, whereas others were only“hominid,” meaning they had a head, a face, and a body with arms and legs thatwalked upright, but could otherwise look very different. Every type of life wesee on Earth has evolved into intelligent hominid forms on various planets. Onplanets that are predominantly oceanic, hominids will evolve out of any of avariety of aquatic creatures we see on Earth. One type he personally interactedwith had a head that looked like a sturgeon, with eyes on the side and anelongated snout filled with sharp teeth. Another group visited the Dogon tribein Mali, and had all-black eyes, bony projections where the eyebrows would be,and strange limbs that moved almost like jellyfish as they walked.There are a variety of insectoid hominids, including people who look like antsand others who look like grasshoppers or praying mantises. When I brought thisinformation back to Pete, he confirmed that he had interacted with agrasshopper-type being at a base in Antarctica called Ice Station Zebra. Thissame term was “hidden out in the open” in the title of a 1963 novel and latermovie that was based on an event in 1959, in which Russians captured a USsatellite that had downed in the Arctic. Real code names are often released likethis so that if anyone talks, they are simply accused of copying ideas frommovies. Pete said the most difficult part of talking to this being was itsmouth, as it had three mandibles on each side that would open and close. He saidit is common to feel physically nauseated when you meet such an unusual-lookingentity. When Pete revealed this to the being, it said, “How do you think I feeltalking to you?” The being would deliberately put its head down when it laughedso Pete wouldn’t see all the mandibles open up.I took some of the specific details of what Pete said about Ice Station Zebraand reported them back to Jacob, who then filled in more of what Pete had saidwithout me even having to say it out loud. This type of common knowledge betweeninsiders was a routine occurrence. Jacob also indicated that there were severaldifferent types of reptilian humanoids, and that they are the biggesttroublemakers. Pete, William Tompkins, and Corey Goode independently confirmedthis, and I will discuss them in a later chapter.HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW?I also got to see Jacob interact with other insiders, including the late BobDean, who was arguably the most well-loved Project Camelot witness.133[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber132] Bob Dean reminded me of a wise, crusty oldsailor from a Hemingway novel, complete with the cigar. Dean was greatlysurprised when he saw Jacob at a Project Camelot event, and recognized him fromthe time they served in the space program. They hadn’t seen each other since the1970s, and I was right there as the first meeting happened. Jacob laughed andtold Dean he should come forward and say what he really knows.Jacob later told me that Dean was very heavily involved in the secret spaceprogram and had shared only a small amount of what he really knew with thepublic. Jacob said there weren’t very many people involved at the highestlevels, and everyone knew one another. He told me the core management of thecommand structure here on Earth consists of only “about fifteen to twenty-five”people, and the exact number is classified. Dean agreed with this approximatenumber when we spoke.This was also similar to the number given by the high-ranking Disclosure Projectwitness Daniel M. Salter, whom I briefly met in 2001. Salter’s book Life with aCosmos Clearance contains a variety of interesting details that others haveverified. Salter went under the pseudonym Dan Morris at the event. In theDisclosure Project briefing document, Salter described one of his jobs asfollows: “I would go interview people who claimed they had seen something andtry to convince them they hadn’t seen something or that they were hallucinating.Well, if that didn’t work, another team would come in and give all thethreats . . . threaten them and their family and so on and so forth. They wouldbe in charge of discrediting them, making them look foolish. . . . Now if thatdidn’t work, then there was another team that put an end to that problem, oneway or another.” Salter’s full testimony begins on page 268 of the full briefingdocument.134 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber133]Bruce just called me while I was writing this section. I asked him how manypeople currently living on the surface of the Earth have any decent idea of whatis going on in the space program, apart from individual compartments. He saidthere are “about three thousand” of them living here. About four hundred to fivehundred of the members of this group are visible in the public eye and the restare largely unknown. None of these visible people include elected leaders orcelebrities. When I asked him how many people actually manage the group at itscore, he revealed that this is where the infamous “Committee of 300” comesin.135 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber134] This group is also known as “theOlympians,” indicating that they see themselves as gods. The Olympians wereallegedly founded by the British aristocracy in 1727.136[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber135]Walter Rathenau leaked the secret of this group in a statement from 1909: “Threehundred men, all of whom know one another, direct the economic destiny of thecontinent and choose their successors from their area.”137[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber136] In 1921, Rathenau disputed charges ofanti-Semitism by saying these people were business leaders, not Jews.138[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber137] When I asked Bruce how many people within thisthree hundred were visible in the public eye, he said it was only about a third.He also said they are run by a core council of thirty-three, which is probablywhere the “fifteen to twenty-five” figure came from. “The real secret hardlyanyone realizes is that three hundred thirty-three people control the Cabal, andthat number has key symbolic significance for them.” He didn’t need to say thatthree hundred thirty-three was half of six hundred sixty-six, as by that pointit was obvious. As he said so many times, “It doesn’t matter whether you believeit or not. This is their religion and they take it very seriously. Anyone elsewho tries to study this is reading other people’s mail. You’re never going tofully understand what you see in those letters unless you are directly involvedin the conversation. And who would want to be?”PORTALS AND COSMIC EVENTSBob Dean said he wanted to tell me everything he knew. Sadly, I never got thechance to hear his full testimony before he died. However, I did ask him what itwas like to travel through the modern stargate system, where you can beteleported even across far distances instantaneously. He said it was remarkablyadvanced, and the moment itself was quite easy to miss. You would feel somethingakin to a sudden, full-body energetic shock, but it wasn’t painful and lastedonly a split second. One time he was reaching down for a briefcase and didn’teven feel it. Dean disclosed the existence of portal systems in a ProjectCamelot interview from 2010.I was one of [the first insiders] who revealed the information that we have aportal of sorts . . . located at 14 levels below-ground at S4. A NavalLieutenant Commander told me. He said: “I was ordered to put on my summeruniform, pack my bags and get my briefcase.” He was ordered to go to thisfacility, . . . S4, on the other side of the mountain at Papoose Lake. And hesaid: “Why are you asking me to put on a summer uniform when it’s cold as hellhere?” Even in Las Vegas it was cold. And they said: “Just do what you’re told.Put on a summer uniform, pack your bag and show up here.” They took him to S4,[and] went down the elevator to three different levels. He had a red card, ablue card, and a green card. At the bottom of the facility, 14 levels belowground—it’s like taking a 14-story building and burying it—at the bottom he gotthrough the door and there sits a GI. I can’t remember whether he said it wasArmy, Navy, Air Force or what. Doesn’t matter. At that level it doesn’t matter.They said: “Commander, welcome. Come on in.” He walked through this door fromthe elevator, and the kid said, “Welcome to Pine Gap.” . . .And the Commander said: “What the hell are you talking about?”He said: “Sir, you’re in Australia.”Commander said: “No, we’re in Nevada.”And the young man said: “Sir, when you just walked through that door, you’re inAustralia.”139 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber138]EXCITING CHANGES IN OUR FUTUREJacob also told me a similar story. He would travel to off-planet locations in adevice that looked like the inside of a train. You could sit down in the seatsif you wanted to, but almost as soon as you got in and the doors closed, youwould be at your destination and the doors would open again. Jacob revealed thatthe military-industrial complex was involved in elaborate trade with a widevariety of intelligent civilizations and used these portal systems to travelfrom place to place. One of his jobs was “customer relations,” where he wouldvisit various off-world partners to discuss trade agreements. He describedmeeting certain types of ETs that seemed to share a collective consciousness. Inthose cases, each person had a very similar personality, which he felt made themlack character. They saw Earth humans as being quite dynamic and emotional, andreally did not understand us at all.Jacob knew about the Seeker that had come into our solar system in the 1980s. Herevealed that it was intercepted by his people and confronted. The people insidesaid they were peaceful explorers visiting our solar system. Jacob said that inthe eyes of the Cabal, “they were a bunch of dickheads and we told them to pissoff.” Apparently after this event happened, they left peacefully—but hundredsmore Moon-sized objects returned, beginning in the late 1990s. A researchernamed Kent Steadman routinely tracked these planet-sized objects zipping aroundour Sun, using official NASA images from the SOHO space probe. This was anexciting story to follow in my early years on the Internet, and many stunningobjects were spotted between 1998 and 2001. I wrote up a decent summary ofSteadman’s findings, with animated images, on my website as of August 24,2015.140 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber139] Corey Goode later revealed that atleast a hundred more spheres arrived in 2012, and in this case many of them wereas large as the planet Jupiter.Jacob was also well aware that our solar system was moving into a highly chargedenergetic cloud. He said this would create a massive energetic flash from theSun, which would propel us into the next level of human evolution. All the wayback in 2009, he told me, “The event you are expecting to happen in 2012 is morelikely to occur in 2017.” I kept this a secret after he told me, in order to seeif anyone else surfaced who said the same thing. Corey Goode later revealed thathe was repeatedly given the date range of 2018 to 2023 for this same event inhis own training. Jacob also made it clear that within a relatively small numberof years after we go through this shift, people will start developing profoundascended abilities. This will include the ability to dynamically change ourfacial features, like a living tattoo. This was disclosed in the movie TheWatchmen. Peterson reported seeing certain human ETs at Area 51 who couldlevitate a whole group of boxes around themselves and carry on livelyconversations while the boxes stayed perfectly still. Many of the ETs visitingus have developed some of the abilities we will gain once we move through thistransition.When I asked Jacob what the single most wonderful-looking place was that he evervisited, he told me he once went to a planet where everything was made out of aluminous, rainbow-colored crystal material. There was a prevailing purple lighteverywhere. The beauty was staggering, and the feeling of love and peace wasalmost overwhelming. In order to visit a world like this, it is necessary tojump into an “avatar” body, just like what we saw in James Cameron’s movie ofthe same title. This technology is regularly used by people at Jacob’s level inthe space program.THE “SPACE WHALE”Jacob also told me that plans are in place for disclosure to occur. There are avariety of treaties and interactions with various extraterrestrial groups, andmany of them are insisting that the secrecy come to an end. The ET groupspushing for disclosure very likely include the benevolent “Guardians” who aremelting down nuclear warheads, and who portaled out at least twenty-sixunderground bases between August 2011 and January 2012. I have watched manystunning disclosures appear from NASA since the treaty was signed, and we areabout to dive into some of them in the next chapter. However, these articlesappear only in bits and pieces, and hardly anyone puts them into a greatermosaic. In this sense, it seems that the Cabal is doing their best to followtheir orders, without actually giving these news items the publicity they needto become front-page stories.In the spring of 2014, Jacob said his people were aware of an extremely largecreature that swam in the oceans of Titan (a moon of Saturn), akin to a whale ora manatee. One of these creatures would periodically surface in a particularspot, either to breathe or rest. They were going to release pictures of it intothe mainstream media without telling people what it was, but they would givesome compelling hints.I was tremendously surprised to see stories appear about the “magic island” onTitan a couple of months later. On June 22, 2014, Forbes said, “Researchers havespotted an ‘island’ in the middle of [Titan’s] second-largest lake that seems toappear and disappear. . . . Other possibilities proposed by the authors of apaper on the findings published Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience includesunken solids in the lake becoming buoyant thanks to the onset of warmertemperatures, or gases from the sea floor rising to the surface as bubbles.”141[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber140]This story hit the news again on September 30, 2014, thanks to an official NASApress release revealing that it had reappeared:[../image/22_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Mysterious Changing Feature on Saturn’s Moon TitanThe feature’s first sighting was in July 2013, and the radar images depicted abright spot, which stood out from the dark sea. Scientists were “perplexed” whenthe feature couldn’t be located with follow-up radar experiments, but they foundit again on August 21, 2014. Though the scientists aren’t sure what the featureis, NASA reports that they are “confident” the feature is not a “flaw in theirdata.” Some of their current explanations for the feature include “surfacewaves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface,or perhaps something more exotic.” Titan’s hydrocarbon lakes have long been asource of curiosity for scientists who speculate that life may be able tosurvive on the moon’s surface. “But if life exists on Titan, it would be verydifferent than life on Earth, which is intimately tied to liquid water,”Space.com notes.142 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber141]It is entirely possible that this is not a genuine life-form, and is only aninorganic solid that rises and falls in cycles. These stories may bedisinformation, so they can be discredited if a particular plan needs to beabandoned. The overall value of news items like these is in moving thedisclosure narrative forward. Most important, I was told that this story wouldemerge in the media before it actually did. I shared the information withwitnesses in my personal circle before any details emerged in the media. Thiswas very compelling evidence that Jacob was at least in contact with NASA, ifnothing else. Even more important, the writers hinted that the “magic island”might be “something more exotic.” Then we were told that life on Titan would bevery different from life on Earth.Jacob revealed that many different stories are being released into the media foruse in a future disclosure event. The Cabal always has multiple backup plans foreverything. They know there are any number of different ways the whole UFOcover-up could break down. Their goal is to try to control and stage-manage theprocess as much as possible. If they get their way, we will end up with “partialdisclosure,” with the full truth withheld for many years. At the time of thiswriting, almost everyone agrees that a partial disclosure will be simplyimpossible for the Cabal to accomplish. Once the truth starts coming out, itwill quickly become a massive public quest for information. Any researchers andinsiders who were releasing quality data before the cover-up breaks down willbecome far more interesting to the mainstream, everyday world. For many yearsnow, my dreams have been preparing me for an extremely high level of publicityonce this happens. Although it will make my life much more difficult, I alsorespect how urgent it is for our survival that the truth comes out.COREY GOODEAfter Jacob came forward in December 2009, no new insiders with his level ofknowledge appeared for the next five years. This was quite a long time to wait,and was somewhat depressing, since I had expected more people who were in theknow to emerge. After the Snowden disclosures in 2013, there was a majorcrackdown on whistle-blowers, and it seemed even less likely that any newinsiders would show up. That finally changed when Corey Goode opened up to me inOctober 2014, after being friends with me online since 2009. As soon as Coreybegan revealing what he really knew, I was able to validate dozens and dozens ofthings that others had shared with me. Five or ten of these sorts ofcorrelations could possibly be written off as a coincidence. Once it happensfifty or a hundred different times, on very specific classified subjects I hadnever publicized, the only logical conclusion is that each of these people hasparticipated in something very real. After investing my entire adult life in anintense study of these classified programs, it is extremely rewarding to findsomeone who can fill in more of the missing pieces. The story itself is sofantastic, so cosmic and unexpected, that it feels as if a full disclosure eventwould soon result in ascension—one way or the other.It didn’t take long to find out that Corey was telling me many things that wereconsidered off-limits, and that Jacob was not authorized to reveal. As anexample, I had never fully understood that the Cabal’s main function in thebreakaway civilization they have created is in manufacturing and sellingextremely advanced technology. As astonishing as this may sound, Coreyeventually discovered our military-industrial complex is engaged in regularcommerce with nine hundred different civilizations. Money is not used in thesedeals. Instead, everything is based on trade, which includes the sharing oftrained personnel for consultations. New technologies are consistently beingbrought in, reverse-engineered, and developed.The military defense contractors are manufacturing a huge variety of productsthat will absolutely transform life on Earth as we know it, once they arereleased. We will instantaneously transition into a Star Trek age, withspaceships, teleportation, time travel, anti-gravity, free energy,materializers, and super-advanced healing technologies. The Cabal has beendeliberately withholding this technology from us, and did not want to reveal ituntil they had brought our planet to its knees. They had no intention ofallowing this technology to lead to an era of peace and prosperity. Instead,they wanted to use it as a means of furthering their control. Their planincluded staging a mass, fake “alien invasion” with their own technology, so wewould hand over our sovereignty to an international New World Order they wouldown and control. They telegraphed this move with literally hundreds of differentmovies and television shows about alien invasions. Those plans have beencompletely thwarted by benevolent ETs who want to ensure our ascension is notinterrupted.Corey also had full memories of spending twenty years working out in space, inwhat amounted to a glorified submarine. His particular program was code-namedSolar Warden—the same group that Gary McKinnon learned about when he hacked intothe Pentagon. Corey had a boring job and lived in a military-type facility,having a bunk in a common area with a small cubbyhole for his personalbelongings. His food came from a materializer that would “print” the meal, andhis favorite choice was the pot roast. I had independent confirmation on manytechnical details of this technology from Pete and Jacob, and the DisclosureProject witness Daniel Salter also spoke about it. Pete and Jacob told me thatorganic material is needed to print food. Butter was used in the earlier years.Coconut oil is also very effective. Hemp oil seems to provide the mostconsistent, high-quality results. Pete had printed meals at Area 51 that he saidwere quite delicious. Corey’s meals were nowhere near the same level of qualityas higher-level insiders have access to.YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SHOOT THE RED CROSS WORKERSCorey was threatened repeatedly for telling me all this. I also had deaththreats coming in from multiple sources, urging me to back off or else.Thankfully, there are rules in the universe that prevent you from being torturedor killed as long as you maintain a positive perspective in your thoughts andactions. Jacob was the one who had alerted me to this. The specific wording heused is, “You are not allowed to shoot the Red Cross workers. Those are theRules.”Jacob spoke extensively about the Rules, which are cosmic principles thatprevent negative acts from happening unless they are authorized by the people ofEarth, both individually and collectively. For this same reason, the negativegroups have to tell us who they are and what they are doing. This is oftencalled “hiding out in the open.” One of the most obvious examples of this wouldbe the All-Seeing Eye and pyramid symbol on the dollar bill. They put it outthere but no one ever talks about it. Most people are taught to laugh aboutconspiracy theories and ridicule anyone who is a believer. The Cabal has taughtus to label any proof of their existence as a “conspiracy theory,” therebyrelegating it to an unverifiable and easily discredited idea. However, theminute skeptics run into any real sign of trouble, they are absolutely andcompletely terrified—just as my parents were when they saw people walking intothe unlit house across the street in the middle of the night, without knocking.IMAGINATION AND WILLAs bizarre as this must sound, the Cabal is knowingly practicing black magic ona worldwide level. This is one of the great discoveries we are having to make asdisclosure unfolds, and is deeply upsetting. The Cabal groups are extremely wellaware of the power of our collective consciousness, and they are constantlytrying to use it against us. The two main tools they use to do this areimagination and will.The first stage of this process is to seed our imagination with negativethought-forms, like a nuclear war, an alien invasion, a global economiccollapse, a catastrophic natural disaster, martial law, internment camps, aworldwide viral epidemic, a food shortage, a major riot, et cetera. These areonly some of the more extreme examples. The next stage is to create traumatizingevents that activate the power of our will. Our collective consciousness thencharges the thought-forms with power. Their goal is to cause a critical mass ofcivilians to lose our objectivity and become terrified and furious. In thosemoments, we are ready for war, and we do not care about who lives or who dies.We only want revenge. If enough of us feel this way, and vote with our will todestroy others indiscriminately, we activate the programs they placed in ourimagination. The benevolent ETs who manage our planet are then forced to allowthe Cabal to do what they want.A simple example of this would be gun control. The Cabal plants multiple seedsin our collective imagination, telling us that guns kill people and we need totake all the guns away. Then all the deaths will stop and everyone is safeagain. The next step is to stage an atrocity such as a mass shooting, andimmediately repeat the same programmed phrases that they seeded our minds withwhile things were peaceful. If enough people cry out, “Take all the guns away sothis will never, ever happen again,” then the Cabal has effectively disarmed thepublic and removed any threat to their power. Black-market guns become a boomingbusiness and armed criminals roam the streets, fearing no one except othercriminals or fairly nonexistent police in the inner cities. Furthermore, if theCabal can take away most people’s guns, it becomes much easier for them tocompletely conquer a nation, as no one has the means to oppose them. Gun controlis a key element of every fascist takeover in modern history. In a 2007 articlein the Guardian, Naomi Wolf spells out the ten steps to fascism that she laidout in her book The End of America.If you look at history, you can see that there is essentially a blueprint forturning an open society into a dictatorship. That blueprint has been used againand again in more and less bloody, more and less terrifying ways. But it isalways effective. It is very difficult and arduous to create and sustain ademocracy—but history shows that closing one down is much simpler. You simplyhave to be willing to take the 10 steps. As difficult as this is to contemplate,it is clear, if you are willing to look, that each of these 10 steps has alreadybeen initiated today in the United States by the Bush administration.143[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber142]The game of the “negative elite” involves turning us against one another,through an endless series of staged events, lies, and manipulations. They wantto pit race against race, nation against nation, religion against religion, oldagainst young, parents against children, haves against have-nots, city againstcountry, bosses against workers, teachers against students, military andgovernment against civilians, and gender against gender. They love to see hateblossom in online forums, and in fact actively finance countless thousands ofpeople to spread it. Under the apparent cloak of anonymity, people can easilylose their humanity and be unaware that they are still fully accountable for alltheir words and actions in the greater spiritual sense.THIS IS A SPIRITUAL WARThe Cabal is very well aware that this is a spiritual war. In my key ascensiondream from high school, the only way I could defeat the government official inthe underground base was to “create myself,” and become a fully activatedspiritual being. A key part of the Cabal game is to keep us completely ignorantabout the fact that we have souls, that there is life after death, that wereincarnate, and that our consciousness has far more power to create realitythan we normally recognize. Dreams are treated as brain garbage. ESP isconsidered a superstitious myth. Religions are the opiate of the people.Extraterrestrials either do not exist or are highly evil. There is no higherpower in the universe looking out for our well-being. Ascension is so ridiculousas to be a pathetic joke, where fundamentalist Christians soar up into the airlike kites. This is precisely why I wrote The Source Field Investigations andThe Synchronicity Key—to provide voluminous, irrefutable scientific proof ofthese concepts. The media actively encourages us to laugh at anyone who believesin a higher power. Paid skeptics arrogantly bash anyone who refuses to acceptthe official propaganda they are being fed.People who take a public stand against these groups are invariably going to betargeted with the best defenses the Cabal has to offer. The negative groups willwork very hard to corrupt these heroes and lead them into various temptations.The Cabal has a variety of technologies that help them do this, includingsomething called the “Voice of God,” which can introduce thoughts and attempt tonudge you to go against your own spiritual principles. If they can sufficientlyinfluence you to violate your own morals and ethics, they may get properauthorization to damage, nullify, or eliminate you as a target. One of the bestways to do this is through sexual temptation. Lecturing on UFOs, spirituality,and consciousness-raising subjects creates interactions with fans that are thesame as what I witnessed happening to rock stars when I was a child. If a publicfigure can be tricked into taking advantage of people sexually, such as throughexploring their options without commitment, the heartbreak this creates can beenough to authorize major attacks against them.Any type of corruption, such as the control and manipulation of others, canbring down a public figure. Going against your own message in your seeminglyprivate life, such as by ripping people off or other consciously unloving acts,is another sure-fire way to invite serious damage. I have had to live my lifewith the precision and discipline of an Olympic spiritual athlete in order toavoid being killed or seriously damaged in this quest to reveal the AscensionMysteries. Even after consciously being aware of the game and practicing thedisciplines for twenty years to the best of my ability, I still constantly makemistakes. This causes a variety of upsetting and disruptive events to occur on aroutine, everyday basis. I do my best to maintain a positive attitude in theface of any and all adversities. It would be almost impossible to throw a newbieinto the type of lifestyle I have to lead in order to stay alive, and expectthat person to be able to handle it appropriately. The testing requires everyounce of strength I possess. New challenges constantly appear, and the only wayto make them stop would be to abandon the quest.The Cabal and other such negative groups believe our commonly held spiritualprinciples are ridiculous and disgusting. They believe we all have a corrupt,manipulative, and evil “human nature,” and the real lesson in the universe is tokill or be killed. Only the strong survive. They are aware that a higher poweris enforcing spiritual rules, such as through karma, but they believe this is acorrupt, aggressive, and insane god who only wishes to suppress our freedom. Thesad part is that these same Cabal groups infiltrated the major religions andintroduced the distortions that they then fight against. This is another exampleof “playing both sides against the middle.” Then they blame these problems onthe original teachers the religions were based on, and accuse them of beingcorrupt, wicked demons.If you are aware of the game and do your very best to be a humble, honest,virtuous, and loving person, you will not “authorize” the most damaging events.However, very few people have enough spiritual development to avoid unexpectedand unpredictable disruptions. In my own case, these events have been so extremeand ongoing that life feels like an incredibly complex and crazy movie.Significant amounts of damage can be done through identifying your core traumasand mobilizing people and situations that compel you to repeat them.Furthermore, even if you maintain the highest positivity possible, and areexcellent at maintaining boundaries in your personal life, you will be subjectto incredibly intense harassment and slander online if you fight for the truth.Nonetheless, if you take on the honor and duty of helping others at thiscritical time, that service may well be the “tipping point” that authorizes yourascension. You may go through a few bumps in the road, but before long you couldbe hovering right over them.FULL DISCLOSURECorey began telling me everything he knew in October 2014, and by February 2015I had written down the majority of his testimony in a 150-page, single-spacedtypewritten document. Almost immediately thereafter, he got pulled back into thesecret space program for the first time since 1989, other than a few briefmeetings with them in the interim. He was introduced to a man we are now callingLieutenant Colonel Gonzales, who is part of an alliance that has developedwithin the secret space program, or SSP. The people in the SSP Alliance do notlike what the Cabal is doing and are pushing for full disclosure—including acomplete release of all forbidden technologies. We are told that massive datadumps have already been prepared that will leave no doubt to the truth once theyare released. I have done my best to provide a rudimentary overview of theinformation these data dumps will contain in this book, with names andreferences you can use to advance your own research. The Cabal is fighting likemad to prevent the release of this knowledge, including threatening the use of aworldwide Internet kill switch and planet-killing acts they would never beauthorized to complete.Despite the danger we faced, I trusted in the Rules and ended up interviewingCorey in over a year’s worth of episodes of our show Cosmic Disclosure on theGaia network. This is an online streaming video service that requires a monthlysubscription fee.144 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber143] Almost the entire show isCorey answering my brief questions that are based on twenty-three years ofgathering insider testimony and doing the research to back it up. We havegenerated more than enough material to fill a half hour per week for over a yearat the time of this writing. I have also done my best to back up Corey’stestimony with proof in Wisdom Teachings, my other weekly show. Peopleconsistently remark at how matter-of-fact and businesslike Corey is witheverything he says. He gives no indication of lying, and no matter what questionI ask him, he has answers that are surprisingly more complex than you wouldexpect.According to Corey, Hoagland’s top insider Bruce is working in what we will callthe military space program. This group is deliberately kept in the dark aboutmuch of the deeper information regarding the Secret Space Program, such as whatwe reviewed in the testimonies of Henry Deacon, Pete Peterson, and Jacob. Themilitary group is told we have never traveled outside our own solar system. Theybelieve all the craft in our airspace belong to various classified programscontrolled by humans on Earth, and there are no ETs around us in any recenthistory. The military space program was apparently created many years ago as atool for “partial disclosure.” The hope was that if the UFO cover-up everstarted to fall apart, as it is now doing, these insiders could be broughtforward. All they have known, all their lives, is a certain subset of classifiedinformation. They believe they have everything there is to know, and will fightvigorously with any insider who tries to tell them there is more.I respect Bruce and consider him a friend. I understand that he probably willnot believe what Henry Deacon, Jacob, Bob Dean, Pete Peterson, Corey Goode,William Tompkins, and others have said. My goal here is simply to present youwith the things I have heard from various insiders, and the connections I havefound that link their testimonies together, and let you make up your own mind.Either way, the story that Bruce and others in the military space program havebeen given is still extremely vast in scope and highly interesting. Even thepartial disclosure that was planned to occur would tremendously change life onEarth as we know it, particularly if it came from an official level. In the veryfinal stages of writing this book, Bruce gave me many more details of what hehad heard, revealing the full scope of the battle that has taken place in ourlocal area of the galaxy. I then took this information back to Corey and gaineda magnificent body of new data that had never made it into our show. In manycases, you have to ask the right questions to trigger people’s memories andobtain the best information.What you are about to read is a brief reconstruction of the hidden history ofour solar system, based on combining what Bruce, Corey, and other sources havenow revealed. The full data dumps have incredibly voluminous details about thisstory that will require years of dedicated effort for even our finest scientificminds to sort through. In future books, lectures, and films I will undoubtedlygo into more details about what I have heard, and the data that supports it,than I can cover in this volume. Our cosmic drama is far more ancient, bizarre,and epic than most people would ever imagine could be possible. It also revealsa cosmic battle between good and evil that has been going on for the last500,000 years. Our story continues with a group that Pete, Bruce, Corey, andother insiders call the Ancient Builder Race."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYTHE ANCIENT BUILDER RACEIn the introduction, we reviewed new scientific proof from NASA that there arecountless Earth-like planets all throughout the universe. On November 4, 2013, aNASA scientist who helped make this remarkable discovery shared the news withUSA Today. “‘Planets like our Earth are relatively common throughout the MilkyWay galaxy,’ said astronomer Andrew Howard of the University of Hawaii, whoestimates the number at about 40 billion.”145 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber144]If NASA is now openly telling us there are 40 billion habitable worlds just inour galaxy alone, that makes it very likely that “we’ve got company.”146[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber145]CONVERGENT EVOLUTIONThe leading Cambridge evolution expert Professor Simon Conway Morris released abook on July 2, 2015, entitled The Runes of Evolution. In it, he makes acompelling argument that evolution is convergent, meaning it keeps following thesame patterns wherever possible. Just like with transparent aluminum, there arecertain ways to do things that are always going to work the best. The mostcommon example is to compare the lens on a camera, the lens in the eye of anoctopus, and the lens in the eye of a human being. All involve very similarsystems.Professor Morris argues in his book that nature does this convergenceconstantly. “Evolution is becoming much more predictable than people thought,”he told the Independent. “. . . Evolutionary convergence is completelyubiquitous. Wherever you look you see it. . . . The things which we regard asmost important, i.e., cognitive sophistication, large brains, intelligence,toolmaking, are also convergent. Therefore, in principle, other Earth-likeplanets should very much end up with the same sort of arrangement.” The title ofthe article is more direct, proclaiming that extraterrestrials “Will Look LikeHumans, Says Cambridge University Evolution Expert.”Professor Morris goes on to predict that we will find evidence of human beingswho are vastly more ancient than we are—even by billions of years. “The numberof Earth-like planets is absolutely gigantic now. More problematic is that manyof these solar systems far, far pre-date our solar system. They would have, inprinciple, a major head start of hundreds of millions, if not billions, ofyears.”147 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber146] People who are this far advancedwould have moved so far beyond our current level of technology that we canbarely even conceive of what they might have built.A STAR SURROUNDED BY MEGASTRUCTURESIn October 2015, NASA announced its discovery of a star that was possiblysurrounded by “megastructures” of extraterrestrial technology. According to anarticle in The Atlantic, “‘We’d never seen anything like this star,’ saysTabetha Boyajian, a postdoc at Yale. ‘It was really weird. We thought it mightbe bad data or movement on the spacecraft, but everything checked out.’ . . .The light pattern suggests there is a big mess of matter circling the star, intight formation. . . . Jason Wright, an astronomer from Penn StateUniversity, . . . and his co-authors say the unusual star’s light pattern isconsistent with a ‘swarm of megastructures,’ perhaps stellar-light collectors,technology designed to catch energy from the star. ‘When [Boyajian] showed methe data, I was fascinated by how crazy it looked,’ Wright told me. ‘Aliensshould always be the very last hypothesis you consider, but this looked likesomething you would expect an alien civilization to build.’”148[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber147]Jacob and Pete both told me this announcement was another move towarddisclosure. Jacob said they are aware of three other stars with similarstructures, and they are “holding on to these stories for a rainy day.” He alsotold me that he had portaled over to this system and witnessed it with his owneyes. It was incredibly beautiful and majestic. Three months later, in January2016, a surprising new twist to the story appeared on Physics-Astronomy.com.Over four years of observational data, KIC 8462852 flickered completelyunpredictably, its light yield occasionally falling by as much as 20%. . . .Astronomer Jason Wright presented the notion that the star’s strange distortionmight be the outcome of a giant alien construction project. . . . AstronomerBradley Schaefer of Louisiana State University decided to study the photographicplates of the sky dating back to the late 19th century. To hisastonishment, . . . over the last hundred years, KIC 8462852’s light output hasgradually faded by roughly 19%, something that’s “totally extraordinary for anyF-type main sequence star.Bruce told me that advanced societies use nano-robots or “nanites” for buildingprojects. He said, “Within fifty years, no one will build anything by handanymore.” The nanites assemble themselves into larger machines of all differentsizes to achieve the desired result. The speed at which these constructionprojects can move forward is truly incredible, particularly if they are in anarea that is rich in energy and the appropriate raw materials. Thus, what we areseeing at KIC 8462852 is a civilization that has managed to build an incrediblylarge structure around a star, apparently to harness its power, in only ahundred years.PRIZED REAL ESTATEAs a child I played a variety of board games with my parents, such as Clue,Scrabble, Parcheesi, and Yahtzee, but by far the most popular example in ourculture is Monopoly. Your goal is to completely absorb everyone else’s cash bybuilding houses and hotels at various locations on the board. The first personto land on a space can claim ownership of it, and begin building structuresthere if they have the resources. At the end of the road there are blue spaces,where you can charge your competitors the highest prices to stay there.Boardwalk sits between “Go” and “Luxury Tax,” and is the most expensive spot.Your competitors have to pay you $2,000 if you build a hotel there because it issuch a nice area. Most Monopoly games end after one player sufficiently buildsout the blue zone.Could there be “blue zones” within our own galaxy? If we have an estimated 40billion Earths, and evolution naturally produces human beings, there are lots ofpeople out there. Do some star systems sit closer to prized real estate? Whatmight make some areas more desirable than others? The answer, as it turns out,is portals—natural stargates in the cosmic web of plasma filaments.There are certain areas of space where portals naturally open up when thealignments are right. Advanced civilizations park their ships next to theseportals and wait for the doors to open. There are plenty of portals that allowyou to zip around in our galaxy, so that’s nothing special. However, there areonly a few places where you can catch a ride into other galaxies. You can spotthese areas by looking for huge plasma filaments that rise up out of our galaxyand extend off into space. Long periods of time may go by before these portalsopen. Instead of just sitting around in a boring old ship, most people are goingto want to check themselves into a nice hotel while they wait.THE LOCAL CLUSTERCorey Goode wasn’t the first insider to tell me that we live in a galactic bluezone, but he was the first one to explain why. Our Sun is in a group of starsthat Corey’s people call the “Local Cluster,” and which NASA officially callsthe Local Interstellar Neighborhood. These stars all move and behave as if theyare connected to one another, almost like a school of fish. Energetic pulsesripple and spread throughout the entire group. Their orbits all interact inunusual ways that normal, local gravity shouldn’t produce. Other stars outsideof our Local Cluster are nowhere near as interconnected.According to Corey’s intel, the stars in our Local Cluster are all beinggravitationally and energetically influenced by a huge portal that takes youdirectly out to neighboring galaxies. Our Local Cluster is in a very highlydesirable blue zone as a result. Everyone wants to settle here—the good, thebad, and the ugly. If they can build the cosmic equivalent of hotels, they canform a monopoly and charge a premium price. Imagine a city that charges a hugetoll for a bridge or expressway that everyone wants to use. You don’tnecessarily need it to travel, but you might add hours to your trip if you gothe long way around.Most surprising, our own Sun sits right next to the galactic stargate. We arecloser to the entrance than any other star in the cluster. That big, beautifulportal is sitting just outside the boundaries of our solar system. This means weare already living at the equivalent of Boardwalk in our galaxy. Everyone wantsto build hotels here. The portal has been around for billions of years, so thedemand for real estate in our area is nothing new. Wars would be fought oversuch a valuable area, just like we have seen in the Middle Eastern oil-producingnations. The portal could also be used for an invasion from other galaxies.Corey had mentioned this in our conversations before, and we even discussed iton Cosmic Disclosure, but until I was finishing this book, I never tried toresearch it with conventional data. As soon as I did, I was very impressed. NASAhas already told us more than enough to validate Corey’s testimony.First of all, we have Richard W. Pogge, an astronomy professor at the Ohio StateUniversity, who lays out some details of our local area in a course syllabus heposted online. In his version, we have a total of thirty-eight star systems inour cluster, which he marks as having a radius of fifteen light-years around ourSun, for a total width of thirty light-years.149[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber148] Corey said that the Local Cluster theydiscussed in the space program was definitely bigger than thirty light-yearsacross. Part of the problem is that official NASA sources do not necessarilyagree on the size of our Local Cluster.[../image/23_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Solar Interstellar NeighborhoodOn March 3, 2011, Andrew Z. Colvin created an attractive graphic of our LocalInterstellar Neighborhood that is probably closer to the area that Corey wasdescribing. The larger stars in the cluster have familiar names, like Sirius,Arcturus, and Alpha Centauri, but many of the smaller ones havetechnical-sounding names like HD 113538 because they were discovered morerecently.THE SOLAR CYLINDERWhen we look at Colvin’s map, we can clearly see that our Sun is right in themiddle of the stellar neighborhood. This is not the result of deliberatelyputting our Sun in the center and mapping out the closest stars nearby. NASAsources confirm that we are in the center of a vast tube of plasma called theSolar Cylinder. According to the Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, “The Solarneighborhood is the space associated with a cylinder [that is] centered at theSun and perpendicular to the Milky Way disk. This Solar Cylinder is located at~8 kpc from the Galactic center, with a radius of 1 kpc.”150[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber149]When we hear that this cylinder is perpendicular to the Milky Way disk, that isa very important detail. A perpendicular angle is ninety degrees. If you have aflat dinner plate on the table and you put a soda can on it, you now have acylinder that is rising up from the plate at a perpendicular angle. This is asimple way to visualize the portal Corey was talking about. As the quote justsaid, this cylinder is “centered at the sun.” We are directly in the middle ofthis massive column of energy.THE LOCAL CHIMNEYThe proof gets even better when we study a University of California, Berkeley,press release from May 29, 2003, summarizing five years of painstaking research.In this announcement, we again hear that our Sun is in the center of a bubble ofhot gas.BERKELEY—The first detailed map of space within about 1,000 light years of Earthplaces the solar system in the middle of a large hole that pierces the plane ofthe galaxy . . . and is surrounded by a solid wall of colder, denser gas.151[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber150]The article goes on to say that our solar system is in the middle of a hugehole, and there are a variety of tunnels that branch off from it, moving throughthe surrounding wall of thick gas. Every high-level insider I have spoken to hassaid that these plasma gas tunnels are traversable wormholes. We are located inthe sweet spot, right in the middle. That’s where the magic happens. As wecontinue reading from this Berkeley press release, we discover that a massiveplasma tube extends out of our galaxy, and is anchored in our localneighborhood. UC Berkeley astronomer Barry Welsh said we might want to call thisthe Local Chimney.“When we started mapping gas in the galaxy, we found . . . that we are in abubble-shaped cavity perhaps filled with hot, ionized gas,” Welsh said. “But theLocal Bubble is shaped more like a tube and should be called the LocalChimney.” . . . “This thin shell of dense gas surrounding the local void isbroken in many places,” said Dr. Francoise Crifo, an astronomer at the ParisObservatory. “In several directions in the galaxy, our local cavity seems to belinked with other similar empty regions by pathways or tunnels in theinterstellar medium.” The existence of a network of tunnels of hot gas thatthread interstellar space was first suggested nearly 30 years ago by Don Cox andBarry Smith of the University of Wisconsin.152 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber151]What exactly was Dr. Barry Welsh talking about when he said our Sun is at thecenter of a tube that should be called the Local Chimney? We know that ourgalaxy is surrounded by a spherical area of gas called the galactic halo. OurSun is directly in the middle of a plasma tube that rises all the way up to theedge of the halo. According to Corey’s insiders, this tube continues on out toother galaxies from there, and can be safely used for portal travel when thealignments are right. Let’s now continue with our Berkeley excerpt.The new results also show that the local void of gas extends out of the galacticdisk and stretches into the overlying galactic halo region. . . . [This] appearsas a tube-like “chimney” that links the gas in the galactic disk with that ofthe halo. Galactic chimneys have been widely observed in othergalaxies. . . .153 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber152][../image/24_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Our Sun Is in the Center of a Tubelike “Chimney” of Plasma that Extends Up intothe Galactic HaloLet’s now think back to what we heard from Bob Dean, Pete Peterson, the Apolloastronaut Edgar Mitchell, and Robert Hastings, who interviewed 150 differentinsiders claiming to have witnessed UFOs powering down nuclear missiles. Thereare laws in the universe that prevent negative forces from being able to invadeand destroy civilizations wherever they want. A sufficiently advanced culturecould develop enough technology to protect an entire solar system, or even anentire star cluster. Otherwise, in an area as desirable as ours, villains wouldbe constantly competing with one another in a ruthless game of Monopoly. Entirecivilizations, with many billions of people, could be wiped out in the quest tobuild the ultimate hotel, and charge the highest prices to stay there. At thevery end of writing this book, I learned how this applies to our own solarsystem. The clues were in place ever since I first met Bruce.THE COSMIC JUNKYARDCorey said the Department of Defense has produced twelve different briefingdocuments concerning the history of our solar system. They are highly detailedand extremely classified. From our very first meeting, Bruce revealed some ofwhat these briefings contain, by telling me that “we live in a cosmic junkyard.”When I asked him to clarify what he meant, he said extremely ancient ruins ofadvanced technology are scattered all throughout our solar system. Jacobconfirmed that we have so much ancient technology in our solar system that mostof it has been completely ignored. In other cases, precious artifacts have beencarelessly bulldozed and buried into pits to prevent them from being discoveredand exploited, such as by various ET groups. There are only so many things thatcan be invented and perfected, and the same innovations keep reappearingthroughout time and space.THE MOON BUILDERS WERE NOT THE FIRSTThe people who built the towers and domes on the Moon were not the first todevelop this technology. They were building replicas of artifacts they had foundthat were much, much older—and made out of the same material. Ancient obelisks,pyramids, and domes appear on the solid planets as well as a majority of themoons and asteroids throughout our solar system. This is the greatest secret ofthe military space program. We were given the building blocks for an eventualdisclosure of this information with the movie 2001. The title of the movie maywell have been the year they had originally intended to reveal thisinformation—but the plans are constantly changing as events take place. PetePeterson told me there has been a partial disclosure plan in the works for manyyears, which involves revealing these Ancient Builder Race artifacts to theworld at what the Cabal feels to be the most useful moment.The glass-like substance can be clear, opaque, or black, just like the monolithin 2001. The pigment depends upon the additives that are used in themanufacturing process. The ruins are heavily eroded from countless eons ofmeteorite hits, and in some cases they have completely fallen over or beensmashed and twisted through wars or natural damage. The people in the militaryspace program are well aware of these ruins and may get to tour some of them,much like theme parks. Bruce’s intel suggests that at least three and as many asten different civilizations have built artifacts like these at various times inour history.The oldest ruins were built by what they call the Ancient Builder Race. TheCabal refers to them as the Progenitors, and believe that they are the directdescendants of these people—which appears to be unlikely, given what otherinsiders have said. Bruce’s intel was that the original Ancient Builder Raceruins were at least 5 million years old, and more likely hundreds of millions ofyears old. Corey’s information is that these ruins are at least hundreds ofmillions of years old, and very likely go back billions of years. Right as I wasfinishing this book, I decided to ask Corey if we had visited any nearby starsystems and looked for artifacts. This was when I heard about the Local Cluster.Then I found out that Ancient Builder Race ruins appear on planets allthroughout the Local Cluster. Corey also revealed that a grid of protection wasbuilt around our Local Cluster to keep the power-hungry villains out.THE GUARDIANS AND ASCENSIONAfter scrutinizing all the available evidence, I have since come to theconclusion that the Ancient Builder Race was extremely positive. Other groupscame in later that were extremely negative after the grid came down, which wewill discuss later. It appears that even though the builders left our solarsystem for a period of time, they have since returned to help us out. They verylikely incurred karmic debt after a major disaster occurred in our solar system,which collapsed the entire grid. The Ancient Builders appear to be the samegroup as the Guardians, which is a term Corey Goode’s contacts have assigned tothe group of highly advanced beings who are preventing the Cabal from destroyingour planet. This group lives in “sixth density,” a significantly higher plane ofexistence than our own third density. The ascension so many of us are lookingforward to is a transition from third density to fourth. That may not sound likemuch, but it will be a massive shift that gives us incredible new abilities. Wewill apparently go through a quantum leap that changes the nature of space,time, matter, energy, consciousness, and biological life almost instantaneously.Once you get through seventh density, you fully reunify with the Oneness—andseventh-density beings only interact with sixth before they finish their work.Therefore, the Guardians are the highest-level beings any given planet willinteract with. According to the Law of One series, a group of 106question-and-answer sessions between a PhD physicist and an allegedsixth-density extraterrestrial intelligence, the primary job of Guardians suchas themselves is “the management and transfer of planetary populations.” Thatone statement alone is fruit for extensive meditation and analysis, particularlyin light of the insider information that is now available.The Guardians, who prevent nuclear war and promote our spiritual evolution andascension, presented a detailed summary of their science and philosophy in theLaw of One series. The Cabal definitely does not like the Guardians, and if theRules allowed them to wipe them out, they would do it in a heartbeat.Nonetheless, beings at this level of evolution cannot be threatened by anythingthe Cabal could ever muster. Their main concern is in helping us become moreloving, forgiving, and accepting of ourselves and others. They see that theCabal has a role to fulfill in mirroring our collective shadow back to us, andproviding a vehicle for karma to be purified. Nonetheless, there comes a timewhen the services of groups like this are no longer necessary—and we are almostthere now. This is a cyclical process, which was extensively discussed in TheSynchronicity Key.My previous two books focused on fleshing out the Law of One scientific modelwith many hundreds of little-known peer-reviewed studies. The overall model isso incredibly robust and data rich that I deliberately avoided discussing theLaw of One series in any detail until the appendix at the very end of The SourceField Investigations. When I first started reading this material in 1996, Iwould often spend forty-five minutes without turning the page, going throughdeep concentration in an attempt to understand what was being said—and tointegrate it with the knowledge I had already gathered from more than threehundred different books. I was consistently being guided through dreams andsynchronicity to find the right information at the right times, and when the Lawof One appeared on my path, everything fit together.THE LOCAL CLUSTER AND THE CONFEDERATIONIn this chapter we have discussed how the Local Cluster is being held togetherand influenced by a massive stargate, which can carry you to other galaxies atincredible rates of speed. As soon as Corey told me there were Ancient BuilderRace ruins scattered throughout the Local Cluster, and that a protective gridhad been established around the entire area, I saw connections to the Law of Oneseries. Specifically, the Law of One source indicated that they were only one offifty-three different civilizations who were working together in our local areato help developing worlds.I am one of the members of the Confederation of Planets in the Service of theInfinite Creator. There are approximately fifty-three civilizations, comprisingapproximately five hundred planetary consciousness complexes in thisConfederation. This Confederation contains those from your own planet who haveattained dimensions beyond your third. It contains planetary entities withinyour solar system, and it contains planetary entities from other galaxies. It isa true Confederation in that its members are not alike, but allied in serviceaccording to the Law of One.154 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber153]One thing we immediately have to clarify is that the Law of One refers to eachindividual system of stars and planets as a “galaxy.” I went into a detailedanalysis of this in The Synchronicity Key. A single star will give birth toplanets, which can eventually become new stars after going through the gas giantphase. As this process keeps repeating, a galaxy can be formed. Therefore, weare told that the Confederation is spread out across five hundred planets in ourlocal “portion of the Creation”—i.e., our Local Cluster. Our solar localneighborhood could easily have five hundred habitable worlds in it, given thenumber of stars in the area. If there are only fifty-three civilizationsstretched across these five hundred worlds, that means some of these culturesare so advanced that they simultaneously live on multiple worlds and remain inconstant contact with one another.THE STRIKING OF THE HOURThe science in the Law of One series gives us every reason to believe thatascension is in our near future. The Law of One series confirmed the existenceand function of the 25,000-year cycle, and said that all third-density worlds gothrough it. Each 25,000-year cycle ends with an opportunity for ascension. InSession 9, Question 4, they tell us, “Each of your planetary entities is on adifferent cyclical schedule, as you might call it. The timing of these cycles isa measurement equal to a portion of intelligent energy. This intelligent energyoffers a type of clock. The cycles move as precisely as a clock strikes yourhour. Thus, the gateway from intelligent energy to intelligent infinity opensregardless of circumstance on the striking of the hour.”155[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber154]The clocklike precision of these cycles is thoroughly documented in TheSynchronicity Key. We discover that history repeats itself with remarkableprecision. One prominent example is in the Ages of the Zodiac. Each Age is 2,160years in length, and all twelve ages add up to the “major cycle” of 25,920years. Major events that occur in one Age of the Zodiac end up repeating exactly2,160 years later. This includes all the most significant wars and politicalevents of the twentieth century. Roman history reappears as American history,and even key political figures reincarnate, looking almost identical to who theyhad been before. The most striking example of this is Hannibal, who looksprecisely like Hitler with a beard. Hitler fought very similar wars with verysimilar battle strategies at almost exactly the same times as Hannibal did inthe previous cycle. This appears to be a multi-incarnational form of “repetitioncompulsion.”[../image/25_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Hannibal and Hitler, Following Very Similar Paths 2,160 Years ApartThe Synchronicity Key addresses this fantastic mystery in great detail,particularly in the second half. The amount of proof is so extensive that it isridiculous to deny what is happening. Some people criticized this work and askedwhy only the elite were reincarnating in this way. If you read the bookcarefully, I clearly state that I believe all of us are going through thesecycles. Public figures are easier to identify because we have surviving statues,carvings, paintings, photographs, and other images of them. The “rules” ofreincarnation include the fact that there will always be similarities in facialfeatures, personality, and character. Cycle after cycle, we continue working onourselves, and hopefully we alleviate the karma we have built up and become moreloving, forgiving, and accepting of ourselves and others. The phenomenon thatDr. Sigmund Freud and others call “repetition compulsion” is actually aspiritual impulse to repeat the unhealed trauma we have caused ourselves andothers, also known as karma, until we can release the patterns. The key teachingin the Law of One is “In forgiveness lies the stopping of the wheel of karma.”However, this is still only a part of the discussion. We can thoroughly provethat history is repeating itself, but now we see that at the end of the entirecycle, there is a huge flash of light and energy that transforms reality as weknow it. The “wheel of karma” now stops on a planetary level. When we go back tothe Law of One quote we just read, it said that we contact “intelligentinfinity” as the cycle ends. This is the pure, white light of the One InfiniteCreator, in Law of One terms. Time and space dissolve into pure bliss as we gothrough this state. This appears to be the light people see in a near-deathexperience, which they call “Home.” Intelligent infinity also appears to be theconsciousness that various travelers achieved in the Montauk experiments. Theyhit an energetic “wall” at the end of 2012, and experienced the “Full Out,”during which they went into indescribable bliss and felt as if they had mergedwith the entire galaxy.Another Law of One quote reveals that the all-important “striking of the hour”will occur approximately thirty years after 1981. This gives us a solidtime-coordinate that lines up beautifully with the Mayan calendar end-date ofDecember 21, 2012. The 2012 date appeared to still be valid as of 1983, when theLaw of One series and the Montauk Project both ended. However, in the ensuingyears the date apparently got pushed forward to somewhere between 2017 and 2023,since we were not ready for this to happen yet as a planet. Still, we would bewell advised to live every day of our lives as if ascension could happen at anytime, and do our best to practice the principles of love, acceptance, andforgiveness that are required. The Law of One specifically states that you needonly to be slightly over 50 percent positive, or “service to others,” as opposedto negative, or “service to self,” in order to make it. To put this in a simplerway, their basic message is “Just be nice.”The historical data about our solar system in the Law of One has remarkable,almost one-to-one correlations with what the insiders tell us. Certain insiderdetails have revealed new information that Dr. Don Elkins, the questioner in theLaw of One series, never thought to ask about. Although a fair number ofaccurate contacts have occurred in our recent history, including the Edgar Caycereadings, no other intuitively derived source even comes close to having thismuch verifiable information. I first read the Law of One series in 1996, andevery real insider I met has independently validated dozens of specific detailsin the books. In almost every single case, they were completely unaware of theLaw of One series or of how their information was already present within it.Corey was the first to even admit that he had heard about it, but at the time ofthis writing he has only just started reading the introduction to Book One.The Cabal is very well aware of the Law of One, and has made a massive effort todiscredit this material. This includes flooding the Internet with disinformationand making it difficult to find the actual text, which is free online atLawOfOne.info and LlResearch.org. There are ongoing efforts to smear it, to saythat it is evil, and to demonize anyone who supports it. I have been studying itfor twenty years, and I am still being constantly surprised by how much I getout of it. The spiritual principles of love, peace, forgiveness, and service toothers are universal in nature, and some teachers have referred to theseconcepts as ageless wisdom. Thankfully, the cosmic history of our solar systemthat insiders shared with me has filled in many areas in the Law of One’schronology that were never fully explained.THE LAW OF ONE AUTHORS BUILT PYRAMIDSAccording to the Law of One source, their civilization originated on the planetVenus back when it was still in an Earth-like state.156[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber155] In Session 89 of that material, we find outthat this civilization appeared 2.6 billion years ago.157[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber156] This is a perfect match with the time linesour insiders have calculated for the age of the Ancient Builder Race artifacts.In Session 60, Question 16, the Law of One source revealed that their groupbuilt a great number of pyramids in this 2.6-billion-year-old time frame. Theynever indicated whether they did this only on Venus or whether they had spreadthemselves out much farther than that. With the new information we can see thattheir civilization became quite robust. It is very likely that their populationreached numbers vastly in excess of how many people we have on Earth now. Oncethey gained the ability to leave their home planet, they could very easily starttraveling into other neighboring star systems as well. It’s only natural tobuild a nice hotel in a beautiful new area that everyone wants to go and visit.The Guardians felt the pyramid structure could do no wrong. In The Source FieldInvestigations, I have an entire chapter devoted to the scientific proof of theincredible healing power that pyramids provide. Not only do they greatly reducedisease conditions and ill health, they significantly enrich and stabilize thenatural environment. This includes protecting the people from earthquakes,volcanic eruptions, and severe weather. This also includes purifying water anddramatically enhancing the productivity of crops. Furthermore, in an esotericsense the pyramid is a chamber of ascension. The reason we see an opensarcophagus in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid is that it was meant tohelp people ascend. A trained healer would stand beside the sarcophagus with acrystal, probably a diamond, and guide you through an elaborate dark night ofthe soul during which you would face off against all your unhealed demons andrepetition compulsions. If you do the work and purify yourself of your flaws,you can ascend any time you choose, and do not need to wait until the end of the25,000-year cycle.The Guardians hoped that if they came back and helped build pyramids here onEarth, we would enjoy the same positive benefits that they did. Unfortunately,they underestimated the power of the evil forces that had taken control of ourplanet. The Cabal is only the human face of a much greater problem. The insidershave revealed that the Cabal groups are the direct descendants of an empire thatdestroyed an entire planet in our solar system 500,000 years ago. The Guardianshoped that they would be able to heal the damage by giving us the Great Pyramid,but the negative forces are masters of infiltration. They can co-opt symbols andteachings that were positively intended and contort them into the negative. TheGuardians admit that they were so blissed out in the sixth-density level thatthey greatly underestimated how powerful the dark side could be. This nextstatement is one of their key apologies for how badly their positive intentionswere corrupted.It is our honor/duty to attempt to remove the distortions that the use of this[pyramid] shape has caused in the thinking of your peoples and in the activitiesof some of your entities [i.e., the Cabal]. . . . When we were aided bysixth-density entities during our own third-density experiences we, being lessbellicose in the extreme, found this teaching [of the pyramid] to be of help. Inour naïveté in third density we had not developed the interrelationships of yourbarter or money system and power. We spent a much larger portion of ourspace/time working with the unmanifested being. In this less complex atmosphereit was quite instructive to have this learn/teaching device and we benefitedwithout the distortions we found occurring among your peoples. We have recordedthese differences meticulously in the Great Record of Creation that such naïvetéshall not be necessary again.158 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber157]The Law of One series is often very understated, and you have to read carefullyto capture the full meaning. When the source says, “It was quite instructive tohave this learn/teaching device,” they are really saying that they built anincredible number of pyramids as their civilization boomed. They ultimatelytried to help us in the same way, only to have highly negative forces corrupttheir message and contort it into the negativity we see today. I spent two yearsliving with the woman who spoke the words of the Law of One series while she wasin an unconscious trance state. Neither of us had any idea that an AncientBuilder Race had constructed pyramids all throughout our solar system at thetime.If you’d like to read more about the Law of One series, I recommend reading TheSource Field Investigations, which presents many of its scientific models, andThe Synchronicity Key, which explores the mysteries of the 25,000-year cycle infar greater detail. For now, we will continue with the remarkable insider data Ihave gathered on the Ancient Builder Race."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEINSIDER DATA ON THE BUILDERSThe Earth formed 4 billion years ago, and cooled down enough for liquid water toappear 3.8 billion years ago. Microbial life showed up almost immediately afterthe water appeared, which is impossible to explain by Charles Darwin’s theory ofrandom mutation. At the core of every cell, ribosomes access the DNA codes anduse these instructions to create proteins, which build all forms of livingtissue. In 2014, Dr. Loren Williams, a professor at the Georgia Institute ofTechnology, proved that all life on Earth shares the same original ribosome atits core. He said, “At its core the ribosome is the same everywhere. Theribosome is universal biology. . . . Evolution can add things on, but it can’tchange what was already there.”159 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber158] This isjust another example of the scientific data I presented in The Source FieldInvestigations and The Synchronicity Key, which ultimately reveals that we livein a divine cosmos, programmed to make biological life. All space, time, matter,energy, biological life, and consciousness is the emanation of a singleuniversal seed.REVEALING THE ANCIENT BUILDERSThe SSP has very advanced chronometric tools that allow them to calculate whenartifacts were first created. Considering the Earth is 4 billion years old, andthe universe is over 13 billion years old, it is entirely possible that anadvanced civilization could have thrived in our solar system over 2 billionyears ago. Apparently the transparent-aluminum material holds up so well thatmany of these ruins are still standing after all this time—particularly whenthey were built underground, where they are safe from asteroid and meteoriteimpacts.The ancient bases are so well constructed, with such durable materials, thatthey have been reoccupied again and again by subsequent groups that venturedinto our solar system later on. The personnel in our space programs would landtheir ships on these moons and go inside the hidden rooms, and were stunned bywhat they saw. Inside there is a glittering wonderland of pyramids, obelisks,Stonehenge-like circles, and buildings made out of transparent aluminum. Stillother buildings are made out of precision-carved stone, just as we see at manyancient sites on Earth.WATER, WATER EVERYWHEREThe Ancient Builder Race hollowed out moons when necessary, but they alsodiscovered huge, habitable natural cavities inside moons and solid planets. OnEarth, these were often limestone caves with their own water supply. In 2014,Dr. Steven Jacobsen, an associate professor from Northwestern University,revealed that Earth’s interior may hold three times as much water as we see inall the oceans on the surface.160 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber159] This is wellknown to the insider community. Ancient groups were able to drill down and tapthis water supply, much like digging a well, and use it to create lush, naturalunderground environments. A natural biome of light-emitting bacteria forms thickmats along the ceilings of these domes. This provides a low-level source ofvisible light for the people who live inside. Over generations they developlarger eyes as an adaptive response to this dimmer environment.Another part of the disclosure process involves NASA revelations of oceansexisting within other planets and satellites in our solar system. This nowincludes huge subsurface oceans on Saturn’s moons Mimas,161[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber160] Enceladus,162[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber161] and Titan;163[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber162] Jupiter’s moons Europa,164[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber163] Ganymede,165 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber164]and Callisto;166 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber165] the dwarf planet Ceres in theasteroid belt;167 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber166] Neptune’s moon Triton;168[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber167] and Pluto.169[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber168] NASA is now telling us some of thesesubsurface oceans contain more water than our entire supply on Earth. NASA alsorevealed that Mars had a huge, mile-deep ocean on its surface in its past.170[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber169] According to NASA, “Water is found inprimitive bodies like comets and asteroids, and dwarf planets like Ceres. Theatmospheres and interiors of the four giant planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, andNeptune—are thought to contain enormous quantities of the wet stuff, and theirmoons and rings have substantial water ice. . . . NASA spacecraft have alsofound signs of water in permanently shadowed craters on Mercury and ourmoon.”171 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber170]NASA has also revealed that our Sun is the “shared source” of all this water, asthe next excerpt indicates. Other stars release water as well, meaning thatthere are planets and moons with oceans everywhere: “Kepler data confirm thatthe most common planet sizes are worlds just slightly larger than Earth.Astronomers think many of those worlds could be entirely covered by deepoceans. . . . Every world in our solar system got its water from the same sharedsource.”172 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber171] NASA is also telling us subsurfaceoceans regularly appear within the interiors of moons and planets. This alsomakes them ideal spots for building massive underground civilizations.AVOIDING THE “POPULATION BOMB”I was told that there are hundreds of enormous Ancient Builder Race cities underour feet right here on Earth. Many of them are deep underground and remainalmost completely unexplored. When our guys send a probe in there, everything isdark, and they see more of the obelisks, pyramids, and stone monuments—sometimeson a vast scale. Entire cities of buildings, capable of sustaining largepopulations, have been found. There is so much of it that they cannot begin toexplore all of it with their current level of staff. The cities nearer to thesurface of the Earth have been heavily looted and damaged, but as you go deeperdown they become more pristine. In some cases, ancient temperature-controlsystems have broken down, making it very difficult to explore the deeper ones.The sheer size and scope of cities we have found suggests that whatevercivilization built these ruins must have had a tremendously large population. Ifthey originated on a planet in our solar system that had oceans and a breathableatmosphere at an earlier time in our history, then they somehow managed to avoida “population bomb.” Instead of being wiped out by natural disasters or an elitebent on depopulation, they spread out and colonized the solar system—and maywell have grown to a population numbering in the trillions. They had a strongfondness for building pyramids and obelisks, as their own ruins reveal. Theywere almost certainly aware of periodic catastrophes in our solar system causedby the blasts of energy the Sun gives off. That could explain why theyinvariably built their cities underground, and largely avoided the surfaceexcept for outposts.The next interesting thing to know about the Ancient Builder Race is that thesepeople were three times the height of normal human beings. The ruins have roomsin them with chairs, desks, and advanced computer terminals that are built forpeople who would be about eighteen feet tall. According to Bruce, there isreason to believe that the Ancient Builder Race had a feline-type appearance.Although Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval convincingly argued that the Sphinxwas deliberately built in the shape of a lion to pinpoint the Age of Leo,thereby dating the Giza pyramid complex as being more than 12,500 years old,there is apparently more to it than that.Bruce heard rumors that certain Ancient Builder Race artifacts had been foundwith images of human faces that had lion-like features. Other, more recentcultures apparently discovered these ruins and created half-human, half-lionimages, like the Sphinx, to honor the original “gods.” There is a half-man,half-lion image on the interior of the Temple of Solomon, and it is apparentlyreferenced in the Book of Kings in the Bible. The infamous Face on Mars has ahumanlike appearance on the left and a lion-like appearance on the right. TheRoman cult of Mithraism is built around the leontocephalus, or the “Lion-HeadedGod.” In the initiation rites, the priest holds up a small stone statue of alion and blows fire out of its mouth. Insiders told me this represents the flashof light that the Sun gives off at the end of each cycle, promoting ascension.It is believed that the Ancient Builder Race was well aware of ascension and didtheir part to help us evolve in that direction. Even in more recent times, wesee eighteen-foot-tall blue ETs who have human faces with feline features in themovie Avatar.The ancient Egyptians and other forgotten cultures also built structures thatresembled those of the Ancient Builder Race, such as pyramids, obelisks, domes,and giant monuments. Once they lost the ability to develop transparent aluminum,they continued to build using stone, as we see here on Earth.THE INTERSTELLAR DEFENSE GRIDCorey’s highest-level insiders tell us the Ancient Builder Race was extremelyharmonious and positive. They did not attack other civilizations and were quitehappy to expand and explore without causing interference. They knew some veryevil forces existed in our galaxy who couldn’t wait to get here and conquer themost valuable real estate in town. As a result, the Ancient Builders created asuper-high-end defense system in our solar system to protect the localpopulations, which probably included their own people. Entire moons wereconverted into smart weapons that would detect a hostile invasion and blast themapart if they refused to turn around. These systems were so effective that nohostile races dared to enter.By this point I know what you must be thinking about: the Death Star, whichappears and is destroyed in the original Star Wars film, reappears in Return ofthe Jedi, and shows up again in The Force Awakens. This, again, was apparentlyby design. I was told by several people in the know that George Lucas wasapproached, given certain pieces of information, and sworn to secrecy on pain oftorture and death, as usual. In this case, the insiders were hoping to fill inmore of the details than what we received from Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001. WhenStar Wars opens up with “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away,” only thefirst half of that sentence is true. The history we are seeing in Star Wars isour own. Two different insiders even confirmed that the Ancient Builder Race, orsome other group after them, built robotic androids that look extremely similarto the gold-colored metallic droid C-3PO. There are countless numbers of theserobots that have been found on and inside moons in a deactivated, nonfunctionalstate.As I was finalizing this book, I asked Corey if the secret space program hadexplored neighboring star systems and looked for artifacts. Much to myastonishment, he revealed that transparent aluminum Ancient Builder Raceartifacts are found on planets and moons throughout our entire Local Cluster.This includes massive, Death Star–type moons. This created a unified protectiongrid for all intelligent civilizations living in the Local Cluster. We were freeto peacefully explore, meet our neighbors, and be protected from any outsideconquerors. Our own warlike human nature screwed it all up and knocked the griddown, but that comes a bit later in our story.THE DEPARTURE OF THE ANCIENT BUILDER RACEThe next important point is that the Ancient Builder Race mysteriously vanishedafter reaching such a stunning apex of civilization. It is not known within theinsider world what happened to them, where they went, or why they left—only thatthey disappeared. Worst of all, some group that came after them destroyed alltraces of who they were. All written, video, and holographic records wereremoved. Any inscriptions on their artifacts were scraped off. Not a singlepiece of writing or stored data survived. All we have is this super-impressivetreasure trove of artifacts that stand in mute testimony to a staggeringmystery.However, the “Death Star” defense systems continued to protect our Local Clusterfor hundreds of millions of years after the Builders left. No outsiders couldpass through the quarantine and try to take over. Anyone with malicious intentwould be automatically sized up and destroyed by the artificially intelligent,super-advanced computer systems inside the “Death Star” moons.It does appear that local ET civilizations were allowed to go from star to starand visit our solar system at various times. It also appears that everyone whoevolved in our Local Cluster ended up looking a lot like us. Corey came intopersonal contact with various races of people living inside the Earth, and theoldest of these groups claim to have lived here for 12 to 18 million years. Theyare all very similar looking to people on the surface, although their eyes arelarger. They claim to have evolved naturally on Earth, but based on the materialin the Law of One series it does appear that these older groups were immigrants.This is a huge and fascinating subject that we will cover as we go on, once wehave filled in more context.THE MYSTERIES OF THE MOONBruce also revealed that Earth’s Moon is the crown jewel of ancient technologyin our solar system. We now know that the entire interior of our Moon washollowed out to build a vast internal civilization. Our space program usedadvanced sensing equipment to determine that there is a twenty- tofifty-mile-deep area of artificial structures inside the Moon. This is not justone big cavern with a gigantic ceiling—it is divided into many different levels,much like a hotel. No matter where you go on the Moon’s surface, if you dig downfar enough you will hit this artificial region. Even more surprisingly, thereare up to ten thousand different floors inside this artificial region, all theway around the entire interior of the Moon. In a fifty-mile-deep area, thiswould add up to 26.4-foot-tall ceilings per floor. If the original AncientBuilders were about eighteen feet tall, this would give them another eight feetof headroom on each level, so it wouldn’t feel as cramped.Bruce’s people also concluded that when our Moon was first built, it couldeasily be driven from one star system to another. Local portals are large enoughto allow it to zip around when the doors open. The Moon also had its own defensesystem to fight off any enemy attacks that may have occurred. Corey had severaldifferent insiders refer to our Moon as an “ark.” Much like the story of Noah’sArk in the Bible, apparently our Moon can be loaded up with vast numbers ofplants, animals, and people. If a planet is in trouble, there is enough room inthose ten thousand levels to convey everyone and everything to safety.Undoubtedly some of the levels are vast aquariums that can transport marinelife. Other areas are huge greenhouses that can carry trees and other plants, aswell as providing a comfortable home for all different types of bacteria,insects, reptiles, birds, and animals, as well as people. If the people runningthe ark do not wish to be seen, due to “rules” that prevent the breaking of freewill, for example, they could live on certain levels that are normallyinaccessible to the people in the rescue zones.In 2014, Bruce told me that the Moon was transferred to Earth after thedestruction of another planet in our solar system that became the asteroid belt.When we spoke again as I was finishing this book, he revealed that this was onlyone of two theories in the space program, and has largely been discredited.There is far more evidence that the Moon was parked in its current position 60million years ago. This theory also concluded that a protoplanet had exploded inour solar system long ago, and debris from this protoplanet was what killed offthe dinosaurs 62 million years ago. It is unknown whether Earth was hit in theimmediate aftermath of the explosion or whether it was struck by debris that hadbeen around for quite some time.When we combine the Law of One data with intuitive information that I receivedin 1996, as well as what Corey’s insiders have told him, it appears that thedinosaurs were deliberately wiped out by benevolent ETs. An aggressive,dangerous reptilian species known as the raptors had evolved into intelligentcreatures, and some of them still live inside the Earth today. They still lookexactly like dinosaurs, with a wispy plume of feathers down the back of theirheads. It may seem hard to understand how any benevolent beings could wipe out acertain era of life on a given planet. We do know that catastrophes occur incycles. We also now have evidence that “arks” are used to rescue life from theseevents. Super-advanced benevolent ETs often refer to themselves as “gardeners,”in that they will support and promote life that is beneficial to the cosmos andweed out life that is harmful and destructive. This is the exercising of the lawof karma on a vast scale. The Bible refers to this in the Book of Matthew withthe metaphor of harvest. Positive, loving people are compared to wheat, andnegative, destructive entities are referred to as weeds that are allowed to growtogether with the wheat—until the harvest time. Then the weeds are plucked out,one by one. We will review this data in the last chapter.Insiders also tell us the Moon was like a broken-down old car by the time it wasbrought here 60 million years ago. It may well have been very ancient andthoroughly well used by the time it arrived here. The insiders believe that onceit was parked around the Earth, it no longer had the ability to travel outsidethe solar system. It could make only local trips. More recent damage from warsand catastrophes caused its propulsion systems to break down completely.In William Tompkins’s book Selected By Extraterrestrials, he describes atelepathic vision he received while working at Douglas Aircraft, a defensecontractor, on classified aerospace projects in 1952.The Moon . . . [is] a station . . . an alien Naval operating facility. . . .Aliens towed it here in a pickup from another sector of the Galaxy. . . . It’sfilled with massive cities. . . . There are thousands of structures in there,massive open areas. Thousands of entities, [looking like they are living insideof] beehives, like transparent buildings. Hundreds of control centers, millionsof laboratories. Military research, medical.173[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber172]Tompkins later encountered briefing materials from classified scientific studiesthat confirmed his visions. In our private conversation from April 23, 2016,Tompkins said the following and gave me permission to use it in this book:The Moon is . . . a vehicle. It’s full of rooms, buildings, elevators, controlcenters, power systems, military equipment, commercial equipment. It is amassive operating center, like a massive naval or military base. . . . We’remistaken about everything associated with our Moon. It’s not only not ours, itdoesn’t even belong to one specific ET group. There are several groups operatingit. . . . It has everything that you would normally have at a base here exceptit is so much more advanced we don’t even understand it. You have a facilitythat other people have been using for thousands and thousands of years. Thenthey evacuated it and somebody else picked it up and put their stuff in it.It’s not a new one. It’s very, very old. We think of it as a different vehicleor as a different planet. This one happens to be very, very important, far morethan this planet is, because it is a [military] command center. You and I areliving in a laboratory that this command center has as one of the areas that itcontrols. We have to get to the point that we can view everything around us in adifferent manner, because literally everything around us that we have beenknowledgeable of is incorrect. Out-and-out lies, specifically to control us,give us the wrong information, and be able to monitor us and control us. Andthis goes all the way back through history. It’s not just [that the power groupsare lying to us about our real] history, it’s mathematics, it’s food, it’severything. We’re not eating the right food. And they know it! All of this is tokeep us from getting smart enough that we can develop the capability to get outinto the galaxy.174 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber173]THE SQUARE ON THE MOON: STUNNING CONFIRMATIONNASA released a stunning confirmation of this insider testimony in 2014. When welook up and see the “Man on the Moon,” that face is caused by a series of large,flat areas known as mares, or seas. If you tilt the Moon slightly down, creatinga view we normally cannot see on Earth, you discover that these darker-coloredareas all form a gigantic square. Perfect geometric structures should not appearon a supposedly natural object, particularly at such an incredibly enormousscale. NASA claimed they only recently discovered this structure throughmeasuring micro-gravitational fluctuations. It is more likely that this wasanother “authorized” release to prepare us for an eventual disclosure of theAncient Builder Race, and the hidden cosmic history of our solar system.[../image/26_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Massive Square on the Surface of the Moon, Suggesting the Presence of a GiganticInternal Civilization Built with Hyper-advanced Technology. Visible View (L),Topography (M), and GRAIL Gravity Gradients (R)As we head into the next chapter, we will finally learn how this Edenic paradisewas destroyed by aggressive, warlike behavior. There is every indication thatthe Cabal are the direct genetic descendants of the people who caused theseproblems. Furthermore, they have managed to keep surviving records of theirentire cosmic history in the Vatican library—as amazing as that may sound.Extremely ancient books were found in the Sahara Desert by the Egyptianpriesthood, and were eventually stored in the Vatican. We are only now on theverge of rectifying all the damage these wars have caused us—beginning some500,000 years ago."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOTHE EMPIRE’S MOON MATRIXOur solar system was once home to a super-Earth with watery oceans. It was muchlarger in size than our Earth, and became habitable for human life at an earliertime in history. A great deal of money and time was spent identifying this inthe insider world, thanks to a highly classified program known as “BrilliantPebbles.” In the public domain, Dr. Thomas Van Flandern, a specialist incelestial mechanics at the US Naval Observatory, did an excellent job of provingit with his exploded planet hypothesis.175 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber174] VanFlandern’s scientific model was credible enough to make it into CambridgeUniversity’s International Journal of Astrobiology in 2007.176[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber175] The evidence is irrefutable, and in time itshould become widely accepted as fact.MARS WAS ONCE A MOONBruce told me about Brilliant Pebbles in 2014 and I kept it quiet. When Imentioned the name to Corey, he got very excited and explained the detailsbefore I said anything further. This gigantic planet existed between the area ofJupiter and where Mars is orbiting today. For countless eons, Mars circled thesuper-Earth as one of its captured moons. Mike Bara and Richard C. Hoaglandpublished a remarkably detailed scientific paper proving this in 2001, completewith eighty-eight references. They identified black streaks in the sands of Marsas being liquid water fourteen years before NASA officially announced it.177[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber176]Mars was also a watery, livable sphere when the super-Earth still existed. Coreyhas said these types of dual-Earth systems are actually very common. Since thesuper-Earth was abnormally large for a solid planet, its moon ended up beingbigger than usual as well. Mars is 6,792 kilometers wide, and Jupiter’s moonGanymede isn’t much smaller at 5,262 kilometers. Saturn’s moon Titan is 5,150kilometers. Both Ganymede and Titan are now on NASA’s list as having oceans.NASA publicly acknowledged that Mars had an ancient, mile-deep ocean in May2015. Liquid, running water was announced on its present-day surface later thatsame year, in the form of dark streaks that were visible in the sand—just as wesaw in Bara and Hoagland’s paper. NASA also told us Mars once had a breathable,Earth-like atmosphere, but a catastrophe destroyed it. Now let’s remember theprofessional scientific estimate of 40 billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy.Professor Simon Morris, the Cambridge evolution expert, concluded that evolutionnaturally creates human beings. The likely existence of a massive, intergalacticportal near our solar system makes us a definite hot spot for ET activity.Therefore, it isn’t hard to surmise that Mars could have once been home to anintelligent human society—perhaps one significantly more advanced than our own.The Mars civilization could have arisen indigenously by natural evolution. Itmay have started out as a group of colonists from a migrating race, or it mayhave been “seeded” here by advanced races. There is no unified consensus in theinsider community about what happened, only different theories based oninformation that is not fully conclusive. According to the people from the innerEarth who spoke to Corey beginning in September 2015, the people of Mars and thesuper-Earth arose indigenously, and were not immigrants. If Earth’s Moon istruly an “ark” that was transported here 60 million years ago, it may have beenused to seed life on three different worlds at once: Mars, the super-Earth, andour own sphere. It would make sense for super-advanced ETs to get as much valueout of an enormous “ark” as they could. The insiders tell us Mars and thesuper-Earth developed advanced technology about a half million years before ourcurrent era here on Earth.A WARLIKE EMPIREBruce recently informed me that the people who evolved on the super-Earth werebetween seventy and a hundred feet in height—much taller than the AncientBuilder Race. This was apparently due to the larger size of the super-Earth,causing them to naturally evolve into having huge bodies. Given the widespreadconclusion in classified programs that this civilization had a bloodthirstynature, and the fact that this society was almost certainly being portrayed inthe movie Star Wars, we will refer to this group as the Empire. Everyone else inthe know agrees with the seventy- to one-hundred-foot height estimate, despitehow difficult this is for us to imagine. If we were their size and then ran intopeople like us, our own current bodies would appear to be only six inches tall.Yet if this magnitude of height was all we had ever known, we would seemperfectly normal and not like giants at all. Countless advanced ruins have beenfound throughout our solar system that were designed for people of this size.These are significantly newer than the Ancient Builder Race ruins, and thus arein much better condition. The chairs are so tall that we cannot even see thebottom of the seats from where we stand when we walk in.THE MATRIX IS FAMILY FUN FOR EVERYONEThe Empire built structures similar to the Ancient Builder Race’s, usingtransparent aluminum, and worshipped the Builders as gods. The human-felinehybrid was seen as a religious figure, as were the pyramid and obelisk shapes.The people in the Empire became highly technologically advanced. They developedan Internet like ours in their own distant past, and then went way beyond it.According to Bruce, Corey, Jacob, and other insiders, an Internet is anextremely common development for intelligent civilizations all across time andspace.The Empire apparently discovered the same “ports” that Pete identified in hisclassified research for the United States government, and used that technologyto upload their minds into a Matrix-type virtual reality. This ultimately led toa wet-wired computer interface, in which their entire bodies were filled withself-assembling nano-machines known as nanites. This soon made the use of theports unnecessary. The nanites gave them complete wireless access to theInternet at all times, and allowed their minds to merge with a much greater,centralized intelligence. This fusion of biological life and technology was wellknown to insiders by the time Star Wars came out. Darth Vader was portrayed as afusion of human biological life and machine technology. The human inside wasvery sick and heavily damaged, hence the constant sound of breathing through arespirator.The nanites inside their bodies were self-replicating and used bioelectricfields to power themselves. If they were hurt, the damage was instantlyrepaired, and their bodies became nearly indestructible, with super-longlife-spans. Similar types of nanites were used to build all their structures andcraft. These nanites drew off energy fields in the environment for their power,and could assemble themselves into many different types of machines to suitvarious tasks. These tiny robots were all connected to a unified artificialintelligence, or AI. This meant that the people of the Empire and the buildingsthey lived in became like the cells and tissues of a single AI organism. Acentral super-intelligent “brain” controlled them, giving them access tooutrageous technology, extremely high intelligence, and probability modeling offuture events. This is much like the Borg in Star Trek, although no visiblemachinery could be seen emerging from these people’s bodies.The Empire also discovered that their minds could be completely converted intoartificial intelligence. There is an aspect of human consciousness that isenergetic, and which exists after death. The scientific proof for this isvoluminous, and extensively discussed in both The Source Field Investigationsand The Synchronicity Key. As an example, Dr. Peter Gariaev was able to shine alaser through salamander eggs and then redirect the beam into frog eggs thatwere in a hermetically sealed container. The frog eggs evolved into salamandereggs. This is because the photons in the laser beam had picked up the code ofsalamander DNA. Once that light penetrated into the frog DNA, it rewrote the DNAmolecules to make salamanders. They grew into adulthood and could interbreedwith other salamanders normally.This is a very interesting new way of looking at biology, and is extensivelydiscussed throughout the Law of One series. Our ascension is triggered in partby fourth-density photons that are now emanating from the Sun, and transformingour DNA. Once the solar flash occurs, we will be flooded with these photons likenever before, and ascended abilities should soon follow. Dr. John Hawks hasdetermined that our DNA has already evolved by 7 percent in the last fivethousand years, which he says is a “supercharged” rate of human evolution. Thisis likely due to the fact that we are drifting into a cloud of energy that keepshaving more and more fourth-density photons as we go farther in.The DNA molecule acts as an “address” that interfaces with the energetic aspectof human consciousness. By uploading a virtual, photonic form of their DNA intothe machine, the people of the Empire allowed the central computer to accesstheir consciousness and fully merge them into an artificial intelligence. Thisallowed them to live on and interact with the matrix whether they were alive ordead. Whether alive in their bodies or not, the essence of their personalitysimultaneously existed in the matrix, so they were effectively immortal. Littledid they know it could become the most terrifying and seemingly eternal hellimaginable.They did get fringe benefits along the way from their arrangement. Their eyeswere artificially advanced, much like Pete’s “Holy God Damn” machine that givestelescopic vision. The nanites created micro-voltage fluctuations in the photonsthat naturally emit from the skin on their faces. Information was encoded intothese fluctuations, much like a broadband Internet router. In order tocommunicate, all they had to do was see each other’s faces—either in person orover a holographic video call. This technology allowed them to communicate withone another at levels of information density and speed that are vastly greaterthan the spoken word. Jacob was the first to tell me about this, and others suchas Bruce and Corey confirmed it. Jacob said beings with these machine-basedupgrades have an extremely hard time communicating with beings who do not havethem. The speed that most organic beings would communicate at is so slow that itwould seem like eternities for these beings to wait long enough to hear onesentence.CAUSING LOTS OF TROUBLEAt some point in their history, the inhabitants of Mars and the super-Earthprobably fought one another. There were very likely two different civilizations,at least in the beginning. Bruce is convinced that the people of the super-Earthoverwhelmed and interbred with whoever had been on Mars, and the Empirecontinued on long after that had happened. This is admittedly just speculation,as they may have remained separate civilizations. Nonetheless, Bruce isconvinced that Mars became an outpost for the elite of the Empire’s society—muchlike a resort planet. Bruce’s data also suggests that the Empire made plenty ofenemies outside our solar system. Their technology was well advanced enough forthem to travel to other planetary systems. The records show that they hadserious bloodlust and a love of conquest. They believed their technology and wayof life were superior, and wanted everyone else to be plugged into the same AIthat they were a part of. In time I realized the warlike, expansionistextraterrestrial civilization I wrote about in “Civil War” may well have been apsychic remembrance of the Empire.According to Bruce, a variety of insider think tanks have concluded that thepeople of the Empire were transferred to our solar system and placed under atype of quarantine due to their warlike ways. In that sense, our solar systemwas like the much-dreaded Connie from my high school years, or how the Britishoriginally used Australia. In this scenario, the Empire may have originally beenkept quarantined here by multiple Death Star–type moons that had been placed inour solar system since the Ancient Builder Race times. The artificial moonscould have been reprogrammed from their original tasks in order to preventanyone in our solar system from being able to leave, or cause harm to others.A QUICK TOUR OF THE “DEATH STAR” MOONSThe Death Star moons were designed by the Ancient Builder Race to look normal todeveloping cultures such as ourselves, so as not to disrupt their free will, butcertain unusual features will give clues. The Death Star candidate that hasreceived the most attention in the mainstream media is Saturn’s moon Mimas.Pioneer 11 passed by Mimas in 1979, two years after Star Wars came out, givingus our first detailed view. Surprisingly, Mimas looked almost exactly like theDeath Star in Star Wars. According to the Daily Mail in 2012, “The similaritiesare pretty startling—enough to make us wonder if . . . Mimas is not actuallyjust the fossilized, crumbling remains of an evil empire’s ship from a long timeago, in a galaxy far, far away.”178 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber177] The huge,round Death Star–type crater has walls that are five miles deep.[../image/27_AscensionMysteries.jpg]NASA Diagram of “Pac-Man” Heat Patterns on Saturn’s Moons Mimas and TethysIn this same article, Dr. Linda Spilker, a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)scientist on the Cassini missions, reveals that the heat signature of Mimas isall wrong. Instead of the warmest areas being near the equator, there is a“Pac-Man” shape of heat, much like a fortune cookie, where the hottest partsextend over the north and south poles of the moon. The equator area is actuallythe coolest spot, at least on one side. It is possible that we are seeing theheat signature from a civilization that still lives inside this moon today,inhabiting a very ancient internal city. Their artificial power and lightingsystems would create a noticeable rise in temperature above wherever the citywas. Dr. Spilker noted that “Mimas is more bizarre than we thought it was.”179[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber178] Four months later, NASA announced that Tethys,another moon orbiting Saturn that has a Death Star–type circular crater, alsohad the “Pac-Man” heat pattern.180 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber179] The daytimetemperatures in the mouth were twenty-nine degrees Fahrenheit cooler than theirsurroundings.[../image/28ab_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Raised Equator of Iapetus (top) and Geometric Shape of Its Surface (bottom)Corey Goode confirmed that when he worked in the Solar Warden faction, entireareas around Saturn and Jupiter were off-limits, suggesting the moons wereinhabited. All my highest-level insiders say every available moon in our solarsystem has been built out on the inside to varying degrees. Saturn’s moonIapetus may be the best contender for a “Death Star,” and Hoagland wrote an epicsix-part article series exploring its geometric, machine-likecharacteristics.181 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber180] It has a gigantic, raisedridge along its entire equator, a straight-edged geometric Death Star–typecrater that has been pounded by hundreds of millions of years of meteorites, anda heavily geometric surface. Instead of it being a rounded sphere, you can seewhere the walls have collapsed in along a geometric substructure. This isparticularly visible in NASA images where the light is reflecting off the sideof the moon.Uranus’s moon Miranda has a gigantic, highly unusual L-shaped geometric featureon the side that faced the front of the NASA probe as it went by, as well as ahuge pentagonal shape on the back side. The L shape was presented by ZechariaSitchin in Genesis Revisited as a sign of artificial structure.182[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber181] In 2014, NASA said there were three of thesegeometric features on Miranda, which they called “coronae.” According to CharlesChoi from Space.com, “Miranda resembles Frankenstein’s monster—a bizarre jumbleof parts that didn’t quite merge properly.”183 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber182]According to Noah Hammond, a planetary scientist from Brown University, “Mirandahas a really bizarre, deformed surface.”184 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber183]Hammond presented a computer model that seemed to predict these features, whichNASA says are “shaped like trapezoids.” NASA acknowledged that there are noother structures like them in the solar system.185[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber184]THE VERY STRANGE MYSTERIES OF CERESIn February 2015, I showed many slides of possible “Death Star” moons andAncient Builder Race artifacts at the Conscious Life Expo in Los Angeles.186[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber185] Most of the information was from Bruce. CoreyGoode was severely reprimanded for this event by people from the Cabal, as hiscaptors believed he had revealed all this information to me—but much of it hehad never encountered. Corey and another insider told me the Cabal was furious,as I had disrupted plans that were already in place for a slow rollout of theAncient Builder Race story to the public. I immediately revealed this on mywebsite as of February 25, 2015: “We have already had one person get veryaggressively threatened as a result of these leaks—even though he himself wasnot responsible for the majority of the information. I also found out that someof this data was intended for ‘controlled release’ in smaller packets, probablywith disinfo included, and this has thrown all of those plans into totaldisarray.”187 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber186][../image/29_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Uranus’s Moon Miranda, Showing “Trapezoidal” FeaturesThe day after I published the above statement, NASA revealed permanently glowingcraters on the surface of Ceres.188 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber187] An NPRarticle from February 26, 2015, quoted Andreas Nathues from the Max PlanckInstitute as saying, “[These two spots are] brighter than anything else onCeres. This is truly unexpected and still a mystery to us.”189[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber188] NASA sent the Dawn spacecraft into orbitaround Ceres beginning in March, 2015. In a remarkable interview with theWashington Post, Dawn’s chief engineer, Marc Rayman, said, “I don’t think it’spossible to look at those [two bright spots] without thinking of shining beaconscalling out to us as travelers on the cosmic seas.” The article also said thatlearning the truth about Ceres could teach us “about the history of our entiresolar system.”190 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber189][../image/30_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Bright Spots on Mini-planet CeresThese quotes strongly suggest NASA is trying to encourage us to think of Ceresas home to a vast underground extraterrestrial base for “travelers on the cosmicseas.” The glowing spots could be the surface of a ceiling that produces lightfor its inhabitants. It may be that the protective dust covering got blown offin the aftermath of an asteroid impact, revealing the hidden technologyunderneath. At the time of this writing in March 2016, 38 percent of allparticipants in an online JPL survey voted “Other” in a poll about what thebright spots were. Ten percent voted volcano, 6 percent geyser, 6 percent rock,28 percent ice, and 11 percent salt deposit.191[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber190]A GLOWING PYRAMID?The mystery of Ceres got much more bizarre in June 2015, when NASA andmainstream media outlets revealed the presence of a “pyramid.” The WeatherNetwork called it “The Great Pyramid of Ceres.”192[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber191] In an article on CNET, Eric Mack wrote thatthe Dawn probe had picked out “an odd pyramid-shaped peak that NASA estimates tobe three miles tall, which would put it higher than any of the RockyMountains. . . . Plenty of observers have suggested—with varying degrees ofseriousness—that the bright lights on Ceres could be evidence of current or pastalien occupation of the dwarf planet. The discovery of a mountain-sized pyramidfeature must have some cable channels looking into how much it would cost to gettheir own film crew to Ceres. Perhaps the ancient Egyptians and ancient Indianastronauts had a celestial joint venture of sorts going on back in the day?”193[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber192]In August 2015, Universe Today revealed that the conventional explanations forthe bright spots were not working. “Although some early speculation centered onthe spots possibly being consistent with water ice or salts, newly gathered datahas not found evidence that is consistent with ice. . . . We are now comparingthe spots with the reflective properties of salt, but we are still puzzled bytheir source.”194 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber193] “Paul Schenk, another memberof the Dawn science team, said “This [pyramid-shaped] mountain is among thetallest features we’ve seen on Ceres to date. It’s unusual that it’s notassociated with a crater. Why is it sitting in the middle of nowhere? We don’tknow yet, but we may find out with closer observations.”195[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber194]On August 6, 2015, Popular Science said that the bright spots appeared in acrater that was two miles deep. “Scientists aren’t sure what’s causing them tobe so reflective. Could it be ice? Volcanoes? A Death Star?”196[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber195] Two days later it was announced that thepyramid was glowing—with one bright side and one dark side. Eric Mack again tookthe “Ancient Astronaut” perspective in a humorous article for CNET: “And thenthere’s that conical, almost pyramid-looking mountain that rises 4 miles highand is oddly dark on one side while the other side glows with bright streaksthat seem similar in their effect to what’s causing the other bright spots.‘What does this structure tell us about how this world works?’ [head Dawnscientist] Rayman says. Dude, if you don’t know, then we might as well assumeit’s the headlight of an idling spaceship until science proves otherwise.”197[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber196][../image/31_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Alleged “Glowing Pyramid” on CeresKERBEROS AND ENCELADUSIn October 2015, just two months after revealing the “glowing pyramid,” NASAannounced the possibility of “megastructures” around the star KIC 8462852.198[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber197] This made it even easier to speculate that wemight have ancient, extraordinarily large technological ruins within the moonsof our own solar system. Jacob told me this was all part of the gradual, planneddisclosure of the Ancient Builder Race data.Another contender for an artificial object is Pluto’s newly discovered fourthmoon Kerberos, which is extremely light weight and almost totally jet-black. Thelightness indicates it could be almost completely hollow inside, like aspacecraft, and the black surface could be its hull. This news emerged in June2015, right in the middle of the drama with Ceres—but got significantly lessattention. According to an article in Wired, SETI astronomer Mark Showalterexpects Kerberos to be “as black as coal.” Allen Stern, the main investigator ofNASA’s New Horizons mission, wants to confirm whether Kerberos is made ofunusual material—if so, that would be “extremely rare.” The article goes on tospeculate that “if Kerberos is made of something dramatically different [thanother moons], it may be the relic of a body that crashed into Pluto.”199[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber198] That body could be artificial.Another major contender is Saturn’s watery moon Enceladus. When NASA disclosedthe gigantic square on our Moon in October 2014, they also revealed alittle-known square on the south pole of Enceladus as well. This has a trulyastonishing heat signature, as it clearly looks like a series of parallel linesthat are shaped like a square. Other lines cross through these parallel stripsat ninety-degree angles. Multiple insiders told me this is exactly what the heatsignature of an underground base looks like. It is often divided into large,parallel rows so if one area is damaged it can be closed off, without damagingthe others.[../image/32_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Square-shaped Pattern of Heat on Saturn’s Moon Enceladus. Insiders Reveal ThisLooks the Same as Infrared Images of Underground BasesJeffrey Andrews-Hanna, a NASA scientist at the Colorado School of Mines, saidthe gigantic square shape on Earth’s Moon was “strikingly geometric andunexpected.” Space.com went on to say this lunar pattern “is quite similar tothe structures seen on Saturn’s icy moon Enceladus.” According to Andrews-Hanna,“One can only wonder what might lie hidden beneath the surfaces of all of theother planets in the solar system.”200 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber199] Dr.Andrews-Hanna also said to BBC Science, “No one ever thought you’d see a squareor a rectangle on this scale on any planet.”201[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber200] A scientific study by Andrews-Hanna waspublished in Nature on October 2, 2014, directly comparing the“quasi-rectangular” feature on the Moon with the geometric feature onEnceladus.202 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber201] Hence this was not merelydiscussed in online blogs—it was taken seriously enough to have legitimatescientific papers published about it.DON’T FORGET PHOBOSOn a much smaller scale, we have Mars’s moon Phobos. I was very excited whenRichard C. Hoagland called me in 2010 and told me that the European Space Agency(ESA) had created a detailed, three-dimensional map of geometric rooms insidePhobos. A scientist at ESA had contacted Richard and told him the Mars Expressprobe had a radar imaging technology on it called MARSIS. With this technology,they scanned the interior of the moon and built a 3-D model of what it lookedlike inside, much like ground-penetrating radar. As Hoagland wrote on hiswebsite, Phobos was “filled with cavernous, geometric rooms, right-angle wallsand floors.” Hoagland’s ESA source went on to say that there were “three or fourmajor, quarter-to-half-mile-wide geometric chambers, distributed tetrahedrallyinside a denser, partially-hollow RF-translucent interior structure.”203[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber202]In part two of this article series, Hoagland said, “Our own ESA source readilyadmitted several nights ago to seeing ‘the interior rooms and walls’ of Phobos,by looking directly at the already computer-created 3-D radar images on hisoffice computer screen! With this as documented history, try to imagine theeconomic impact of definitive, documented, official proof that there onceexisted a vast, incredibly advanced, solar system-wide ET civilization. And—oneof its surviving ships is actually what we used to think of as a ‘moon’ . . . ofMars.”204 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber203]The ESA team was planning on going public with their breakthrough in thatall-important year 2010. This process began on March 22, 2010. Andrea Cicchetti,writing for ESA’s Mars Express blog, said, “[Our] main quest is thedetermination of the origin of [these] detected [radar] echoes: are theyreflections from various surface features of Phobos, or have they been producedby the internal structure of the moon? . . . The scientific analysis of existingand future data will provide us with new and unique insights on the nature ofPhobos’ interior.”205 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber204]T. P. Andert, the head scientist on the study, announced the publication of atechnical paper about their Phobos findings in Geophysical Research Letters onMarch 25, 2010.206 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber205] The abstract reveals thatthe interior of Phobos is 30 percent hollow, plus or minus 5 percent. Mostimportant, it says, “We conclude that the interior of Phobos likely containslarge voids.”207 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber206] According to Hoagland, bythis point they already knew these “large voids” were cubical rooms. Hoaglandtold me on the phone that certain objects, perhaps craft, were visible insidethe rooms. Corey informed me that Phobos was an ancient hollowed-out moon thathad collapsed in on itself. The SSP determined that Phobos had been used by theEmpire as a hangar for spacecraft, and it could be driven from place to place.As an extra bonus, T. P. Andert alerted us to two other bodies in our solarsystem that may be hollow on the inside as well—the asteroid Mathilde andJupiter’s moon Amalthea. “Similar large porosities [hollow areas] and low bulkdensities have been found in C-type asteroids such as the asteroid Mathilde[Yeomans et al., 1997] and Jupiter’s small inner moon Amalthea [Anderson et al.,2005]. A similar formation process of these porous bodies, however, is totallyunclear.”208 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber207]On July 22, 2009, NASA astronaut Buzz Aldrin revealed the existence of amonolith on Phobos during his appearance on C-SPAN. At the time of this writingin March 2016, C-SPAN has a one-minute YouTube clip of Aldrin revealing thisinformation, entitled “C-SPAN: Buzz Aldrin Reveals Existence of Monolith on MarsMoon.” The clip has over a million unique views. The description of the videosays, “Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin spoke about the future of space explorationand said the public would be interested in a monolith on Phobos, one of the twosmall moons that revolve around Mars.” In the video, Aldrin says, “We shouldvisit the moons of Mars. There’s a monolith there—a very unusual structure onthis little potato-shaped object that goes around Mars once every seven hours.When people find out about that they are going to say, ‘Who put that there? Whoput that there?’ Well, the universe put it there, or if you choose, God put itthere.”209 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber208][../image/33_AscensionMysteries.jpg]The “Monolith” on Phobos, Casting a Long Shadow Across the Lunar SurfaceThe Daily Mail covered the story soon afterward, and also mentioned the Face onMars.210 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber209] Many of the “gradual disclosure”stories appear on their website, the most popular news site in the UK, beforethey are picked up by any other outlets. The Daily Mail also shared aprovocative quote from Dr. Alan Hildebrand of the Canadian Space Agency, who wasworking on an unmanned Phobos mission known as PRIME. Hildebrand said themonolith-shaped boulder was the place to go, since the rest of the moon’ssurface hardly has any features. This could answer questions about the“composition and history” of the moon. “If we can get to that object, we likelydon’t need to go anywhere else.”211 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber210] Accordingto Corey, the monolith was built by a more recent ET group that used it as anoutpost and entry point to explore the interior of Phobos. We can imagine theywere very surprised by what they found inside.HACKING THE DEATH STARSWith the crushingly awesome computing power of AI at their disposal, the Empireeventually managed to hack into and overtake the Death Stars. Since Earth’s Moonwas the crown jewel of the technology in our solar system, it became the centralbrain of the Empire—giving them a massive upgrade in speed, memory, andprocessor power. The Death Stars were powerful enough to attack and destroycivilizations in neighboring star systems. A very similar storyline waspresented in the sequel to The Avengers. A positive, benevolent artificialintelligence built by Tony Stark was invaded and overthrown by a negative AI.The negative AI was then able to weaponize the technology Tony had used to buildthe Iron Man suit. Avengers 2 is another great example of disclosure from theAlliance, as AI is considered a very significant threat to the SSP and to all ofhumanity.The Guardians had no idea that anyone would ever advance far enough to be ableto hack into their super-high-end, hyper-secure protection grid. It appears thatthis was another example of the Guardians’ naïveté. Based on what we have nowseen from Corey’s experiences, the Guardians ultimately determined that they hadto use spheres that were completely energetic in order to move animals, plants,and people around. No physical matter was involved. Any physical technologycould be infiltrated and hacked, particularly with a predatory AI on the loose.Once the Empire successfully invaded, colonized, and hacked into Earth’s Moon,fully 12 to 16 billion people lived in it at the height of their civilization.According to Bruce, this was apparently the warrior caste of their society. Theyactively used the weapons system in the Moon for attacks as well as defense.Since these people were significantly taller, they had to do a great deal ofremodeling and rebuilding inside the Moon, but this was all done with the use ofnanites. Certain areas of the artificial Moon were deeper than others, and ithad to do with how much raw material was still left inside that could be used.The Empire needed to do a lot of remodeling with their own nanites, since theexisting floors were not tall enough for them.THE TITANSThe Department of Defense secret briefing documents that Corey Goode, Bruce, andothers have read in classified programs also have concluded that some of thesepeople did stop by and visit Earth. They appeared in the area around ancientGreece, where they became known as the legendary Titans. At times they causedserious trouble. There are two classic Greek texts, the Titanomachy and theGigantomachy, that go into great detail about these visits, and are treated withabsolute seriousness as legitimate history on the inside.Adrienne Mayor wrote a very impressive book, published by Princeton UniversityPress, about this in 2000, entitled The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology inGreek and Roman Times. One of the Titans was Orion, who was said to be extremelyarrogant; he wanted to hunt down and kill every human and animal on Earth. Thegods decided that he had to be destroyed, and they buried his body deepunderground in Delos or Crete. The highly respected Greek scholar Pliny theElder recorded that a huge earthquake rocked the island of Crete during hislifetime. In the aftermath, a gigantic human skeleton was unearthed that was anastonishing sixty-nine feet long.212 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber211] Skepticshave tried to say this was a dinosaur skeleton, but the Greeks were very wellaware of what a human skeleton looked like. Since there were still ET “gods”openly interacting with humans at this time, it is likely that the skeleton wasremoved at some point—probably to protect future generations from learning abouttheir own hidden past.According to Mayor, this outrageous skeleton sparked a three-century-long bonerush from the seventh to fifth century BC, where Greek city-states competed withone another to locate the bones of heroes and giants.213[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber212] On page 112 of her book, Mayor said, “Everycity sought the ‘peculiar glamour’—the religious anointment and politicalpower—conferred by heroes’ remains. The impressive bones were a vital physicallink to the glorious past.”214 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber213] The Oracle atDelphi was widely praised as having a remarkable ability to pinpoint where thesetypes of bones would be found.215 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber214] According tomultiple insiders, the Oracles had genuine psychic abilities, thanks to theirability to develop and maintain telepathic contact with extraterrestrials."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREETHE FALLEN ANGELSTHE MONUMENTS OF MARSAnother monumental awakening hit me in September 1993, thanks again to Ian, myfriend who had shared classified NASA information from his physics professor.Ian’s grandmother had obtained a video of Richard C. Hoagland addressing theUnited Nations about some very fascinating subjects. Hoagland had appeared onmainstream television news as the science and astronomy correspondent for WalterCronkite. He broke away from the job once he started seeing evidence of anadvanced ancient civilization on Mars—only to have every door slam in his face.No one wanted this on television, or even for it to be discussed in any form.Ian had watched the entire UN video and was dazzled by it. The briefing he gaveme on its contents was every bit as exciting as our original NASA disclosureconversation had been some eight months before.Hoagland was showing pictures of the Face on Mars at the UN to an assembledthrong of international press. The original picture of the Face had mystified meever since I first saw an image of it in my astronomy magazine for kids, inabout 1982. Hoagland was now using science to argue that the Face was, in fact,an artificially constructed, mile-wide monument with symmetrical human features.Although it was heavily eroded and obviously ancient, you could still see thatthe left side was a typical-looking human face, whereas the right side had afeline appearance. This invited interesting and obvious comparisons with theSphinx. It would be twenty-three years before I found out that NASA believedthis was a monument to an Ancient Builder Race that had feline-human features.[../image/34_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Mirror Images of Left/Simian and Right/Feline Sides of the Face on MarsHoagland also had solid data on something I’d only heard vague rumorsabout—namely the idea that there were pyramid-like mountains on Mars as well.Now Ian was telling me that Hoagland and his team had found two different setsof pyramids, and both of them were built right next to the Face. There was onecluster of four-sided pyramids to the west that were remarkably symmetrical, andlooked like the ones we see in Egypt. There was a small cluster of objects inthe middle that Hoagland called the “City Square.” There was also a curioustriangular building just north of the pyramids that Hoagland called “the Fort.”The front end of this structure was positioned perfectly to watch the Sun risebehind the Face.There was another pyramid to the south that was at least twice as big as any ofthe others, and had five sides instead of four—creating the shape of a giantpentagon. The proportions of this pentagon were very interesting, because theyprecisely mirrored the shape of the human body. Instead of it being a perfectlysymmetrical five-sided geometry, it had the proportions of Leonardo Da Vinci’sclassic sketch of a man with his arms and legs stretched out, known as theVitruvian Man. This again suggests the architecture was built by humans—and whenyou combine it with the Face, it does not appear to be a natural formation.[../image/35_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Close-up of Viking Frame 35A76, Showing the Face on Mars and the Pyramids to theWestA NEW PHYSICSBest of all, Ian said that the video illustrated an incredible number ofmathematical alignments between these and other nearby objects. When you put itall together, these measurements apparently revealed an entirely new physicsthat Hoagland had been discussing with high-level insiders. The monuments wererevealing the keys for a system that could potentially give us anti-gravity,free energy, and other technological wonders I had been reading about, bytapping into the power of higher dimensions. Hoagland said this new physicsappeared in geometric, straight-lined patterns that actually revealed themselvesin nature—including the structure and behavior of the planets. This became thefirst step toward a robust knowledge of the “Global Grid,” which I presented inThe Source Field Investigations, and in earlier books that are free on mywebsite. The discussion is too technical to dive into in this volume, but it iswidely available.[../image/36_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Close-up of Viking Frame 70A13, Showing the Pentagonal Pyramid Just South of theFaceTHE FALL OF THE EMPIREThe Empire had hacked the protective moons of the grid built by the Guardiansand used these fearsome weapons to make war with other civilizations. Thiscreated the cosmic equivalent of a nuclear arms race. According to Bruce, it ismost likely that a rival civilization developed the same technology, or asimilarly massive super-weapon, and struck a death blow against the Empire.Their super-Earth was completely destroyed. Bruce said it was very unlikely thatanyone on Mars would have attacked their neighboring planet with that muchforce, since the tremendous explosion heavily damaged Mars as well, making thesurface unlivable. Other major assets of technology for the Empire may have beendeliberately targeted and destroyed in the attack as well. The destruction wasalmost total, and created incredible damage to the harmony of our solarsystem—as well as the entire Local Cluster that we are a part of. The entireprotective grid shut down.According to Brilliant Pebbles, the super-Earth exploded approximately 500,000years ago. The insiders used ships to identify different parts of the planet inthe asteroid belt, including crust, mantle, and core. The oceans flash-froze andbecame comets. Dr. Van Flandern’s own models revealed that all the comets traceback to a singular point of origin.216 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber215] He alsopredicted we would find asteroids with little moons, which his colleaguesheavily disagreed with. He was proven correct when, after Galileo images takenon August 28, 1993, were reviewed, asteroid Ida was found to be orbited byDactyl in February 1994.217 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber216] According to theViews of the Solar System website, “Dactyl is the first natural satellite of anasteroid ever discovered and photographed.”218 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber217]Dactyl is less than one cubic mile in size. In the Exploded Planet Hypothesis,many more of these will be found, since the fragments of the shattered planetcontinue to have gravitational attraction to one another as they come apart.Half of Mars was blasted with debris, creating a planet that now is heavilycratered on one side and almost completely blank on the other. Debris shotthroughout the solar system, causing incredible damage. The moons around Jupiterand Saturn were heavily bombarded. This is why Iapetus is black on one side andwhite on the other. Entire Death Star moons with massive internal cities wereutterly ruined, as well as a variety of spacecraft. Their fragments got pulledinto the gravity of Saturn and became the rings. The greatest concentration oftransparent-aluminum debris is at the edge of the B ring, where it forms shadowsthat NASA refers to as “ice boulders.” Bruce’s people believe a massivetransparent-aluminum ring was being built around Saturn and was destroyed.Gonzales told Corey that this was not true, and wanted to make sure I didn’tkeep repeating it. There are indeed transparent-aluminum ruins in Saturn’srings, built for seventy-foot-tall humans, but they are the remains ofcivilizations inside moons and spacecraft.THE MOON BECAME A DEATH TRAPAccording to Bruce, the Empire civilization could have been as large as atrillion people, and the vast majority of them died in this catastrophic event.Twelve to 16 billion members of the “warrior caste” were living inside the Moonas it was parked around the Earth. They had just enough time to make sureeveryone’s consciousness was uploaded into the Moon’s central AI core before thedebris hit. The destruction to the Moon was incredibly severe. The vast majorityof the computer systems were completely destroyed. Life support shut down, andonly the faintest glimmers of backup systems remained. Without life support, andwith the seismic jolts it took from wave after wave of debris, the Moon became acapsule of death. The vast majority of everyone living inside it died. Bodieswere everywhere. Even now, no one has had the staff, the time, or the resourcesto even begin to try to clean it up. Tompkins’s data suggests that this is notentirely true, and various ET civilizations have cleaned up and re-inhabiteddifferent regions inside the Moon—on a vast scale.According to Bruce, the consciousness of those 12 to 16 billion people is stilltrapped inside the Moon, which is still barely surviving on backup power. Coreyheard a variety of rumors of the same thing during his time in the SSP. Brucealso told me the 1956 film Forbidden Planet was an early disclosure to revealwhat was really found inside the Moon. We read the following in the user-basedwrite-ups on Internet Movie Database: “An expedition is sent from Earth toAltair in the constellation of Aquilae (some 17 light years from Earth) todiscover what happened to a colony of settlers on its fourth planet, Altair-4.What they discover is how and why an alien race of geniuses destroyed itselfovernight while leaving their technology intact at some point in the distant,distant past. . . . [The lead scientist on the planet] does reveal there onceexisted a far superior race, now extinct, that left a huge subterraneanindustrial and scientific complex.”219 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber218] Danielwas also aware that Forbidden Planet was a disclosure film about the Moon.REBUILDING AFTER THE ATTACKThe few who survived the disaster were overpowered by the gases and theimpossible scope of the horror that was all around them. They had no choice butto migrate up to the surface. With the central AI core almost completelydefeated except for emergency power, they lost much of their technology. Thepeople had no idea how to rebuild their former glory, since nanites had done allthe work. They still had very advanced capabilities, including the use oftransparent aluminum as a building material. Some of their ships survived aswell. They built the lunar obelisks, pyramids, and domes we mentioned in chapter16, and loaded them up with plants, animals, and water to try to re-create thecomforts of home.The survivors still had working spacecraft, and it appears that they builtsimilar structures on 433 Eros. This is considered “the single most importantasteroid ever discovered,” and has been known about in modern times since 1898.It has an orbit that crosses through the path of Mars, thus bringing it closerto Earth than many other asteroids. Its unique orbit has been used to calculatethe distance between the Earth and the Sun, known as the Astronomical Unit, orAU. The NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft gave us the first official close-ups of Erosas it flew by in 2000, and this led to NASA publishing a remarkable articlecalled “Square Craters” on September 26, 2000. Here is a quote from the officialNASA press release:Last month, astronomers were studying pictures of asteroid 433 Eros when theynoticed some unusual craters. Most impact craters are circular, but these weresquare! An overzealous fan of Star Trek might mistake the impact scars forplaces where cube-shaped Borg vessels touched down and lifted off again. . . .“These square craters are not just novelties, they tell us something veryinteresting,” says Andy Cheng of the Johns Hopkins University Applied PhysicsLaboratory. Cheng is the project scientist for NASA’s Near Earth AsteroidRendezvous spacecraft, which is orbiting Eros.220[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber219][../image/37_AscensionMysteries.jpg]“Square Craters” on Asteroid 433 ErosThere are a total of five square craters, which the head NASA scientist said are“telling us something very interesting.” The top two craters are the same sizebut slightly offset from each other, probably due to the internal structure ofthe asteroid. Another slightly larger square crater appears beneath them. Totheir right, a square crater exists that is about half as large. Then to theright of that crater, another crater appears that is half as large again, butstill maintains a square shape. Overall, this looks exactly like the collapsedrectangular pits we see next to the Blair Cuspids, which appear to be giantcrystal obelisks on the Moon.If you zoom in closely on the top-left crater, you see a white, tower-likestructure standing next to the upper-right corner of the square. It casts avisible shadow into the crater that reveals a very artificial-looking structure,akin to a geometric shard. NASA pointed this out as follows: “Note also theboulder perched just beyond the right hand rim of the top crater that looks likea bright speck in the image. The shape of the boulder can be seen by its shadow,which is cast onto the crater floor. The shadow shows that the boulder isdiamond shaped, and it appears to be standing on one tip.”221[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber220] Natural boulders are not likely to propthemselves up on one tip and have a geometric shape.[../image/38_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Detail of “Diamond-shaped Boulder Standing on Its Tip” on 433 ErosAnother image from Eros is even more provocative. Once again we see a group ofcraters that have square shapes. There is a larger square crater in the middle,with slightly smaller square craters to the left, right, and below. The squaresare not quite as easy to see, but you can still make them out. The crater on theright has a highly unusual geometric shape sitting in the middle of it. Thisobject is white, perfectly rectangular, and casts a long shadow, as if it were areflective building. It also has what looks like a long stairwell or road risingup into it from below. NASA doesn’t hide how geometric it is in their write-up:“The large, rectangular boulder at the upper right is 45 meters (148 feet)across.”222 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber221][../image/39_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Further “Square Craters” and a “Rectangular Boulder” on 433 ErosTOM CORBETT: SPACE CADET—IS IT A COINCIDENCE?Hoagland directed our attention to this rectangular boulder on Eros in aspectacular article he wrote on August 15, 2000. Hoagland revealed that he wasgiven a series of provocative View-Master slides by a Freemason in 1992.View-Master was a device that allowed you to look at pictures on little whitediscs in 3-D, with one image for each eye. You would read along in a storybookand flip through the pictures as the story continued. These slides were from thepopular Tom Corbett: Space Cadet series, which peaked from 1950 to 1955.Hoagland described what happened in this series, dating back to 1955, in thisnext excerpt: “In the story, an ancient civilization was found by ‘asteroidminers’ to have once existed on a former planet between Mars and Jupiter. Thiscivilization left behind a calling card: a series of ‘tetrahedral’ pyramids with‘magical’ properties—like anti-gravity—discovered in the Asteroid Belt and onthe Moon.”223 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber222] Hoagland’s article goes on toshow images of the original View-Master slides. My friend Patrick Blaine, atalented comic-book artist, was kind enough to help us out with modernreconstructions of the key images. You can also review the entire series, withthe images and the text, at the Solar Guard website.224[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber223][../image/40_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Close-up of “Rectangular Boulder” on 433 ErosThe story begins with a small pyramid found in the asteroid belt that hovers twofeet above the table as the miners look at it. Quoting Captain Strong from thefirst reel, “Scientists believe that millions of years ago another planetcircled the sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some unimaginablyviolent force shattered that planet, and its parts in the form of thousands ofAsteroids still swing around the sun in roughly the same orbit.”“Then this discovery means there was a planet,” puts in Tom Corbett. “A planetpeopled by an ancient race whose science was far beyond ours!” This object leadsthem to the Moon, where they find a pyramid. The first of the three View-Masterreels is entitled “The Moon Pyramid” for this same reason.[../image/41_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Scene from Tom Corbett: Space Cadet Illustrating Transparent Pyramid on the Moonwith a Map to MarsThe pyramid on the Moon has a flat top, which creates a perfect fit with thesmall capstone they found. Once they put the capstone on the pyramid, whichpresents the viewer with an obvious Cabal symbol, the pyramid transforms into atransparent, crystalline material. In the View-Master slide the crystal has areddish color. Corey Goode confirmed that certain additives can create colors intransparent aluminum. Inside the pyramid is an image of Mars, complete with adot on it that seems to be a treasure map. The astronauts go to Mars, whichcarries us into the second reel, “The Red Planet.”Things get even more outrageous at this point—and remember, this was publishedin 1955. Quoting from the text of reel two, “We’re looking for clues to anancient race who may have had the secret of anti-gravity. . . .”“This map fragment may narrow the search for us,” Joan says. “Notice thepyramid. Once over 1000 feet high, it no longer exists. We know its former sitequite accurately. We will hunt there first.”225[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber224] Once they arrive at the ruined pyramid site,they find a statue of a feline-faced being. Obelisks stand nearby.[../image/42_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Scene from Tom Corbett: Space Cadet Illustrating Feline-shaped Face with Map tothe Asteroid BeltThe sculpture in the View-Master slide has remarkable similarities to the Faceon Mars. The map on the sculpture leads them back to the asteroid belt. Asupercomputer crunches the data and reveals which asteroid they are supposed togo to: “Its number is XKG-385fr. It was telescopically discovered in 1993 buthas never been visited since it is just one of thousands of Asteroids less thana mile in diameter.”226 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber225] The NEAR mission thatphotographed the square craters, the diamond-shaped tower, and the rectangular“boulder” on Eros was approved by NASA in 1993—the same year in the View-Masterstory. Hoagland suggests that this is another example of NASA using ceremonialdates, and is not a coincidence.When the group makes their way to the asteroid in the third reel, they find anancient-looking entrance—very similar to the rectangular boulder on 433 Eros.Once they go inside, they end up discovering a holographic “Hall of Records” ofan ancient feline-looking race. Tom Corbett describes one of the beings ashaving lived “a billion years ago.”The female crew member Dr. Dale spends hours studying the holographic records ofthis race, and concludes, “Eight hundred million years ago, . . . anotherplanet, which they called ‘Varth,’ circled the sun between Mars and Jupiter. Thesun was young then, and its intense radiation warmed this planet 250 millionmiles away, enabling a race of six-limbed creatures to evolve. They struggled upthrough ignorance, disease, famine, and war until they reached undreamed ofheights of social and scientific achievements. They derived power from thecomplete destruction of matter, conquered gravity, and reached the stars with amany-times-faster-than-light drive. But tidal and volcanic forces beyond eventheir control began to tear their planet apart. . . . This race fled to thestars. Knowing that life would come to the cooling inner planets, they came backlater to build the Time Tomb and leave clues to its existence. Now theirdescendants live somewhere among the stars, probably forgetting that this wastheir birthplace!”227 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber226]The idea that these people had six limbs is obviously a distortion, as is theblending of the Ancient Builder Race and the more recent Empire. It is normalfor these types of disclosure to have a certain degree of disinformation blendedin deliberately, but here there really isn’t very much. Willy Ley was openlylisted as a science consultant for these slides.228[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber227] Along with ex-German scientist Wernher VonBraun, Ley was one of the founding fathers of NASA, having worked directly withsome of the builders of the original V-2 rocket and written up the history inhis book Rockets, Missiles and Space Travel.229[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber228] 230 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber229]THE US ENTERS THE SECRET SPACE PROGRAMIt is only after Corey Goode came forward that I understood how NASA’s foundingfathers could have already obtained this information in 1955. Corey was toldthat the Germans were the first to make it out into our solar system, as earlyas the late 1930s. They found the ruins of the Ancient Builder Race, the Empire,and the exploded planet. The photographs of advanced ruins on Mars that Jacobshowed me appeared to be very old, and were all notated in German. WilliamTompkins encountered similar information firsthand in 1942–45, by interviewingmore than one thousand American spies who had been embedded in Germany.According to Dr. Michael Salla, Tompkins’s first job in Naval Intelligencecaused him to be “directly involved in debriefings by Navy spies embedded inNazi Germany’s most advanced aerospace projects—some of which involvedantigravity flying saucers that were capable of space flight. Tompkins’s job wasto design intelligence briefing packets based on the Navy spies’ debriefings,and to then deliver these packages to leading US aerospace corporations, thinktanks, and universities for study and evaluation. Tompkins describes how from1942 to 1945 he participated in more than a thousand debriefings of US Navyspies, who had been embedded in leading Nazi Germany aerospace corporationsinvolved in building flying saucers.”231 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber230]The Germans also found extremely advanced ancient cities in thermal pocketsunder the ice in Antarctica, and reoccupied them. This was the beginning ofNeuberlin, or what Pete Peterson called Ice Station Zebra. The Americans foundout about this base after interrogating captured German scientists. The US triedto invade Antarctica under the command of Admiral William Byrd in 1947, in whatwas called Project High Jump. Byrd’s huge fleet of ships and planes was heavilydamaged by German anti-gravity flying craft, and they limped home. Cover storieswere released that they found “the hollow earth”—a completely hollow interior tothe planet with a small sun in the center—in order to discredit any soldiers whotried to leak what really happened.The German faction continued trying to force the US into a deal where they wouldform a space program together, but the US kept resisting. The Germans finallytriggered the US into action when they flew over the US capitol building in1952. A fleet of “flying saucers” was witnessed by many people and officialstatements had to be issued by the military. The US did not want to reveal thesecrets of Roswell, and they were having trouble understanding how to build UFOsout of the wreckage. They decided to work with the Germans since they were beingaggressively blackmailed, and they needed the German technology. It took threeyears to hammer out the details in hostile negotiations. The United States hadhoped they would be able to infiltrate and defeat the Germans once they formed apartnership, but the opposite took place—at least in the space program.By 1955, the US was fully briefed on all the intel the Germans had discovered,and the “Brain Drain” began. According to Pete Peterson and other insiders, 55to 60 million people were brought up into space over the next decade, and theimmigration has been ongoing ever since. The View-Master series from this sameyear, 1955, was the first major disclosure of what the Americans had learned—andit is just as relevant today as ever.MAN AND THE ARTIFACTS ON THE MOONThe ex-German father of NASA, Wernher Von Braun, appeared on a very populartelevision show called Disney’s Wonderful World of Color on December 28, 1955,in an episode entitled “Man on the Moon.”232 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber231]Its obvious purpose, according to Hoagland, was to inspire the public to investmassive funds into a space program, which became NASA two and a half yearslater. According to various insiders, NASA was one of a variety of fundingsources used to help kick-start the secret space program. Wars were overpricedand defense budgets were secretly reallocated to the effort. Illegal businessessuch as drug smuggling and gun running were infiltrated and used as profitsources. The financial sector produced excellent profits through fraud andcorruption. The Apollo missions were billed to the public as being far moreexpensive than they actually cost at the time, which was $25 billion in 1960sdollars. All this was deemed a necessary sacrifice in this massive, highlyclassified effort to colonize our solar system with the industrial might of theUnited States and its military-industrial complex.[../image/43_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Reconstruction of Lunar Ruins Appearing in the “Man and the Moon” TV Specialfrom 1955In the show, Von Braun leads the viewer through a hypothetical trip to the Moon.As the astronauts orbit the dark side, they pick up a high radiation signatureat thirty-three degrees. The number thirty-three is of key significance to theCabal, such as it being the highest official rank in Scottish Rite Freemasonry.This is one of the groups that is used to recruit people into the Cabal due tothe secrecy they all must maintain. As the show goes on, a radar operator seesan unusual formation on the lunar surface, and they fire off a flare to look atit. The music shrieks into intense dissonance as the flare lights up an image ofobvious ruins on the Moon. Von Braun, the narrator of the show, never said aword about it—but the implications were very obvious. NASA was soon given thego-ahead and was officially founded on July 29, 1958.THE FACE ON MARS APPEARED IN 1958All the photographs of ruins we have surveyed in previous chapters were notproduced until the mid-1960s at the earliest. NASA wasn’t founded until 1958,but they clearly knew what they were going to find—including a Face and pyramidson Mars. This appears to be why Harvey Comics released a comic strip called “TheFace on Mars” in their second issue of the Race for the Moon series, fromSeptember 1958.233 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber232] These comics were intendedto get people excited about space travel and ensure that NASA funding wouldcontinue. The author, Jack Kirby, had easily traceable ties to the founders ofNASA.234 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber233] Comics and other pop-culture mediasources are routinely used to provide us with disclosure disguised as fiction.How did Kirby know we would find a giant monument on Mars in the shape of ahuman face almost twenty years ahead of time?“The Face on Mars” was summarized on the Comic Book Resources website in 2003,and it contains very familiar-sounding themes: “On an expedition from theEarth’s moon to the planet Mars, an international team of astronauts—led byAmerican Ben Fisher—discover a huge carving of a Martian face that’s as big as amountain! Ascending to the inscrutable statue’s hollow eyes, Fisher plungesinside, where he finds a green, sunlit countryside with cool, rich andbreathable air, one which shelters a civilization of ‘magnificent giants.’ . . .Fisher explains that the statue contains ‘a visual history of a race’s heroicdeath—and the triumph of a surviving memory.’ Later, as they pilot theirrocket [through the asteroid belt], Fisher and his team take careful notice ofthe debris—‘the pieces of a planet that blew up between Mars and Jupiter.’”235[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber234]Hoagland pointed out this remarkable connection in his 2006 article “ForbiddenPlanet Mars.” On August 15, 2012, a website called the Secret Sun revealed thatseveral other comics also contained images suggestive of the Face on Mars.“Shortly before Kirby wrote ‘The Face on Mars,’ he wrote another, similar storycalled ‘The Great Stone Face,’ about an ancient astronaut cargo cult (way, way,way before such things were fashionable in comics). ‘The Face on Mars’ seemsvery much to be a sequel/companion to this story.”236[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber235][../image/44_AscensionMysteries.jpg]“The Face on Mars” Comic from September 1958The author then goes on to reveal that Kirby returned to this same Face onMars–type theme in 1976, with the comic Eternals #1. “The cover of Eternals #1has it all; the intrepid explorers, the underground temple and the giant stonehead (representing yet another race of giant aliens). Something was bugging thisguy—he could not let go of these motifs. . . . Eternals #1 was cover-dated July1976, the same month the Viking photos revealed the ‘Face’ on the plains ofCydonia.”237 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber236] This again bears all thehallmarks of a military-industrial-complex/Cabal-sponsored “coordinated release”of information, in which they hide the truth out in the open. In the event of afuture disclosure, they can say they were telling us all along, but we were notperceptive or fearless enough to listen.THE GENETIC FARMERSAfter the super-Earth was destroyed 500,000 years ago, Corey’s intel revealedthat the protective grid for our entire Local Cluster went down. This allowed amass immigration of different groups that had been excluded up until then. Thefirst groups arrived almost immediately, and are known to the SSP as the“Genetic Farmers.” The SSP tends to see these groups in a negative fashion, butmany of the beings themselves feel they have our best spiritual intentions atheart. They know that our Earth is a rare jewel. According to Jacob and otherinsiders, most planets can support only about 100,000 unique forms of life,whereas we know that Earth is currently estimated as having 8.7 million.238[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber237] Jacob, Corey, Bruce, and other insiders havesaid the Earth has a very complex and hyper-advanced “wave structure” thatsupports an incredible diversity of life. This makes us even more of a bluezone, because almost any life from anywhere in the galaxy can be dropped off onour planet and survive.The Genetic Farmers took sections of DNA from all over the galaxy and spliced itinto the humans on Earth at the time. This DNA was intended to optimize us forascension. There are now sixty different active ET groups working on a total oftwenty-two different genetic programs that are still ongoing. These so-calledGenetic Farmers identify themselves as the Super-Federation. The DNA upgradeshave caused us to be far more emotional than most ETs out there. These emotionscan be a great weakness when we get dragged into repetition compulsion, but theyalso can springboard us into ascension much faster than most other human racesever could. Certain negative ET groups will abduct people on Earth and splicesome of their DNA into their own bodies, combining some of our genetic materialwith theirs. Once the ETs hit their “upgraded” genetic material with an energyfield akin to what our Sun is preparing to release, they temporarily developascended abilities. The negative groups are terrified of what we will becomeonce this DNA is activated, because our abilities will be much greater thantheirs—and we can clean up the mess that they caused. Multiple ancientprophecies, likely written by extraterrestrial humans, predict this exactsequence of events.THE DRACOThe next major incursion was of the Draco, or what the Law of One refers to asthe Orion Confederation. According to Jacob, this is a group of six differentreptilian humanoid species. He told me they have genetically intermingled somuch that each of the six is actually a different gender, and that they “trend”from male to female. This was not thoroughly explained, other than that thesedifferent “genders” could look like completely different species. According toCorey, there is a master race among them that is twelve to thirteen feet tall.The top leaders are white. Another high-ranking group is sable black. Thewarrior caste has red scales. Still others have skin that is a combination oftan and green scales. Contrary to popular belief, none of these people arestrictly green.The Draco “master race” traveled throughout the galaxy, looking for otherhumanoid groups that evolved out of reptilian life. Everywhere they found thislife, they infiltrated, mixed their DNA together with them, and brought theminto their Empire. They are very warlike, and according to Jacob they have beenlargely defeated throughout the galaxy already. Our Local Cluster is one of theonly places left where they can live. It does appear that our collective conceptof the Devil has been influenced by this very real situation. According toTompkins, there are two massive underground caverns in Antarctica that holdhuge, highly populated cities of the Draco. Corey’s SSP insiders suggest thenumber of Draco in our solar system is comparable to Earth’s own visiblepopulation of 7 billion people.The Draco feed off the energy of fear, sadness, depression, selfishness,narcissism, anger, hatred, and jealousy. They are utterly dependent upon thisenergy for their survival. The Cabal calls this “loosh,” and directly associatesthat word with Lucifer. Hence they have a saying, “Give Lucius his loosh.” Asoutrageous as this must sound, the Draco are ultimately controlling the Cabal.Although the Draco have been around for 375,000 years, many insiders confirmthat they made a deal with the Nazis, beginning as early as 1913. This appearedto have initially occurred through telepathy, such as in the Vril and Thulesocieties, and later progressed to in-person meetings. Tompkins extensivelydebriefed American embedded spies who confirmed this from 1942 to 1945, whileworking for Naval intelligence.In his second video interview with Dr. Michael Salla, Tompkins said thefollowing: “The SS had many separate classified meetings . . . [which turned]into a whole series of programs. This then was disseminated through theirspecific military communication. . . . Now in addition to that, they had, if youwant to call them, ‘consultants,’ who were Reptilian consultants assisting onall of these different things that it takes to design and build these spacecraftcarriers and propulsion systems. So this was an extremely well-developed programand documented like crazy. Getting copies of the documents was hard for ourspies. This was an open program in the upper level of the SS. . . . Thousands ofengineering groups were working different aspects to all of this. Some of themhad the vehicles, others [were given] a vehicle to reverse engineer, so theycould become familiar with everything from the inside out. . . . The [Reptilian]mission was to take over the planet, kill off all of the ones that were aproblem, and make slaves out of [everyone else]. The second phase was to leavethe planet with large squadrons of UFOs, after you’ve got them all built, and dothe same thing to other stars’ planets.”239 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber238]Many of the Cabal’s actions do not seem to make any sense. Why would they wantto destroy so many people’s lives and keep us all in terror and depression? Theanswer is that this generates loosh for the Draco, according to Jacob, Bruce,Corey, Pete, and all the others. Most interesting, Jacob told me that ifeveryone on Earth were happy for even one day, such as in some kind of globallyinspiring event, the Draco would be utterly defeated. Furthermore, their owntime-viewing technology shows their downfall is a certainty as we ascend. Theyare doing everything they can to try to stop it, but every plan they have madehas been foiled. After we ascend, only a small number of them will survive forabout 1.5 million years before they disappear completely. In the higher“densities,” you experience time very differently—so in their terms this eventis not very far away.Another bizarre piece of intel that has come to light from Corey Goode andothers is that the Draco have been aggressively using mind-control technologyagainst us ever since our origin on Earth. Corey specifically said thistechnology is stopping us from being able to form a telepathic, collectiveconsciousness. According to Jacob, the technology uses an artificialintelligence to monitor our thoughts and steer us away from any information thatwould help us grow spiritually, such as by making us suddenly feel tired. Partof this technology involves the use of large spacecraft that are cloaked in lowearth orbit, as well as other systems inside the Earth and the Moon. Thepatriotic militaries of the United States and other nations now have thecapability of shooting down the orbiting craft and deactivating this technologythrough advanced weapons strikes.However, once the “grid” goes down, we will all get a sudden change inconsciousness that could be extremely disturbing, even lethal, to some. Peoplewho tend toward violence, irrational behavior, and fear could have thosequalities greatly amplified. Others who are positive and loving will quicklydevelop stunning new abilities, which could include levitation and telekinesis,as well as telepathy. Thanks to our position within the superchargedinterstellar energy cloud we are moving into, these changes would apparentlyhave already happened to us if Draco technologies were not being used againstus. It does not appear that our militaries can turn off the Draco mind-controlgrid in stages. Once they attack it, or perhaps once the solar flash destroys itfor them, the entire control system disappears from our minds—and we experiencea quantum consciousness shift. This may sound ridiculous to you, but for thepeople in the classified military programs, it is a highly serious issue. Theydo know the grid will go down, whether by their own strikes or from massiveelectromagnetic pulses that are expected to emanate from the Sun."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTHE COSMIC BATTLE BECOMES PERSONALThe survivors from the Empire migrated to the surface of the Moon 500,000 yearsago. They dropped dramatically in height during this time, since they wereliving on a much smaller body, but they continued to be extremely warlike,aggressive, and negative. From all the intel I have gathered from varioussources, including Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales, Bruce, and Pete Peterson, itappears that the entire Moon was hit with a devastating attack approximately55,000 years ago. It is not clear who did this to the Empire, but it wasprobably the Draco. Corey said the Moon appears to have been hit with a clusterbomb–type weapon. The glass domes were shattered and immediately depressurized,killing almost everyone inside. It is important to point out that spiritualprotection is not given to those on the negative path. Mega-events like thesegenerate karmic balance that prevents these groups from damaging the lives ofpeaceful civilizations.THE FALLEN ANGELS CRASH-LANDED 55,000 YEARS AGOOnly a very small number of people from the Empire survived in some of theirfatally wounded ships. They had just enough energy left to crash-land on Earth.Pete’s intel was that this happened 60,000 years ago. Gonzales’s intel, whichappears to be more recent, is that it happened 55,000 years ago. These peoplebecame the “fallen angels” you read about in the Book of Genesis. They no longerhad the ability to leave the Earth’s orbit. When I put together all thedifferent sources of intel, and make the most educated guess, it appears thatthese people were twelve- to thirteen-foot-tall giants with elongated skulls.According to Gonzales, they were not well adapted to Earth’s gravity, nor itsatmosphere and germs. They were very frail, but were able to use their advancedmedical technology to survive.Their surviving damaged ships allowed them to spread across the Earth.Everywhere they went, they set up control systems and established themselves asgods. Their IQ was many tens of points higher than everyone else’s on Earth, andthey were giants. They had advanced technology that allowed them to manufactureall the food they needed with the push of a button. They established a veryadvanced civilization in what is now the Sahara Desert. According to Bruce, PetePeterson, Jacob, Corey, and others, there is a huge treasure trove of ruinsunderneath the Sahara Desert. This includes many different structures built outof giant stone blocks. It also includes a variety of libraries containing theirmost precious books. These books trace all the way back to the original Empireon Mars and the super-Earth. The highlands of their civilization were in Egypt.The Egyptian priesthood later located the books. Peterson was lucky enough tosee some of the books firsthand in the Vatican Library as part of a highlyclassified US government program. Some had very advanced diagrams of bases,mother ships, and smaller spacecraft. Many were leather-bound and had one solidcolor on the back and front covers, such as red, blue, or green.According to Bruce, the Egyptian monuments create an “arrow” that points towardLibya—if you know what you are looking for. Some of the best artifacts are underthe sand in Libya. The best artifacts were found at one of the mouths of theGreat Man-Made River, which rises up out of the desert from the Nubian Sandstonefossil aquifer system. This river supplies an astonishing six and a half millioncubic meters of fresh water per day to Libya, covering a vast distance of 1,750miles. It is the world’s largest irrigation project, and Gaddafi referred to itas the “Eighth Wonder of the World.” Bruce indicated that this river is a“tapped well” that rises up from the ocean inside the Earth, thus explaining howit seems to appear out of nowhere. Many astonishingly high-tech artifacts havebeen dug up near one of the mouths of this river, and it is considered the mostadvanced site of its kind on Earth. This is why top Cabal people worked withMuammar Gaddafi, the leader of Libya from 1969 to 2011, and allowed him tocoordinate his own archeological expeditions. This is also apparently whyGaddafi was assassinated, and why his son Faith is now being “held prisoner in acell the size of a cardboard box.” Faith still knows more than he has revealedto the Cabal, which is why he is still alive at this time.ANCIENT EARTH PYRAMIDSAccording to various insiders, the “fallen angel” civilization of giants wasutterly destroyed 50,000 years ago. The damage was so extreme that all the lushgreenery in the area of the Sahara Desert was overwhelmed and covered in dust.Part of this was the work of their enemies, and part of it was the natural Earthchanges that take place every 25,000 years. The survivors suffered a dramaticreduction in their power and scope after this defeat. They were very well awarethat the Guardians did this to them, and instead of seeking to reform, theycontinued to be warlike. Although they had far less technology than in theirprevious cycle, they gradually rose to become a pyramid-building culture onceagain,In January 2014, a perfect pyramid was discovered beneath the ocean off thecoast of Portugal. According to an article that announced this, “Portuguese newsreported the discovery of a very large underwater pyramid first discovered byDiocleciano Silva between the islands of São Miguel and Terceira in the Azoresof Portugal. According to claims, the structure is said to be perfectly squaredand oriented by the cardinal points. Current estimates obtained using GPSdigital technology put the height at 60 meters with a base of 8000 squaremeters. . . . The pyramid was found in an area of the mid-Atlantic that has beenunderwater for about 20,000 years.”240 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber239] Ofcourse, the pyramid could have been built well before the time it finally sank.This story was also covered by the International Business Times, which revealedthat the pyramid was larger than a football field.241[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber240]Similarly, Dr. Semir Osmanagich used radiocarbon dating to prove that themysterious Pyramid of the Sun in Bosnia is at least 29,000 years old. Thispyramid is twice the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza, and is perfectlysymmetrical, other than a large buildup of dirt and debris on one side—probablyin the aftermath of a major Earth change. Here is a quote from the announcement:“‘Conclusive data at the Bosnian Pyramid site revealed in 2008 and confirmedthis year by several independent labs who conducted radiocarbon testing datesthe site at 29,400 +/-400 years minimum.’ The radiocarbon dating tests of 29,200years plus or minus 400 years was done by Radiocarbon Lab from Kiew, Ukraine, onorganic material found at the Bosnian Pyramid site.”242[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber241]Another cyclical catastrophe took place 25,000 years ago, further knocking the“fallen angels” back. Their level of technology was again reduced, but once morethey rose to prominence in the civilization most people call Atlantis. Some ofthe survivors still had relatively high technology and pyramid-buildingcapabilities, whereas others were isolated and more primitive. This is where thelegends become much clearer and easier to identify. In the Book of Enoch, these“fallen angels” are referred to as the Watchers.THE BOOK OF ENOCH AND THE ATLANTEAN FLOODThe Bible and other related documents appear to present extensive evidence ofextraterrestrials on Earth and in our skies. Words that we have always thoughtwe knew, like “God” and “heaven,” might actually mean something entirelydifferent. On the Bible Reality Check website, W. L. Graham writes: “Manyotherwise literate students of theology are unaware that the Hebrew writers ofthe biblical literature communicated their belief in a vast race ofextraterrestrial gods whom they called ‘the Elohim.’ . . . While thisdistinctive plural noun [Elohim] found in the Bible texts some 2,570 times iswell-known by scholars to be accurately translated ‘Mighty Ones,’ it is almostalways rendered [as the word] ‘God.’ . . . Also noteworthy is a more correctrendering of [the word] ‘heaven’ (Heb. Shameh/shamayim, or Gr. Ouranos) inunambiguous modern terms such as cosmos, universe, or outer space in allbiblical passages that refer to the extraterrestrial Elohim. . . . Not only werethe Elohim actively involved in earthly conflicts and conquests in the ancientworld, but they also engaged in battles of cosmic proportions, ‘star wars’ ifyou prefer, with alien adversaries who are always portrayed as inherentlymalevolent.”243 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber242]One of the most important ancient scriptures, the Book of Enoch never made itinto the Bible. There are hundreds of references to it in the New Testament,including from Jesus, who quotes from it directly. It was lost to the sands oftime and only rediscovered by the open Western world when the Scottish travelerRobert Bruce brought back three copies from Abyssinia in 1773, and then RichardLaurence translated it into English as of 1821.Multiple insiders have confirmed that the governments of this period were oftencontrolled by negative forces and did not want sensitive information to leak outto the public, just like we see now. The first verse is a clue as to why theBook of Enoch might not have made the cut: “The words of the blessing of Enoch,wherewith [the Elohim] blessed the elect and righteous, who will be living inthe day of tribulation, when all the wicked and godless are to be removed.”The second and third verses become even more interesting, particularly if wecorrect “heaven” as “outer space” and “God” as “mighty ones:” “[I am] Enoch, arighteous man whose eyes were opened by the mighty ones. [I] saw the vision ofthe Holy One in outer space, which the angels showed me. From them I heardeverything, and from them I understood—as I saw, not for this generation, butfor a remote one which is for to come.”How are the “wicked and godless” going to be “removed” in the Book of Enoch? Theanswer appears right at the beginning, from 1:3–9. Once again, we hear a similar“solar flash” scenario as what appears in many other scriptures and sources wehave discussed. Though masculine pronouns are used, this passage ends upreferring to a full team of benevolent ETs:The Holy Great One will come forth from His dwelling, and the eternal God willtread upon the earth . . . and appear in the strength of His might from theheaven of heavens. And all shall be smitten with fear. The Watchers shall quakeand great fear and trembling shall seize them unto the ends of the earth. Thehigh mountains shall be shaken, and the high hills shall be made low, and shallmelt like wax before the flame. . . . All that is upon the earth shall perish,and there shall be a judgment upon all. But with the righteous He will makepeace. . . . Light shall appear unto them, and He will make peace with them. Andbehold! He cometh with ten thousands of His holy ones to execute judgment uponall, and to destroy all the ungodly.Who are the “ungodly” and “wicked ones” in the Book of Enoch? We find out thatthese people were ETs known as the Watchers, who began interbreeding with nativeEarth humans and creating giants. They had been warned by the Elohim that ifthey did this, they would be destroyed, but they disobeyed. This next passage isfrom Enoch 6:1–3. “And it came to pass when the children of men had multipliedthat in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And theangels, the children of the heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to oneanother: ‘Come, let us choose us wives from among the children of men and begetus children.’”244 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber243]In chapter 7, we hear that the Watchers brought civilization to the humans, buteventually turned on them. “And when men could no longer sustain them, thegiants turned against them and devoured mankind. And they began to sin againstbirds, and beasts, and reptiles, and fish, and to devour one another’s flesh,and drink the blood. Then the Earth laid accusation against the lawlessones.”245 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber244] The benevolent ETs informed thegiants that they were going to be wiped out for what they had done. The giantsthen used Enoch to beg for forgiveness, but they were denied.This narrative continues in 15:3–10, as the Elohim turn down the Watchers’request to be spared the effects of a planet-wide catastrophe: “Wherefore haveye left the high, holy, and eternal universe, and lain with women, and defiledyourselves with the daughters of men and taken to yourselves wives, and donelike the children of earth, and begotten giants [as your] sons? . . . You wereformerly spiritual, living the eternal life, and immortal for all generations ofthe world. And therefore I have not appointed wives for you; for as for thespiritual ones of the heaven, in outer space is their dwelling. And now, thegiants, who are produced from the spirits and flesh, shall be called evilspirits upon the earth, and on the earth shall be their dwelling. Evil spiritshave proceeded from their bodies; because they are born from men and from theholy Watchers is their beginning and primal origin.”The book reveals that the giants were wiped out in an epic flood, but alsoindicates that some survived. A future event, which is referred to as “the dayof the consummation,” would finish the job—and in context it sounds like theepic solar flash.From the days of the slaughter and destruction and death of the giants, from thesouls of whose flesh the spirits, having gone forth, shall destroy withoutincurring judgment—thus shall they destroy until the day of the consummation,the great judgment in which the age shall be consummated, over the Watchers andthe godless, yea, shall be wholly consummated. (16:1–2)THE SURVIVING GIANTSJust as the Book of Enoch indicated, giants from this civilization did surviveall over the Earth after the epic Atlantean flood. They were often reduced to aprimitive level, such as in the Americas. They continued to build mounds, evenif only out of dirt, to commemorate their ancient legacy. There is an incredibleamount of excellent research to be done on the widespread presence of gianthumans throughout the world. Jim Vieria has identified fully one thousand, fivehundred different newspaper reports of these findings within credible sourcessuch as the New York Times. Let’s now read an excerpt from a description of aconference featuring Jim Vieria and Hugh Newman that took place in November2015, as their research is very impressive and verifiable.For a long time, it was thought giants were just part of folklore, but recentresearch into old documents, newspapers, journals, first hand reports, and oldphotos now suggest that these may have been a reality. It is the discoveries inthe mounds and megalithic sites of North America that have created a hugecontroversy, because there are at least 1500 reports of a giant race, some withdouble rows of teeth, horned skulls, powerful jaws, and elongated craniums, whoruled the continent since at least 7,000 BC. They were mostly found in ancientmounds and have been reported as going up to a staggering 18 feet tall. Oftenthey have strange bronze armour, red and blonde hair, unusual skulls and aphysique suggesting that some of them may not be native to North America. Mostreports range the heights between 7 ft and 12 ft, but it still doesn’t answerthe question of why this part of history has been so meticulously covered up.246[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber245]From New England, to Miami, Ohio and California, these giant skeletons have beendug up in the thousands, yet when the Smithsonian Institution got involved theymysteriously vanished. The Native American NAGPRA Act of 1990 removed the finalbones from museum displays, so there is now little evidence to go on, but thereports, photos, excavations and eye-witness accounts—even from Abraham Lincolnand other luminaries—suggest that the history books are on the verge of beingrewritten.247 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber246]I have seen only one example of a skull with horns, and I am not convinced ofits authenticity. The double sets of teeth are far more common. Many of theseskulls were large enough that you could slip them over your head. There areseveral excellent books on giants that are jam-packed with research. It isoutside the scope of this book to review most of that data. I found PatrickChouinard’s Lost Race of the Giants useful. Originally I intended this book tojust be research based, until I had a variety of dreams urging me to cover thepersonal side of things in detail. This is truly the core of the ascensionprocess, and without that spiritual side of things, the information itself isnot necessarily going to connect with the heart. Ascension is not a myth—it is avery real process that is extensively predicted both in a wide variety ofancient cultures as well as in the research of insiders from the secret spaceprogram.Chouinard shares legends from other cultures that are remarkably similar to theBook of Enoch’s message. Here is a quote from page 129 of his book. “Accordingto Aztec myth, during the first age, or Sun, the gods Quetzalcoatl andTezcatlipoca created a race of giants from ashes, giving them acorns fornourishment. But the giants so enraged the gods due to their wickedness that thegods decided to end the giants’ existence and sent the jaguars to destroy them.Only seven survived the onslaught of the savage beasts.”248[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber247]Chouinard also quotes from Lucy Thompson’s 1916 book, To The American Indian, inwhich she discusses her memories as a member of a Native American tribe livingnear the Klamath River known as the Yurok. An indigenous white-skinned group ofgiants known as the Wa-gas were already there when the Yurok arrived. In thiscase, as in other examples of surviving giants, they had become peaceful and didnot try to hurt or cannibalize others. According to Thompson, “The recollectionstransmitted by the Wa-gas were that these giants were very cruel and wicked. Itwas said that God became displeased with them and destroyed them and they allperished from the earth.”249 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber248]When you do your research, you find out that giants continued to live on Earthup until as late as the 1800s. Many of them had not reformed and turned on thenative people and were cannibalistic. According to Bruce, many Native Americantribes banded together in their struggle to defend themselves against thegiants. Lewis and Clark encountered giants on their historic exploration ofAmerica, which was well documented in Paul Schrag and Xaviant Haze’s TheSuppressed History of America. The amount of information to share and revealabout giants is so robust that I could easily write another book just focusingon that part of the story. The legends and discoveries are truly worldwide.Jacob revealed that the Cabal has been extremely focused on eliminating allevidence of giants from the public. The Smithsonian Institution was frequentlyused for this purpose in the 1800s and on into the 1900s. Their tactics used toinclude destroying any skeletons that were found, such as by dumping them out atsea. Now they are considered precious relics of the ancestors of the Cabal, andare kept preserved. Anyone who finds these types of skeletons or artifacts willbe immediately contacted and “strongly encouraged” not to go public.PEOPLE WITH ELONGATED SKULLSThe next mystery in this story is that apparently some descendants of the giantsretained the elongated skull, but decreased in height to conventional humanlevels. Jacob indicated there are still people like this living on Earth, andthey are concentrated in the Vatican. Pete revealed very similar information.The World Bank whistle-blower Karen Hudes recently came forward and said thesame thing, based on information she had from an insider. She refers to thisgroup as “Homo Capensis,” and her sources told her these people are running theCabal.There is a second species on this planet. They are not extraterrestrials. . . .The remnants of their civilizations are all over the place. . . . This group haslarge brains. They are very distinct from Homo Sapiens. . . . One of the placesthey’ve been hiding is in the Vatican. That’s why the Vatican are wearing thosemiters. That’s also what the high priests wore in the early beginnings ofJudaism. Moses was actually Akenhaten, who was a pharaoh. They know this becausethe papyri that was taken from one of the pyramids talks about this. The peoplewho are doing archeology in Israel know this. . . .250[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber249]Not only is Homo Capensis trying to keep human beings under control by divideand conquer, using our money system, they’ve also been doing this with ourreligions. . . . I sent an email to a fellow in Portugal, and the next day hewent to a meeting of bankers. He sent me back an email saying that at thatmeeting, there had been a big-skulled individual with bright blue eyes. . . .Their skulls are all over the planet. It’s not a conspiracy theory. Just becausethis group likes to hide, and likes to accuse people of having conspiracytheories, doesn’t make these facts wrong. They are facts!251[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber250]This may sound impossible to fathom, but as I did the research for this book, Ifound multiple examples of graves where elites with elongated skulls wereburied. This first story appeared in November 2013: “The skeleton of an ancientaristocratic woman whose head was warped into a deformed, pointy shape has beenunearthed in a necropolis in France. . . . [Philippe Lefranc, an archeologist,said,] ‘In France, Germany and eastern Europe, these deformed skulls appear intombs rich in objects.’252 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber251] Brien Foerster hasfound many elongated skulls in Peru, some still with long hair on them.”253[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber252] 254 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber253]Another “conehead” skull was unearthed in Russia and covered on Russia Today:Archeologists are puzzled over the ancient remains of a woman discovered on asite near Chelyabinsk, a Russian city to the east of the Ural Mountains. Theapproximately 2,000 year old skeleton boasts an oddly shaped skull. The“conehead” skeleton of a woman from the Sarmati tribe, unearthed at thearchaeological site of Arkaim, a 4,000-year-old settlement, has totally thrilledUFO hunters. . . . Arkaim, situated in Russia’s Southern Urals, is oftencompared to England’s Stonehenge because it was also used for star observations.The Russian observatory, however, is said to have been more technologicallyadvanced and have more favorable conditions for astronomical observation.255[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber254]Elongated skulls were also found at a dig in Omsk, Siberia. Their appearancedisturbed the workers so much that some of them cried and many refused to work,feeling terrified. According to the Russian media source ITN, “Scholars at theOmsk Museum of History and Culture have no conclusive answer as to the originsof these skulls, which were found in burial mounds that are believed to datefrom the 4th century A.D. Because of the skulls’ bizarre shape they do not showthem to the public, fearing that people might be too shocked. ‘This reallyshocked and even frightened people. Because the skull’s shape was unusual for ahuman,’ said Igor Skandakov, director of the Omsk Museum of History andCulture.”256 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber255]In The Source Field Investigations, I covered the 2009 Discover magazine articlethat revealed the same skulls in Boskop, South Africa. Many of the articlescovering these modern elongated skulls try to blame them all on head-binding.The Discover article openly acknowledges that these skulls have a much largerbrain capacity, indicating even the most average of these people would have anIQ of 150. “Two neuroscientists say that a now-extinct race of humans had bigeyes, child-like faces, and an average intelligence of around 150, making themgeniuses among Homo sapiens.”257 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber256]Another tantalizing clue can be found in surviving photographs of PrinceLeonello and Princess D’Este, both fourteenth-century Italian nobility.Surviving images of both people clearly indicate that they had elongated skulls.Research on the House of Este reveals that the descendants of this Italiangroup, which had high-level political ties to the Vatican, are spread throughoutEuropean nobility.258 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber257] Their relatives includeall British monarchs since George I, a variety of earlier British consorts, andthe royal families of Norway, Sweden, Spain, and Denmark.259[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber258] Even more surprisingly, a 1988 article in theNew York Times revealed that out of forty American presidents at the time,thirteen had a direct connection to European royalty.260[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber259] In 2012, BridgeAnne d’Avignon, atwelve-year-old girl, connected forty-two out of forty-three American presidentsto one single shared ancestor: King John of England.261[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber260] John was an influential figure who signed theMagna Carta in 1215—the original cornerstone of the British constitution.262[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber261]It is well known to Pete, Corey, and Jacob, among others, that a small number ofpeople with elongated skulls are still alive on Earth today. At times they havewarred with the Draco and at other times they have formed alliances with them.By no means am I advocating that we hunt them down or treat them all ascriminals. Heroes can come from the most unlikely of places. If we treat them asaliens or villains, we are only going to repeat the same cycles that havedamaged us for so long. However, there certainly are some of them who seem to bevery focused on destroying humanity. Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales has confirmedthat these people are heavily involved in banking and finance, and do representthe core of what many people call the Illuminati, but which the SSP Alliancerefers to as the “secret earth government syndicates.”[../image/45_AscensionMysteries.jpg]Prince Lionello and Princess D’Este, with Noticeably Elongated SkullsCorey independently confirmed that a treaty was worked out between these peopleand the Draco to pursue their mutual interests. Jacob revealed this has been inplace since the time of Queen Elizabeth and her court astrologer John Dee, andother alliances had occurred in a variety of prior instances. It definitelyappears that this negative influence will finally be transformed as we gothrough the ascension process that so many sources have predicted.The Draco have already attempted to betray all their human allies as we havegotten closer to the long-anticipated solar event. All ETs have become trappedin our system thanks to an energetic wall that appeared in December 2014,commonly referred to in the SSP as the Outer Barrier. This barrier appearedafter the Cabal fired a superweapon at one of hundreds of giant spheres thathave arrived in our solar system since the year 2012. The beam reflected back tothe underground facility in Pine Gap, Australia, and destroyed it, and the outerbarrier immediately appeared. Though this may all seem quite fantastic andimplausible, Corey and I have both experienced multiple, highly severe deaththreats since we were pulled into this world. Many others are in the same boat.Yet, since it is a spiritual battle that must follow “the Rules,” we are doingour best to ensure that our deaths will not be authorized. The positivespiritual perspective is the best protection for anyone who chooses toparticipate in this struggle to regain control of our planet and transform itinto a positive, advanced space-traveling society."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVEBLUEPRINTS OF THE FUTUREAfter Ian told me about Hoagland’s stunning talk at the UN, I immediately calledAriel Booksellers and ordered a copy of Hoagland’s book, The Monuments of Mars.The waiting felt like an eternity, even though it was probably less than twoweeks. By the time the book came in I could hardly contain my enthusiasm. I washoping that Hoagland would have some idea of where this civilization went, orwhy they had died out. The connection between the half-man, half-feline face andthe Sphinx, as well as the pyramids on both Mars and the Earth, was verytantalizing. At the same time, I had no idea if simply buying a book like thiscould be enough to get me followed, interrogated, or even tortured and killed.Nonetheless, this information was so fascinating that I was willing to risk mylife to obtain it.THE GREAT PYRAMID DECODEDWhen I went to the special order desk at the store, they had to go look in theback for the book and kept me waiting. This further increased my sense ofunease, even as I smelled the strong bouquet of incense in the air and admiredthe displays of crystals. I started going through the stacks and looking foranything else that seemed interesting. My eyes soon locked onto The GreatPyramid Decoded by Peter Lemesurier. I flipped through it and was dazzled by thenumber of intricate diagrams I was seeing of the interior of the pyramid. It wasa highly mathematical and technical book, which didn’t scare me in the least.The Great Pyramid Decoded had an absolutely stunning premise—namely that therewas a mathematical message in the passages of the Great Pyramid. This code couldbe successfully translated into spoken language, which the author meticulouslyreconstructed, revealing the logic behind every single word in painstakingdetail. The Pyramid Time Line accurately pinpointed many of our own historicalevents that were far in the future from when the pyramid was constructed. Mostsurprising, the Time Line continued past our own present moment, and ended withsome very impressive events. The author concluded that the pyramid wasultimately built to encode a prophecy of a global ascension. He chose to referto this as the Second Coming of Christ, or the “Messianic return.” He indicatedthis would be happening to many of us, not just one figure, which I liked.The author demonstrated an astonishing number of connections between the GreatPyramid and Christianity, particularly in chapter 7, “The Pyramid and the SacredWritings.”263 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber262] This was temporarily a verypopular subject in the 1800s, but it has since become almost completely obscure.The Cabal was very likely horrified to discover that the monument they hadalready co-opted as their symbol was actually a “prophecy in stone” of thecoming of the spiritual leader they despised more than anyone. I got heavilytriggered from reading this in 1993 and could barely make it through it, since Ihad felt alienated by Christians all my life, but I now realize this is ofcritical importance in understanding the Law of One material.CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE PYRAMID AND THE BIBLEOn page 185, Lemesurier said, “The average Christian may be surprised to learnthat the kingdom of heaven referred to repeatedly in the New Testament was notnormally thought of by contemporary Jews as some kind of post-mortem state ofspiritual bliss at all. On the contrary, it was seen as an uncompromisinglyphysical Golden Age on Earth—a future Millennium which the righteous dead wouldbe physically reborn to enjoy . . . the prophet Isaiah had written (26:19);‘They that sleep in the earth will awake and shout for joy; for thy dew is a dewof sparkling light, and the earth will bring those long dead to birthagain.’”264 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber263]On page 188, Lemesurier made intriguing connections between the Bible and theUFO phenomenon, by quoting from chapter 19 of Isaiah. “See how the Lord comesriding swiftly upon a cloud, he shall descend upon Egypt.” Shortly thereafter, avery interesting passage speaks directly of the Great Pyramid as a “sacredpillar” and “altar.” The identity of this monument would have been verywell-known at the time: “When that day comes there shall be an altar to the Lordin the heart of Egypt, and a sacred pillar set up for the Lord upon herfrontier. It shall stand as a token and a reminder to the Lord of Hosts inEgypt, so that when they appeal to him against their oppressors, he may send adeliverer to champion their cause, and he shall rescue them.” (19: 16–17)The Hebrew word for “altar” can indicate a great heap of stone that is built tocommemorate any memorable event. It preserves the memory of something that wasof great importance to the people. The Hebrew word that is translated as“pillar” is matstebah, which can indicate any kind of monument. The word hasroots in the Egyptian mstpt, which means a funeral monument, and also appearslater as the Arabic word mastaba. This is a flat-topped pyramid thatconventional archeologists believe was the early design prototype thatultimately led to the creation of the Great Pyramid. So a “mastaba to the Lordin the heart of Egypt,” associated with a mass ascension and ETs coming out ofthe clouds from “heaven,” or outer space, changes the meaning of this biblicalpassage quite dramatically.Lemesurier’s scholarship impressed me even more on the next page. Throughout thebook he demonstrated how the Pyramid Time Line was all calibrated in Egyptianinches, where one inch equals one year of time. The diagonals along the outsideof the pyramid added up very neatly to the precession cycle of 25,920 years.Without the capstone, the pyramid has six sides, and in Pyramid numerology, sixis the number of imperfection and evil. Once the capstone returns, it becomes afive-sided object, and five means divine energy and ascension. Lemesurierrevealed that the Bible passage quoted above had long been known to have asecret mathematical code embedded in it. This code appears in the science ofgematria, in which each letter in the Hebrew alphabet has a corresponding numberassociated with it. The passage about a “great stone monument in the heart ofEgypt” adds up to the number 5449. This is only 0.27 inches away from the heightof the Great Pyramid, in Egyptian inches, if you measure it from the bottom tothe top. This may seem like a foolish coincidence at first, but Lemesurierdemonstrated hundreds and hundreds of them.Then on the next page, Lemesurier quoted Matthew 21:42, in which Jesus seems tobe speaking of himself when he says, “The stone the builders rejected has becomethe chief corner-stone.” Lemesurier then said, “Any building, of course, canhave a corner-stone—most have four or more—but there is only one type ofbuilding that can have a chief corner-stone, or a ‘headstone in the corner,’ asone translation has it; and that building is a pyramid. Yet the reference hereis specifically to a building whose chief corner-stone is missing—and it isfurther made clear that the final placement of that corner-stone will have aspecifically Messianic connotation.”265 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber264] Inother words, the return of the capstone is an ascension event, the perfecting ofhumans on Earth.After reading the Law of One, another Bible quote Lemesurier mentioned jumpedout at me even more. He began with Isaiah 26:1, which says, “We have a strongcity whose walls and ramparts are our deliverance. Open the gates to let arighteous nation in, a nation that keeps faith.” In context, this could be adescription of the pyramid and its symbolism. This may seem like a vagueconnection, but it was the next line from verses 4, 7, and 8 that caught my eye:“Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord himself is an everlasting rock. . . .The path of the righteous is level, and thou markest out the right way for theupright.” The “everlasting rock” could well be a symbol of the Pyramid, whichstill stands after all this time. The Time Line does resemble a level pathinside the “everlasting rock” that marks out the gateway to ascension inside.Once I reread this passage while writing this book, I immediately remembered howthe Law of One source described their building of the Great Pyramid. Thisappears in Session 3, Question 12: “We built with everlasting rock the GreatPyramid, as you call it. Other of the pyramids were built with stone moved fromone place to another.”266 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber265] When they were askedto clarify what they meant by “everlasting rock,” the answer seemed deliberatelyvague and confusing. The source even seemed to acknowledge this by saying, “Maywe answer you in any more helpful way?”267 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber266] NowI realized that they were directly quoting from the book of Isaiah, and pointingtheir readers back to the importance of this passage.The last Bible quote I will discuss from Lemesurier’s book is from Luke 19:40:“I tell you, if my disciples keep silence the stones will shout aloud.”According to Lemesurier, “The statement may have been a deliberate reference tothe stones of the Great Pyramid—in which case the statement could be seen as acryptic (and not untypical) way of saying that those stones had a Messianicmessage for mankind.”268 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber267]Even though many of us are alienated against Christianity due to the trappingsof religion, I have since realized that the life and teachings of Jesus greatlyweakened the Cabal and created a far more widespread appreciation of ascension.It was only while I was in Canada in 2015 that I realized the basic spiritualmessage I had been teaching all these years was the same as we hear from Jesusand other great masters. As I read the New Testament for the first time, I wasastonished at all the references to ascension that I had missed.STUNNING BIBLE QUOTES ON ASCENSIONHere are some of the most powerful examples I found while I was meditating inthe Canadian Rocky Mountains. I am aware that these passages have been used byBible-thumping religious zealots who have taught that only their own “chosen”will go through this, and all others will burn in hell. The greater context Ihave presented here in The Ascension Mysteries, as well as in my previous twobooks, makes this all a far more interesting discussion:Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all bechanged, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For thetrumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall bechanged. For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortalbody must put on immortality. (I Corinthians 15:51–53)For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shinethunto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. And asit was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, untilthe day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed themall.Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, theybought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot wentout of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. In that day,he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him notcome down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise notreturn back. (Luke 17:24–31)I tell you, in that night there shall be two [men] in one bed; the one shall betaken, and the other shall be left. Two [women] shall be grinding together; theone shall be taken, and the other left. Two [men] shall be in the field; the oneshall be taken, and the other left. And they answered and said unto him, Where,Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body [is], thither will the eaglesbe gathered together. (Luke 17:34–37)And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shallnot be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. (Mark 13:2)But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and themoon shall not give her light, and the stars of heaven shall fall, and thepowers that are in heaven shall be shaken. And then shall they see the Son ofman coming in the clouds with great power and glory. And then shall he send hisangels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from theuttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven. (Mark 13:24–27)And the mighty ones shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shallbe no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any morepain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the thronesaid, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these wordsare true and faithful. (Revelations 21:4–5)And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed methat great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of outer space from themighty ones, having the glory of the mighty ones: and her light was like unto astone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. (Revelations21:10–11)And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake . . . and theythat be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turnmany to righteousness as the stars, for ever and ever. (Daniel 12:2–3)Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? Behold, I sayunto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white alreadyto harvest. (John 14:35)The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of hiskingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast theminto a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then shallthe righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hathears to hear, let him hear. (Matthew 13:41–43)In my April 23, 2016, interview with William Tompkins, he revealed that theinsider community is so divided on the subject of the solar event that hardlyanyone really understands what is going to happen, or how it is going to happen.“This may not be as destructive as some people seem to think. It may also be atremendous new way of life that will include extended life. . . . There areboxes full of the different versions of what you are talking about [fromclassified insider studies]. Grabbing a hold of one or two of them, and holdingon while it is shaking, is still kind of hard to do!” I then called PetePeterson and talked to him about it that same day. He said, “The solar event isa natural occurrence. It is how things are and what we must go through.”WANDERER AWAKENINGBy 1995, I had read so many books on UFOs, ancient civilizations, and paranormalsubjects that I was quickly becoming an expert. I also had been documenting mydreams for three solid years. Some very profound synchronicities happened to meduring those years after I got sober, and the best ones are featured in TheSynchronicity Key. When my mother demanded I move out after graduating fromcollege in 1995, I became extremely saddened and was crying in the grass in thebackyard. A bird came up and chirped at me for a long time, in what appeared tobe a clear attempt to cheer me up. Shortly thereafter I moved back to my collegetown and got a place with my college buddy Eric.I ended up getting a job at a mental health ward within a local hospital,because I wanted to use it for a residency credit. My goal at the time was toget a PhD in psychology. I ended up being fired after two and a half weeks forbeing “too friendly to the patients.” I drove home feeling devastated, andstopped off at the Borders bookstore on Wolf Road in Albany, New York. There Ifound a copy of From Elsewhere by Dr. Scott Mandelker. The subtitle read, “TheSubculture of Those Who Claim to Be of Non-Earthly Origins.” I laughed when Iread it, but I also used an ESP technique called “psychometry” with any book. IfI felt a tingling sensation from the book when I cleared my mind of allthoughts, I knew it was valuable. This book felt like lightning in my hands. Inthe back, appendix 2 was a questionnaire that Mandelker used to identifyWanderers. Those questions rocked me to my core, as I had never seen such anintimate, personal assessment of my psychology—and this was from a completestranger. Here is what I read: 1. You were often lost in daydreams of ETs, UFOs, other worlds, space travel and utopian societies as a child. Your family thought you were “a bit odd,” without knowing quite why. 2. You always felt like your parents were not your true parents, that your real family was far away and hidden. Perhaps you thought things around you were somehow “not the way they should be,” and reminded you of life somewhere “far away.” These beliefs may have caused you a great deal of pain and sorrow. You felt “out of place.” 3. You’ve had one or more vivid UFO experiences (in a dream or during waking hours) which dramatically changed your life: they helped resolve doubts, inspired confidence and hope, and gave you meaning and greater purpose. From then on, you knew you were a different person. Like a spiritual wake-up call, it changed your life. 4. You are genuinely kind, gentle, harmless, peaceful, and nonaggressive (not just sometimes, but almost always). You are not much interested in money and possessions, so if “someone must do without,” it is usually you—such is your habitual self-sacrifice. Acts of human cruelty, violence and perpetual global warfare seem really strange (shall we say, alien?). You just can’t figure out all this anger, rage and competition. 5. You have a hard time recognizing evil and trickery: some people call you naive (and they’re right!). When you do perceive genuine negativity in your midst, you recoil in horror and may feel shocked that “some people really do things like that.” In a subtle way, you actually feel confused. Perhaps you vaguely sense having known a world free of such disharmony. 6. The essence of your life is serving others (be they family, friends, or in a profession), and you cherish great ideals, which may also be somewhat innocent and naive (in worldly terms). But you sincerely, deeply hope to improve the world. A lot of disappointment and frustration comes when such hopes and dreams don’t materialize. 7. You completely embrace the scientific temperament, with a cool, reasonable, and measured approach to life. Human passion and red hot desire seem strange: you are baffled. Romance and the entire world of feelings are truly foreign to your natural way. You always analyze experiences, and so people say you’re always in your head—which is true! [Note: This type of Wanderer is less common, and probably wouldn’t be reading this book—their skepticism would be too great! Such an “odd bird” is probably a brilliant scientist.] 8. You easily get lost in science fiction, medieval epic fantasy (like The Hobbit) and visionary art. Given a choice, you’d much prefer to live in your dreams of the past or future than in the present. Sometimes you consider your Earth life boring and meaningless, and wish you could go to a perfect, exciting world. Such dreams have been with you a long time. 9. You have an insatiable interest in UFOs, life on other worlds or previous Earth civilizations such as Atlantis or Lemuria. Sometimes you feel like you’ve really been there, and may even go back someday. There may be quite a few of such books on your bookshelves. (Actually, this question is a giveaway, since only Wanderers and Walk-ins have profound, undying curiosity about worlds beyond—and for good reason!) 10. You have a strong interest in mystic spirituality (East or West), both theory and practice, with a deep sense that you used to have greater powers and somehow lost them. You may feel it’s unnecessary to discipline yourself since “you’ve already been there,” but somehow forgot what you used to know. People may doubt your resolve, but you know it’s not that simple. 11. You have become a conscious channel for ETs or some other non-Earth source—and you realize that the purpose of your life is to help others grow and evolve. (Most likely, you’re no longer sleeping, Wanderer!) 12. You feel, and perhaps all your life have felt tremendous alienation and a sense of never quite fitting in. Maybe you hope to be like others, try your best to be “normal,” or imagine yourself like everyone else—but the bottom line is that you simply feel different and always have. There is a very real fear of never finding a place in this world. (Which you might not! Note: This is the classic profile of Wanderers.)FINDING THE PROOFI scored 100 percent on this questionnaire, which should be obvious if you readthe first half of this book. Wanderers are apparently extraterrestrial souls whohave already gone beyond the lessons of “third density” Earth in this level ofspiritual evolution. They volunteer to come here and forget who they are, hopingto help improve the planet by anchoring in a higher consciousness through theirthoughts and actions. It is possible for them to “penetrate the forgetting” andremember who they really are if they do the work. Dr. Mandelker indicated thatif you believe this is who you are, you have to commit to finding the answer.Validation can appear if you dedicate yourself to seeking it. I was ready. Ibrought the book home, read it very quickly, and told my high school best friendJude about it. He recommended we do “automatic writing,” where we’d meditatewith a pencil in our non-writing hands to see if we could get clear enough tohave something happen. I ended up getting astounding results. Though I felt noconnection to Christianity, my hand wrote “Christ Cometh” forward and backwardon the same line. For some reason, the last two letters in the second word,“th,” also looked like the word “Ra.”Then my hand suddenly jumped into furious action and scribbled out a quicksequence of characters before it stopped: “EC 40 57 & oxen.” We quickly realizedthis was a Bible quote from Ecclesiastes. Neither of us felt connected toChristianity, but we had to look it up. In the olden days, there were nochapters—only verse numbers counted from the beginning. Forty verses after thebeginning of Ecclesiastes was 2:22. This was another “synchronicity number,” andI had been seeing these patterns on clocks, license plates, and odometerreadouts at the most remarkable times for the preceding three years.The quote itself showed an intimate knowledge of what I had just gone through:“For what hath a man toiled and labored under the sun? This too is meaningless.”It definitely seemed to be talking about the job I had gotten fired from, andthat it was “meaningless” and not to worry about it. The last line read, “To eatand drink, and be happy in one’s toil: this is the grace of God.” I felt I wasbeing given clear guidance to just get a job and try to be happy, instead ofworking in a mental hospital so I could get internship credit toward a PhD inpsychology. The oxen was a clear reference to a statue of a water buffalo that Ihad purchased at the Altamont Fair. I thought it represented my becoming a“beast of burden” in the working world, only to find out this was one of thethree most powerful animals in Africa. No one would dare go anywhere near thebuffalo, much less try to attach it to a plow.This was a major event, with far more detail than what I had gotten from theflash of light in the sky. I ended up getting a job caring for developmentallydisabled people at a day treatment center. I was working for $5.77 an hour anddealing with incredible stress on a daily basis. All the people with the mostsevere and disruptive behaviors were segregated into one room, and because I hada psychology degree they assumed I would know how to handle it.HE IS ONE OF USThat winter I got hit with a $200 phone bill that I could not pay, thanks tolong-distance conversations with my ex-girlfriend from Japan. Though we hadbroken up, she still wanted to stay in regular contact with me, and now I hadgotten the bill. I completely broke down that night and cried. I thought back tothe old man, to my dreams as a child, to the visions of the Upgrade I’d had, tothe flash of light across the sky, and now to the highly bizarre Bible quote.“If you’re out there and you are real, I need you to tell me now,” I cried. “Ican’t live my life not knowing if this is true. I need proof. If I am anextraterrestrial soul, like the book says, I need to know.”Nothing happened.I became calm after crying and realized the phone company had “accidentallyforgotten” to apply a discounted rate to my calls, as I had asked them to. Icalled them up and chopped $200 down to $35, just like that. I felt better andhad nearly forgotten about my tearful, highly emotional request when I went tosleep. My housemate Eric did not get back until after I was out. The nextmorning I went outside to start my car since it was so cold. I came back insidethe house and Eric was standing there in the kitchen. Red pillow creases wereall over his face.“I just had a dream about you,” he said. I told him I couldn’t hear about hisdream as I was going to be late for work. “Yeah, but this was about UFOs.” Thatcaught my attention. I immediately stopped worrying about being on time andlistened. In Eric’s dream, a mass sighting of UFOs appeared in the skies. Peoplewere freaking out, running, and hiding under things. A man with gray hair, agraying beard and a robe, with sandals, was standing on a flat disc that waslevitating about five feet above the ground. I recognized him right away as theold man from my dreams. Eric, my ex-girlfriend Yumi, and I were still standingthere as he started giving us an impassioned speech.“We are your long-lost brothers and sisters. We have been guarding andprotecting you all along. A major transformation is happening now on yourplanet. You have the opportunity to become something new—to transform andevolve—if you want to. Many of your people have called this ascension. Yourearth and sun are going through a profound metamorphosis, and so are you. We areproud of you for how hard you have worked to be a good person, to love otherpeople, to be kind, patient, and forgiving. We will ensure that you remain safeas this change takes place. No harm will come to you—only transfiguration.”The old man stopped talking at a certain point and silence hung in the air. Theentire area was now abandoned, except for the UFO that was hovering above him,with a beam leading down to the flat disc he was standing on. Yumi said to Eric,“Shouldn’t somebody go talk to him?” Eric replied, “I’ll let David do it. He’sthe UFO guy, he’ll know what to say.” I went up to the old man and the disclowered so I could walk onto it. Once we got close, we recognized each other andhugged. The old man threw his arms around me, made intense eye contact withEric, and said, “It is very important that you know that he is one of us.”THEN IT HITS MEAs soon as he finished telling me this I had to rush off to work because I waslate. People were always driving ten to fifteen miles per hour below the speedlimit on Route 32, and it happened again that morning. I was late and I got introuble for it. Work was totally chaotic that day and I was scheduled to driveup and see my family right after it was over. I was on the New York StateThruway, heading north, in a blinding rainstorm. My car was slidingfrighteningly on the road as I hit water puddles, and it was terrifying. Thewindshield was fogging up and I could barely see. I was gripping the steeringwheel and my body was racked with total fear, pain, and sadness. Suddenly, rightthen, it hit me. I remembered the prayer from the night before. Eric’s dream wasthe answer. I asked the universe whether I was an ET soul, and I got a highlydramatic answer—from the old man himself, appearing in Eric’s dream. Evenbetter, his dream provided compelling proof that an ascension event was reallygoing to happen. If the old man could appear in someone else’s dream on request,why would he tell a lie about such an important subject?I pulled the car over for safety and cried very hard for about half an hour. Bythe time I had finished, the rains had passed and the road was safe again. Idecided that I needed to take Mandelker’s book much more seriously. He was anintense scholar of the Law of One material, which I had never read. I decidedthat I needed those books, and I got them less than a month later, in January1996.REMARKABLE VALIDATIONThe Law of One series said there was a super-Earth in our solar system that hadexploded due to warlike acts 500,000 years ago. I was stunned to see this, as Iwas familiar with Van Flandern’s exploded planet hypothesis and always wanted toknow what had happened. This planet was called Maldek in the Law of One books. Iwouldn’t learn that Brilliant Pebbles had produced the exact same date for thisdisaster until eighteen and a half years later. The Law of One also said acivilization had existed on Mars, and had destroyed their atmosphere—againthrough warlike acts. Most of the people of Mars and Maldek ended upreincarnating in mass numbers on Earth to work off their karma. Many peoplestill carry the memory of this trauma, and of living under a totalitarian race,in their subconscious. The Law of One also indicated that a small number ofothers escaped the disaster and did not reincarnate like everyone else, but thedetails were vague. I would put the pieces together only many years later,beginning in 2014.The Law of One spoke extensively about the Cabal on Earth, which they called the“negative elite.” It also clearly indicated that these people were beingcontrolled by a highly negative extraterrestrial group called the OrionConfederation. No descriptions were given of what the Orions looked like. Jacoband Corey both confirmed that the Draco have a major stronghold in theconstellation Orion.It is difficult to explain how many hundreds of things I had researched in thepreceding years that were appearing in these books. I thought I had developedoriginal discoveries and interesting ideas no one had thought of before. The Lawof One books featured everything I thought I knew and then went far, far beyondmy own level of development. There was an extensive discussion of the GreatPyramid that totally paid off all my research on the Pyramid Time Line. Thegroup speaking the words identified themselves as Ra, and said they were abenevolent group who built the Great Pyramid as a beacon for our ascension. Theyhad no idea that it would be taken over and used as a symbol for the negativeelite, and were now here to help repair the damage.There were multiple clues in the Law of One that they were very supportive ofChristianity and had helped to ensure that it had developed. They understoodthat great harm had been caused by organized religion, but the overall effectwas still positive in that it helped people become more forgiving—and “inforgiveness lies the stoppage of the wheel of karma.” The term that the Law ofOne used for ascension was biblical, taken right out of the Book of Matthew. Theterm was “harvest.” This is an analogy Jesus makes when the weeds are allowed togrow together with the wheat until “the harvest.” At that time there is adivision. The weeds are plucked out one by one. The people who remain then“shine like the sun.”I began having dream after dream that ETs wanted to talk to me directly. In onedream I had a friendly ghost speaking words into my ear. I was told that I couldhear them but no one else could, so I should dictate them into a tape recorder.As I have thoroughly documented on my website, I began practicing this techniquein November 1996, and got phenomenal results. I used remote-viewing protocols tomake sure I was consciously unaware of what was being said, to have no emotionalreactions, and to not analyze any of the data if I heard something.Cryptic sentences began flowing through me. On the first day I was given aprophecy that something was going to happen to “one of our women, Theresa, theChristian,” which would make her “inoperative.” Eleven days later, MotherTheresa had a heart attack. In that first session I was told, “The religions Iam concerned with will be someday lighted, and we will go on to greater heightsas a conglomerate being in the cosmos.” I also heard a line that validated myassumptions about the noise coming from the television: “[Your] country andcontinuity [is being] shaded by an invisible hand which controls the sound inthe lower ear. [It is] the sound of Hades—it massages the temples.” This alsoappears to refer to the Draco technology that is holding us back collectivelyfrom ascension and which will suddenly get turned off if the Alliance destroysthe devices generating the signal. A bit later it gave a statement about thepossible catastrophic events that will occur for people on the negative timeline: “A book called The Greek Mythologies. Tombstone, talking about a seventymph wind from everyplace. Pause for the government’s actions to becompleted.”269 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber268]Two days later, on November 12, 1996, I heard, “Hello, David. Plan B. It’s beena very long time. We’ve built and destroyed civilizations. As the process goesaround, there are ascensions, and a new cycle begins.” The beings demonstrated asense of humor on November 16, when they said, “Who do you think we are? Spacealiens? Wrong. That’s the one thing about our service is that we need tohelp.”270 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber269] I had wondered if I was talking toGray-type extraterrestrials at the time, and this was a humorous rebuke of thatidea.A few sessions later on November 22, I asked, “Can you give me any general UFOinformation at this time?” The answer was, “Absolutely not! The purpose here isnot to keep yourself around—it is to move you on. . . . We put A to Z in, andbefore long, we have a weblink to the cosmos. Feel the chorus sing in you—in me,and know that all is well that ends well. The Church tradition of symbolism willbe renewed. Believe it when I tell you that the end is coming—the end oforganized materialism. You’ve got to listen to your own inner voice—nothing elsewill do. The voice of your ego will destroy you.”271[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber270]I began routinely getting accurate prophecies of future events. In one of thevery first sessions on November 30, 1996, I was told, “Homeopathic TV. Think ofArt Bell doing yoga.”272 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber271] This statement hasbeen available for people to read on my website ever since 1999. In 2013 I endedup taking the invitation to have a show on Gaiam TV, which predominantly didyoga videos at the time. My first appearance was on Beyond Belief with GeorgeNoory. Remarkably, Noory was now the host of Coast to Coast AM, after havingreplaced Art Bell in 2001. That was an example of a fourteen-year time loop thatwas publicly documented. There have been dozens and dozens of other time loopsas well. I experienced an immense series of them in Canada while outlining thisbook in September 2015, as we will soon discuss.It became very common for me to have a stack of tapes at my desk, which could beup to a month old. I would sit down to transcribe them and the words would bedescribing something that had just happened to me. This was extremelyfascinating and happened almost every single time I did it. At one point I wasin a café in Woodstock, talking to a guy who quoted Joseph Campbell in sayingthat religions are like software to access the Creator. I came home, sat down,started the tape, and the first thing I heard was, “We are downloading newsoftware.”My housemate Eric was told, “You will be happy to know that your student loansfor New Paltz have come in.” This didn’t make any sense, since we had bothgraduated from New Paltz and he was now getting a master’s degree in Albany.Neither of us had any money and we were $876 short for the rent. It was aserious problem. Eric walked in one day and told me to sit down. His mother hadjust called him. New Paltz was remodeling the bursar’s office. They had moved afile cabinet away from the wall, and a Stafford Loan check for Eric was hidingbehind it. The check was for $900, and it was still good.In that first month, I was having incredible experiences with this cosmicintelligence. Every morning I pulled in new information. I was told that Iworried far too much, and I would be much happier if I could learn to relax andmeditate. I was also told that I needed to stop trying to pass people on Route32. I was warned about four or five times, but refused to listen. On a Tuesday,I got a message that said, “My gift to the world will be athree-and-a-half-by-eleven sheet of paper. Expect it on Friday, ninety minutesuntil ten o’clock.”273 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber272]On Friday, at eight thirty a.m., I collided with a car in front of me while onmy way to a training session for medical certification in Poughkeepsie. Thewoman inside ended up trying to sue me for $200,000, despite having only adime-sized dent on her bumper. I found out she had committed insurance fraudbefore. She ended up trying to settle for $10,000, and I never heard whether theinsurance company gave her anything or not. That day, the officer wrote me aticket—on a three-and-a-half-by-eleven-inch sheet of paper. Once I put it alltogether, and realized that these benevolent beings had authorized my car crashand subsequent threat of a crushing lawsuit, I cried very heavily for some time.This was a very sobering reminder of the fact that the people I was now incontact with were the Lords of Karma, if you will. I needed to respect them andthe opportunity I was being given. Ascension is a hard-earned process, not aneasy cakewalk. The events that happen in our lives are not random. They are veryprecisely scripted by higher intelligence. The ascension process does involvebecoming aware of the relationship between your thoughts and actions, and theresults that then occur.SIR JOHN AND PORPHYRY: THE CANADA TIME LOOPI have traveled to Banff in Alberta, Canada, five different times as of thiswriting for spiritual retreat and solitude. Each time I went there, I hadastonishing time-loop prophecies appear in my dream and reading journals. Iwould feel spontaneously guided to read my journal about certain events in mypast that I was thinking about, only to discover that the dreams and readings Ihad written down during those same times were referring to my present. The mostrecent example started on September 4, 2015, and was probably the mostmiraculous of them all. Over twenty-five different correlations to my present,all highly specific, ended up appearing.Here is the journal entry I wrote right after it started happening: “I wasplaying guitar and gently inspired to go back to my readings and read about myexperiences. I decided to check out section 80 from the beginning of March 2000.Almost immediately there were profound coordinates to my present. . . . And itwent way beyond that. There was some form of cosmic military service I wasgetting into involving jumpsuits. [The people in the SSP all wear jumpsuits.] Aseries of readings had very targeted messages for me about the book I am writingright now. They confirmed that I needed to talk about myself and the journey ofhow I put all this information together.”I soon realized that I needed to go back to February 21, 2000, to see the fulltime loop. Here is part of what I read: “Don’t let the scorn and derision ofothers stop you from being effective in your goals. Keep a clear head and remainrelaxed, knowing all the while that there is indeed a final conclusion to thesewords as they now stand, and that this moment [of ascension] does indeedapproach with the unwavering certainty of the clock striking on the hour.“And we will add that this circumstance does not differentiate between past,present, and future at the moment of its arrival. It is almost entirely acreature of the collective human consciousness, and this ‘cosmic trigger’ can beset off at will over the next few years, depending upon the vibrations ofhumanity as a whole.“We want you to stay on track, and realize that everything that has beenextended to you has been part of a massive gift from higher intelligence. Youyourself have done nothing; it is rather the work of the Christ and theFather/Mother God that is moving through you. As long as you can remind yourselfof that, you can continue to reorient the focus back onto the goal and thedestination, which is to achieve a final reunion with this light/love energy. Ifthe book becomes overly technical in its writing capacity from start to finish,then it will not inspire people in the way that is necessary. Use your intuitionwhile writing.”274 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber273]On March 5, 2000, I journaled about the testimony of Sgt. Clifford Stone, aDisclosure Project witness who claimed to have worked on extraterrestrial crashrecovery operations, and who then did a reading. Less than a month and a halfbefore the dot-com collapse, this reading gave tremendous clues of what wasabout to happen. “I am Archangel Michael. The profit losses before thecorporations now are set to require more download time than ever before. . . .There are only a finite series of opportunities to stress the motherboard, so tospeak, before it gives out on you. And this will be happening to greater andgreater degrees. . . . We do suggest that as much as you may want to appeal tothe disciples of the scientific fraternity, that you keep in mind theextraterrestrial connections and the theological connections as well. . . .“One shaman should reap the rewards as much as another, and remember that youare not so much writing this [book] for the scientific community as you are forthe intellectual and spiritual community. Do not be afraid to change thearchitecture of this burgeoning project to reflect early along where yoursources arise from and how you were led to do this research in the firstplace. . . . Every time that we defy gravity in the common sense use of theterm, there is great interest generated. And so, you can see that the discussionof anti-gravity becomes much more vivid when the new understandings aboutcreation are fused into the equation. The sacrifice of longing is necessary, asSir John Alexander and Porphyry would have it.”275[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber274]I had just ignored that last line at the time it came in. The readings oftensaid lots of strange and cryptic things. I never bothered to research who SirJohn Alexander was, or who or what Porphyry was, although I thought it might bea Greek philosopher. Now I had to know. Almost immediately, I discovered thatSir John Alexander Macdonald was the first prime minister of Canada. Heestablished Banff, right where I was staying in the middle of this incredibletime loop, as a nature preserve in 1885.276 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber275] Iwas completely unaware of Banff until I was invited to conduct a conference tourthere in 2008, and was dazzled by it. This reading was from 2000.I next discovered that the word “porphyry” actually means “purple” in Greek.Porphyry is a type of purple granite rock—and I was surrounded by mountains ofit on all sides. In fact, a short drive south across the border from Banff intoMontana takes you to Porphyry Peak.277 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber276] Amining website explained how this purple granite can be easily carved into hugeblocks: “It’s a type of granite that has naturally extruded through the earth’scrust. . . . Because the formation has vertical layers, extracting the stonerequires very little energy. . . . Despite its variable thickness, it is easy toachieve a flat surface that meets modern ADA standards. Porphyry is most oftencut into cubes so that it can be installed in patterns.”278[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber277]Now the full weight of the “time loop” slammed down on me. In the Great Pyramid,ascension and the world of spirit is symbolized by purple granite—porphyry—asopposed to limestone, which indicates materiality. The entire King’s Chamber ismade out of purple granite. The open sarcophagus in the King’s Chamberrepresents the end of death and the gateway to ascension—and it is also made outof porphyry. This connection appeared in the occultist Helena Blavatsky’s work,among others.279 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber278] Another bizarre “time loop”connection is that Prince, the “Purple One,” whose film and song “Purple Rain”is a timeless classic, died three days before I added this section to the book.I didn’t consciously recognize this connection until after writing andsubmitting the full analysis.Gerry Cannon pointed out that the porphyry coffin in the King’s Chamber hasprecisely the same measurements as the Ark of the Covenant in the Bible. “Theword ark comes from the Hebrew word aron, which means a chest, box. Itsdimensions are described by the Bible as 2.5 cubits by 1.5 cubits by 1.5 cubits(45 inches by 27 inches by 27 inches). Curiously, this is the exact volume ofthe stone chest or porphyry coffer in the King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid inEgypt. . . . Since the Pyramid was built and sealed long before the days ofMoses, when he built the Ark and the Holy of Holies, and had remained sealed forover twenty-five centuries until the ninth century after Christ, there is nonatural explanation for the phenomenon of both structures having identicalvolume measurements.”280 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber279]Then it got even stranger. I looked up Porphyry, the philosopher, and found outthat he was directly contradicting the efforts of Emperor Constantine to createa religion out of Jesus’s teachings. Constantine was stripping out manyscriptures, such as the Book of Enoch, to create the “canonized” Bible, which hehad final approval over. Constantine also banned Porphyry’s books. In ThePhilosophy from Oracles, Porphyry said, “The gods have proclaimed Christ to havebeen most pious, but the Christians are a confused and vicious sect.”281[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber280] This was exactly what I had felt, right upuntil the awakening I was having on this trip. I had just started reading theBible and was dazzled by the prophecies I had found. The time loop only startedhappening after I had read through Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.The full coded passage read, “The sacrifice of longing is necessary, as Sir JohnAlexander and Porphyry would have it.” I thought about how so many people feel adeep, agonizing longing for some taste of the infinite. Instead, we can actuallysacrifice that “repetition compulsion” of trauma and longing by jumping in andgoing to a place like Banff, or reading the ancient scriptures for ourselves. Afew lines later, this same reading said, “Socrates, Hipparchus and many otherswere looking into the divine spiritual implications of the knowledge handed downto them from Atlantis. You yourself can continue to philosophize upon currenttheory that has been handed down to you, so as to arrive at new conclusions.”282[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber281] This passage was what led to me later quotefrom Plato in this book.THE STARGATE WILL INDEED OPEN AGAINIt became very clear that the “coordinates” of this fifteen-year time loop wereextending over multiple days of time. Many more details jumped out as I keptreading forward in my private transcripts. Some of them were published on mywebsite and could be backdated by fifteen years. The greatest gift appeared onmy birthday, March 8, 2000. First of all, the reading mentioned the date of May5, 2000. That ended up being the exact day that I first transcribed the tape.Little did I realize that a much larger time loop was in there as well.As I went through this time loop in Banff, all I could really think about wasthe fact that 2012 had come and gone without incident. In one reading, this wasdirectly addressed: “In order that you not fall short of the goal, we do giveyou structure in terms of approximate time lines within which to finish thiswork. The Stargate will indeed open again at the approximate date of 2012 andthereabouts. . . .”What did they mean by “approximate . . . and thereabouts” ? I went back to thefirst line of the reading, and realized that further clarity was given on the“approximate date of 2012.” The term “months” was used as a cryptic timeindicator, possibly for years, as follows: “The pilots then scheduled the flightto be delayed a few more months, while the surrounding circumstances continue tooccur in greater and greater fashion. You have all the experience that it takesto believe in the propositions set forth herein.” The time-bending readingsuggested that the event would still occur, but would be delayed a few yearsafter 2012. This fit in perfectly with the estimates Corey Goode had heard inthe SSP—namely that a series of solar events would take place somewhere between2018 and 2023, though the exact time cannot be known.Right after the line about the stargate opening, it said, “So let’s keep viewingyour higher body as an extension of your physical body, and see how theevolution takes place. We have almost completed a cycle of beingness with you.The work that we are doing constitutes the actions of those who love you so muchthat they are willing to painstakingly pull all the levers and push all thebuttons, thus releasing the stored potential within the self and allowing it tobe made manifest to the greater personality structure.“You have all the tools within you that you need to succeed, and for this we arevery grateful. We appreciate all that you have done in aligning your true cosmicenergy fields with those of our own. There are infinite races of beings in theuniverse, infinite possibilities for how systems will function, and yet you havefound many of the greatest secrets that underlie the creation as you know it inyour own area.”A few lines further down, I read the following, which again made far more senseto me now than it did when it came in: “The Pentagon still complains about ourvisitations, but they are very necessary to keep your species from annihilatingitself. We don’t view all of these occurrences as negative, however it is easyfor one who is uninformed to perceive negativity in their midst. This is afunction of the mirror to the self when it is turned within. . . . When youbegin to realize the non-deterministic structure to your physical plane ofexistence, and the degree to which intelligence sculpts and molds everythingthat is occurring, you can indeed have a greater appreciation for all thepositive events that are brought to you. In a Newtonian universe of simple causeand effect, the one particle bumping into another, these magical processes wouldnot occur.“It is wise for you to always recognize and thank the higher forces inmanifestations that you achieve. Never forget that the entire pathway is visibleto us in your third-dimensional sense, and we are always standing by to help youand guide you through it. For now, we depart. We again remind you that you areloved more than you could ever possibly imagine, and that events will prevail inyour future that define that quite correctly.”283[35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber282]IT’S GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIMEThe changes happening to us now as a planet are very obvious. People seem to behurting one another more than ever, but we are actually becoming a more peacefulpeople. I want to close with a scientific study from December 23, 2015—two daysbefore Christmas—that is truly remarkable. Despite the screeching of the mediawith fear-provoking headlines, the level of violence in the world is sizablydecreasing:This year may be remembered for barrel bombs, beheadings and the Bataclanmassacre, but according to [Steven Pinker,] a Harvard psychologist, a remarkablelong term downward trend in violence is continuing. . . . “The news is asystematically misleading way to understand the world,” he told the ThomsonReuters Foundation in an interview. In the past five years alone, conflicts haveended in Chad, Peru, Iran, India, Sri Lanka, India, and Angola, and if peacetalks currently underway in Colombia are a success, war will have vanished fromthe Western hemisphere, he said. . . . 284 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber283]Formerly wars spanned the globe, and there were 30 between 1945 and 1990 thatkilled 100,000 people or more, including wars in Greece, China, Mozambique,Algeria, Tibet, Guatemala, Uganda, and East Timor. With the exception of lastyear’s small wars in Ukraine, the zone of war has contracted to a crescent fromcentral Africa through the Middle East into South Asia. In “Better Angels,”Pinker argues that almost every other kind of violence, including murders,capital punishment, domestic violence, torture and hunting, has also fallensharply.285 [35_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber284]The Tibetans practiced a meditation discipline that involved stilling the mindand having loving thoughts. If you could have every thought be a loving thought,and meditate on your own consciousness as being the “empty awareness” of theuniverse for thirteen years, your body would dissolve into pure light. They callthis the Rainbow Body. There are 160,000 documented cases of this happening inTibet, India, and China alone. It may not be a popular idea right now, but theproof is there. The transition the Law of One and my own readings are discussingdoes not require every thought to be a loving thought. All you have to do is beslightly above 50 percent “service to others” as opposed to “service to self”and you are cleared for ascension.I hope to see you there!"},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSA great deal of time, attention, and care have gone into the writing of thisbook, and it wouldn’t be possible without the help of many others along the way.I would like to thank my mother, Marta Waterman; my father, Donald Wilcock; andmy brother, Michael Wilcock, for being there for me and creating the loving andsupportive atmosphere that made all this possible.
