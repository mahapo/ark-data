[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"THE BEST ENEMY MONEY CAN BUY By Antony C. Sutton "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Foreword by Gary North In December of 1979, the Soviet Union launched a li ghtning-fast military offensive against the backward nation of Afghanistan. It was after this invasion that President Jimmy Carter admitted publicly that it had taught h im more about the intentions of the Soviets than everything he had ever learned. Never again would he kiss the cheeks of Premier Brezhnev before the television cameras of t he West. The Democrat- controlled Senate even refused to ratify his SALT I I treaty. (By the way, President Reagan has been honoring its terms unofficially, an d he already has ordered the destruction of several Poseidon submarines, includi ng the U.S.S. Sam Rayburn, the dismantling of which began in November of 1985, 1 and which cost a staggering $21 million for the destruction of that one ship. 2 The Nathan Hale and the Andrew Jackson are scheduled for destruction in 1986. 3 To comply with SALT II, we will have to destroy an additional 2,500 Poseidon submar ine warheads. \"Good faith,\" American diplomatic officials argue. (\"Good grief,\" you may be thinking.) The invasion of Afghanistan was a landmark shift in Soviet military tactics. Departing from half a century of slow, plodding, \"smother the enemy with raw power\" tactics, the Soviet military leadership adopted the lightnin g strike. Overnight, the Soviets had captured the Kabul airfield and had surrounded the capital city with tanks. 4 Tanks? In an overnight invasion? How did 30-ton Sov iet tanks roll from the Soviet border to the interior city of Kabul in one day? Wh at about the rugged Afghan terrain? The answer is simple: there are two highways from t he Soviet Union to Kabul, including one which is 647 miles long. Their bridge s can support tanks. Do you think that Afghan peasants built these roads for yak-draw n carts? Do you think that Afghan peasants built these roads at all? No, you built th em. In 1966, reports on this huge construction project began to appear in obscure U.S. magainzes. The project was completed the following year. It was part of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. Soviet and U.S.' engineers worked side by side, spending U.S. foreign aid money and Soviet money, to get the highways built. One strip of road, 67 miles long, north through the Salang Pass to the U.S.S.R., cost $42 million, or $643,000 per mile. John W. Millers, the leader of t he United National survey team in Afghanistan, commented at the time that it was the most expensive bit of road he had ever seen. The Soviets trained and used 8,000 Afgha ns to build it. 5 If there were any justice in this world of internat ional foreign aid, the Soviet tanks should have rolled by signs that read: \"U.S. Highwa y Tax Dollars at Work.\" Nice guys, the Soviets. They just wanted to help a technologically backward nation. Nice guys, American foreign aid officials. They als o just wanted to help a technologically backward nation... the Soviet Union ."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Seven Decades of Deals The story you are about to read is true. The names have not been changed, so as not to protect the guilty. In the mid-1970's, the original version of this boo k led to the destruction of Antony Sutton's career as a salaried academic researcher w ith the prestigious (and therefore, not quite ideologically tough enough) Hoover Instit ution on War, Revolution and Peace. That was a high price for Sutton to pay, but not nearly so high as the price you and I are going to be asked to pay because of the a ctivities that this book describes in painstaking detail. Lenin is supposed to have made the following observ ation: \"If we were to announce today that we intend to han g all capitalists tomorrow, they would trip over each other trying to sell us the ro pe.\" I don't think he ever said it. However, someone who really understood Lenin, Communism, and capitalist ethics said it. This book shows how accurate an observation it is. Antony Sutton is not about to offer the following e vidence in his own academic self- defense, so I will. Perhaps the best-informed Ameri can scholar in the field of Soviet history and overall strategy is Prof. Richard Pipes of Harvard University. In 1984, his chilling book appeared, Survival Is Not Enough: Soviet Realities and Americ a's Future (Simon & Schuster). His book tells at least part of the story of the Soviet Union's reliance on Western technology, including t he infamous Kama River truck plant, which was built by the Pullman-Swindell comp any of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a subsidiary of M. W. Kellogg Co. Prof. Pipes remar ks that the bulk of the Soviet merchant marine, the largest in the world, was buil t in foreign shipyards. He even tells the story (related in greater detail in this book) of the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company of Springfield, Vermont, which sold the Sov iet Union the ball-bearing machines that alone made possible the targeting mec hanism of Soviet MIRV'ed ballistic missiles. And in footnote 29 on page 290, he reveals the following: In his three-volume detailed account of Soviet purc hases of Western equipment and technology . . . [Antony] Sutton comes to conclusio ns that are uncomfortable for many businessmen and economists. For this reason hi s work tends to be either dismissed out of hand as \"extreme\" or, more often, simply ignored. Prof. Pipes knows how the academic game is played. The game cost Sutton his academic career. But the academic game is very smal l potatoes compared to the historic \"game\" of world conquest by the Soviet emp ire. We are dealing with a messianic State which intends to impose its will on every nation' on earth — a goal which Soviet leaders have repeated constantly since they captured Russia in their nearly bloodless coup in October of 1917. Sutton identifies the deaf mute blindmen who sell t he Soviets the equipment they need for world conquest. But at least these deaf mu te blindmen get something out of it:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"money. Not \"soft currency\" Soviet rubles, either; t hey get U.S. dollars from the Soviets, who in turn get long-term loans that are g uaranteed by U.S. taxpayers. Their motivation is fairly easy to understand. But what d o the academic drones get out of it? What do they get for their systematic suppression o f the historical facts, and their callous treatment in book reviews of works such as Sutton's monumental three- volume set, Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development? What was in it, for example, for C. H. Feinstein of Clare College, Cambridge Unversity, who reviewed Sutton's first volume, covering 1917-1930? He could not honestly fault Sutton's basic scholarship, nor did he try: . . . he has examined a vast amount of information, much of it previously unknown to scholars, regarding the trading contacts and contra cts between the U.S.S.R and the West, notably Germany and the United States. The pr imary sources were the fascinating and extraordinarily detailed files of t he U.S. State Department and the archives of the German Foreign Ministry, and these were supplemented by a wide- ranging and multilingual selection of books and jou rnals. He even wrote that \"Sutton's prodigious researches (and this is apparently only the first of three projected volumes) have provided stu dents of Soviet economic development with a detailed survey of the way in wh ich 'Western' technology was transferred to the Soviet Union, and for this we ar e indebted to him.\" But having admitted this —thereby preserving the surface appea rance of professional integrity — Feinstein then lowered the academic boom: Unfortunately, his attempt to go beyond this, and t o assess the significance of this transfer and of the concessions policy, is unsatisf actory and overstates the extent and impact of the concessions as well as their importan ce for Soviet economic development .... the defects of Sutton's approach . . . a similar lack of understanding... Sutton exaggerates... He further indulges his fondn ess for exaggeration .... 6 You get the basic thrust of the review. \"Facts are fine; we are all scholars here.\" But even the mildest sort of first-stage conclusions co ncerning the importance and significance of such facts are anathema, for the fa cts show that the Soviet economy should have this sign over it: \"Made in the West.\" Sutton's subsequent two volumes were never reviewed in this specialized academic jo urnal — the journal, above all other U.S. scholarly journals, in which it would ha ve been most appropriate to include reviews of scholarly books on Soviet economic histo ry. The information blackout had begun, and it was augmented by the publisher's own blackout beginning in 1973, a blackout discussed in this book. Less than three years after Feinstein's review was published, Bryant Chucking Grinder Co. sold the Soviets the ball-bearing grind ers that subsequently placed the West at the mercy of the Soviet tyrants. At last, t hey possessed the technology which makes possible a relatively low-risk first-strike b y Soviet missiles against our missiles and \"defenses.\" 7 Until Bryant supplied the technology, the Soviets couldn't build such offensive weapons, which is why they had lobbied fr om 1961 until 1972 to get the U.S. government's authorization to buy the units. W ithin a few years after delivery, they had the missiles installed. Then they invaded Afghanistan. So much for Sutton's \"exaggerations.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This book is not really designed to be read word fo r word. It is a kind of lawyer's brief, filled with facts that none of us will remember in detail. But if the facts were not included, the book's thesis would be too far-fetche d to accept. He therefore includes pages and pages of dull, dreary details — details t hat lead to an inescapable conclusion: that the West has been betrayed by its major corporate leaders, with the full compliance of its national political leaders. From this time forward, you can say in confidence t o anyone: \"The United States financed the economic and military development of t he Soviet Union. Without this aid, financed by U.S. taxpayers, there would be no significant Soviet military threat, for there would be no Soviet economy to support the Soviet military machine, let alone sophisticated military equipment.\" Should you r listener scoff, you need only to hand him a copy of this book. it will stuff his mou th with footnotes.

From this day forward, you should never take seriou sly any State Department official (and certainly not the Secretary of State) who anno unces to the press that this nation is now, and has always been, engaged in a worldwide st ruggle against Communism and Soviet aggression. Once in a while, Secretaries of State feel pressured to give such speeches. They are nonsense. They are puffery for t he folks out in middle America. You may note for future reference my observation th at Secretaries of Commerce never feel this pressure to make anti-Communist spe eches. They, unlike Secretaries of State, speak directly for American corporate intere sts. They know where their bread is buttered, and more important, who controls the knif e. When it comes to trading with the enemy, multinatio nal corporate leaders act in terms of the political philosophy of the legendary George Washington Plunkett of Tammany Hall: \"I seen my opportunities, and I took 'em.\" Pl unkett was defending \"honest graft\"; our modern grafters have raised the stakes consider ably.

If Soviet missiles were to take out the bulk of our la nd-based missiles in a first strike, we would have little choice but to surrender, since our submarine-launched missiles are too weak and too inaccurate to destroy hardened Soviet missile silos, and the Soviets could threaten a second wave of missiles ag ainst our cities if we were to attempt to retaliate.

These four books are detailed verifiable catalogs o f Western technology used and in use by the Soviet Union, acquired by gift, purchase , illegal diversion or theft. Taken together, these four volumes constitute an ex traordinary commentary on a basic weakness in the Soviet system and an equally extrao rdinary weakness in Western policy making. The Soviets are heavily dependent on Western technology and innovation not only in their civilian industries, b ut also in their military programs. Technology is, of course, the life blood of modern economic development: technology is the difference between the Third Worl d and the advanced 21st century development epitomised by Silicon Valley in Califor nia. Regrettably, most economists are not qualified to e xplore the role of technology in economic development. Technology is assumed as a \"g iven,\" whereas it is in fact a dynamic factor, the most dynamic factor many would argue, in modern economic development. Similarly, State Department planners, essentially political scientists, are not at home with technology — sufficiently so that in 1963 State issued papers to the effect that the Soviets had only self-generated tec hnology. Even today State and Commerce appear barely conversant with the extent o f Soviet \"reverse engineering.\" Fortunately, Department of Defense is more attuned to technology and among all government departments is alone aware of the magnitude of the problem to be described in The Best Enemy Money Can Buy. The deaf mute blindmen — to quote from Lenin — are those multinational businessmen who see no further than the bottom line of the current contract. Unfortunately, these internationalist operators hav e disproportionate influence in Washington. Consequently, arguments based on the fl imsiest of evidence and the most absurd logic that fly in the face of all we kn ow about the Soviets are able not only to be heard in Washington, but even form the b asis of our policy. An inevitable conclusion from the evidence in this book is that we have totally ignored a policy that would enable us to neutralize Soviet global ambitions while simultaneously reducing the defense budget and the tax load on American citizens. Whether we like it or not, technology is a politica l tool in today's world. And if we want to survive in the face of Soviet ambitions, we will have to use this weapon sooner or later. At the moment the combined efforts of the deaf mute blindmen have been successful. Only an informed, aroused electora te has sufficient potential power to counter their suicidal ambitions. Antony C. Sutton, California, January 1986."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" CHAPTER I America's Deaf Mute Blindmen \"To attribute to others the identical sentiments th at guide oneself is never to understand others.\" — Gustav Le Bon Over the past several decades, quietly, without med ia attention, many Americans in diverse fields of activity have been pressured into silence, and failing silence, have been removed from their positions or excommunicated from a chosen profession. These men range from historians in Department of St ate, top level officials in Department of Commerce, engineers working for IBM, to academics in America's leading universities. In each case threats and pressures which led to cen sorship, firing, and excommunication track back to the deaf mute blindme n, and their associates in political Washington. Who are the deaf mute blindmen? The Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ilych (Ulyanov) Lenin coined the phrase, and whatever we think of Lenin's revolutionary philosop hy, we cannot deny his genius in the analysis of capitalists and their motivations. Here is Lenin on the \"deaf mute blindmen.\" The Capitalists of the world and their governments, in pursuit of conquest of the Soviet market, will close their eyes to the indicat ed higher reality and thus will turn into deaf mute blindmen. They will extend credits, which will stre ngthen for us the Communist Party in their countries and giving us th e materials and technology we lack, they will restore our military industry, indi spensable for our future victorious attacks on our suppliers. In other words, they will labor for the preparation for their own suicide. 1 The Suppressed Higher Reality What is this \"higher reality\" that Lenin identifies ? It is simply that the Soviet system cannot generate sufficient innovation and technolog y to become a world power, yet Soviet global ambitions demand that its socialist s ystem challenge and surpass the capitalist systems of the West. Lenin deduced just before he died in 1923 that Soviet communism had an Achilles heel, a fatal defect. In a remarkable about-face Lenin then introduced the New Economic Policy, a return t o limited free enterprise and a prelude to a long-lasting cooperation with Western capitalists — the deaf mute blindmen. This policy was repeated by Communist Chi na in the early 1980s."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"It is knowledge of this \"higher reality\" that has b een ruthlessly suppressed by successive Administrations under political pressure from internationalist businessmen. The State Department, for example, has a disgracefu l record of attempting to black out information and present a false picture of hist orical events. Under John Foster Dulles, Dr. G. Bernard Noble, a Rhodes scholar and an enemy of any attempt to change the Establishment's party-line, was promoted to take charge of the Historical Office at State Department. Two historians, Dr. Don ald Dozer and Dr. Bryton Barron, who protested the official policy of distorting inf ormation and suppressing historical documents, were railroaded out of the State Departm ent. Dr. Barron, in his book, Inside the State Department, 2 specifically charged the State Department with responsibility for the exportation of military tech nology to the Soviet Union, and listed four examples of highly strategic tools whos e export to the USSR was urged by officials of the State Department. 1. Boring mills for manufacture of tanks, artillery , aircraft, and the atomic reactors used in submarines. 2. Vertical boring mills for manufacture of jet eng ines. 3. Dynamic balance machines used to balance shafts on engines for jet airplanes and guided missiles. 4. External cylindrical grinding machines which a D efense Department expert testified were essential in making engine parts, gu ided missiles, and radar. Bryton Barron concludes: It should be evident that we cannot trust the prese nt personnel of the Department to apply our agreements in the nation's interest any m ore than we can trust it to give us the full facts about our treaties and other interna tional commitments. Breathtakingly inaccurate are the only words that c an describe State Department claims regarding our military assistance to the Sov iet Union. The general State Department line is that the Soviets have a self-dev eloped technology, that trade is always peaceful, that we have controls on the expor t of strategic goods, and that there is no conceivable relationship between our export t o the Soviet Union and Soviet armaments production· An example will make the point. Here is a statement by Ambassador Trezise to the Senate: Ambassador Trezise: We, I think, are sometimes guilty, Senator, of a d egree of false and unwarranted pride in our industrial and technol ogical might, a kind of arrogance, if you will · . . we are ahead of the Soviet Union in many areas of industry and technology. But a nation that can accomplish the sc ientific and technological feats the Soviet Union has accomplished in recent years is cl early not a primitive, mudhut economy .... It is a big, vigorous, strong, and hig hly capable national entity, and its performance in the space field and in other fields has given us every indication that Soviet engineers, technicians, scientists, are in t he forefront of the scientists, engineers, technicians of the world."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Senator Muskie: So that the urge towards increased trade with East ern European countries has not resulted in a weakening of the re strictions related to strategic goods? Ambassador Trezise: I think that is an accurate statement, Senator. Now we have, we think, quite an effective system of handling items which are in the military area or so closely related thereto that th ey become strategic items by everybody's agreement. In fact, at the very time Trezise was making the ab ove soothing statement, critical shipments of strategic materials and equipment were going forward to the Soviet Union. The so-called Export Control laws were a lea ky sieve due to outright inefficiency in Departments of State and Commerce. Censorship has enabled politically appointed offici als and the permanent Washington bureaucracy to make such unbelievably inaccurate st atements without fear of challenge in Congress or by the American public. The State Department files are crammed with informa tion concerning U.S. technical and economic assistance to the Soviet Union. The au thor of this book required three substantial volumes (see Bibliography) just to summ arize this assistance for the years 1917-1970. Yet former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, presumably acting on the advice of State Department researchers, stated in 1 961, \"It would seem clear that the Soviet Union derives only the most marginal help in its economic development from the amount of U.S. goods it receives.\" A statement flatly contradictory to the massive evidence available in departmental files. In 1968 Nicholas de B. Katzenbach, Assistant Secret ary of State, made a statement that was similarly inconsistent with observable fac t, and displayed a fundamental lack of common-sense reasoning: We should have no illusions. If we do not sell peac eful goods to the nations of Eastern Europe, others will. If we erect barriers to our tr ade with Eastern Europe, we will lose the trade and Eastern Europe will buy elsewhere. Bu t we will not make any easier our task of stopping aggression in Vietnam nor in build ing security for the United States. 3 In fact, aggression in South Vietnam would have bee n impossible without U.S. assistance to the Soviet Union. Much of the key \"Eu ropean\" technology cited derives from U.S. subsidiaries. Jack N. Behrman, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Affairs at the Department of Commerce, repeated the same theme on behalf of the Commerce Department: This is the old problem of economic dependency. How ever, I do not believe that Russia would in fact permit herself to become depen dent upon imported sources of strategic goods. Rather she would import amounts ad ditional to her strategic needs, thereby relieving the pressure on her economy by no t risking dependence. 4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"In fact, Jack Behrman to the contrary notwithstandi ng, Soviet Russia is the most dependent large nation in modern history, for wheat as well as technology. Here's another statement from former Secretary of C ommerce Maurice H. Stans: Q : Is there danger of this country's helping the Rus sians build a war potential that might be turned against the interests of the free w orld? A : Under the circumstances, we might be very foolish not to accept business which could create jobs in the United States, when refusi ng to sell to the Soviet Union would in no way deter their progress. 5 Suppression of Information Information suppression concerning Soviet relations with the United States may be found in all administrations, Democrat and Republic an, from President Wilson to President Reagan. For example, on November 28, 1917 , just a few weeks after the Petrograd and Moscow Bolsheviks had overthrown the democratic and constitutional government of Russia, \"Colonel\" House (then in Pari s) intervened on behalf of the Bolsheviks and cabled President Wilson and the Secr etary of State in the \"Special Green\" cipher of the State Department as follows: There has been cabled over and published here [Pari s] statements made by American papers to the effect that Russia should be treated as an enemy. It is exceedingly important that such criticisms should be suppressed ... 6 Suppression of information critical of the Soviet U nion and our military assistance to the Soviets may be traced in the State Department f iles from this 1917 House cable down to the present day, when export licenses issue d for admittedly military equipment exports to the USSR are not available for public information. In fact, Soviet sources must be used to trace the impact of some American technology on Soviet military development. The Soviet Register of Shipping, for example, publishes the technical specifications of main engines in Rus sian vessels (including country of manufacture): this information is not available fro m U.S. official sources. In November 1971, Krasnaya Zvezda published an article with specific reference to the contribution of the basic Soviet industrial structu re to the Soviet military power — a contribution that representatives of the U.S. Execu tive Branch have explicitly denied to the public and to Congress. Even today U.S. assistance to the Soviet military-i ndustrial complex and its weapons systems cannot be documented from open U.S. sources alone because export license memoranda are classified data. Unless the technical nature of our shipments to the USSR is known, it is impossible to determine their contribution to the Soviet military complex. The national security argument is not acce ptable as a defense for classification because the Soviets know what they a re buying. So does the United States government. So do U.S. firms. So do the deaf mute blindmen. The group left out in the cold is the American taxpayer-voter."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"From time to time bills have been introduced in Con gress to make export-license information freely available. These bills have neve r received Administration support. Nonavailability of current information means that d ecisions affecting all Americans are made by a relatively few government officials w ithout impartial outside scrutiny, and under political pressure from internationlist b usinessmen. In many cases these decisions would not be sustained if subjected to pu blic examination and criticism. It is argued by policy-makers that decisions affecting na tional security and international relations cannot be made in a goldfish bowl. The ob vious answer to this is the history of the past seventy years: we have had one catastro phic international problem after another — and in the light of history, the outcome would have been far less costly if the decisions had been made in a goldfish bowl. For instance, little more than a decade after House 's appeal to Wilson, Senator Smoot inquired of the State Department about the possible military end-uses of an aluminum powder plant to be erected in the Soviet Union by W . Hahn, an American engineer. State Department files contain a recently declassif ied document which states why no reply was ever given to Senator Smoot: No reply was made to Senator Smoot by the Departmen t as the Secretary did not desire to indicate that the Department had no objec tion to the rendering by Mr. Hahn of technical assistance to the Soviet authorities i n the production of aluminum powder, in view of the possibility of its use as war materi al, and preferred to take no position at the time in regard to the matter. 7 Congressional action in the Freedom on Information Act and administrative claims of speedy declassification have not changed this basic situation. Major significant documents covering the history of the past seventy years are buried, and they will remain buried until an outraged public opinion puts some pressure on Congress. Congress has on the other hand investigated and sub sequently published several reports on the export of strategic materials to the Soviet Union. One such instance, called \"a life and death matter\" by Congress, conce rned the proposed shipment of ball bearing machines to the USSR. 8 The Bryant Chucking Grinder Company accepted a Soviet order for thirty-five Centalign-B machines f or processing miniature ball bearings. All such precision ball bearings in the U nited States, used by the Department of Defense for missile guidance systems, were processed on seventy-two Bryant Centalign Model-B machines. In 1961 the Department of Commerce approved export of thirty-five such machines to the USSR, which would have given the Soviets cap ability about equal to 50 percent of the U.S. capability. The Soviets had no equipment for such mass producti on processing, and neither the USSR nor any European manufacturer could manufactur e such equipment. A Department of Commerce statement that there were ot her manufacturers was shown to be inaccurate. Commerce proposed to give the Sov iet Union an ability to use its higher-thrust rockets with much greater accuracy an d so pull ahead of the United States. Subsequently, a congressional investigation yielded accurate information not otherwise available to independent nongovernment re searchers and the general public."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Congressional investigations have also unearthed ex traordinary \"errors\" of judgment by high officials. For example, in 1961 a dispute a rose in U.S. government circles over the \"Transfermatic Case\" — a proposal to ship to the USSR two transfer lines (with a total value of $4.3 million) for the produc tion of truck engines. In a statement dated February 23, 1961, the Departm ent of Defense went on record against shipment of the transfer lines on the groun ds that \"the technology contained in these Transfermatic machines produced in the United States is the most advanced in the world,\" and that \"so far as this department kno ws, the USSR has not installed this type of machinery. The receipt of this equipment by the USSR will contribute to the Soviet military and economic warfare potential.\" Th is argument was arbitrarily overturned by the incoming Secretary of Defense Rob ert McNamara. Secretary McNamara did not allow for the known fact that most Soviet military trucks came from two American-built plants even then receiving equipment from the United States. The Transfermatic machines approved by McNamara had clear and obvious military uses — as the Department of Defense had previously argued. Yet McNamara allowed them to go forward. Yet another calculated deception of the American pu blic can be traced to the Johnson Administration. In 1966 the U.S. Department of Stat e produced a beautiful, extravagantly illustrated brochure of American hand tools. This was printed in Russian, for distribution in Russia, with a preface — in Russian — by Lyndon Johnson. Requests to the State Department for a cop y of this brochure went unanswered.

Imagine the public reaction in 1966, when the Soviets were supplying the North Viets with weapons to kill Amer icans (over 5,000 were killed that year), if it had become known that the State D epartment had published lavish booklets in Russian for free distribution in Russia at taxpayers' expense. However, the point at issue is not the wisdom of pu blication, but the wisdom of concealment. The public is not told because the pub lic might protest. In other words, the public cannot be trusted to see things in the s ame light as the policymakers, and the policymakers are unwilling to defend their posi tions. Further, what would have been the domestic politica l consequences if it had been known that a U.S. President had signed a document i n Russian, lavishly produced at the taxpayers' expense for free distribution in Rus sia, while Russian weapons were killing Americans in Vietnam with assistance from o ur own deaf mute blindmen? The citizen-taxpayer does not share the expensive illus ions of the Washington elite., The political reaction by the taxpayer, and his few sup porters in Congress, would have been harsh and very much to the point. The Deaf Mute Blindmen The key party interested in concealment of informat ion about our export to the Soviet Union is, of course, the American firms and individ uals prominently associated with such exports, i.e., the deaf mute blindmen themselv es. In general, the American public has a basic right t o know what is being shipped and who is shipping it, if the Soviets are using the ma terial against us. The public also has a right to know about the personal interests of pre sidential appointees and previous employment with firms prominent in trade with the U SSR. Until recently, the firms involved could publicly c laim ignorance of the use to which the Soviets put imported Western technology. It is not a good claim, but it was made. From the 1970's on, ignorance of end-use is not a v alid claim. The evidence is clear, overwhelming, and readily available: the Soviets ha ve used American technology to kill Americans and their allies. The claim that publication of license information w ould give undue advantage to competitors is not the kind of argument that an hon est businessman would make. It is only necessary to publish certain basic elementary information: date, name of firm, amount, destination in the USSR, and a brief statem ent of the technical aspects. Every industry has a \"grapevine\" and potential business i n an industry is always common knowledge. In any event, suppose there was adverse comment about a particular sale to the Soviets? Is this a bad thing? If our policies are i ndeed viable, why fear public opinion? Or are certain sectors of our society to be immune from public criticism?

The problem was suspected, but the compilation of the proof had to wait several decades until the evidence became available from Soviet sources.

In general, only those who had already made up their minds that Sovi et trade was desirable had access to license informati on. These were the deaf mute blindmen only able to see their own conception of e vents and blind to the fact that we had contributed to construction of Soviet military power. In 1968, for example, the Gleason Company of Roches ter, New York shipped equipment to the Gorki automobile plant in Russia, a plant previously built by the Ford Motor Company. The information about shipment did not come from 'the censored licenses but from foreign press sources. K nowledge of license application for any equipment to be used to Gorki would have el icited vigorous protests to Congress. Why? Because the Gorki plant produces a w ide range of military vehicles and equipment. Many of the trucks used on the Ho Ch i Minh trail were GAZ vehicles from Gorki. The rocket-launchers used against Israe l are mounted on GAZ-69 chassis made at Gorki. They have Ford-type engines made at Gorki. Thus, a screen of censorship vigorously supported b y multinational businessmen has withheld knowledge of a secret shift in direction o f U.S. foreign policy. This shift can be summarized as follows: 1. Our long-run technical assistance to the Soviet Union has built a first-order military threat to our very existence. 2. Our lengthy history of technical assistance to t he Soviet military structure was known to successive administrations, but has only r ecently (1982) been admitted to Congress or to the American public. 3. Current military assistance is also known, but i s admitted only on a case-by-case basis when information to formulate a question can be obtained from nongovernment sources. 4. As a general rule, detailed data on export licen ses, which are required to establish the continuing and long-run dependence of the Soviet military-indu strial complex on the United States, have been made available to Cong ress only by special request, and have been denied completely to the American public at large. In brief, all presidential administrations, from th at of Woodrow Wilson to that of Ronald Reagan, have followed a bipartisan foreign p olicy of building up the Soviet Union. This policy is censored. It is a policy of s uicide. Persistent pressure from nongovernmental researcher s and knowledgeable individuals has today forced the Administration to at least pub licly acknowledge the nature of the problem but still do very little about it. For inst ance, in an interview on March 8, 1982, William Casey, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, made the following revealing statement:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"We have determined that the Soviet strategic advanc es depend on Western technology to a far greater degree than anybody ever dreamed o f. It just doesn't make any sense for us to spend additional billions of dollars to p rotect ourselves against the capabilities that the Soviets have developed largel y by virtue of having pretty much of a free ride on our research and development. They use every method you can imagine — purchase, l egal and illegal; theft; bribery; espionage; scientific exchange; study of trade pres s, and invoking the Freedom of Information Act — to get this information. We found that scientific exchange is a big hole. We send scholars or young people to the Soviet Union to study Pushkin poetry; they send a 45-year-old man out of their KGB or defense establishment to exactly the schools and the professors who are working on sensitive technologies. The KGB has developed a large, independent, special ized organization which does nothing but work on getting access to Western scien ce and technology. They have been recruiting about 100 young scientists and engi neers a year for the last 15 years. They roam the world looking for technology to pick up. Back in Moscow there are 400 or 500 assessing what they might need and where they might get it — doing their targeting and then asses sing what they get. It's a very sophisticated and farflung operation. 10 Unfortunately, Mr. Casey, who pleads surprise at th e discovery, is still concealing the whole story. This author (not alone) made this know n to Department of Defense over 15 years ago , with a request for information to develop the ful l nature of the problem. This exchange of letters is reproduced as Appendix A. Nothing was done in 1971. In the past 15 years there has been a superficial chan ge — the Reagan Administration is now willing to admit the existence of the problem. It has not yet been willing to fac e the policy challenge. Until the deaf mute blindmen are neutralized, our assistance for Soviet strategic advances will continue.

Pravd a, July 20, 1927 At the end of World War II the U.S. government appo inted an interagency committee to consider the future of the German automobile ind ustry and its war-making potential. This committee concluded that any motor vehicle industry in any country is an important factor in that country's war potential. More than half U.S. tanks, almost all armored and h alf-track vehicles and one-third of guns over 33 millimeter were manufactured in U.S. c ivilian motor vehicle plants. Consequently, the committee unanimously recommended : 1. Any vehicle industry is a major force for war. 2. German automotive manufacturing should be prohib ited because it was a war industry. 3. Numerous military products can be made by the au tomobile industry, including aerial torpedoes, aircraft cannon, aircraft instrum ents, aircraft engines, aircraft engines parts, aircraft ignition testers, aircraft machine guns, aircraft propeller subassemblies, aircraft propellers, aircraft servicing and testing equipment, aircraft struts, airframes, and so on. A total of 300 items of military equipme nt was listed. A comparison of the recommendations from this commi ttee with subsequent administrative recommendations and policies for the export of automobile- manufacturing plants to the Soviet Union demonstrat es extraordinary inconsistencies. If automobile-manufacturing capacity has \"warlike\" pot ential for Germany and the United States, then it also has \"warlike\" poten tial for the Soviet Union. But the recommendations for post-war Germany and the So viet Union are totally divergent. Some of the same Washington bureaucrats (for example, Charles R. Weaver of the Department of Commerce) participated in making both decisions. In brief, any automobile or tractor plant can be us ed to produce tanks, armored cars, military trucks, other military vehicles and equipm ent. A major conclusion reached by a U.S. interagency committee formed to study the wa r-making potential of the U.S. and German automotive industries was that a motor v ehicle industry has enormous military potential."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\"The Committee recognized without dissent that [Ger many's] motor vehicle industry was an important factor in her waging of war during World War II.\" On the basis of its findings, the committee recomme nded that the manufacture of complete automobiles in Germany be prohibited, that the manufacture of certain parts and subassemblies be \"specifically prohibited,\" and that Germany \"should not be permitted to retain in her possession any types of vehicles or particular military application, such as track-laying vehicles, multi-a xle vehicles, etc.\" The committee further listed more than 300 \"war pro ducts manufactured by the automotive industry.\" These conclusions have been ignored for the Soviet automobile industry, even while the Soviets themselves officially stated their inte ntion to use foreign automobile technology for military vehicles as early as 1927 . V. V. Ossinsky, a top planner, wrote a series of articles for Pravda (July 20, 21 and 22, 1927) with the following warning: If in a future war we use the Russian peasant cart against the American or European automobile, the result to say the least will be dis proportionately heavy losses, the inevitable consequences of technical weakness. This is certainly not industrialized defense. The Soviet military-civilian vehicle manufacturing industry, as subsequently developed, produces a limited range of utilitarian trucks and automobiles in a few large plants designed, built by, and almost entirel y equipped with Western, primarily American, technical assistance and machinery. These motor vehicle plants mostly manufacture their own components and ship these to assembly plants elsewhere in the Soviet Union. There is a high degree of integration between Russi an military and civilian vehicle models. Military and civilian vehicles have interch angeable parts and Soviet policy is to maximize unification of military and civilian de signs to assist model change-over in case of war. This unification of military and civilian automobil e design has been described by the Soviet economist A. N. Lagovskiy: The fewer design changes between the old and the ne w type of product, the easier and more rapidly the enterprise will shift to new produ ction. If, for example, chassis, motors, and other parts of a motor vehicle of a civ ilian model are used for a military motor vehicle, or course, the shift to the mass pro duction of the military motor vehicle will occur considerably faster and more easily than if the design of all the main parts were different. Lagovskiy notes that Soviet \"civilian\" agricultural tractors and motor vehicles can be used directly as military vehicles without major co nversion. Soviet tractors (direct copies of Caterpillar models) were used as artiller y tractors in World War II and Korea. General G. I. Pokrovski makes a similar argu ment about the U.S. 106- millimeter recoilless weapon mounted on a Willys je ep and comments that \"even"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"relatively powerful recoilless artillery systems ca n, at the present time, be mounted on a light automobile without reducing the number of m en accomodated.\" 11 Almost all — possibly 95 percent — of Soviet milita ry vehicles are produced in very large plants designed by American engineers in the 1930s through the 1970s. The Soviet Military Truck Industry Soviet civilian and military trucks are produced in the same plants and have extensive interchangeability of parts and components. For exa mple, the ZIL-131 was the main 31/2-ton 6x6 Soviet military truck used in Vietnam and Afghanistan and is produced also in a civilian 4 x 2 version as the ZIL-130. Ov er 60 percent of the parts in the ZIL- 131 military truck are common to the ZIL-130 civili an truck. All Soviet truck technology and a large part of Sov iet truck-manufacturing equipment has come from the West, mainly from the United Stat es. While some elementary transfers-lines and individual machines for vehicle production are made in the Soviet Union, these are copies of Western machines and alw ays obsolete in design. Many major American companies have been prominent i n building up the Soviet truck industry. The Ford Motor Company, the A. J. B randt Company, the Austin Company, General Electric, Swindell-Dressier, and o thers supplied the technical assistance, design work, and equipment of the origi nal giant plants. This Soviet military-civilian truck industry origin ally comprised two main groups of plants, plus five newer giant plants. The first gro up used models, technical assistance, and parts and components from the Ford-built Gorki automobile plant (GAZ is the model designation). The second group of production plants used models, parts, and components from the A. J. Brandt-rebuilt ZIL plant in Moscow (Zavod imeni Likhachev, formerly the AMO and later the Stalin pl ant). Consequently this plant was called the BBH-ZIL plant after the three companies involved in its reconstruction and expansion in the 1930s: A. J. Brandt, Budd, and Ham ilton Foundry. There is a fundamental difference between the Ford and Brandt companies. Brandt had only one contract in the USSR, to rebuild the o ld AMO plant in 1929. AMO in 1930 had a production of 30,000 trucks per year, co mpared to the Gorki plant, designed from scratch by Ford for an output of 140, 000 vehicles per year. Ford is still interested in Russian business. Brandt is not inter ested and has not been since 1930. The Ford-Gorki group of assembly plants includes th e plants at Ulyanovsk (model designation UAZ), Odessa (model designation OAZ), a nd Pavlovo (model designation PAZ). The BBH-ZIL group includes the tr uck plants at Mytischiy (MMZ model designation), Miass (or URAL Zis), Dnepropetr ovsk (model designation DAZ), Kutaisi (KAZ model), and Lvov (LAZ model). Besides these main groups there are also five independent plants. The Minsk truck plant (MAZ) was built with German assistance. The Hercules-Yaroslavl truck plant (YaA z) was built by the Hercules Motor Company. The MZMA plant in Moscow, which manu factures small automobiles, was also built by Ford Motor Company."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"In the late 1960s came the so-called Fiat-Togliatti auto plant. Three-quarters of this equipment came from the United States. Then in 1972 the U.S. government issued $1 billion in licenses to export equipment and technic al assistance for the Kama truck plant. Planned as the largest truck plant in the wo rld, it covers 36 square miles and produces more heavy trucks, including military truc ks, than the output of all U.S. heavy truck manufacturers combined. (Togliatti and Kama are described in Chapter Three below.) This comprises the complete Soviet vehicle manufact uring industry — all built with Western, primarily American, technical assistance a nd technology. Military models are produced in these plants utilizing the s ame components as the civilian models. The two main vehicle production centers, Go rki and ZIL, manufacture more than two-thirds of all Soviet civilian vehicles (ex cluding the new Togliatti and Kama plants) and almost all current military vehicles. The Ford Gorki \"Automobile\" Plant In May 1929 the Soviets signed an agreement with th e Ford Motor Company of Detroit. The Soviets agreed to purchase $13 million worth of automobiles and parts and Ford agreed to give technical assistance until 1938 to construct an integrated automobile-manufacturing plant at Nizhni-Novgorod. Construction was completed in 1933 by the Austin Company for production of the Fo rd Model-A passenger car and light truck. Today this plant is known as Gorki. Wi th its original equipment supplemented by imports and domestic copies of impo rted equipment, Gorki produces the GAZ range of automobiles, trucks, and military vehicles. All Soviet vehicles with the model prefix GAZ ( Gorki Avtomobilnyi Zavod) are from Gorki, and models with prefixes UAX, OdAZ, and PAZ are made from Gork i components. In 1930 Gorki produced the Ford Model-A (known as G AZ-A) and the Ford light truck (called GAZ-AA). Both these Ford models were immediately adopted for military use . By the late 1930s production at Gorki was 80,000-9 0,000 \"Russian Ford\" vehicles per year. The engine production facilities at Gorki were desi gned under a technical assistance agreement with the Brown Lipe Gear Company for gear -cutting technology and Timken-Detroit Axle Company for rear and front axle s. Furthermore, U.S. equipment has been shipped in sub stantial quantifies to Gorki and subsidiary plants since the 1930s — indeed some shi pments were made from the United States in 1968 during the Vietnamese War. As soon as Ford's engineers left Gorki in 1930 the Soviets began production of military vehicles. The Soviet BA armored car of the 1930s was the GAZ-A (Ford Model-A) chassis, intended for passenger cars, but converted to an armored car with the addition of a DT machine gun. The BA was follow ed by the BA-10 — the Ford Model-A truck chassis with a mount containing eithe r a 37-millimeter gun or a 12.7- millimeter heavy machine gun. A Red Army staff car was also based on the Ford Model-A in the pre-war period."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"During World War II Gorki produced the GAZ-60 — a h ybrid half-track personnel carrier that combined the GAZ-63 chassis. In the la te 1940s the plant switched to production of an amphibious carrier — The GAZ-46. T his was a standard GAZ-69 chassis with a U.S. quarter-ton amphibious body. In the mid-1950s Gorki produced the GAZ-47 armored amphibious cargo carrier with space for nine men. Its engine was the GAZ-61, a 74 -horsepower Ford-type 6- cylinder in-line gasoline engine — the basic Gorki engine. In the 1960s and 1970s production continued with an improved version of the BAZ- 47 armored cargo carrier, using a GAZ-53 V-8 type e ngine developing 115 horsepower. In brief, the Ford-Gorki plant has a continuous his tory of production of armored cars and wheeled vehicles for Soviet army use: those use d against the United States in Korea and Vietnam. In addition to armored cars, the Ford-Gorki factory manufactures a range of truck- mounted weapons. This series began in the early thi rties with a 76.2-millimeter field howitzer mounted on the Ford-GAZ Model-A truck. Two similar weapons from Gorki before World War II were a twin 25-millimeter antia ircraft machine gun and a quad 7.62-millimeter Maxim antiaircraft machine gun — al so mounted on the Ford-GAZ truck chassis. During World War II Gorki produced several rocket-l aunchers mounted on trucks. First the 12-rail, 300-millimeter launcher; then, f rom 1944 onwards, the M-8, M-13, and M-31 rocket-launchers mounted on GAZo63 trucks. (The GAZ-63 is an obvious direct copy of the U.S. Army's 21/2-ton truck.) Als o during World War II Gorki produced the GAZ-203, 85-horsepower engine for the SU-76 self-propelled gun produced at Uralmashzavod. (Uralmash was designed a nd equipped by American and German companies.) After World War II Gorki production of rocket-launc hers continued with the BM-31, which had twelve 300-millimeter tubes mounted on a GAZ-63 truck chassis. In the late 1950s another model was produced with twelve 1 40-millimeter tubes on a GAZ- 63 truck chassis. In the 1960s yet another model wi th eight 140-millimeter tube was produced on a GAZ-63 chassis. Finally, in 1964 Gorki produced the first Soviet wi re-guided missile antitank system. This consisted of four rocket-launchers mounted on a GAZ-69 chassis. These weapons turned up in Israel in the late 1960s. The GAZ-69 chassis produced at Gorki is also widely used in the Soviet Army as a command vehicle and scout car. Soviet airborne troops use it as a tow for the 57-millimet er antitank gun and the 14.5- millimeter double-barrelled antiaircraft gun. Other Gorki vehicles used by the Soviet military include the GAZ-69 truck, used for towing the 107-millimeter recoilless rifle (RP-107), the GAZ-46, or Soviet jeep, and the GAZ-5 4, a 1 1/2-ton military cargo truck."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"In brief, the Gorki plant, built by the Ford Motor Company the Austin Company and modernized by numerous other U.S. companies under t he policy of \"peaceful trade,\" is today a major producer of Soviet army vehicles and weapo ns carriers. The A. J. Brandt-ZIL Plant A technical assistance agreement was concluded in 1 929 with the Arthur J. Brandt Company of Detroit for the reorganization and expansion of the tsarist AMO truck plant, previously equipped in 1917 with new U.S. equipment. Design work for this expansion was handled in Brandt's Detroit office an d plant and American engineers were sent to Russia. The AMO plant was again expanded in 1936 by the Budd Company and Hamilton Foundry and its name was changed to ZIS (now ZIL). During World War II the original equipment was removed to establish the URA LS plant and the ZIS plant was re-established with Lend-Lease equipment. The first armored vehicle produced at AMO was an adaptation of the civilian Z IL-6 truck produced after the Brandt reorganization in 1 930. This vehicle was converted into a mount for several self-propelled weapons, in cluding the single 76.2-millimeter antiaircraft gun and the 76.2-millimeter antitank g un. In World War II the ZIL-6 was adapted for the 85-mi llimeter antitank and antiaircraft guns, quadruple 7.62 Maxims, and several self-prope lled rocket-launchers, including the M-8 36-rail, 80-millimeter, and the Katyusha mo del M-13/A 16-rail, 130- millimeter rocket-launcher. In the immediate postwar period the ZIL-150 truck c hassis was used as a mount for the model M-13 rocket-launcher and the ZIL-151 truc k was used as a mount for the M-31 rocket-launcher. In addition, the ZIL-151 truc k was used as a prime mover for the 82-millimeter gun. In 1953 the ZIL-151 truck was adapted for several o ther weapons, including the BM- 24, 240-millimeter, 12-tube rocket-launcher; the RM -131-millimeter, 32-tube rocket- launcher; the BM-14, 140-millimeter, 16-tube rocket -launcher, and the 200-millimeter, 4-tube rocket-launcher. In the 1960s the ZIL-157 truck became a mount for t he GOA-SA-2 antiaircraft missile, and a prime mover for another rocket syste m. The ZIL plant has also produced unarmored cargo and troop vehicles for the Soviet Army. In 1932 the ZIL-33 was developed; an unarmore d half-track used as a troop carrier. In 1936 the ZIL-6 was developed as a half- track and during World War II the ZIL-42 was developed as a 21/2-ton tracked weapons carrier. In the postwar period the ZIL-151 truck chassis was adapted for the BTR-1 52 armored troop carrier. In the 1950s the ZIL-485 was developed; a replica of the A merican DUKW mounted on a ZIL-151 truck, and followed by an improved DUKW mou nted on a ZIL-157 truck."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"From 1954 onwards new versions of the BTR-152 were added, based on the ZIL-157 truck. In the 1960s a new BTR-60 (8 x 8) amphibious personnel carrier was developed with a ZIL-375 gasoline engine. Other ZIL vehicles are also used for military purpo ses. For example the ZIL-111 is used as a radar and computer truck for antiaircraft systems and as a tow for the M-38 short 122-millimeter howitzer The ZIL-111 is copied from Studebaker 6 x 6 trucks supplied under Lend-Lease. There is a great deal of interchangeability between the military and civilian versions of the ZIL family of vehicles. For example, an arti cle in Ordnance states: In the 1940s the ZIL-151, a 21/2-ton 6 x 6 was the work horse of the Soviet Army. It was replaced in the 1950s by the ZIL-157, an appare nt product improved version. In the 1960s, however, this vehicle class requirement was met by the ZIL-131, a 31/2- ton 6 x 6 vehicle, essentially a military design. I t is of interest to note that a civilian version was marketed as the ZIL-130 in a 4 x 2 conf iguration. Over 60 percent of the components in the military version are common to th e civilian vehicle. Thus the ZIL plant, originally designed and rebuilt under the supervision of the A. J. Brandt Company of Detroit in 1930 and equipped by o ther American companies, was again expanded by Budd and Hamilton Foundry in 19;3 6. Rebuilt with Lend-Lease equipment and periodically updated with late model imports, ZIL has had a long and continuous history of producing Soviet military car go trucks and weapons carriers. On April 19, 1972, the U.S. Navy photographed a Rus sian freighter bound for Haiphong with a full load of military cargo, includ ing a deck load of ZIL-130 cargo trucks and ZIL-555 dump trucks (Human Events, May 13, 1972). Thus the \"peaceful trade\" of the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s, 1960s an d the 1970s was used to kill Americans in Vietnam, and commit genocide in Afghan istan. The original 1930 equipment was removed from ZIL in 1944 and used to build the Miass plant. It was replaced by Lend-Lease equipmen t, was supplemented by equipment imports in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The Urals plant at Miass (known as Urals ZIS or ZIL ) was built in 1944 and largely tooled with equipment evacauted form the Moscow ZIL plant. The Urals Miass plant started production with the Urals-5 light truck, ut ilizing an engine with the specifications of the 1920 Fordson (original Ford M otor Company equipment supplied in the late 1920s was used, supplemented b y Lend-Lease equipment). The Urals plant today produces weapons models: for exam ple, a prime mover for guns, including the long-range 130-millimeter cannon, and two versions — tracked and wheeled — of a 12-ton prime mover. Possibly there may have been doubt as to Soviet end -use of truck plants back in the 20s and ;30s, but the above information certainly w as known to Washington at least by the mid 1960s when this author's first volume wa s published.

Under intense political pressure from the deaf mute blindmen, U.S. politicians, particularly in the Johnson and Nixon administratio ns under the prodding of Henry Kissinger (a long-time employee of the Rockefeller family), allowed the Togliatti (Volgograd) and Kama River plants to be built. The Volgograd automobile plant, built between 1968 and 1971, has a capacity of 600,000 vehicles per year, three times more than th e Ford-built Gorki plant, which up to 1968 had been the largest auto plant in the USSR . Although Volgograd is described in Western literatu re as the \"Togliatti plant\" or the \"Fiat-Soviet auto plant,\" and does indeed produce a version of the Fiat-124 sedan, the core of the technology is American. Three-quarters of the equipment, including the key transfer lines and automatics, came from the Un ited States. It is truly extraordinary that a plant with known military pote ntial could have been equipped from the United States in the middle of the Vietnam ese War, a war in which the North Vietnamese received 80 percent of their supplies fr om the Soviet Union. The construction contract, awarded to Fiat S.p.A., a firm closely associated with Chase Manhattan Bank, included an engineering fee o f $65 million. The agreement between Fiat and the Soviet government included: The supply of drawing and engineering data for two automobile models, substantially similar to the Fiat types of current production, bu t with the modifications required by the particular climatic and road conditions of the country; the supply of a complete manufacturing plant project, with the definition of the machine tools, toolings, control apparatus, etc.; the supply of the necessary know-h ow, personnel training, plant start- up assistance, and other similar services. All key machine tools and transfer lines came from the United States. While the tooling and fixtures were designed by Fiat, over $5 0 million worth of the key special equipment came from U.S. suppliers. This included:"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"1.

Transfer lines and machines for other components , including transfer lines for machining of differential carriers and housing, aut omatic lathes, machine tools for production of gears, transmission sliding sleeves, splined shafts, and hubs. 4. Machines for body parts, including body panel pr esses, sheet straighteners, parts for painting installations, and upholstery processing e quipment. 5. Materials-handling, maintenance, and inspection equipment consisting of overhead twin-rail Webb-type conveyors, assembly and storage lines, special tool 'sharpeners for automatic machines, and inspection devices. Some equipment was on the U.S. Export Control and C o-Corn lists as strategic, but this proved no setback to the Johnson Administratio n: the restrictions were arbitrarily abandoned. Leading U.S. machine-tool firms particip ated in supplying the equipment: TRW, Inc. of Cleveland supplied steering linkages; U.S. Industries, Inc. supplied a \"major portion\" of the presses; Gleason Works of Ro chester, New York (well known as a Gorki supplier) supplied gear-cutting and heat -treating equipment; New Britain Machine Company supplied automatic lathes. Other eq uipment was supplied by U.S. subsidiary companies in Europe and some came direct ly from European firms (for example, Hawker-Siddeley Dynamics of the United Kin gdom supplied six industrial robots). In all, approximately 75 percent of the pr oduction equipment came from the United States and some 25 percent from Italy and ot her countries in Europe, including U.S. subsidiary companies. In 1930, when Henry Ford undertook to build the Gor ki plant, contemporary Western press releases extolled the peaceful nature of the Ford automobile, even though Pravda had openly stated that the Ford automobile was want ed for military purposes. Notwithstanding naive Western press releases, Gorki military vehicles were later used to help kill Americans in Korea and Vietnam. In 1968 Dean Rusk and Wait Rostow once again extoll ed the peaceful nature of the automobile, specifically in reference to the Volgog rad plant. Unfortunately for the credibility of Dean Rusk and Wait Rostow, there exi sts a proven military vehicle with an engine of the same capacity as the one prod uced at the Volgograd plant. Moreover, we have the Gorki and ZIL experience. Fur ther, the U.S. government's own committees have stated in writing and at detail ed length that any motor vehicle plant has war potential. Even further, both Rusk an d Rostow made explicit statements to Congress denying that Volgograd had military pot ential.

In other words, the statements can only be considered as deliberate falsehoods to mislead Cong ress and the American public."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"It was argued by Washington politicians that a U.S. jeep engine is more powerful than the engine built at Togliatti. The engine is indeed about two-thirds as powerful as the jeep engine, but a proven vehicle of excellent capa bilities utilizing a 1,500 cc. 4- cylinder Opel engine developing 36 horsepower: this same engine later powered the Moskvitch-401 and the Moskvitch-402 (Moskva) milita ry cross-country 4-wheel drive version of the 401, produced at the MZMA in M oscow. In brief, there already existed a tested and usable military vehicle capable of transporting men or adaptable for weapons use and p owered by a !,500 cc. engine, the same size as the engine supplied for Togliatti. The refore statements by U.S. officials to the effect that the Togliatti plant has no milit ary capabilities are erroneous. Military possibilities for such a small engine incl ude use in a special-purpose small military vehicle (like the American jeep), or as a propulsive unit in a specially designed vehicle for carrying either personnel or w eapons. Soviet strategy is currently toward supply of wars of \"national liberation.\" The Togliatti vehicle is an excellent replacement for the bicycle used in Vietnam. The GA Z-46 is the Soviet version of the U.S. jeep, and we know that such a vehicle figures in Soviet strategic thinking. The War Potential of the Kama Truck Plant Up to 1968 American construction of Soviet military truck plants was presented as \"peaceful trade.\" In the late 1960s Soviet planners decided to build the largest truck factory in the world. This plant, spread over 36 sq uare miles situated on the Kama River, has an annual output of 100,000 multi-axle 1 0-ton trucks, trailers, and off-the- road vehicles. It was evident from the outset, given abs ence of Soviet technology in the automotive industry, that the design, engineeri ng work, and key equipment for such a facility would have to come from the United States. In 1972, under President Nixon and National Securit y Adviser Henry Kissinger, the pretense of \"peaceful trade\" was abandoned and the Department of Commerce admitted (Human Events, Dec. 1971) that the proposed Kama plant had militar y potential. Not only that, but according to a depart ment spokesman, the military capability was taken into account when the export l icenses were issued for Kama. The following American firms received major contrac ts to supply production equipment for the gigantic Kama heavy truck plant: Glidden Machine & Tool, Inc., North Tonawanda, New York — Milling machines and other machine tools. Gulf and Western Industries, Inc., New York, N.Y. — A contract for $20 million of equipment. Holcroft & Co., Kovinia, Michigan — Several contrac ts for heat treatment furnaces for metal parts.

The concept originally came from Nation al Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, who reportedly sold President Nixon on t he idea that giving military technology to the Soviets would temper their global territorial ambitions. How Henry arrived at this gigantic non sequitur is not known. Sufficient to state that he aroused considerable concern over his motivations. Not leas t that Henry had been a paid family employee of the Rockefellers since 1958 and has served as International Advisory Committee Chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, a Rockefeller concern. The U.S.-Soviet trade accords including Kama and ot her projects were signed by George Pratt Shultz, later to become Secretary of S tate in the Reagan Administration and long known as a proponent of more aid and trade to the Soviets. Shultz is former President of Bechtel Corporation, a multi-national contractor and engineering firm. American taxpayers underwrote Kama financing throug h the Export-Import Bank. The head of Export-Import Bank at that time was Wil liam J. Casey, a former associate of Armand Hammer and now (1985) Director of the Cen tral Intelligence Agency. Financing was arranged by Chase Manhattan Bank, who se then Chairman was David Rockefeller. Chase is the former employer of Paul V olcker, now Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank. Today, William Casey denies k nowledge of the military applications (see page 195), although this was emph atically pointed out to official Washington 15 years ago. We cite these names to demonstrate the tight interl ocking hold proponents of miltiary aid to the Soviet Union maintain on top policy maki ng government positions.

Critics of Kama Silenced and Suppressed"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"For two decades rumors have surfaced that critics o f aid to the Soviet Union have been silenced. Back in the 1930s General Electric w arned its employees in the Soviet Union not to discuss their work in the USSR under p enalty of dismissal. In the 1950s and 1960s IBM fired engineers who publ icly opposed sale of IBM computers to the USSR. Let's detail two cases for the record; obviously th is topic requires Congressional investigation. At some point the American public ne eds to know who has suppressed this information, and to give these peri sons an op portunity to defend their actions in public. The most publicized case is that of Lawrence J. Bra dy, now Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Administration. Ten years ago Br ady was a strong critic of exporting the Kama River truck technology. In his o wn words (in 1982 before a Senate Investigating Committee) is Brady's view on Kama River. Mr. Brady : Mr. Chairman, it is a privilege for me to be here again. I have testified before this subcommittee previously. As a matter of fact, it is 3 years ago this month that I testified over on the House side before the House Armed Services Committee in which I disagreed with the political appointees of the Carter administration and indicated that the technology which we were licensi ng to the Soviet Union, specifically for the Kama River plant, was being di verted to the Soviet military. It is 10 years ago this month that the President of the U nited States inaugurated the era of detente with a trip to Moscow. A central component of that historic trip was the h ope that greatly expanded trade ties between the East and the West would lead to mutual cooperation and understanding. Obviously, those hopes have not taken place. In tha t 10-year period, as we in the administration have indicated in the last year, we have been exploited both legally and illegally by the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. T his technology which has helped the Soviet immensely in their military industrial i nfrastruture. Again, 3 years ago, I personally disclosed the failures of the Commerce D epartment in the licensing process, referring to it, as I said in my testimony , as a shambles. 12 Brady went on to note that his reward for surfacing vital information was criticism and suppression. Chairman Roth [presiding]: Thank you, Mr. Brady. Mr. Brady, the members of the subcommittee are, of course, aware of your personal commitment to this important area, but | believe it is important that the record reflect fully your position on the specific question of export technology and particul arly reference the efforts some years ago to help the Soviet Union construct some t rucking facilities. Would you, for the purposes of the record, explain your role in this matter? Mr. Brady: Mr. Chairman, about 3 years ago, the Export Adminis tration Act was up for review for extension. As part of that review, t he House Armed Services Committee decided that it was going to hold hearing s on that extension, in addition to"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"the committee of appropriate jurisdiction, namely t he Foreign Affairs Committee on the House side. There were some statements being made on both sides in Congress that were not totally consistent with the facts. We had intellige nce information that trucks were being produced at the Kama River plant for the Sovi et military and, in fact, being distributed to Eastern Europe for use in East Europ ean endeavors. An administration witness was asked about that and denied it. I was asked about it and confirmed it. And, as a result of that, I was label ed a whistleblower and eventually left the Department of Commerce. In point of fact, that was the tip of the iceberg. There had been apparently intelligence through the 1970s, particularly the latter half of the seventies, indicating that there was substantial di version taking place (and) . . . for some reason the intelligence just didn't get to the top. So that was my role. I eventually had to leave Government for it. 13 However, Mr. Brady was unaware of a similar and muc h earlier story of suppression in the Kama case which paralleled his own. In the years 1960-1974 this writer authored a three volume series, Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development, published between 1968 and 197:3 by the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where the author was Research Fellow. This series cataloged the origins of Soviet technol ogy from 1917 down to the early 1970s. The series excluded the military aspects of technical transfers. However, the work totally contradicted U.S. Government public statements. Fo r example, in 1963 State Department claimed in its public pronouncemen ts that all Soviet technology was indigenous, a clear misunderstanding or dismissal o f the facts. By the early 1970s it was clear to this author that a significant part of Soviet military capability also came from the West, even though thi s assessment was also refuted by U.S. government analysts. Quietly, without governme nt or private funding, this author researched and wrote National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union. The manuscript was accepted by Arlington House. Both au thor and publisher maintained absolute silence about the existence of the manuscr ipt until publication date. When news of publication reached Stanford, there wa s immediate reaction — a hostile reaction. A series of meetings was called b y Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn Campbell. Campbell's objectives were: 1) to withdraw the book from publication, 2) failing that, to disassociate Hoover Institution from the book and the author. Campbell initially claimed that National Suicide was a plagiarism of the author's works published by Hoover. This was shown to be non sense. In any event an author can hardly plagiarize himself. The objective, of co urse, was to persuade author and publisher to withhold publication. Both the author and Arlington House refused to withdraw the book and continued with publication. T he book was published and sold over 50,000 copies."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"After the unsuccessful attempt at suppression Glenn Campbell arbitrarily removed the title Research Fellow from the author and removed b oth his name and that of his secretary from the personnel roll of the Hoover Ins titution. This effectively disassociated Hoover Institution from the book and its contents. The author became a non-person. Two years later the author voluntarily left Hoover Institution and assumed a private role unconnected with any researc h foundation or organization. These events happened some years before Mr. Brady o f Commerce took his own personal stand and suffered a similar fate. By a strange quirk of fate, Glenn Campbell is today Chairman of Mr. Reagan's Intelligence Oversight Committee. Who were the Deaf Mute Blindmen at Kama River? Clearly, the Nixon Administration at the highest le vels produced more than a normal number of deaf mutes — those officials who knew the story of our assistance to the Soviets but for their own reasons were willing to p ush forward a policy that could only work to the long run advantage of the United S tates. It is paradoxical that an Administration that was noisy in its public anti-co mmunist stance, and quick to point out the human cost of the Soviet system, was also a n Administration that gave a gigantic boost to Soviet military truck capacity. Possibly campaign contributions had something to do with it. Multina-tionals listed below as prime contractors on Kama River were also major political contributors. However, the significant link never explored by Con gress is that Henry Kissinger, the key promoter of the Kama River truck plant at the p olicy level, was a former and long-time employee of the Rockefeller family — and the Rockefellers are the largest single shareholders in Chase Manhattan Bank (David was then Chairman of the Board) and Chase was the lead financier for Kama River .

The industrial revolution of the late 18th and 19th centuries was based on canals and iron. Railroads were a fundamental innov ation of the first third of the 19th century. In the late 19th century the Bessemer proc ess enabled mass production of cheap steel. The internal combustion engine in the 1900s began another revolution. Atomic energy in the 1940s started the atomic age. In the 1970s the semi-conductor was first mass prod uced in California. The economy of the 21st century will evolve around the silicon chip, i.e., the integrated circuit memory chip and semi-conductor components. No country large or small will make any progress in the late 20th century without an ability to manufacture integrated circuits and asso ciated devices. These are the core of the new industrial revolution, both civilian and mi litary, and essentially the same device is used for both military and civilian end u ses. A silicon chip is a silicon chip, except that military quality requirements may be mo re strict than civilian ones. This electronic revolution originated in Santa Clar a Valley, California in the 1950s and roughly centers around Stanford University. Stanford is also in many ways at the core of the de bate over transfer of our military technology to the Soviet Union. Congressman Ed Zsch au (Rep. Menlo Park) represents the Silicon Valley area and is a strong proponent of more aid to the Soviets. On the other hand, also in Silicon Valley, this aut hor's six books critical of our technological transfers to the Soviets originated, and three were published at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University (See Biblio graphy for titles). Silicon Valley gets its name from the essential ele ment silicon used in integrated circuits. An essential component of integrated circ uits is the semi-conductor usually made of silicon and linked to other components such as transistors into a single circuit. By 1971 an entire computer could be produced on a s ingle chip, in itself probably the most significant industrial breakthrough since the discovery that steel could be manufactured on a large scale from iron."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The semi-conductor revolution began in the Silicon Valley and was a challenge to the socialist world to duplicate. This they could not d o. Every single Soviet weapon system has semi-conductor technology which originat ed in California and which has been bought, stolen or acquired from the United Sta tes. Early Soviet Electronic Acquisitions Back in 1929 Pravda commented that without the automobile the Soviet Ar my would be helpless in any future war. Western multinationa ls Ford Motor Company, Hercules Gear, IBM and others helped USSR bridge the gap of the 1920s. Identical aid can be found for electronics. In August 1971 the U.S. Department of Defense paid $2 million to Hamil ton Watch Company for precision watchmaking equipment. Watchm aking equipment is used in fabricating bomb and artillery shell fuses, aircraf t timing gear, pinions, and similar military components. Most Soviet watch-manufacturin g equipment has been supplied from the United States and Switzerland; in some cases the Soviets use copies of these foreign machines. In 1929 the old Miemza concession factory, formerly a tsarist plant, received the complete equipment of the Ansonia Clock Company of New York, purchased for $500,000. This became the Second State Watch Factory in Moscow, brought into production by American and German engineers, and ad apted to military products. In 1920 the complete Deuber-Hampton Company plant a t Canton, Ohio, was transferred to the Soviet Union, and brought into production by forty American technicians. Up to 1930 all watch components used i n the Soviet Union had been imported from the United States and Switzerland. Th is new U.S.-origin manufacturing capability made possible the production of fuses and precision gears for military purposes; during World War II it was s upplemented by Lend-Lease supplies and machinery. After World War II Soviet advances in military inst rumentation were based on U.S. and British devices, although the German contribution was heavy in the 1950s. About 65 percent of the production facilities removed from Germany were for the manufacture of power and lighting equipment, teleph one, telegraph, and communications equipment, and cable and wire. The r emainder consisted of German plants to manufacture radio tubes and radios, and m ilitary electronics facilities for such items as secret teleprinters and anti-aircraft equipment. Many German wartime military electronic development s were made at the Reichpost Forschungsinstitut (whose director later went to th e USSR) and these developments were absorbed by the Soviets, including television, infrared devices, radar, electrical coatings, acoustical fuses, and similar equipment. But although 80 percent of the German electrical and military electronics industri es were removed, the Soviets did not acquire modern computer, control instrumentatio n, or electronic technologies from Germany: these they acquired from the U.S."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" Bridging the Semi-conductor Gap Taking semi-conductors as an example, three stages can be identified in the transfer process. The Soviets were able to import or manufac ture small laboratory quantities of semi-conductors from an early date. What they co uld not do, as in many other technologies, was mass produce components with high quality characteristics. This situation is described by Dr. Lara Baker, a Soviet computer expert, before Congress: The Soviet system in preproduction can manage to pr oduce a few of almost any product they want, provided they are willing to dev ote the resources to it. The best example of this would be the Soviet 'civilian' spac e program, in which they managed to put people in orbit before the United States did , but at a high cost. In the area of serial production, that is, the day to day production of large quantities of a product, the differences between the two systems become most obvious. Serial production is the Achilles heel of the Soviet bloc. Especially in high technology areas, the big problem the Soviets have is quality assuran ce they count products, not quality products. This is the area where the Soviets exhibi t weakness and need the most help. 14 The first phase for the Soviets was to Identify the technology needed, in this case a semi-conductor plant, to bridge the chasm between t he 19th century and the 21st century. The second phase was to obtain the equipment to establish a manufacturing plant. The third phase was to bring this plant into produc tion and make the best use of its output in an economy where developmental engineerin g resources do not exist in depth and military objectives have absolute priorit y. We shall demonstrate in Chapter Five how the Soviet s achieved the first of these tasks — with the help of the Control Data Corporation, Mr . William Norris, Chairman. The second phase was achieved through an illegal espion age network, the Bruchhausen network. The third phase is today in progress, alth ough the phases one and two are already in place in the Soviet military complex. The emphasis in this critical transfer of semi-cond uctor technology was not reverse engineering as, for example, the Soviet Agatha comp uter is reverse engineered from the Apple II computer, but use of U.S. manufacturin g techniques and equipment to bridge a gigantic gap in Soviet engineering capabil ities. The Soviet system does not generate the wealth of technology common in the Wes t. It cannot choose the most efficient among numerous methods of achieving a tec hnical objective because the Marxist system lacks the abundant fruits of an ente rprise system. The emphasis in semi-conductors is transfer of a complete manufactu ring technology to produce high quality products for known military end uses WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED BY THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES, WITHOUT FUNDAME NTAL CHANGES IN THEIR SYSTEM."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"In brief, in electronics the key is not copying Wes tern technology as for example the Caterpillar tractor was duplicated by the millions, but to transfer specialized production equipment to mass produce critical compo nents. This assertion has been fully supported by expert w itnesses before Congressional committees. For example, the following statement wa s made in 1952 to the Senate by Dr. Stephen D. Bryen, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, International Economics, Trade and Security Policy. Senator Nunn: Dr. Bryen, you made reference in your testimony to the effort by the Soviets to build and equip a semiconductor plant us ing equivalent know-how from the United States. Could the Soviets have built and equipped such a pl ant in the late 1970s and early 1950s without U.S. machinery, equipment and know-ho w? Dr. Bryen: My answer is they could not. That doesn't mean tha t equipment necessarily came from this country. It could have b een transferred from Europe or elsewhere. In fact, it could have been transferred from another country that bought that equipment — it could have been on the secondar y market. There is a secondary market in this sort of machinery. These are terribl y difficult things to trace. What we know in the first instance is that a lot ha d to be U.S. equipment, that the system was full of holes, it was porous, it was eas y for them to get it and they got it. The microelectronics area has enabled the Soviets t o upgrade their military equipment. 15 And a similar comment from a former Russian enginee r, Joseph Arkov, again in Senate testimony. By using — not copying — the American high technolo gy products, they move closer to their goal of technical self-sufficiency. Whethe r they will ever become self- sufficient in high technology is a debatable point. My own view is that this course of action gives them quick gains, but over the long ru n, it will result in their being permanently behind the United States, forever havin g to rely on American products to manufacture their own. However, being behind us in technology is a relativ e condition. The Soviets can make progress in a technical sense and, at the same time , trail the United States, but by their standards, they will have achieved much. Their acco mplishments will have been made with limited cost to them because the basic researc h and development will have been paid for by the Americans. To repeat, then, the Soviet strategy in obtaining A merican high technology products includes efforts to copy and duplicate, but the Sov iets' primary objective is to obtain machinery which they can use in the manufacture of their own high technology equipment."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"This distinction — the difference between copying o f technology and the use of it — is an important one because it provides the United States with a key insight into which products the Soviets are the most anxious to obtain . It also can influence American policymakers in deciding which products the United States can afford to sell the Soviet Union, and which components should not be so ld to them. Soviet strategy in using American products can be s een in the following illustration. Let us say, for example, that the Soviets have 100 plants involved in producing components for use in space flight. Each of the pla nts could use a certain kind of American computer. But they cannot obtain 100 compu ters; that is, one for each plant. Instead, they are able to obtain three or four Amer ican computers of the desired type. They use the computers as best they can in those th ree or four plants where they can do the most good. They are not inclined to use them as non-producing models to be studied in a laboratory for the purpose of copying. Moreover, if the American product obtained in anoth er transaction — if, for example, the product is a sophisticated oven used in the hea ting of microchips — then they are even less interested in copying or imitating. They will use the oven to produce microchips. There is no civilian use for equipment used to manufacture integrated circuits or semi-conductors. 16 How the Deaf Mute Blindmen Helped the Soviets into the 21st Century With these insights into Soviet technological acqui sition strategy we can identify the stages by which the Soviets acquired semi-conductor technology. Chronologically these are: DATE EVENT 1951 Semi-conductor developed in Santa Clara Valley , California. From this point on Soviets import chips and then manufacture on a laboratory scale. 1971 \"Computer in a chip\" development. Soviets sti ll unable to mass produce even primitive semi- conductor devices. 1973 Control Data Corporation (CDC) agrees to suppl y Soviets with a wide range of scientific and engineering information including construction and design of a large fast computer (75 to 100 million instructions per second is fast even in 1985) and manufacturing techniques for semi-conductors and associated technologies (See Chapter Five). 1977-80 Soviets acquire technology for a semi-condu ctor plant through the Bruchhausen network and Continental Trading Corp. (CTC). The CDC agreement gives Soviets sufficient information to s et up a purchasing and espionage program. CDC told"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"the Soviets what they needed to buy. 1981-82 Commerce Department lax in enforcing export control regulations. U.S. Customs Service makes determined efforts to stop export of semi-conductor manufacturing equipment. 1985 Soviets establish plant for semi-conductor mas s production. Soviet military equipment based on this new output. 1986 U.S. taxpayer continues to support a defense b udget of over $300 billion a year. Without these transfer s Soviet military could not have been computerised and U.S. defense budget reduced. The Bruchhausen Network The second phase of the acquisition of semi-conduct or mass production technology was the Bruchhausen network. This network comprised a syndicate of 20 or so \"fro nt\" electronics companies established by Werner J. Bruchhausen, age 34, a Wes t German national. The key component was a group of companies with the initial s CTC (Continental Trading Corporation), managed by Anatoli Maluta, a Russian- born naturalized U.S. citizen. A Congressional subcommittee devoted considerable tim e and resources to reconstruction of the activities of the CTC-Maluta operation. This network of companies, controlled from West Ger many, gave the Soviets the technology for a major leap forward in modernizing military electronics capability. Dr. Lara H. Baker, Jr., who had personal knowledge of t he CTC-Maluta case, was one of the subcommittee's sources in reconstructing the ne twork. Other sources included the Departments of Commerce and Justice and the U.S. Cu stoms Service. Using Werner Bruchhausen's companies and accomplice s in Western Europe as freight forwarders and transshipment points, Maluta sent more than $10 million of American-made high technology equipment to the Sovi et Union from 1977 to 1980. the machinery was used to equip a Soviet plant for the manufacture and testing of semiconductors. The equipment went from California to Western Europe to the USSR. To Dr. Baker, the CTC-Maluta case proved a point: t hat the Soviets know precisely what U.S. technology they want, and leave little to chance. Dr. Baker explained: Of particular interest to me in the (CTC-Maluta) ca se is the information it gives us about Soviet intentions. We delude ourselves if we think the Soviets enter the black market in search of strategic components in a helte r-skelter style, buying up dual-use commodities without rhyme or reason."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The truth of the matter is that the Soviets and the ir surrogates buy nothing they don't have specific, well defined needs for. They know ex actly what they want — right down to the model number — and what they want is pa rt of a carefully crafted design. The carefully crafted design in this instance was a semi-conductor manufacturing plant, an essential part of the Soviet need to clos e the technological gap between themselves and the U.S. in the integrated circuit/m icrocomputer industry. We shall see in Chapter Five how Control Data Corporation pr ovided the key basic information on what to acquire. Dr. Baker, who testified in the 1981 successful pro secution of Maluta and his associate, Sabina Dorn Tittel, studied 400 separate air waybills and other shipping documents used by the CTC network. The conclusion w as inescapable that the Soviets were equipping a semi-conductor plant. Sovi et use of components of U.S. origin demonstrated their determination to make the facility as efficient and modern as any in the world: ...(the Soviets) have purchased clandestinely all the hardware they need for equipping a good integrated circuit production plant. They sh owed no interest in purchasing production equipment that was not state of the art. They showed very good taste. Stressing the point that, through the CTC-Maluta co mbine, the Soviets bought everything needed for a semi-conductor manfacturing plant, Dr. Baker testified to the Senate that among the equipment bought in the perio d 1977 through 1980 were saws for cutting silicon crystals, equipment for making masks for integrated circuit production, plotters to draw the circuits, basic co mputer-aided design systems for integrated circuit design, diffusion ovens for circ uit production ion-implantation systems for circuit production, photo-lithographic systems for integrated circuit production, scribers for separating integrated circ uits on wafers, testers for testing integrated circuits on wafers, bonding equipment fo r bonding connecting leads to integrated circuits, and packaging equipment for pa ckaging the circuits. Dr. Baker added: High quality integrated circuits are the basis of m odern military electronics. Integrated circuits form the basis for military systems which are more flexible, more capable and more reliable than systems using discrete electroni c components. The production tooling and equipment obtained by the Soviets (from the CTC-Maluta network) will significantly improve the Soviets' capability to pr oduce such circuits. Further support for the assertion that the Soviets relied on American technology to equip their semi-conductor plant came from John D. Marshall, a chemist and specialist in facilities that manufacture semicondu ctors. Marshall owns a high technology business in Silicon Valley and testified to Congress that in the winter of 1975 he made two trips to the Soviet Union. Led by a West German named Richard Mueller to believe that the So viets wanted to retain his consultative services in connection with their plan s to manufacture electronic watches, Marshall learned on the second trip to Moscow that what was actually wanted was expertise to equip a semi-conductor plant. Marshall told the subcommittee:"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"On the second trip, we met several Soviets who purp orted to be technical people. They were not very well trained and were not famili ar with sophisticated technological thinking. But it was apparent to me b y the questions they asked and the subjects they discussed that the Soviets had built a semi-conductor manfuacturing and assembly plant and they were anxious to equip it. They wanted American semi-conductor manufacturing e quipment and they had detailed literature on the precise kind of equipmen t they wanted. They also wanted me to obtain for them certain semi-conductor component s. It was clear to me that Mueller had deceived me as to the Soviets' intentions, that it was not merely electronic watches the Soviets wante d to manufacture. Marshall realized that to cooperate further with th e Soviets would be illegal. He refused to meet further with the Soviets and left M oscow. As he returned to the United States, Marshall recal led conversations he had overheard that at the time had not made.sense to him on the w ay to Moscow. Marshall and Mueller had stopped in Hamburg where Mueller introd uced him to a Canadian, also providing technical assistance to the Soviets, that his mission was to show them how to make integrated circuits and to use equipment no w on the way. In Moscow, Marshall said, he met a woman who spoke English with a German accent who planned to ship certain American-made photolith ography materials to the Soviet Union via East Berlin. Photolithography materials a re critical in semi-conductor manufacture. In West Germany, Marshall was introduced to Volker Nast, identified by Mueller as his partner. Nast was involved in illegal diversion s of the U.S. technology to the Soviet Union. The significance of 1975 as the year the Soviets ex pressed their desire for American- made semi-conductor equipment has been explained by Marshall. In 1975 the U.S. was preeminent in the field of semi-conductor techn ology. Marshall said: It is my view that the Soviets had built their manu facturing plant, or plants, to specifications for American-made equipment — for th e manufacture, assembly and testing of integrated circuits. Now that the facili ties were constructed, they were, in the winter of 1975, confronted with the next step, which was to equip the facilities. According to Marshall, the Soviets' primary interes t in 1975 was the manufacture and assembly phases of semi-conductor production. By 19 77, he said, the Soviets needed to stock the facility with test equipment, and soft ware development equipment. Dr. Lara Baker, in his testimony before Congress, a greed with Marshall. In the 1978- 79 time frame the CTC-Maluta syndicate purchased pr oduction equipment. In the 1979-1980 period, the CTC-Maluta network bought sem i-conductor test equipment. Said Baker, \"Marshall's testimony is quite consiste nt with my information.\""},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"U.S. Customs Service investigations confirmed not o nly the Bruchhausen network but subsidiary networks operating in cooperation with t he Soviets for illegal purchase of semi-conductor manufacturing equipment. Information about the Soviets' efforts to build a s emi-conductor industry — and, in so doing, make a major leap forward in military electr onics — was given to a Senate subcommittee by Charles L. McLeod, a Special Agent with the U.S. Customs Service. McLeod said the same Richar Mueller who had brought John Marshall to Moscow had been active in several other schemes. In fact, McLeod said, Mueller was an operative in a syndicate whose mission was to export by illegal means semi-conductor manufacturin g equipment from the United States to the Soviet Union. Other operatives in the network included Volker Nast, Luther Heidecke, Peter Gessner and Frederick Linnho ff, all West Germans. In the U.S., their associates included Robert C. Johnson, Gerald R. Starek and Carl E. Storey, officers in high technology firms. McLeod, of the San Francisco office of U.S. Customs , investigating technology diversions originating in nearby Santa Clara County , said inquiries into two Silicon Valley electronics firms — II Industries and Kaspar Electronics — led to the conclusion that the Soviets were trying in the mid- 1970s to \"construct a semi- conductor manufacturing facility by using U.S. tech nology and equipment.\" A loosely knit organization of electronics producers and brok ers in West Germany and Northern California assisted the Soviets. The first diversion of semi-conductor manufacturing equipment occurred in 1974. McLeod said participants in the diversion included Luther Heidecke, a representative of Honeywell/West Germany, AG, and Peter Gessner, t he European sales representative for Applied Materials, a Northern Ca lifornia firm which produced semi-conductor manufacturing equipment. Gessner had other jobs as well, serving as the European salesman for II Industries and Kaspar Electronics. In addition, Gessner was employed by Richard Mueller. Processing orders through Honeywell/West Germany fo r the purchase of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Heidecke arr anged for the export of II Industries and Kaspar Electronics machinery to West Germany and ultimately to the Soviet Union. Heidecke's activities came to the att ention of the West German authorities, who prosecuted him for giving the Sovi ets national security information. McLeod described a second diversion. A Mays Landing , New Jersey export firm known as Semi-Con, formed by a West German Richard Mueller and managed by a former intelligence agent, shipped semiconductor ma nufacturing equipment to the Soviet Union. The equipment was from II Industries and Kaspar Electronics. The identification of the Bruchhausen network does not reflect favorably upon the operating efficiency of the Commerce Department's O ffice of Export Control and specifically its Compliance Division. (As the situa tion existed in 1980, it may possibly have improved since that time.)"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The existence of the CTC network of companies was f irst brought to the attention of the U.S. government in 1977 and 1978 when two anony mous letters were received at the American Consulate in Dusseldorf, Germany. The State Department translated the letters into English and referred them to the Compl iance Division in Commerce. The letters were received by the Compliance Division in 1978 and no effort was made to investigate the allegations. After receipt of the letters, two U.S. producers of dual-use technology also reported to the Commerce Department that they were suspicious o f the CTC companies. Again no Commerce action. A Commerce Department special agent did interview C TC's principal executive in Los Angeles, the naturalized Russian-born American citizen Anatoli Maluta, also known as Tony Maluta and Tony Metz. Maluta told the special agent from Compliance that he did not know anything about expo rt controls, or the need to have validated export licenses to ship certain controlle d commodities. However, Maluta said, because of the agent's interest, he would can cel the suspicious order. There was no further investigation of the CTC netwo rk until a second letter arrived at Compliance Division from another high-technology pr oducer, also suspicious about the CTC companies. Early in 1980, a second Compliance Division agent, Robert Rice, was assigned to the case and conducted a comprehensive preliminary inqu iry. Rice, the most senior agent in the Division, found considerable information ind icating widespread violations of export controls. The evidence went to the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles in March 1980. A major inquiry was begun by the U.S . Attorney's office, under the direction of Assistant U.S. Attorney Theodore W. Wu and the U.S. Customs Services. Customs ultimately assigned about 15 agents to the case in California, Texas, New York, and Western Europe. Compliance Division Speci al Agent Rice was the only Commerce Department representative assigned to the case on a regular basis. Indictments were brought against Bruchhausen and Di etmar Ulrichshofer, both of whom remained in Europe out of reach, and two Los A ngeles associates — Maluta and Sabina Dorn Tittel. Maluta and Tittel were conv icted. The CTC case demonstrated technology diversions of about $10 million and is considered by law enforcement and national security specialists one of the most important export control cases ever brought to tria l. The inquiry showed that: First, the Compliance Division did not move quickly to establish the value of the anonymous letters. Second, the Compliance Division did not connect the anonymous letters to the allegations reported by two U.S. manufacturers. Third, when Compliance Division Agent Rice turned o ver the results of his inquiry to Assistant U.S. Attorney Wu in Los Angeles, it was a pparent to Wu that considerable expenditures of resources would be needed. Trained investigators would be required"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"to conduct interviews, evaluate shipping documents, surveil suspected violators, and carry out other aspects of a traditional law enforc ement full-scale field investigation. Commerce's contribution to that effort was Agent Ri ce, a competent investigator in whom Wu had confidence. But he needed more than one agent, and enlisted assistance of the Customs Service. Later assistance was provided by trained criminal investigators from the IRS. Fourth, at an early point in the inquiry it was nec essary to seize shipments. Commerce had neither the authority nor the manpower to seize shipments. Customs did. Fifth, at another point in the inquiry it was neces sary to search the premises of CTC companies and certain of employees in the United St ates and Europe. The Compliance Division had insufficient resources to i mplement simultaneous search warrants. The Compliance Division had no law enforc ement capabilities in Western Europe to work with German customs to coordinate se arches abroad. Customs executed the warrants in the United States and, thr ough its agreements with West German customs, arranged for the execution of warra nts in Germany. Sixth, to substitute sand for one of CTC's shipment s to Moscow, a sizable expenditure of funds was needed. The Compliance Division balked at the shipment substitution strategy and refused to pay the cost of recrating t he sand and airfreight. Customs officials approved of the substitution and agreed t o pay the cost. Seventh, extensive overseas coordination, in additi on to the search warrants, was called for with West German Customs and other overs eas law enforcement contacts. Eighth, extensive surveillance was necessary. Armed Customs agents and armed Internal Revenue Service criminal investigators and an unarmed Compliance Division Special Agent Rice provided this work. Two suspects under surveillance had firearms in the back seat of their. car. The firearms were not used. But it was an important law enforcement advantage for the agents on surveillance to be armed as well. Ninth, experienced supervisors with law enforcement background and training were needed to direct the inquiry in the field. The Offi ce of the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California, working with superv isorial personnel in the Customs Service, provided the needed direction. Contact wit h supervisorial personnel in the Compliance Division, who remained in Washington, wa s made on the telephone and the persons who worked on the case in California di d not consider such communication to be satisfactory. Tenth, when the appropriate time came to apprehend Anatoli Maluta and Sabina Dorn Tittle, IRS agents made the arrests. Customs agents , like the IRS criminal investigators, are authorized to make arrests. Even had the Compliance Division dispatched sufficient numbers of agents to assist i n the inquiry, they could not have arrested the suspects."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":" The Type of Equipment Shipped to the USSR The Bruchhausen network was extremely efficient at obtaining the type of equipment needed by the Soviets for their semiconductor plant .

Norris, Chairman Control Data Corporation To make any progress in developing weapons systems the Soviets must utilize modern high-speed computers. The computers and the necessary computer technology, both hardware and software, have come from the West , almost exclusively from the United States. At the end of the 1950s the United States had about 5,000 computers in use, while the Soviet Union had only about 120. These Soviet compu ters, as reported by well- qualified observers, were technically well behind t hose of the West and barely out of the first-generation stage even as late as the 1960 s. In the late fifties the Soviets produced about thir ty to forty BESM-type computers for research and development work on atomic energy and rockets and missiles. In general, the BESM type has most of the features typical of e arly U.S. computers. The original version had 7,000 tubes; the later version had 3,00 0 tubes and germanium diodes. The only Soviet computer in continuous production i n the 1960s was the URAL-I, followed by the URAL-II and URAL-IV modifications o f the original model. The URAL-I has an average speed of 100 operations per s econd, compared to 2,500 operations per second on U.S. World War II machines and 15,000 operations per second for large U.S. machines of the 1950s, and 1- 10 million operations per second common in the early 1970s. Occupying 40 square mete rs of floor space, URAL-I contains 800 tubes and 3,000 germanium diodes; its storage units include a magnetic drum of 1,024 cells and a magnetic tape of up to 40 ,000 cells — considerably less than U.S. machines of the 1960s. URAL-II and URAL-I V incorporate slightly improved characteristics. The URAL series is based on U.S. technology. Production methods for both the URAL and the BESM c omputers were the same as American methods. Until the mid-1960s direct import of computers from the United States was hea vily restricted by export control regulations. In 1965 o nly $5,000 worth of electronic computers and parts were shipped from the United St ates to the Soviet Union, and only $2,000 worth in 1966. This changed in 1967. Co mputer exports increased to $1,079,000 and a higher rate of export of U.S. elec tronic computers to the USSR has been maintained to the present time under constant lobbying pressure from U.S. businessmen and their trade associations."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The precise amount and nature of U.S. computer sale s to the Soviet Union since World War II is censored, but it is known that afte r World War II, IBM sales to the Communist world came \"almost entirely from [IBM's] Western European plants,\" partly because of U.S. export control restrictions and partly because U.S. equipment operates on 60 cycles, whereas Russian and European equipment operates on 50 cycles. American computer sales as opposed to Soviet theft may be traced from 1959 with sale of a Model-802 National-Elliott sold by Elliot t Automation, Ltd., of the United Kingdom. (Elliott Automation is a subsidiary of Gen eral Electric in the United States.) Towards the end of the sixties Soviet purchases of computers were stepped up, and by late i969 it was estimated that Western computer sa les to all of Communist Europe, including the USSR, were running at $40 million ann ually, in great part from European subsidiaries of American companies. In 196 4-65 Elliott Automation delia ;red five Model-503 computers to the USSR, in cluding one for installation in the Moscow Academy of Sciences. Other General Electric made in Europe machines, for example, a Model-400 made in France by Compagnie de s Machines Bull, were also sold to the USSR. Olivetti-General Electric of Milan, Italy has been a major supplier of GE computers in the USSR. In I967 the Olivetti firm delivered $2.4 million worth of data-processing equipment systems to the USSR in addition to Model- 400 and Model-115 machines. In sum, General Electric from 1959 onwards sold to the Soviet Union through its European subsidiaries a range of its medium-capacit y computers. Of perhaps even greater significance for the 1960 e ra were sales by English Electric, which include third-generation microcircuit compute rs utilizing Radio Corporation of America technology. In 1967 English Electric sold t o the USSR its System Four machine with microcircuits; this machine incorporat es RCA patent and was similar to the RCA Spectra-70 series. The largest single supplier of computers to the USS R has been International Computers and Tabulation, Ltd. of the United Kingdo m, which also licenses RCA technology, and by 1970 had supplied at least twent y-seven of the thirty-three large computers then in Russia. In November I969, for exa mple, five of the firm's 1900- series computers (valued at $12 million) went to th e USSR. These large high-speed units with integrated circuits were, without questi on, considerably in advance of anything the Soviets were able to manufacture. Such machines were certainly capable of solving military and space problems. Indeed, a c omputer cannot distinguish between civilian and military problems. In 1971 the USSR and East European family of genera l purpose computers known as the RYAD series was announced. These are based subs tantially on IBM 360 and 370 computers illegally diverted into the USSR. This ha d an important effect of making available to them a tremendous library of computer software that was RYAD compatible. Dr. Baker has commented on the current RYAD positio n:"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"In the area of available manpower, one of the serio us problems afflicting the Soviet economy is the lack of qualified, highly trained, t echnical people in the areas of computers and microelectronics. One cause of this i s the lack of enough computing and electronic equipment to train the next generati on of scientists and engineers. They simply don't have enough equipment to allow student s sufficient 'hands-on' practice at an early stage in their education. The Soviets are trying to alleviate this problem by producing large, for them, numbers of RYAD computer s — copies of the U.S. IBM System 360's and 370's. 17 Soviet Agatha - American Apple II In mid 1983 the Soviets introduced their first pers onal computer —the AGATHA (a rather curious name for a Russian product). Produced at Zelenograd, outside Moscow, the Agatha was reversed engineered from the APPLE II. Specifications are similar to the APP LE and the components are either Soviet produced from reverse engineered U.S. compon ents or imported and bought openly or clandestinely in Europe or Japan. Officials at the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences ha ve admitted that the APPLE II served as a \"prototype\" for the Soviet Agatha. In 1985 COCOM set up some new rules for microcomput ers and made it legal to export without license low powered 8-bit computers. Such a machine sells in the West for $100 to $500. The response was a flood of computer manufacturers attempting to make elaborate sales pitches to the multimillion Soviet microcompu ter market. If history is any judge, the Soviets will buy a few thousand and then attemp t to reverse engineer and produce in the Soviet Union. Presumably the microcomputers, although low powered, could have military applications and indeed this was open ly admitted by a major computer manufacturer (New York Times, February 8, 1985): \"We have no illusions. Some of these are headed for the military.\" Military End Use Confirmation of military end use comes from unimpea chable sources — Soviet engineers who have worked on copying or reverse eng ineering in the Soviet Union and later defected to the West. These engineers hav e testified before Congress and provide firsthand evidence of Soviet military use o f our technology. Here is a statement from Joseph Arkov, who graduated from a S oviet engineering school in 1970 and who now resides in the United States. Arko v worked in Soviet research installations. If, for example, a new American computer has been o btained by the Soviets, they will make a military application of it rather than a civ ilian application,\" 18 and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"In my work in the second research installation I ha d the assignment of copying Western and Japanese high technology. Arkov makes the interesting point that the Soviets are now so far behind technologically that they can no longer just revers e engineer as previously — they must import even the technology to manufacture high technology: They do not have the human resources or the fine tu ned equipment required to produce the high technology machinery they try to c opy. Once they know what makes a given piece of machinery work, they find that the y do not have the technical know- how and equipment to produce the product themselves . That is why they want Western high technology machines that will enable t hem to produce the products. And the Western products they desire the most are t hose produced in the United States. That is why they want American high technol ogy machines with which they can produce the components for high technology prod ucts. Under Senate questioning Arkov confirmed that the m ajor application of our high technology is for military end uses. Mr. Arkov: Well, the task of copying Western technology . . . part of their assignment was for military. Is that the question? Senator Rudman: Yes, let me just follow that up. You spoke in your prepared statement about the use of sophisticated American c omputers in various Soviet military operations, and also about the use of semi conductor technology. There are those in this country who feel that had we not tran sferred that technology legally to the Soviet Union — we sold them certain semiconduct or technology and certain sophisticated computer technology in the late sixti es and early seventies — the Soviets would not have achieved the advantages in m issilery which they have made in terms of the enormous throw weight and precision of their guidance systems. Do you agree with that assessment? Do you think that the s ale of those semiconductors and those computers has given them a tremendous step fo rward in their technology in the defense area from your background and your knowledg e? Mr. Arkov: Yes, I think so. I can't tell exactly. It's hard t o estimate the degree of advantage they got. But they gained there, using Am erican computers and American semiconductors.19 Control Data Deception The 1973 Control Data Corporation technical assista nce agreement with the Soviet Union enabled the Soviets to complete phase one of their semiconductor manufacturing plant (see Chapter Four). Highly significant is a comparison of Control Data Corporation's public argument to the media and Congress with this 1973 agreement and its totally one-sided presentation of the national security argument."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"One can only conclude that some CDC statements are deliberate untruths. We make this statement by comparing Control Data public sta tements, particularly those of Chairman William Norris, with internal documents an d agreements with the Soviet Union. These documents are confidential, but copies are in our possession. On December 19, 1973 William Norris wrote Congressm an Richard T. Hanna concerning public criticism of the CDC proposal to export advanced Cyber computers to the USSR. We extract some statements from the letter (reprodu ced in full as Appendix C) and compare it to extracts from CDC internal documents reproduced on pages 61-67. For example, Norris: We have offered the Socialist countries only standa rd commercial computers and these offerings have been in full compliance wi th the export control and administrative directives of the Department of Comm erce. Comment: Reference to the 1973 Protocol of Intent between CD C and the USSR marked CONFIDENTIAL and reproduced here tells a vas tly different story. Norris: Many persons including some of the witnesses before your Committee mistake the offering for sale of old or even curren t state of the art hardware for transfer of advanced technology. This is not unusua l because in many cases it is difficult for those who are not technically well in formed to distinguish advanced computer technology. Comment: Norris is comparing apples and oranges. What is \"ol d\" or \"current\" in the United States is far beyond \"state of the art\" in t he Soviet Union. When Norris was offering a million operations per second CYBER comp uter to the Soviets, the run-of- the-mill Soviet technology was in the order of seve ral thousands of operations per second, and that was on copies of imported equipmen t. If multinational businessmen like William Norris we re honestly mistaken in their information or somewhat shaky in their logic, then perhaps they could be forgiven. After all, to err is human. Unfortunately, evidence proves beyond doubt that at least some of these deaf mute businessmen have deceived both Congress and the Ame rican public in an unseemly haste to make a buck. We have documentary evidence in the case of Control Data Corporation and its Chairman, William Norris. In the following pages we print a series of letters from Control Data Corporation to a concerned member of the public and contracts betwee en CDC and the Soviet Union: * Exhibit A Letter from American Council for World Freedom to i ts supporters identifying William Norris and CDC as exporters of valuable mil itary technology to the Soviets."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"* Exhibit B Reply from William Norris, \"Dear Yellow Card Sender ,\" dated May 5, 1978.

The Deceptive World View of Control Data Corporatio n William Norris, Chairman of Control Data, has a liv ely correspondence with Americans anxious to learn his rationale for suppor ting the Soviet Union. We quote below an extract from a letter written by William Norris to an inquirer: You also made reference [wrote Norris] in your lett er to Russia's first democratic government that was overthrown by the communists. Y ou are incorrect on this point. There never has been any democracy in Russia — as a matter of fact, the Russian standard of living today is higher than it was unde r the tsars. Further, you don't find a great deal of unhappiness in the Soviet Union over living conditions and the communist regime for two reasons — (1) they have ne ver know [sic] what democracy is, and (2) life is better than it used to be. Here are the errors in the above Norris paragraph:"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"\u0001 \"There has never been any democracy in Russia.\" Incorrect. The Kerensky government from March to No vember, 1917 was freely elected and overthrown by the Bolsh eviks (with the aid of Western businessmen such as Willia m Norris). \u0001 \"You don't find a great deal of unhappiness in the Soviet Union over living conditions.\" Incorrect. Mr. Norris should look out the window of his Moscow office at the uniform drab blocks of apartme nts. How many families live in one room? How often do severa l families live in one apartment? How about the hours spent in food lines, and the limited choice of consumer goods in a guns- before- butter economy? Just how many individual Russians h as Mr. Norris freely spoken with? Not those of the \"nomenk latura,\" but average Russians in the street. We venture to g uess none at all. \u0001 \"... standard of living today is higher than under the tsars.\" Take one item — wheat. In 1906 Russia was the world 's largest wheat exporter and the world's largest wheat produc er. The climate is the same today as in 1906, yet is used a s a forlorn excuse for Soviet pitiful wheat production. In fact , 80% of Russian bread today is made from imported wheat, the home- grown is only fit for cattle feed. Without Western wheat, Russia today would starve. Is that a truly higher standard of living? Anyway, Russians today don't compare their standard s to those of tsarist times but to the Western world. William Norris only sees what he wants to see, hear s what he wants to hear, and presumably speaks from these limited impressions of the world. In conclusion, we can thank Mr. Norris and Control Data Corporation that Soviet military has been able to break into the electronic s based warfare of the late 20th and early 21st century. CDC fulfilled phase one of the Soviet program for a cquisition of Western semiconductor technology and mass production facili ties.

Without U.S. help the Soviet military system would collapse in 1½ years. — Avraham Shifrin, former Soviet Defense Ministry o fficial Signal rockets were used in the Russian Tsarist Arm y as early as 1717. Present Russian theoretical work in rockets, beginning in 1 903, stems from K. E. Tsiolkovskii, who investigated atmospheric resistance, rocket mot ion, and similar problems. This Tsarist work was continued in the Soviet Union duri ng the twenties and thirties. In I928 pioneer Tsiolkovskii suggested that the value of his contribution had been in theoretical calculations. Nothing had been achieved in practical rocket engineering. Then in 1936, V. F. Glushke designed and built a pr ototype rocket engine, the ORM- 65. This rocket used nitric acid and kerosene as pr opellants. The Soviets then developed the ZhRD R-3395, an aircraft jato rocket using nitric acid and aniline as a propellant. Du Pont provided technical assistance a nd equipment for the construction of large nitric acid plants. During World War II, S oviet rockets used \"Russian cordite,\" which was 56.5 percent nitrocellulose. Th e nitrocellulose was manufactured under a technical-assistance agreement made in 1930 with the Hercules Powder Company of the United States. Finally, under Lend-Lease, 3,000 rocket-launchers a nd large quantities of propellants were shipped from the United States to the USSR. German Assistance for Soviet Rockets A major boost to Soviet ambitions in rocketry came from Germany at the end of World War II. Facilities transferred to the USSR in cluded the rocket testing stations of Blizna and Peenemunde, captured intact and remov ed to the USSR; the extensive production facilities for the V-1 and V-2 at Nordha usen and Prague; the records of reliability tests on some 6,000 German V-2; and 6,0 00 German technicians (not the top theoretical men), most of whom were not release d from Russia until the late 1950s. The German rocket program was in an advanced state of development in 1945. About 32,050 V-1 \"Flying bomb\" weapons had been produced in the Volkswagen plant at Fallersleben and in the underground Central Works a t Nordhausen. In addition, 6,900 V-2 rockets had been produced — 6,400 at the underg round Mittelwerke at Nordhausen and 500 at Peenemunde. Rocket fuel facil ities had been developed in the"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Soviet Zone: liquid oxygen plants at Schmeidebach i n Thuringia and at Nordhausen, and a hydrogan peroxide plant at Peenemunde. The Germans undertook two and one-half years of exp erimental work and statistical flight and reliability evaluation on the V-2 before the end of the war. There were 264 developmental launchings at Peenemunde alone. Mittelwerke at Nordhausen was visited in June 1946 by U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey teams who reported that the enormous undergr ound plant could manufacture V-1s and V-2s as well as Junkers-87 bombers. V-2 ro ckets were manufactured in twenty-seven underground tunnels. The plant was wel l equipped with machine tools and with \"a very well set up assembly line for the rocket power unit.\" Its output at the end of the war was about 400 V-2s per month, and it s potential output was projected at 900-1,000 per month. When the Soviets occupied part of the American Zone in July 1945 under arrangement with General (later President) Eisenhow er, the Nordhausen plant was removed completely to the USSR. The United States and Britain never did gain access to German rocket-testing sites in Poland. The Sanders Mission reached the Blizna test station, after considerable delays in Moscow, only to find that its equipment had been removed \"in such a methodical way as to suggest strongly to the mission's leader that the evacuation was made with a view to the equipment being reerected elsewhere.\" T he Sanders Mission accumulated 1.5 tons of rocket parts. Unfortunately, when the m ission reached home it found that the rocket parts had been intercepted by the Soviet s. Rocket specimens so carefully crated in Blizna for shipment to London and the Uni ted States were last seen in Moscow. The crates arrived at the Air Ministry in L ondon, but contained several tons of \"old and highly familiar aircraft parts when the y were opened.\" The Blizna rocket specimens had vanished. Many German rocket technicians went or were taken t o the Soviet Union. The most senior was Helmut Groettrup, who had been an aide t o the director of electronics at Peenemunde. Two hundred other former Peenemunde tec hnicians are reported to have been transferred. Among those were Waldemar Wolf, c hief of ballistics for Krupp; engineer Peter Lertes; and Hans Hock, an Austrian s pecialist in computers. Most of these persons went in the October 22-23 round-up of ninety-two trainloads comprising 6,000 German specialists and 20,000 memb ers of their families. Askania technicians, specialists in rocket-tracking devices , and electronics people from Lorenz, Siemens, and Telefunken were among the deportees, a s were experts from the Walter Rakententriebwerke in Prague. Asher Lee sums up the transfer of German rocket tec hnology: The whole range of Luftwaffe and German Army radio- guided missiles and equipment fell into Russian hands. There were the t wo Henschel radar-guided bombs, the Hs-293 and the larger FX-1400 . . the U.S.S.R. also acquired samples of German antiaircraft radio-guided missiles like the X-4, th e Hs-298 air-to-air projectile with a range of about a mile and a half, the Rheintochter which was fitted with a radar proximity fuse, and the very promising Schmetterlin g which even in 1945 had an"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"operational ceiling of over 45,000 feet and a plann ed radius of action of about twenty miles. It could be ground- or air-launched and was one of the most advanced of the German small-calibre radio-guided defensive rockets ; of these various projectiles the Henschel-293 bomb and the defensive Schmetterling a nd Hs-298 [the V-3] are undergoing development at Omsk and Irkutsk . . . [a nd later at] factories near Riga, Leningrad, Kiev, Khaborovsk, Voronezh, and elsewher e. Other plants produced improved radars based on the Wurzberg system; the airborne Lichenstein and Naxos systems were reported in larg e-scale production in the 1950s. The Soviets froze rocket design in the late 1950s o n developments based on German ideas. The German technical specialists were sent h ome. By 1959 the Soviets landed a rocket on the moon. Sputnik, Lunik and the Soyuz Programs From the German V-2 rockets, associated German prod uction facilities, and the all- important German reliability tests, stem the contem porary Soviet ICBM and space rockets. In the 1960s there were four types of large liquid rockets in the Soviet Union: the Soviet version of the V-2, the R-10 (a 77,000 pound thrust scale-up of the German V- 2), the R-14 (a scaled up V-2 with 220,000 pound th rust), and a modification known as R-14A (based on the R-14). The R-14 was designed and developed by a joint German-Rusian team. The Germans were sent home in t he late 1950s. The Soviets did not until fairly recently use singl e boosters — they use dusters of rockets strapped onto a central core. The strap-ons were the scaled-up and modified German V-2. Thus, for example, Sputnik I and Sputnik II had a first stage of two R- 14A units, a second stage of two R-14A units, and a third stage of a single R-10 (the German V-2 produced in the Soviet Union). Lunik was a similar cluster of six rocket units. The Vostok and Polyot series are clusters of six units. The planetary ro ckets, Cosmos series and Soyuz family are seven-unit clusters. An excellent photo graph of one of these cluster vehicles is to be found in Leo nid Vladimirov's book, The Russian Space Bluff. 20 In the mid-sixties, any foolhardy person who insist ed that the United States would be first on the moon because the Russians were technol ogically backward was dismissed as a dimwitted neanderthal. But at least two skille d observers with firsthand access to the Soviet program made a detailed case, one in 195 8 and one in 1969. Lloyd Mallan wrote Russia and the Big Red Lie in 1958, after an almost unrestricted 14,000 mile trip through Russia to visit thirty-eight Soviet sc ientists. He took 6,000 photographs. It was Mallan who first drew attention to the Sovie t practice of illustrating space- program press releases with photographs from the Am erican trade and scientific press. The Remington Rand Univac computer was used in the fifties to illustrate an article in Red Star on the Soviet computer program — the captions were translated into Russian. In 1969, Tass issued a photograph for use in American newspapers purporting to show a Russian space station at the time when one S oviet space ship was in orbit and another en route. The Tass photograph was reproduced from Scientific American (Feb."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"1962) and was identical to an advertisement in Sper ry Gyroscope Company of Great Neck, New York. Sperry commented, \"Apparently it is the same as the ad we ran.\" This author personally remembers an incident from t he early 1960s which illustrates the extraordinary success of Soviet propaganda in m olding the U.S. concept of Russian technology. After giving a short speech to a Los Angeles audience on technological transfers to the Soviets, a member of the audience asked a sensible question: \"Who will be first on the moon, the U.S. or the Soviets?\" The answer as closely as can be recalled was to the effect that the Soviets did not have the technology to be first on the moon, and by them selves could not make it in this century. The response from the audience was an instantaneous and loud laugh — how ridiculous was the general audience response, \"ever yone knows\" the Soviets are far ahead of the United States in space. In fact, the Soviets could not even have achieved t heir Soyuz program without U.S. help. The docking mechanism is a direct copy of the U.S. docking mechanism. Unfortunately, NASA and U.S. planners have a confli ct of interest. If they publish what they know about the backwardness and dependenc y of the Soviet space program, it reduces the urgency in our program. This urgency is vital to get Congressional funds. Without transfers of technology the U.S. is in effect racing with itself, not a very appealing argument to place before Congress. Why Did the Soviets Embark on a Space Program? From an economic viewpoint, a Soviet space program makes no sense at all: such a program only makes sense from a geopolitical viewpo int. In 1957, the year of Sputnik , the Soviet Union had fewer telephones than Japan (3.3 million in the USSR versus 3.7 million in Japan). O n a per-hundred population basis, the Soviet Union could provide only 3.58 telephones compared to 49.8 in the United States. Even Spain provided 9.6 telephones per 100 of population, or three times more than the Soviet Union. In automobiles, the Soviet Union was even less affl uent. In 1964 the Soviet Union had a stock of 919,000 automobiles, all produced in Wes tern-built plants, only slightly more than Argentina (800,000) and far less than Jap an (1.6 million) and the United States (71.9 million). Even today the Soviet Union is so backward in autom obile technology that is has to go to Italy and the United States for automobile an d truck technology. Although we in the West might see this technical backwardness a s a natural reason for not going into space, the Soviets saw it as a compellin g reason to embark on a space program."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"A \"technical extravaganza\" was necessary to demonst rate Soviet \"technical superiority\" to the world and maintain the myth of self-generated Soviet military might. The Soviet economic problem in the mid-1950s was ac ute. The Soviet economy had shown good rates of growth, but this was due to the impetus given by Lend-Lease equipment and by war reparations. There were no sig ns of technical viability. Numerous industries were decades out of date with n o indigenous progress on the horizon. The only solution was a massive program of acquiring complete plants and up-to-date technology in the West. Beginning in the late 1950s and continuing through to the 1980s, this program had to be disgui sed because of obvious military implications. One facet of the disguise was the spa ce program. The usual stock of reasons for backwardness had run dry (the Civil War , the Revolution, intervention, warmongering capitalists) — even the damage done by the Nazis could only be spread so far. So two new elements made their appea rance: 1. A space program — to get the Western world looki ng upwards and outwards, literally away from the Soviet Union and its intern al problems. 2. Concurrent articles and press releases in the We st on Soviet technical \"achievements,\" spotted particularly in Western tra de journals and more naive newspapers, such as the New York Times. Around the same time in the '60s and '70s, the West (or rather the United States and Germany) resurrected Edwin Gay's 1918 proposal to m ellow the Bolsheviks, and this proposal now became \"bridges for peace\" to provide a rational explanation for the massive transfers of Western technology that were r equired to fulfill Soviet programs. The United States appears, in historical perspectiv e, to have been almost desperate in its attempts to help the Soviets in space. Of cours e, if the Soviets did not succeed in space, there could be no \"competing\" American space program and many politicians, bureaucrats, and politically oriented scientists we re determined — for their own good reasons — that there had to be a major American spa ce effort. There also had to be U.S. assistance for the Soviet space program. In the ten years between December 1959 and December 1969, the United States made eighteen approaches to the USSR for space \"cooperat ions.\" In December 1959, NASA Administrator R. Keith Glenn an offered assistance in tracking Soviet manned flights. On March 7, 1962 Pr esident Kennedy proposed an exchange of information from tracking and data-acqu isition stations, and on September 20, 1963 President Kennery proposed joint exploration of the moon, an offer later repeated by President Johnson. On Decem ber 8, 1964 the administration proposed an exchange of teams to visit deep-space t racking and data-acquisition facilities. On May 3, 1965 NASA suggested joint com munications tests via the Soviet Molnlya I . On August 25, 1965 NASA asked the Soviet Academy of Sciences to send a representative to the Gemini VI launch, and on November 16, NASA inquired about joint Molnlya I communications tests. Four U.S. offers were made i n 1966; in January NASA inquired about Venus probes; on March 24, and May 23 Administrator James Webb suggested that the Soviets propose subjects for discussion;"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"and in September Ambassador Arthur Goldberg again r aised the question of tracking coverage by the United States for Soviet missiles. Soviet Aircraft Development In 1913 in St. Petersburg, Igor Sikorsky (who later founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Company in America) designed the \"Russki-Vityazyi.\" Weighing 5 tons with a load of seven passengers, this four-engined plane establ ished a contemporary endurance record of 1 hour and 54 minutes aloft. By 1917 a fl eet of seventy-five IM (\"Ilya Mourometz\") four-engined bombers, based on the orig inal 1913 model, were in service — several decades before the American four- engined bomber fleets of World War II. So tsarist Russia produced and successfully flew the world's first four-engined bomber, a quarter of a century before the United St ates developed one. This early bomber had a wing span of over 100 feet, or only 21 inches less than that of the World War II Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Obviously there was nothing wrong with indigenous R ussian aeronautical talent half a century ago. While Russians have a natural affinity and geographic impulse towards aeronautics, the Soviets have only kept up with the West by reverse engineering, prolific \"borrowing\" and importation of technology and manufacturing equipment. Russian dependency on Western aeronautical design a nd production equipment and techniques goes back to the early 1920s. At that time, soon after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Russian aircraft industry depended heavily on foreign aircraft and engine imp orts. There was considerable Soviet design activity, but this work was not conve rted into usable aircraft technology. Consequently, in the early 1930s the Soviet stock o f military planes was almost completely foreign: 260 fighters comprising 160 De Havilland Type 9a (from Great Britain) and 100 Heinkel HD-43 fighters (from Germa ny); 80 Avre 504-K training biplanes (from Great Britain) and some Moraine-Saul nier monoplanes (from France); 52 R-3 biplanes (Russian TsAGI design); 20 R-6 reco nnaissance planes (Russian TsAGI design); 242 I-4 Jupiter-engine,planes (from Great Britain); 80 Ju-30 and ANT-6 (Junkers design); 20 ANT-6 bomber seaplanes ( Russian design; 18 Avro- 504L seaplanes (from Great Britain); 40 Savoia S-62 scouting flying boats (from Italy); 150 Heinkel HD-55 scouting flying boats (fr om Germany); 46 MR-4 (Savoia S-62 license) flying boats (from Italy); 12 TBI (Ru ssian TsAGI design); and 43 Ju-30 naval bombers (from Germany). From about 1932 onward, and particularly after 1936 , there was extensive acquisition of Western aeronautical advances, which were then i ntegrated with the developments of the 1920s. Fortuitously for the Soviet Union, th is much-needed acquisition coincided with a period of increased competition am ong Western aircraft manufacturers. In many cases, military aircraft wer e designed in the West on Soviet account and the heavy, slow, underpowered Russian d esigns of the early 1930s were replaced by efficient Western designs. By 1937 the Soviet government was convinced that th e American method of building aircraft was the best for Russian conditions, as th e American system of manufacture could more easily be adapted to mass production tha n any of the European systems."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The United States thus became the main source of So viet aircraft technology, particularly as a builder of new Soviet aircraft pl ants. Between 1932 and I940 more than twenty American companies supplied either airc raft, accessories, or technical assistance for complete planes and aircraft manufac turing plants. Technical assistance agreements were made for Vultee attack bombers, the Consolidated Catalina, the Martin Ocean flying boat and Martin bombers, Republ ic and Sikorsky amphibians, Seversky amphibians and heavy bombers, Douglas DC-2 and DC-3 transports, the Douglas flying boat, and other aircraft. Kilmarx ha s well summarized this acquisition: The objectives of the Soviet Union were more straig htforward than its methods. By monitoring aeronautical progress and taking advanta ge of commercial practices and lax security standards in the West, the Russians so ught to acquire advanced equipment, designs, and processes on a selective ba sis. Emphasis was placed on the legitimate procurement of aircraft, engines (includ ing superchargers), propellers, navigational equipment, and armament; specification s and performance data; design, production and test information and methods; machin e tools, jigs and dies; semi- fabricates and critical raw materials. Licenses wer e obtained to manufacture certain modern military aircraft and engines in the U.S.S.R . At the same time, a number of Soviet scientists and engineers were educated at th e best technical institutes in the West. Soviet techniques also included assigning pur chasing missions abroad, placing inspectors and trainees in foreign factories, and c ontracting for the services of foreign engineers, technicians and consultants in Soviet pl ants. 21 In 1937 the Soviet Union possessed the world's firs t commercial plane able to fly the Atlantic Ocean nonstop, with a payload of 7,500 pou nds. Known as the Martin Ocean Transport, Model-156, with four 1,000 horsepower Wr ight Cyclone engines, it was built by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore. Model-156 cost the Soviet Union $1 million. Although capable of being flown d irectly to the Soviet Union, it was flown only to New York, then was dismantled and shipped to the USSR by boat. Also in 1937 the Martin Company agreed to design a Soviet bomber. Loy Henderson, the U.S. charge in Moscow, reported: ...since January 1, 1937, the Embassy granted visas t o fourteen Soviet engineers and specialists who are proceeding to Baltimore to the Glenn L. Martin factory. This information would appear to be significant in view of the statements that the Martin Company is to design and develop a new type of larg e plane for the Soviet air force instead of selling somewhat obsolete models which m ay have been released for export by the American military authorities. . . 22 In May 1937 the New York Times reported a $780,000 Soviet contract with Seversky Aircraft Corporation involving construction of, and manufacturing rights for, Seversky amphibians, which then held the amphibian world speed record of 230.4 miles per hour. Under a technical-assistance agreem ent, Seversky Aircraft provided assistance for manufacture of these planes in the S oviet Union at the rate of ten per day. Alexander P. de Seversky, president of the company, then informed the State Department that the Soviets had contracted to purch ase from the company a large number of bombing planes of a new type to be design ed by him. After being informed"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"that a license would be granted if the planes invol ved no military secrets, Seversky suggested that the War and Navy Departments might o bject to its exportation \"merely\" on the ground that the new bomber would be superior to any bombing plane then in existence. Seversky indicated that he inten ded to address his request for an export license to the State Department, \"in hope th at the Department might expedite action in this.\" The first domestic flying boats under the Soviets w ere constructed at Leningrad and Taganrog. In 1932, Plant No. 23 in Leningrad produc ed 18 Avro 504-L seaplanes and 40 Savoia S-62 scouting flying boats, the latter un der a license from the Societa Idrovolanti Alta Italia of Milan —an outstanding de signer of high-performance flying boats. Also in 1932, Taganrog Plant No. 31 produced 196 flying boats: 150 scouting HD-55s and 46 MR-5s, both built under license from Heinkel. The Soviets also acquired a license from the Macchi Company of Italy to produce the MBR series of Russian flying boats. Then in 1937 came an agreement with the Consolidate d Aircraft Company of San Diego for technical assistance for Catalina flying boats under supervision of Etienne Dormoy. With the Catalina flying boat we once again see the extraordinary ability of the Soviets to acquire anything they set their hear ts on. The very first commercial Consolidated PBY (\"Catalina\") off the assembly, lin e in San Diego was sold to the American Museum of Natural History — which promptly transferred it to the Soviets. 23 This is not the first time the American Museum of Natural History turns up in the Soviet files. In 1919 a shipload of Soviet p ropaganda was seized — en route to the United States and addressed to the American Mus eum of Natural History. 24 Also in 1937-38, the Vultee Aircraft Division of Av iation Manufacturing Corporation of Downey, California built a fighter aircraft plan t for the Soviets in Moscow. Equally as important, the Soviets acquired rights t o build the famous Douglas DC-3, probably the most successful transport plane in the history of aviation. Donald Douglas produced his first DC-3 in March1935 and wi thin one year the Soviets decided this was to be the basic transport plane fo r the USSR. A technical-assistance agreement with the Douglas Aircraft Company was sig ned on July 15, 1936 for three years. Within thirty days of contract signature, Do uglas delivered the blueprint materials required to fulfill the assistance contra ct. In October 1937 the Soviet aircraft industry placed a $1.15 million order with Douglas for additional parts, tools, assemblies, an d materials. The order included one complete DC-3 in subassembly and another in \"first- stage\" production. In addition, aluminum extrusions were ordered for another fifty aircraft, together with two complete sets of raw materials and twenty-five sets of finishing materials ranging from ash trays to zippers. Construction facilities, ordered at the same time, included one complete set of 6,485 templates, a set of 350 l ead and zinc drop hammer dies, three sets of hydraulic mechanisms, all the necessa ry wood and plaster patterns, drill and assembly fixtures, a complete set of drop-hamme r stamps, hydraulic-press parts, two crowning machines, and a set of 125 special too ls. Later, another six complete transports were purchased, but it was not until 194 0, four years after the agreement, that the Soviets got any domestic DC-3s (renamed th e PS-84 or the LI-2) off a Soviet assembly line."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"For input materials for military aircraft operation and construction the Soviets also depended on American construction assistance and te chnology. Even after the extensive American construction of refineries in th e early 1930s the Soviet Union continued to be dependent on American technology fo r cracking petroleum into light gasoline fractions. Lend-Lease equipment deliveries brought the output of aviation gasoline from a mere 110,000 metric tons per year i n 1941 to 1.65 million metric tons in 1944, despite the fact that several Lend-Lease c racking units were not delivered until after the end of the war. The Standard Oil Co mpany of New York supplied the Soviet Union with technical information, plant desi gns, and a pilot manufacturing plant for sulfuric acid alkylation for production o f 100-octane gasoline, and \"voltolization\" of fatty oils for production of avi ation lubricating oils. Efficient and specialized tools were developed by A merican aircraft manufacturers and their equipment suppliers and these in turn wer e purchased by the Soviets. For example, in 1938 the Lake Erie Engineering Corporat ion received a Soviet order for six hydraulic presses for forming metal aircraft se ctions. In the same year, Birdsboro Steel Foundry and Machine Company of Birdsboro, Pen nsylvania, filled a half- million-dollar order for hydraulic presses for airc raft manufacture. Similarly, in 1938 the Wallace Supplies Manufacturing Company of Chica go, Illinois, sold seven bending machines \"specially designed to bend tubing for aircraft and parts of motors\" for $34,000. Most, if not all, Soviet aircraft acce ssories were straight copies of foreign products. When biplanes were used, \"the streamline wires [were] of English pattern, landing wheels of Palmer type, bomb-releases... of their own design, and the duralumin machine-gun rings... of French pattern. A ircraft fuel pumps were the French A.M. type and mobile starters were the Hucks types.\" At the request of the State Department and the Buck eye Pattern Works of Dayton, Ohio, the Secretary of War granted \"release of Reco rds of Tests made of certain aluminum exhaust stacks at the Aviation Depot at Wr ight Field, Dayton, Ohio, for benefit of the Russian Soviet Government.\" No milit ary objections were made to the production of Wright aeronautical engines in Russia , and to an application by Sperry Gyroscope to sell bombsights. Nor was objection mad e to export of Type D-1 an D-2 oil bypass relief valves in 1935 by the Fulton Syph on Company of Knoxville. The Stupino plant also manufactured U.S. Hamilton 2-bla de and 3-blade variable-pitch propellers for military aircraft. The United Engineering and Foundry Company contract s of January 1938 exemplify the advanced nature of the aircraft materials techn ology supplied by Western firms to the Soviet Union. Indeed, some of these projects st rained the research and development abilities of the most advanced Western firms and were far beyond the capability of the Soviet Union at that time. The co ntracts do suggest, however, that the Soviet Union has had remarkable ability to reco gnize advance military aircraft technology and enlist front-rank foreign firms in t he acquisition process. The January 1938 United Engineering agreement involved the sale of $3 million worth of equipment and technical assistance for aluminum mil ls at Zaporozhe. These were 66- inch (1,680 min.) hot and cold mills complete with auxiliary equipment — the most modern aluminum mills in the world. Jenkins, the Un ited Engineering chief engineer in the USSR, said of the Zaporozhe mill that \"not e ven the Aluminum Company of America has machinery as modern as it is.\" Both mil ls were \"completely powered and controlled by General Electric apparatus.\""},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Stupino mill (Plant No. 150) near Moscow, by fa r the most important Soviet aluminum-development project, was also the subject of an agreement in May 1939 between Mashinoimport and United Engineering and Fo undry for installation of hot and cold rolling mills. These were mills of extraor dinary size to produce aluminum sheet for aircraft manufacture. The Stupino installation comprised two sections: a hot mill and a cold mill. The hot mill had two units. One was a 2-high 66-inch hot ro lling mill for rolling cast duralumin, including aircraft specification Type 17 -S and 24-S ingots. The 66-inch mill came into regular operation about February 1, 1940 and the 112-inch mill a few weeks later. The cold mill contained two mills of s imilar size for cold working sheets produced in the hot mill. The 66-inch cold mill sta rted about March 1940 and the 112- inch cold mill late in 1940. All finishing equipmen t was supplied and placed in operation by United Engineering for the Soviets. Th e complete contract was worth about $3.5 or $4 million to United Engineering. For this sum the Soviets acquired an installation capable of rolling 2,000-foot aluminum sheets for aircraft. United Engineering said of it, \"Nothing of such a size has ever been produced before.\" During World War II the Soviets produced 115,596 ai rcraft from these materials and items of equipment while Lend-Lease delivered to th e USSR only an additional 14,018. However, the Russian-produced aircraft were mainly obsolete prewar types and many were one-engine wood and canvas models wit h inferior engines. The full utilization of U.S. equipment came after World War II. Domestic production was assisted by a high degree of production specializat ion in a few plants with almost all foreign equipment. The only Soviet dive bomber, the Storrnovik (IL-2), was in production at three plants; each plant produced abo ut the same number of IL-2s, but not other aircraft. Fighter production was concentr ated on the YAK-3, the YAK-2 and YAK-6 being advanced trainer versions. The YAK was produced in six widely scattered plants producing only YAK aircraft at a r ate of between 65 and 400 per month. Two-engined bomber production included the PK-2 (ba sed on the French Potez) at two plants, and the IL-4 at three plants, of which only Komsomolsk (which Henry Wallace said was like the Boeing Seattle plant beca use it had all U.S. equipment) produced other aircraft. The L1-2 (Douglas DC-3) tr ansport was produced only at Tashkent, and the PO-2 (or De Havilland Tiger Moth) was produced only at Kasan. Thus Soviet aircraft production was concentrated on a few types, each for a single flying function. Lend-Lease provided large quantiti es of advanced equipment for the development of the Soviet aircraft industry. Henry Wallace, after his visit to the important Kornsomolsk aircraft plant, commented as follows: The aircraft factory [in Kornsornolsk] where Storrn ovik bombers were built owed both its existence and its production to the United States. All the machine tools and all the aluminum came from America... It looks like the old Boeing plant at Seattle. Foreign Designs for Soviet Aircraft Engines By acquiring rights to manufacture foreign engines under license and with Western technical assistance, the Soviets were able to acqu ire a sizable engine-producing"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"capacity for high-quality engines at low cost. For example, in the 1930s, Plants No. 24 and 25 were built in Moscow. Plant No. 24 made Wrig ht Cyclone engines under license and Plant No. 25 made parts for Wright engi nes. Table 6-2 summarizes Soviet production of aircraft engines in 1940. All Soviet engines were foreign models produced under license. Before this production program was established, pro totypes of every Western aircraft engine were purchased (or stolen). These acquisitio ns were minutely examined and copied, or composition \"Soviet\" designs were built incorporating the best features of several foreign engines. A report by Bruce Leighton of Curriss-Wright describes one of these early Soviet models at the Engine Research Institute in 1931: They've taken Packard, Conqueror, Rolls-Royce, Kest ral, Hispano-Suiza, Fiat, Isetta- Franchini — tested them all, analyzed them down to the minutest details, including microphotographs of piston rings, flow lines in cra nk shafts, etc., taken good features of all, added some ideas of their own (particularly regards valve cooling) and built-up [sic] an engine which we're going to hear more of o r I miss my guess. In 1944, in the entire world, there were about 130 basic types and 275 variations of aircraft engines, either in production or recently in production. Each of the three Soviet engine types was an adaptation of a foreign engine built under a licensing agreement. The M-63 liquid-cooled 9-cylinder radial model was developed from the 1936 M-25, in turn developed from the Wright Cyclon e, and used in the Soviet Consolidated Catalina patrol plane. The M-88 was a 14-cylinder air-cooled radial engine based on the French Gnome-Rhone 14-iN, used in DB bombers, SU dive bombers, and PS transport planes. The third engine type was the M-105, a 12-cylinder liquid-cooled V-type of 1,100 horsepower based on t he French Hispano-Suiza 12-Y engine, and used in the PE dive bombers, YAK fighte rs, and L-760 transport planes.

The Wright Cyclone Engine in the Soviet Union In 1931 the Curtiss-Wright liquid-cooled engine was the only liquid-cooled American engine still in production. The U.S. Army initially supported development, but dissatisfied with the basic design, cut off funds i n 1932. Development support for two other liquid-cooled engines, including the Curtiss- Wright H-2120, was continued by the U.S. Navy. Testing and development continued fr om 1933 to 1936, when the Navy withdrew support and reverted to air-cooled en gines. The second U.S. Navy- supported Curtiss-Wright project was a 12-cylinder V-engine known as the V-1800. This was intended to replace the Curtiss-Wright Con queror, and successfully completed its testing in 1934. Shortly after this t est was completed, the Navy was forced by lack of funds to abandon most of its high -speed program and stopped support of the V-1800. The V-1800 engine was then l icensed to the Soviet Union, which funded further research work to raise the eng ine rating to 900 horsepower from the U.S. Navy's test rating of 800 horsepower. This work was done at Aircraft Engine Plant No. 24 (Frunze) in Moscow, with parts manufac tured at Plant No. 25. By 1938 these plants were producing about 250 Wright Cyclon es (the Soviet M-25) per month. A plant for manufacturing Cyclone engines was also built at Perm — it was twice the size of the Wright plant in the United States. The Soviet M-26 engine was based on the Pratt & Whi tney Hornet. In July 1939 the corporation licensed the Soviet Union for productio n 0fthe Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp 1830 and the Twin Hornet 2180 aircraft engines . The Gnome rotary, manufactured by the Societe des M oteurs Gnome et Rhone, was one of the finest early aircraft engines. After Wor ld War I the Gnome Company purchased the license of the British Bristol Jupite r-11 and during the decade of the 1920s the Gnome-Rhone engineering department was do minated by English engineers from the Bristol Aeroplane Company. After producing the Bristol Jupiter engine for some years, the Gnome Company came up wi th an improved engine of its own design, using American lined cylinders. This cr ossfer-tilization of ideas led to the exceptional Gnome rotary engines of the 1930s, whic h were then adopted by the Soviets. The Gnome-Rhone 114 was built at the Kharkov engine building plant (Plant No. 29) and the French engine became Soviet models M-85, M- 87B, and M-88. About 1,500 M-88s a year were produced by 1940."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Similarly, the French Hispano-Suiza engine was prod uced in Moscow at an enormous plant twice the size of either the Pratt & Whitney or the Wright factories in the United States, themselves gigantic. This French Hispano-Su iza engine became the Soviet M- 105 engine. Western Contribution to the Postwar Soviet Air Forc e In 1945 and 1946 the Russian aircraft industry conc entrated on mastering the achievements of the German aircraft industry as it had been developed from 1941 to 1943. The years immediately after 1946 witnessed a remarkable expansion in the Soviet industry, based on this and on additional Br itish technical assistance. Technical assistance from the West flowed in from the United Kingdom, particularly through transfer of the Rolls-Royce Nene, Derwent, and Tay jet engine technologies, and from Germany via the transfer of about two-thirds of the enormous German wartime aircraft industry to the Soviet Union. The postwar aviation and space industries in the US SR have their roots in German World War II aircraft and rocket developments. In 1 945 the Germans had a large and relatively undamaged aircraft and rocket manufactur ing industry that had been dispersed under threat of Allied bombing toward the eastern regions of Germany — the area later occupied by the Soviets, or transfer red to the Soviets on July 1, 1945. Over two-thirds of this productive capacty fell int act into Soviet hands and was removed to the USSR. The major design units of the German aircraft indus try, including most of the Junkers, Siebel, Heinkel, and Messerschmidt plants, were tra nsported to Podberezhye, about 90 miles north of Moscow. Professor Walter Baade of Junkers continued development of the Ju-287K (as the EF-125) after moving to Podb erezhye, and followed this with the T-140 and T-150 bombers. These were jets capabl e of carrying an atomic bomb and, according to one report, they could outperform the U.S. B-47. There were eleven major Junkers aircraft plants in the Soviet Zone an d six of these are known to have been completely removed to the USSR, among them the main Otto Mader works, two miles east of Dessau (where Professor Baade had bee n located), and the Aschersleben, Bernburg, Leopoldshall, and Schonebeck plants. Asch ersleben was a fuselage- building plant in process of changing over to the p roduction of the jet He-162; its instrument storeroom, \"virtually intact,\" was place d under military guard by the U.S. Army until the Soviets were able to take it over fo r removal to the Soviet Union. Benburg was also intact. In 1944, the outstanding German rocket-plane design er Sanger was working on the Sanger-Bredt project to develop a long-range rocket aircraft. Former Russian General G. A. Tokaev recalls that in 1947 he was summoned t o a Moscow conference at which Stalin said, \"Von Braun, Lippish, Sanger, Tan k and all kinds of other experts are working for the Allies, we must concentrate ver y seriously on German specialists.\" Voznesensky then completed a draft decree, and read it aloud to the conference:"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"The Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. decrees th at a Government Commission shall be formed for the purpose of directing and co -ordinating scientific research into aviation problems, with special relation to piloted rocket planes and the Sanger Project. The Commission shall be composed of the fo llowing: Colonel General Comrade Serov (President) Engineer Lieutenant Colonel Comrade Tokavev (Deputy president) Academician Comrade Keldysh (Member) Professor Comrade Kishkin (Member) The Commission shall leave immediately for Germany, to undertake its preliminary work. A full report of its activities, and of the r esults it has attained, must be rendered to the Council of Ministers by August 1st. Marshall of the Soviet Union Comrade Sokolovsky is hereby directed to give the Commission every assistance. Moscow, the Kremlin, April 17, 1947 25 \"A thorough examination of the Sanger Project was i nvaluable,\" said Tokaev, because \"of the experience such research would give our sci entists in solving related problems and preparing a base for future activities. In othe r words, by mastering Sanger's theories our experts would be able to begin where h e had left off. Despite these high-level efforts, Professor Sanger was never captured by the Soviets, although the transfer involved almost all other Ger man projects and technologies under development in 1945. A troublesome gap in 1945 Soviet technology was mod ern fighter aircraft. Dr. Siegfried Gunther and Professor Benz, both develope rs of German fighter aircraft, were removed to the USSR. Gunther had been chief de signer for Heinkel and a designer of jet fighters since the late 1930s, whil e Benz designed the German He-162 Volksjager jet fighter. Among the Soviet acquisitions in Saxony was the Sie bel works at Halle, where the experimental rocket-powered research aircraft DFS-3 46 (comparable to the U.S. Bell X-1 and X-2 and the Douglas X-3) was in final assem bly. This work was continued at Halle on behalf of the Russians until Octoer 1948, when it was moved to the OKB-2 combine at Podberezhye with technicians from the Ju nkers, Heinkel, and Siebel plants. Flight testing of versions built in the USSR was be gun in early 1948, using a Lend- Lease North American Mitchell B-25 bomber and later a Boeing B-29 Superfortress as mother aircraft. The first test pilots were Germ ans, later replaced by Russian pilots. The aircraft-manufacturing facilities removed from Germany contained some unique equipment. Two German Wotan presses of 15,000 tons were taken and at least four copies were made in the Soviet Union and other unit s developed from these presses. Aircraft-equipment-manufacturing plants included th e former Nitsche plant at Leipzig, used in the USSR to manufacture curve potentiometer s, and the Karl Zeiss plant, for position-finders, wind-tunnel parts, and various pr ecision instruments. It is estimated"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"that in 1954 this segment of the wartime German air craft industry supplied about 75 percent of Soviet radar equipment and precision ins truments. The Boeing B-20 Four-Engined Bomber becomes the Tu- 4 and the Tu-70 During World War II the United States was unwilling to send four-engined heavy bombers to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease. Altho ugh in April 1944 General John R. Deane recommended U.S. approval of Russian reque sts for heavy bombers, the War Department refused on the grounds that the Sovi ets could not train a bombing force prior to the spring of 1945 and that certain special equipment for such bombers was in short supply. The official State Department Lend-Lease report on war aid lists Russian acquistion of only one four-engined bomber (a B-24 that force-landed in Siberia), although the Soviets were in fact able to acquire four B-29s by retaining force-landed bombers in the Far East. The Soviets then started work on the Tu-4 four-engi ned bomber and the Tu-70 civilian-transport version. In 1946 Amtorg attempte d to purchase from the Boeing Aircraft Company a quantity of B-29 tires, wheels, and brake assemblies. In 1947 the Soviets produced the Tupolev Tu-70, which was immed iately identified as a direct copy of the Boeing B-29. The similarity has been de scribed in Boeing Magazine: The famed Boeing 117 airfoil on the Tu-70 is an exa ct replica of the Boeing B-29 wing. Along with the wing are the superfortress nac elles: outline, cooling air intake, auxiliary air scoop, cowl flaps and inboard and out board fairings. The cabin cooling air inlet in the wing leading edge between the body and the inboard nacelle is the same. The trailing edge extension on the flap betwe en the inboard nacelle and the side of the fuselage are also identical, according to th e evidence provided by the photographs. On the landing gear, Boeing commnts: The Tupolev Tu-70 uses the Twenty-nine's main landi ng-gear structure as well as its fairings and doors. The nose gear also appears to b e that of the Superfortress, with the upper trunnion located closer to the body contour o f the Tu-70 than on the Boeing bomber. The tail surfaces of the Russian transport also cam e directly from the Boeing engineering department. On comparison it is apparen t that the vertical tail and the dorsal outline as well as the leading edge of the r udder are the same on the two planes. The rudder of the Tu-70 appears to end at what woul d be the top of the tail-gunner's doghouse on the Superfortress. The shape of the sta bilizer and the elevator is the same on the two planes, and the Tu-70 also uses the inve rted camber of the B-29's tail. The propellers of the Tupoiev Tu-70 were original B -29 props, less cuffs. The hubs are characteristic of the Hamilton-Standard design. Boeing engineers also report that the drift-meter installation of the Russian transpo rt looked like that of the superfortress, as did the pitot head type and locat ion match-up."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Soviets did design a new fuselage, higher on th e wing of the Tu-70 than the fuselage of the B-29, larger in diameter, and a lit tle longer (119 feet as compared to 99 feet). The Tu-70 transport retains the bomber no se, including the bombardier's plate-glass window. How did the Soviets advance from an inability to pr oduce modern bombers in 1940 to an ability to produce a workmanlike design requirin g an extensive period of research and flight testing in 19477 Even if the finest desi gns were available, jigs and dies to put the plane into quantity production were also re quired. The 18-cylinder Wright engines for the B-29 had been extremely difficult t o manufacture — even in the United States. Further, the Soviet's only experienc e in the production of four-engined bombers was the very unsuccessful Tupolev PE-8. We also know that in 1940 the Soviets had enormous difficulties putting the DC-3 twin-engined transport plane into production and repeatedly came back to the Douglas Aircraft Company for aluminum sections, parts, and technical advice. Obviously, the record of a great deal of our assist ance to the Soviets still lies buried in the U.S. government files. One area still worthy of research in the 1980s is the so- called \"special programs\" under Lend-Lease — unpubl icized and still classified. The First Soviet Jets Aircraft Plant No. 1 at Kuibyshev, built by Lend-Le ase during World War II, absorbed the equipment from the Junkers facility at Bernburg, which was transferred from Germany along with Junkers engineers, designer s, foremen, and test pilots. The function of the plant was to utilize the emerging G erman jet technology to build the first Soviet jet fighters and bombers. The Soviet d esigners Tupolev and Gurevich began by visiting German aircraft factories to exam ine prototypes and production methods. The Junkers Company organized an exhibitio n of secret German aircraft projects and arranged for tours of inspection. Equi pment was then removed under the program of OKSs (Osoboye Konstruktorskoye Byuro); O KB No. 1 was at the Junkers plant in Dessau. The bulk of the German engineers and scientists wer e moved to Russia by train on the night of October 22-23, 1946, in what was probably the largest mass movement of scientific brains in the history of the civilized ( or the uncivilized) world. These engineers and scientists were divided into small gr oups of about fifteen persons, with about thirty Russian engineers attached to each Ger man nucleus for study and work. Each project was handled by stages — the draft stag e, the technical project stage, and finally the presentation stage. Whenever a project was almost complete it was canceled by the Soviets and the related drawings, p apers, biographies, and technical material were turned over by the Germans. Duplicate work was undertaken by separate all-Russian groups some distance from the location of the original German pilot-groups. In addition, German groups were put i n competition with each other. Most German designers and engineers in the aeroengi ne industry were sent to Kuibyshev Plant No. 1. They came mainly from the Ju nkers and BMW plants, no less than 800 engineers and technicians from these two c ompanies alone. Among the members of the BMW contingent was Kurt Schell, form er head of the BMW rocket"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"laboratory, and engineers Winter, Kaul, Schenk, Tie tze, Weiner, and Muller. The Junkers group led by Walter Baade was the most impo rtant. Dr. Baade, formerly chief engineer of Junkers with ten years experience in Am erican aeronautical plants, was fully familiar with American methods of aircraft co nstruction. With Dr. Baade was a group of engineers including Feundel, Haseloff, Woc ke, Elli, Lilo, Rental, Hoch, Beer, Antoni, Reuss, Heising, and Hartmann. The Junkers engine team in the Soviet Union was hea ded by Dr. Scheibe, who designed the Junkers P-1 turbine; he was assisted b y engine designers Gerlach and Pohl, who at Dessau had been in charge of the engin e testing department. Also in the Scheibe group were Steudel and Boettger and a large number of personnel from the Junkers turbojet department, including engineers, f oremen, and skilled workers. Another prominent designer, Ernst Heinkel, worked i n the Soviet Union at the Kalinin Experimental Station. The Junkers plant itself was rebuilt at Kuibyshev, \"almost exactly\" as it had been in Leipzig. Development of the First Soviet Jet Engine At first German engineers were used to develop jet engines for the Soviets after World War II. First came reproductions of the Junke rs-004 and the BMW-003 jet engines, which had been removed to the Soviet Union with their associated production equipment. The 004 became the Soviet RD- 10, and the BMW-003 was produced as the Soviet RD-20 on a stop-gap basis un til more advanced designs came along from British sources. The first project given to the German design groups was a Soviet specification for a 3,000-horsepower jet engine, a development of the J unkers-012 turbojet, which had been in the design stage in Germany at the end of W orld War II. By 1947 the Junkers- 012 had been developed as a 12-burner assembly, but operating inefficiencies halted development of this engine in 1948. The next projec t specification given to the German designers was for a 6,000-horsepower turbopr op that could attain a speed of 560 miles per hour at sea level. This engine was de veloped from the Junkers-022 turboprop engine, with the same general design and characteristics as the 012. By 1949 the Brandner design teams had essentially m et the Soviets' specification and immediately set to work on yet another project — a power plant with 12,000 horsepower in contrast to the 6,000 horsepower deve loped by the Junkers-022. Finally, the Type-K turboprop was developed by the Junkers-B MW team as a 14-stage compressor and 5-stage turbine engine, a logical ev olution from the German engines under development during the latter stages of World War II. Type-K engines produced by the mid-1950s power the operational Sov iet four-engined bomber (Tu-20 Bear) with four MK- 12M turboprop engines of 12,000 horsepower capacity, and the civilian version, Tu-114 (The Rossiya). The AM series (after Mikulin) developed from the wo rk of a Junkers-BMW team in the USSR under engineer Brandner. The end result of this design, the AM-3, was seen in 1958 by an American engineer, whose comment was, \"The engine is not an"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"outstanding power plant, being of simple design of very large diameter and developing about 15,000 pounds thrust with 8 compre ssion stages.\" The AM series of turbojets is currently used in the Tu-104 Came; civilian version of the Tu-16 Badger bomber. MIG Fighters with Rolls-Royce Turbojets In 1946 the Soviets bought fifty-five Rolls-Royce c entrifugal compressor type turbojets — twenty-five Nenes and thirty Derwents. These Rolls-Royce engines, the most advanced in the world for the time, were well suited to Soviet production methods and introduced the Soviets to the use of a centrifugal turbojet. Up to 1947 Russian jets were all of the axial-flow type based on German designs. These Rolls- Royce turbines proved to be the best possible equip ment for the MiG-15, which was designed by Siegfried Gunther and put into serial p roduction under the name of the Soviet designers Mikoyan and Gurevich. Gunther was brought to Moscow and appointed chief designer in the construction office in Podberezhye. Two versions of the Rolls-Royce engines were produc ed at Engine Plant No. 45 near Moscow from 1948 to the late 1950s. The plant was t oured in 1956 by U.S. Air Force General Nathan Twining, who noted that it contained machine tools from the United States and Germany, and had 3,000 workers engaged i n producing the Rolls-Royce Nene. In 1951 the American counterpart to this Rolls-Royc e engine was the Pratt & Whitney J-42 Turbo-Wasp, based on the Nene, but not then in quantity production. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, therefore, the Russia ns had thousands of improved Rolls-Royce Nene engines in service powering MiG-15 s, whereas the U.S. Air Force had only a few hundred F-86A Sabres with comparable engines. Several engines from MiG-15s captured in Korea were evaluated by the Uni ted States Air Force. Reports were prepared by engineers of Pratt & Whitney Aircr aft Division of United Aircraft Corporation, the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, a nd Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. We know from these analyses that by 195 1 the Soviets had two versions of the original Rolls-Royce Nene in production quan tities. The first version, the RD- 45 that powered an early MiG-15, was a direct copy of the original Rolls-Royce Nene and delivered 5,000 pounds of thrust. The second ve rsion of the RD-45 delivered 6,000 pounds of static thrust at sea level and 6,75 0 pounds of thrust with water injection. The turbine blades in the Soviet RD-45 e ngines were made of a stainless steel alloy of the Nimonic-80 type, while the burne r liner and swirl vanes were made of Nimonic-75. Parts of the Nene sold to Russia in 1948 were fabricated from Nimonic alloys — \"Nimonic\" being the registered tra demark of Henry Wiggin and Company of Birmingham, England. Both Nimonic-75 and Nimonic-80 were developed by Mond Nickel about 1940, and the specif ications had previously been published by the Ministry of Supply in the United K ingdom on the grounds that it was nonstrategic information. The RD-45 (Nene) was produced in Moscow and also at Magadan from 1951 onwards, at Khabarovsk, at Ufa Plant No. 21, and at the Kiev Plant No. 43 from 1951 until sometime after 1958."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"In 1967 the Soviet Strategic Air Force operated abo ut 120 Tu-14 Bison bombers, 70 Tu-20 Bear bombers, and 1,000 Tu-16 Badger bombers. The Soviet Navy also operated these three types of aircraft. From the information in Table 6-1 we can trace the operational jet engines of the 1960s from the Junkers and BMW prototypes taken fro m Germany at the end of World War II or from those sold by the Rolls-Royce Company as \"peaceful trade\" in 1946. Both groups of prototypes were developed by G erman engineers transferred to Russia as forced labor, with equipment and instrume nts imported as \"peaceful trade.\" When the K-series and the AM-series turbojets were well along the development road the Germans were returned home. The Soviets have ha d no difficulty since in making design improvements to the original German and Brit ish concepts and technologies. These are the engines that power operational Soviet military aircraft. Even today in the 1980s Soviet military and commerc ial aircraft are heavily dependent on Western technology — primarily America n. It has been observed that current aircraft designs from Soviet military aircraft design bureaus are to a significant degree copies of Weste rn military aircraft. Apparently Soviet military designers order documents and plans from U.S. Government sources and we obligingly make deliveries within a month or so directly to the Soviet Union. For example, the Soviet military cargo plane is a d irect copy of the U.S. C-5A giant transport. Soviet acquisition of American aircraft also suggests they are just as interested in aircraft construction techniques as i n design data for particular aircraft. This Soviet design interest has been identified esp ecially in military transport and wide body jets and they have probably managed to ac celerate their development programs significantly. The Soviet IL-86 is a copy of the Boeing 747. The IL-76 is a copy of the C-141. While neither is a precise copy, both designs are substantially the same. Even the NASA Space Shuttle has been copied. In 198 4 U.S. intelligence sources reported that the, Soviet Union is building a \"carb on copy\" of the Space Shuttle. Retired Lt. Colonel Thomas Krebs, former chief of t he DIA space systems branch, reported: \"We've seen the Soviet orbiter and it's i dentical to ours.\" The only difference between the shuttles is reporte d as an additional set of engines below the fuel tank, thus an increased payload capa city. The Soviets were able to purchase a complete set of Space Shuttle plans. The se were unclassified and made available by NASA to any interested party. The Sovi ets were an obviously interested party, although it is beyond comprehension why the NASA people would release a technology with obvious military implications. The NASA excuse is that the plans were released to improve coordination with commerci al suppliers of equipment. The Soviets set up a dummy company to make the purchase (Washington Post, June 9, 1984).

The configurations of the Russian supersonic Tu-144 and the Anglo-French supersonic Concorde are strikingly similar. Given t he history of Soviet technical"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"dependence on the West, we can pose the question: D id the Soviets use the design of the Anglo-French Concorde for the Russian Tu-1447 Design work for Concorde began a decade before the British and French signed the Concorde agreement in 1962. Wind-tunnel testing, wh ich yielded the data for the shape of the plane, began in the early 1950s. The S oviets had many other pressing problems in the early 1950s that were more importan t than research on a supersonic delta plane. However, the Tu-144 has a design conce pt very close to that of the Concorde. Both have modified double-delta wings, fi xed geometry and low-aspect ratio for minimum drag. Fins and rudders are simila r; neither aircraft has tailplanes. The major external differences are relatively sligh t variations in landing gear and engine position. In other words, superficially the Tu-144 is quite unlike anything the Soviets have designed previously; it is a significa nt jump in the technological horizon (but not as much as the aborted titanium U.S. super sonic plane) and should have required many years of testing and design work. Dr. William Strang, technical director of British A ircraft Corporation's commercial aircraft division, has stated, \"I think it likely t hat they did have some knowledge of the work we were doing which led to the general shape d efinition\" (London Times, Sept. 27, 1971). In September 1971 the British government expelled 1 05 Russian \"diplomats\" from England on charges of spying, and specifically mili tary and industrial spying. According to the London Times, this espionage inclu ded \"information on electronics, transformers, semi-conductors, computer circuitry, and technical details of the Concorde and Olympus 593 engine\" (Sept. 25, 1971). Finally, Doyle, a reformed member of the British Co mmunist Party, confessed to accepting L5,000 from the Soviets for information o n Concorde, \"including manuals, sketches and small pieces of equipment\" Security wa s so lax at the plant that Doyle and his Soviet friends once considered smuggling ou t a 16-foot missile disguised as a telegraph pole. This was no real problem, as Doyle had keys to all secret departments and security was nonexistent, but he balked at havi ng to answer to his chief for a missing missile. Concorde was one thing, a missile was something else. British and French engineers may have some justific ation for renaming Tu-144 the \"Konkordskiy.\" Footnotes: 20 (London: Tom Stacey, Ltd., 1971), p. 88. 21 R.A.

This threat would not exist if Pre sident Richard Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger had heeded warning s in 1970 from its own Department of Defense and outside experts that the Soviets were lagging in missile production technology and required specific technol ogies from the West to MIRV their fourth generation ICBMs. MIRV capability is the ability to deploy a number o f warheads from the same missile, thus vastly increasing throw weight. Soviet third g eneration missiles did not have this capability. As stated by a Department of Defense re port: \"... it was not until the fourth generation that the technology became available to the Soviets allowing greater throw weight and greatly improved accuracy so that high y ield MIRVs could be carried by operational missiles\" The phrase \"became available\" is a subtle way for D OD to state what has been concealed from the public: that the U.S. made the t echnology available (as we shall show below). The fourth generation ICBMs are the SS -17, the SS-18 and the SS-19, which today have the capability to destroy most of our 1,000 U.S. Minuteman missiles now operational with only a portion of the ir warheads. American Accelerometers for Soviet Missiles Let's go back to the start of our help for the Sovi et missile program. Accelerometers are small but vital instruments used in missiles and aircraft to measure gravitational pull. In 1965-68 the Soviets displayed an extracurricular interest in American accelerometers, and a Soviet U nited Nations diplomat was forced to hurriedly leave the United States before being p icked up for espionage involving acquisitions of U.S. ac-celerometers. Testimony of Leonard I. Epstein, vice president of Trans-American Machinery and Equipment Corporation of New Jersey, to the House U n-American Activities Committee detailed Soviet interest in this American technology. Mr. Epstein related to the committee how he met Vadim Isakov, a Russian employee of UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) on July 15, 1965, and how Isakov"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"later visited Epstein's plant in New Jersey with a list of four items for purchase, including \"an accelerorneter made by American Bosch Arma Corporation or similar company. The accelerometer is an intricate device w hich measures the pull of gravity on any vehicle such as a missile or space-orbiting device. The device costs about $6,000.\" Mr. Epstein, under instructions from the F BI, met several times with Isakov to \"find out what he wanted.\" In October 1965, \"Isakov began to push for delivery on the ac-celerorneter. [Epstein] surmised that the urgency had something to do with the fact that the Soviets had smashed three vehicles onto the surface of the moon .\" Although Epstein was able to stall for \"quite some time\" on various grounds, Isa kov later became \"quite anxious to obtain an accelerometer.\" When Epstein pleaded expo rt problems, Isakov suggested he would use the Soviet diplomatic pouch. Eighteen months later, in August 1967, another Russ ian, intensively interested in accelerometers, turned up in the United States, thi s time under the auspices of the State Department Academic Exchange Program. From Au gust 1967 to June 1968, Anatoliy K. Kochev of the Kalinin Polytechnical Ins titute of Leningrad was at Catholic University in the United States working on \"construction methods of equipment to measure small accelerations and displa cement,\" that is, the manufacture of accelerorneters. Is there any connection between Isakov's unsuccessf ul espionage attempts to purchase accelerometers and Kochev's \"academic\" work on acce lerometer manufacture in the United States, courtesy of the State Department? Th ere are indeed obsolete accelerometers and sophisticated accelerometers. Th e Soviets know the difference. They know how to make the obsolete versions, but do not have the technical ability to make more sophisticated instruments. The trick is i n the manufacturing process — that is, in knowing how to build into the instrumen t the sensitivity necessary to measure small gravitational pulls quickly and accur ately. It is the manufacturing technique that was important to the Soviets — much more important than a boatful of purchased accelerometers. Why did Kochev come to the United States in 19677 T he State Department reports the title of his project as \"construction methods o f equipment to measure small accelerations.\" Ten months would be sufficient time for a competent engineer to determine the most modern methods in this field, an d given the rather careless manner in which advanced accelerometers have found their w ay into used electronic equipment stores, it is unlikely that Kochev had ma jor problems in adding to his knowledge of the state of the art. Why did the State Department make an agreement in 1 966 to allow a Soviet engineer into the United States to study the manufacture of accelerometers only a few months after another Soviet national had been foiled by th e FBI in attempting to purchase an accelerometer? We have no answer for that. American Ball Bearings for Missile Guidance System"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"In the late 1960s Soviet missiles were extremely in accurate. According to Abraham Shifrin, a former Defense Ministry official, they c ould hardly find the United States, let alone a specific target. By the late 1970s thei r accuracy was so improved that Soviets could guarantee a high proportion of hits o n a target as small as the White House. The technological roadblock was mass production of miniaturised precision ball bearings for guidance systems. In the early 1960s Soviets attempted to buy U.S. te chnology for mass production of miniaturised precision bearings. The technology was denied. However, in 1972 the necessary grinders were sold by Bryant Chucking Gri nder Company and its products are today used in Soviet guided missile systems and gyroscopes. Specifically, the Soviets were then able to MIRY their missiles and i ncrease their accuracy. This is how the tragedy came about. Ball bearings are an integral part of weapons syste ms, there is no substitute. The entire ball bearing production capability of the So viet Union is of Western origin — utilizing equipment from the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Italy. This transfer has been fully documented elsewhere by this author (see Bibliography). All Soviet tanks and military vehicles run on bearings manufac tured on Western equipment or copies of Western equipment. All Soviet missiles an d related systems including guidance systems have bearings manufactured on West ern equipment or Soviet duplicates of this equipment. One firm in particular, the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company of Springfield, Vermont, has been an outstanding supplier of ball b earing processing equipment to the Soviets. In 1931 Bryant shipped 32.2 percent of its output to the USSR. In 1934, 55.3 percent of its output went to Russia. There we re no luther shipments until 1938, when the Soviets again bought one-quarter of Bryant 's annual output. Major shipments were also made under Lend-Lease. Soviet d ependence on the West for ball bearings technology peaked after the years 1959-61, when the Soviets required a capability for mass production, rather than laborat ory or batch production, of miniature precision ball bearings for weapons syste ms. The only company in the world that could supply the required machine for a key operation in processing the races for precision bearings (the Centalign-B) was the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company. The Soviet Union had no such mass producti on capability. Its miniature ball bearings in 1951 were either imported or made in small lots on Italian and other imported equipment. In 1960 there were sixty-six Centalign-B machines i n the United States. Twenty-five of these machines were operated by the Miniature Pr ecision Bearing Company, Inc., the largest manufacturer of precision ball bearings , and 85 percent of Miniature Precision's output went to military applications. I n 1960 the USSR entered an order with Bryant Chucking for forty-five similar machine s. Bryant consulted the Department of Commerce. When the department indicat ed its willingness to grant a license, Bryant accepted the order."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Commerce Department's argument for granting a l icense turned on the following points: (1) the process achieved by the Centalign w as only a single process among several required for ball bearing production, (2) t he machine could be bought elsewhere, and (3) the Russians were already able t o make ball bearings. The Department of Defense entered a strong objectio n to the export of the machines on the following grounds: In the specific case of the granting of the export license for high-frequency grinders manufactured by Bryant Chucking Grinder after recei ving the request for DOD's opinion from the Department of Commerce, it was det ermined that all of the machines of this type currently available in the United Stat es were being utilized for the production of bearings utilized in strategic compon ents for military end items. It was also determined from information that was available to us that the Soviets did not produce a machine of this type or one that would be comparable in enabling the production of miniature ball bearings of the tolera nces and precision required. A further consideration was whether machines of compa rable capacity and size can be made available from Western Europe. In this connect ion, our investigation revealed that none was in production that would meet the spe cifications that had been established by the Russians for these machines. In the light of these considerations it was our opinion that the license should not be gran ted. The Inter-Departmental Advisory Committee on Export Control, which includes members from the Commerce and State Departments as well as the CIA, overruled the Department of Defense opinion, and \"a decision was made to approve the granting of the license.\" The Department of Defense made fur ther protests, demanding proof that either the USSR or Western Europe was capable of producing such machines. No such proof was forthcoming. The following is a summary of the objections of the Department of Defense representative: (a) I expressed dissatisfaction and suggested that the Department of Defense not concur in the initial request of the Department of Commerce. (b) The official member of the Department of Defens e in this connection concurred and, at a series of meetings of the Advisory Commit tee on Export Control, spoke against the proposal that an export license be gran ted. (c) The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Suppl y and Logistics, after reviewing some of the circumstances, requested that I do what ever was possible to stop the shipment of these machines. (d) A letter was transmitted from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to the Secretary of Commerce, approximately November 1, 19 60, saying it [sic] spoke to the Department of Defense and requesting a further revi ew. (e) At two meetings where the matter was reviewed, the Department of Defense maintained nonconcurrence in the shipment of the eq uipment."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"As of this writing I am still convinced that it wou ld be a tragic mistake to ship this equipment. The reference to a \"tragic mistake\" refers to the k nown fact at that time that miniature precision ball bearings are essential for missiles. Granting the license would give the USSR a miniature ball bearing production capability equal to two-thirds that of the United States. In 1961 a Senate subcommittee investigated the gran t of this license to Bryant. Its final report stated: The Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security has un dertaken its investigation of this matter not in any desire to find scapegoats, but be cause we felt that the larger issue involved in the Bryant case was, potentially, of li fe-or-death importance to America and the free world. We are now convinced, for reasons that are set fort h below, that the decision to grant the license was a grave error. 26 The testimony of Horace Gilbert to the Senate summa rizes the position on the Centalign machines; Mr. Chairman, I am Horace D. Gilbert, of Keene, N.H ., and I am president of Miniature Precision Bearings, Inc., and I would lik e to express my appreciation for having an opportunity to be here with you and come particularly at this time, when I know that everyone is so busy, and at such short no tice. As the name implies, my company produces miniature ball bearings of precisi on quality, 85 percent of which are used in the national defense effort. All but 1 percent of our sales are within the United States, and most of these bearings are produ ced by machines manufactured by Bryant Chucking Grinder Co., of Springfield, Vt. Our company owns about 25 of these machines out of the 66 which, I believe, presently exist in the United States. This machine was developed over a long period of years, and much of the know-how, Mr. Chairman, i n the latest model, was contributed by our company. Several months ago Russia ordered 45 of these machi nes from Bryant, and the Department of Commerce has granted an export licens e. I was very much disturbed when I learned of this, a nd I and Mr. Patterson over there — whom I will further identify as one of the develo pers of this machine — we have attempted to demonstrate to the Department of Comme rce the tragedy of these machines being sold to Russia. Unfortunately, we have not met with success, and I would like to assure you, Mr. Chairman, that if these machines are sold, it means absolutely no commercial or financial difference to us as a company or to me as an individual. I have no fear as far as Russia selling in our mark ets is concerned, and our company does not do any significant amount of bearing busin ess in their markets. I am here because I think that this is folly which would unde rmine our defenses."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Department of Commerce has attempted to justify its decision with four or five arguments, none of which, in our opinion, appears t o be valid, and I would like to touch on these. First, they say these machines could be purchased i n Europe, and consequently, Bryant might as well benefit by their sale here. I am thoroughly familiar with the machines which ar e in production in Europe. Part of my knowledge has been gained by three trips to Euro pe in the last 11 months, and I can assure you that no European manufacturer in fac t does produce comparable machines with the accuracy of that which is used by Bryant. I would suggest that, if the Russians could buy this machine in any other ma rket, they would indeed do so. In fact, an American competitor of Bryant, Heald Machi ne Co., of Worcester, has been attempting for 3 years to imitate and produce a com parable machine, and they have not been successful. Secondly, the Department of Commerce has pointed ou t that 45 of these machines which have been ordered by the Russians are only a small part of the total number in existence. The number in existence is a matter of r ecord, and, as of the end of September, there were only 66 machines in the Unite d States, and now Russia has ordered 45 for their own needs, and I understand th at not all 66 of these are in production. They are in experimental facilities, th ey would have almost the equivalent of the entire U.S. capacity for production. Thirdly, the Department of Commerce has suggested t hat these machines require skilled operators who need substantial training; an d I can assure you this is not true, sir. Even if it were, I am confident that the Russi ans have skilled technicians who, in a short time, would be able to master the operation o f this machine, were it complicated, which it is not, and that is part of the magic of t he machine, that it is not complicated. There is a certain amount of skill required to set up the machine, but under a contract with Bryant, I understand that the machine must be disassembled and reassembled in the presence of Russian inspectors who are not at t heir doorstep. Consequently, they will have whatever knowledge they need to put this machine into immediate operation. The case for Bryant Chucking Grinder Company is exp ressed in the following portions of a letter sent to Senator Dodd on Januar y 27, 1961 by N.A. Leyds, Bryant's vice president and general manager: We appreciate the opportunity to make the following remarks concerning the testimony of December 21, 1960 and January 24, 1961 , received by your Committee relative to the license granted to us by the Depart ment of Commerce for the shipment of 45 of our Model \"B\" Centalign machines to Russia .... There was no objection by any of the dissenters to the shipment of the J&L machines, and we certainly have no objection. But it has been readily admitted that these machines will quite probably be used in the product ion of miniature bearings... We were not surprised at the objection by the Depar tment of Defense as it is well known that their technical expert, who could not ap pear, is, and has been, against the shipment of most, if not all, machine tools to Russ ia. We do not question his sincerity"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"nor wish at this time to discuss the validity of th is person's opinion, but, whether this opinion described the policy of U.S. Government in this area is highly questionable. To our knowledge, the top technicians from the Defe nse Department have not seen our Model \"B\" machine... We, along with other machine tool builders, are not restricted from producing any of the machines, not on the international control list , in our foreign subsidiaries. Our Company has subsidiaries producing machine tools in England and West Germany and presently regulations permit us to manufacture Model \"B\"s with spindle speeds up to 120,000 r.p.m. in these subsidiaries and ship them to Russia ... Our leadership in technology in this area is so sli ght that we must continually utilize our forces and talents at the maximum, to maintain the slightest gap which exists. We must be permitted to compete with our foreign compe titors and maintain a healthy posture, or we must rapidly lose the race to mainta in superior technology. A few other key machine tool builders with a similar problem ca n create a situation with far- reaching consequences to the nation's security. It is only when a company is strong that it can support the financial burden necessary to maintain research and development activities at their proper level. In general we believe that in the matter of trade w ith the Soviet bloc, similar restrictions should apply to identical industries i n each and all of the Free World countries. Our hands must not be tied. The Senate subcommittee's conclusions were overwhel mingly in favor of denying the export license and raised major unanswered question s concerning the intentions of Leyds, the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company, and the Department of Commerce. These were the subcommittee's conclusions: We believe that this testimony gives overwhelming s upport to the stand taken by the Department of Defense in this matter, and to the ar guments presented by Miniature Precision Bearing in opposing shipment. This testimony establishes conclusively (1) that th e miniature bearings produced with the help of the Bryant machine are used primarily f or defense purposes; (2) that the function performed by the Bryant machine is of crit ical importance; (3) that no comparable machines can at present be obtained from other sources; (4) that Soviet industry has not been able to master the problems i nvolved in mass producing high precision miniature bearings; that the industry is in fact plagued by poor quality and obsolete equipment; that with its own resources, it would probably take a number of years to develop the capability; (5) that the posse ssion of these machines would greatly accelerate Soviet mastery of the art of min iaturization .... we think it would be helpful if we briefly summarized some of the high p oints of this testimony and recapitulated some of the essential facts. 1. At least 85 percent of the bearings manufactured with the help of the Bryant machine are used by defense industries: Subject machine is a key factor in the economical p roduction of the highest precision for many important Department of Defense applicatio ns, such as the latest guidance"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"systems, navigation, fire control, computer, synchr o and servomechanisms used for aircraft, ordnance, ships, missiles and other space vehicles (statement of Mr. J.R. Tomlinson, president, and Mr. B.L. Mims, vice presi dent in charge of engineering, the Barden Corp., Danbury, Conn.). 2. The function performed by the Bryant machine is of critical importance: The outer ball track grinding operation is one of t he last and most vital of those performed on the bearing outer ring. It is the oper ation which, until the advent of this machine, could probably be called the bottleneck op posing the precision performance of miniature bearings. The necessary perfection of other operations has been achieved 5 to 20 years ago (statement by Mr. H.B. Van Dorn, vice president in charge of engineering, Fafnir Bearing Co., New Britain, Conn. ). 3. The Bryant machine is unique in its field: Secretary Mueller in his letter of January 18, 1961 to Senator Dodd, said that \"substantially comparable\" machines could be obtain ed from other sources. Mr. Bradley Fisk, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for I nternational Affairs, in his testimony before the subcommittee on January 24 sai d that there are \"five factories outside of Russia that could make similar machines. \" It was not clear from his statement whether the companies he named do, in fac t, make such machines, or whether they are theoretically capable of making th em. A careful check has revealed that none of the companies named by Mr. Fisk produc e machines that can be considered equal or \"substantially comparable\" to t he Bryant machine. For the Soviets and Bryant Chucking Grinder Company the matter did not end in 1961. In 1972, just before the presidential election, Nic holaas Leyds, general manager of the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company, announced a contra ct with the Soviets for 164 grinding machines. Anatoliy I. Kostousov, Minister of the Machine Tool Industry in the Soviet Union, then said they had waited twelve years for these machines, which included mostly the banned models: \"We are using mo re and more instruments of all kinds and our needs for bearings for these instrume nts is very great. In all, we need to manufacture five times . more bearings than 12 year s ago.\" Under President Nixon and National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger license for export of these 164 Centalign-B machines was approv ed. Simultaneously came heavy pressure on this author t o stop research work on our technological aid to the Soviet military system and to stop making public speeches on this aid. By 1974 the Soviets had MIRVed their missiles and w ere in mass production. The results we well know and are reflected in the chart on page On March 8, 1983, Secretary of Defense Weinberger n ot only made this massive Soviet increase public, but admitted something not admitted in the early 1970s: that the newly achieved accuracy was derived from our U.

Unfortunately, it is on Soviet ships.\" — Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, May 25, 1983, to graduating class at Annapolis (reported in U.S. Naval Institute Proceed ings, August 1983, pp. 73-4) Only one Soviet battleship was built before World W ar II — the Tretii International (\"Third International\"), laid down on July 15, 1939 in the Leningrad yards. The guns, turrets, armor, and boilers for this 35,000 ton bat tleship were purchased in the United States and Germany. The ship was completed in the l ate 1940s. Other prewar Soviet battleships — the Marat, Kommuna, and Oktyabrskyaya Revolutsla — were reconditioned and refitted ex-tsarist vessels. Atte mpts to build three battleships of the Italian Vittorio Veneto class were abandoned. Three aircraft carriers were under construction at the end of the 1930s. The Stalin (formerly the tsarist Admiral Kornilov ), a 9,000-ton ship built in 1914, redesigned in 1929, and completed in 1939 as an aircraft carrier. Two other carriers of 12,000 tons each were built \"on the basis of American blueprint s\" — the Krasnoye Znamye and the Voroshilov , laid down at Leningrad in 1939 and 1940. World War II Soviet cruisers were refitted tsarist- era vessels, including the Krasni Kavkaz (formerly the Admiral Lazarov , built in 1916 at Kinoleav), the Profintern (formerly the Svetlana , built in 1915 at Reval [now Tallinn] and refitted in 1937), and the Chevonagy Ukraina (formerly the Admiral Nakhimov , built in 1915). The first Soviet attempt at cruiser construction was the Kirov class of 8,000 tons. Three ships were laid down in 1934-35 with Tosi engines manufac tured in Italy and built to Italian plans at Putilovets (the Kirov and Maxim Gorki ) and at Nikoleav (the Kulbyshev ) under the technical direction of Sansaldo, an Itali an firm. There were three groups of Soviet destroyers before World War II. First, fourteen tsarist vessels — four in the Petrovski class (built in 1917-18), nine in the Uritski class (built in 1914-15), and one ex- Novik (built in 1911). Second, some new classes of destroyers were built under the Soviets to Frenc h and Italian designs. Between 1935 and 1939, fifteen destroyers of 2,900 tons eac h, based on French drawings, were built as the Leningrad class: six in the Leningrad yards, eight on the Bla ck Sea, and one at Vladivostok. The first units, supervised by French engineers, were similar to French vessels. The third category encompassed the Stemitelnie class, the largest Soviet destroyer class of the 1930s. Between 1936 and 1939, thirty-f ive of these 1,800-ton ships were"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"built under Italian supervision, mainly in Leningra d and the Black Sea yards, utilizing an Italian Odero-Terni-Orlando design and British m achinery. Their engines were Tosi (Italy) 50,000-shaft-horsepower geared turbine s. In addition, the Tashkent , another Odero-Terni-Orlando design, was built in It aly — the only Soviet surface warship built abroad in the 1930s. In January 1939 the American firm of Gibbs and Cox, naval architects, designed two destroyers and a 45,000-ton battleship for the Sovi et Union in the United States. From 1939 to 1941 the Soviets received German milit ary assistance. The Nazis sent the partly finished cruiser Lutzow, laid down at Br emen in 1937, and in May 1941 \"construction of the cruiser 'L' in Leningrad was p roceeding according to plan.\" In the Leningrad yards German technicians took over constr uction and repair of Soviet ships. This cooperation lasted for eighteen months, from l ate 1939 until May 1941. All told, in 1941 the Soviet fleet comprised 3 batt leships, 8 cruisers, 85 destroyers and torpedo boats, 24 minelayers, 75 minesweepers, 300 motor torpedo boats and gunboats, and 250 submarines. Most were built in th e West or to Western designs. U.S. Lend-Lease added 491 ships to this total: 46 1 10-foot submarine chasers and 59 65-foot submarine chasers, 221 torpedo boats (24 of them from the United Kingdom), 77 minesweepers, 28 frigates, 52 small landing craf t, 2 large landing craft from the United Kingdom, and 6 cargo barges. In addition to combat vessels, Lend-Lease transferred merchant ships and marine engines. In terms of tonnage, Lend-Lease probably doubled th e size of the Soviet Navy. Only a small number of these naval ships have been returne d, although the Lend-Lease master agreement required the return of all vessels . Since World War II, assistance to the Soviet naval construction program has taken two forms: export of shipbuilding equipment and shi pyard cranes from European countries and the United States, and use of plans a nd designs obtained from the United States and NATO through espionage. For examp le, the sophisticated equipment of the U.S.S. Pueblo , transferred by the North Koreans to the USSR, was at least fifteen years ahead of anything the Soviet s had in the late 1960s. In other words, the Pueblo capture took the Soviets in one leap from postwar German and Lend-Lease technical developments to the most moder n of U.S. technology. Current Soviet acquisitions of naval equipment are highly significant and evidence of failure by the West to maintain a realistic defense posture. The Soviets have concentrated their acquisitions in areas related to aircraft carriers, deep sea diving capabilities, sensor systems for an tisub-marine warfare and navigation, and ship maintenance facilities. In the maintenance area, two huge floating drydocks purchased from Japan, supposedly for civilian use, have been diverted to military use. Drydocks are critical for both routine and fast repair of ships damaged in warfare. In 1978, when the Soviets took possession of one of the drydocks, they diverted it to the Pacific Naval Fle et. The other was sent to the Northern Fleet in 1981."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"These drydocks are so large that they can carry sev eral naval ships. More importantly, they are the only drydock facilities in either of t he two major Soviet fleet areas — Northern or Pacific — capable of servicing the new Kiev-class V/STOL aircraft carriers. Soviet advanced submarines carrying balli stic missiles, Soviet Kiev aircraft carriers, and Soviet destroyers were among the firs t ships repaired in these drydocks. The drydocks are so large that no Soviet shipyard i s capable of accommodating their construction without major facility modifications, associate capital expenditures, and interruption of present weapons programs. Their imp ortance will be even more pronounced when the Soviets construct the still lar ger carriers (for high-performance aircraft) projected for the 1990s. The Soviets have acquired Western aircraft carrier catapult equipment and documentation for this large r carrier; catapult technology, though relatively common in the West, is outside So viet experience and capabilities. In the 1980s, the USSR has contracted for or purcha sed foreign-built oceanographic survey ships equipped with some of the most modern Western-manufactured equipment. In place of U.S. equipment that was emba rgoed, other Western equipment has been installed on the ships. This modernization of the world's largest oceanographic fleet with Western technology will su pport the development of Soviet weapon systems programs and antisubmarine systems u sed against the West. Ship and submarine construction requires sheet stee l, steel plate, and steel sections. Armor-plate is produced by rolling high-alloy steel , which is then heat-treated to develop its ballistic properties. Multiple layers a re used for armor protection. Therefore, assistance to the Soviet iron and steel industry — which is significant and continuing — is also assistance to Soviet ship-cons truction programs. A U.S. government agency report has asserted that \" any shipyard capable of building a merchant ship hull is equally capable of building a combatant ship of the same length.\" The report also states that merchant ships can be designed for conversion into naval ships, and that in any event the facilities r equired to build a steel merchant ship are exactly the same as the facilities required to build a steel warship. The main differences are the armament and the varying specif ications for engines and other equipment. Almost 70 percent of the present Soviet merchant fleet has been built outside the Soviet Union. This has released Soviet shipyards and materials for Soviet naval construction. All diesel engines in Soviet sh ips use a technology originating outside the Soviet Union. The Soviets provided 80 percent of the supplies for the North during the war in Vietnam. Most of these supplies were transported by merchant ship. The ocean-going capacity required to supply the North Vietnamese on this scale and so keep them in the war was dependent upon ships previously built o utside the USSR. The same process can be identified in Central America and Af rica. While the supply of maritime technology has been formally forbidden by Congress, grossly inefficient administration of the export control laws has allow ed the Soviets to acquire a massive military transportation capacity. Origins of the Soviet Merchant Marine There are two extraordinary facts about the giganti c strategic Soviet merchant marine:"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"First: over two-thirds of its ship tonnage has been built outside the Soviet Union. The remaining one-third was built in Soviet yards and t o a great extent with shipbuilding equipment from the West, particularly Finland and N ATO allies, Great Britain and Germany. Second: four-fifths of the main marine diesel engin es used to propel the vessels of the Soviet merchant marine were actually built in the W est. In other words, only one-fifth of the main diesel engines were built in the USSR. Moreover, even this startling statistic does not reflect the full nature of Sovie t dependence on foreign marine diesel technology because all of the main engines manufactured in the USSR are bu ilt to foreign designs. The full scope of the dependence of Soviet marine-d iesel technology on foreign assistance is shown in Table 8-1. The manufacture of marine diesels in the Soviet Uni on has received considerable foreign technical assistance. Technical-assistance agreements were made with both M.A.N. and Sulzer in the 1920s, and the Soviet Unio n has continued since that time to receive M.A.N. (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg) and Sulzer technology, in addition to assistance agreements with Burmeister & Wain of Denmark and Skoda of Czechoslovakia. An important basic agreement was signed in early 19 59 in Copenhagen by Niels Munck, managing director of Burmeister & Wain. The Danish company also has a licensing agreement with the Polish engine manufact urers Stocznia Gdanska, and most of that organization's annual production of B & W designs goes to the Soviet Union. All modern large diesels of more than 11,000 horsep ower used in the Soviet Union are built to a single foreign design — Burmeister & Wain of Copenhagen, Denmark. Denmark is a NATO ally of the United States. The ex port of this Danish technology could have been stopped by the State Department und er the Battle Act and CoCom arrangement. All Burmeister & Wain diesels are desi gned with U.S. computers. Burmeister & Wain engines propelled the Soviet ship s that were active in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the supply of North Vietnam and Central America today. The State Department could also have intervened ind irectly to restrict export of military technology by Eastern European Communist g overnments — for example, Skoda armaments — to the USSR and this was the very claim made by State to Congress in order to bring detente. In 1966 Dean Ru sk submitted legislation to Congress for \"most favored nation\" treatment for Ea st European Communist countries. This would, said Dean Rusk, \"give the United States an important political tool in Eastern Europe.\" But East European Communist countr ies went right on providing technical assistance for the Soviets, and the State Department maintained a steadfast blind eye to the military end-uses of this technica l assistance to the Soviet Union. Indeed, State even approved an important technical- assistance agreement made by Simmons, an American firm, with Skoda.

Illegal Actions by State Department When we look closely at the transportation technolo gy used to support the most dangerous international crises of the 60s, 70s and 80s, we find that the U.S. State Department not only had the knowledge and the capab ility to stop the technological transfers which generated the vehicles used, but wa s required by law to ensure that the technology was not passed to the Soviets. In other words, there would have been no Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, no supply of the Viet namese War and no wars of liberation in Africa and Central America if State D epartment had followed Congressional instructions and carried out the job it is paid to do. The Poltava class of Soviet merchant vessels, equipped with sp ecial hatches, was used to carry missiles to Cuba in 1962, it was used to supply the Vietnamese War, it is used today to support \"wars of liberation\" in Afric a and Central America. The main engines for the first two vessels in this class wer e manufactured by Burmeister & Wain in Copenhagen. Engines for the other ships in the class came from the Bryansk plant in the Soviet Union. The Danish and the Bryan sk engines are built to the same specification: 740-millimeter cylinder diameter and 1,600-millimeter piston stroke. The Danish engines have six cylinders while the Sov iet engines have seven cylinders; in all other respects they are identical Burmeister & Wain-design engines. In 1959 the Danish company made a technical-assistance agreemen t with the Soviets for manufacture of large marine diesels, not manufactured in the USSR at that time , and the U.S. State Department, through CoCom, appro ved the export of this technology as nonstrategic. Any member of CoCom has veto power. Objection by State Department representatives would have effecti vely blocked the agreement. The Poltava -class ships were used to carry Soviet missiles to Cuba in 1962. The first Poltava engines were manufactured in Denmark in 1959 and th e ships entered service in 1962, only a few months before they were used to transport missiles to Cuba. In other words, the first operational use of these die sel engines — approved by State as nonstrategic — was in a challenge to the United Sta tes which brought us to the brink of nuclear war. The Poitava -class ships have extra long hatches: eight of 13.6 meters length and 6.2 meters width, ideal for loading medium-range missil es. After near nuclear conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union the Soviets removed their missiles —"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"as deck cargo on other merchant ships. The Labinsk was one of the ships used. The Labinsk is a 9,820-ton freighter built in 1960 in Poland on Soviet account and has Italian engines, made by Fiat in Italy (8,000 bhp, eight cylinders, 750-mm. cylinder diameter, 1,3200-mm. piston stroke). This is the sa me Fiat Company that later in the 60s and 70s provided technical assistance for the l argest automobile plant in the USSR. In 1967, while the Johnson Administration was campa igning for yet more \"peaceful trade\" with the Soviet Union, Soviet ships previous ly supplied by our allies as \"peaceful trade\" were carrying weapons to Haiphong to kill Americans (see Table 8- 2). In addition to the ships listed in Table 8-2, the K uibyshev, a 6,000-ton freighter built in the United States, the Sovetsk, built in Poland with Swiss engines, and the Ustilug, a 4,400-ton freighter with West German M.A.N. engin es, have also been identified. As Table 8-3 shows, if the State Department had don e an effective job according to the laws passed by Congress, thirty-seven of the ni nety-six ships would not have been in Soviet hands — and would not have been able to t ake weapons and supplies to Haiphong.

It was anticipated that because of NATO limitations on the speed of me rchant ships supplied to the USSR (reflected in the export control laws) that th e average speed of NATO-supplied ships would be considerably less than ships supplied either by Eastern European countries to the USSR or built within the USSR itse lf. The results of an analysis of forty-two Soviet ships on the Haiphong supply are a s follows: Merchant ships with engines manufactured in the Fre e World, average speed 14.62 knots. Merchant ships with engines manufactured in Eastern Europe, average speed 13.25 knots. Merchant ships with engines manufactured in Soviet Union, average speed 12.23 knots."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"(All forty-two ships were built after I951, the yea r the Battle Act was implemented.) The most obvious point to be made is that the avera ge speed of Western-supplied ships used by the Soviets on the Haiphong run was 2 .4 knots (i.e., about 20 percent) above that of Soviet domestic-built ships on the ru n. This includes only those ships built after 1951 (i.e., after implementation of the Battle Act and its limitation of speed and tonnage on ships supplied to the USSR). The illegal administration of the Battle Act by Sta te Department also applies to weight limitations — the faster, larger Soviet ships are from the West and the slower, smaller ships are from domestic Soviet shipyards. Under the CoCom machinery each nation participating in the embargo of strategic materials submits its own views on the shipment of specific items. There is also a unanimity rule. In other words, no item may be ship ped to the USSR unless all participating nations agree. Objections by any nati on halt shipment. Douglas Dillon, former Under Secretary of State, has pointed out, \" I can recall no instance in which a country shipped a strategic item to the Soviet bloc against the disapproving vote of a participating member of CoCom.\" It must therefore be presumed that the United State s delegates approved the export of ships of high average speed, as well as marine dies el engines and the Burmeister &'Wain technical-assistance agreement of 1959 for S oviet manufacturers of marine diesels, all of which were later used against the U nited States by the Soviets in supplying North Vietnam, and adventures in Africa a nd Central America. It is clear from this evidence alone that successiv e administrations have been long on words but short on action to stop the Soviets from carrying out world ambitions. Further, successive administrations have committed American soldiers to foreign wars without the resolve to win and obviously in the kno wledge that American technical assistance was being provided to both sides in thes e wars. Under CoCom arrangements in the Battle Act, the Sta te Department can enter an objection to CoCom concerning any technological exp orts to the Soviet Union. No CoCom member can make such exports over the objecti on of any other member of CoCom. In other words, if the State Department had wanted to implement the intent of Congress, it had the ability to stop the transfe r of marine engines and marine engine technology to the USSR. It did not do so. Even further, other Soviet ships have marine diesel s originating in Czechoslovakia (Skoda), Hungary (Lang), and East Germany (Gorlitze r), countries for which State has demanded most favored nation status and trade a s a \"political weapon.\" If there is indeed a polycentralist trend, then why was the Sta te Department unable to stop · the flow of military technology to the Soviet Union? It had the political weapon (trade) it asked for to do the job. In brief: State Department had the means to stop th e transfer of marine-diesel technology. The department was required to do so un der the law. It did not do so. The blame in this tragic case is squarely at the door o f the State Department."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"We can derive two conclusions: 1. The Soviet Union could not have supplied wars of liberation without assistance from the United States and its Western allies. This assistance takes the form of technology transferred through the vehicle of trade . 2. The State Department had the absolute means to s top this transfer through its veto power in CoCom. It did not do so. The position is more serious than even these conclu sions would suggest, because the State Department has excellent — and expensive —int elligence facilities. The department was therefore aware of item (1) above. I t is also aware of its powers in CoCom. Yet a departmental spokesman went before Con gress to make the following statement: If there were no trade at all between West and East , the Soviet Union would still be perfectly competent to supply North Vietnam with it s requirements, many times over. I think the proposition that our restrictions or an y restrictions on trade with Eastern Europe can defer or affect in any significant way t he ability to supply North Vietnam is simply wrong. This bland assertion, without evidence, of course, was made to the Senate by Philip H. Trezise, former Assistant Secretary for Economic Af fairs in the department. Trezise has been described by Senator Mon-dale as \"one of t he most remarkable men that this Committee could hear from.\" That is certainly an ac curate statement. Unfortunately, Trezise has all the qualities of a deaf mute blindm an. The Deaf Mute Blindmen Forge Ahead These facts and conclusions were evident by the ear ly 1970s: the Soviets were using Western transportation technology against the West. Yet in 1973 the State Department under President Ni xon and National Security adviser Henry Kissinger negotiated a major agreemen t to transfer even more transportation technology to the Soviet Union. This agreement was signed by President Nixon on June 19, 1973 and went far beyon d maritime technology. The maritime component was as follows: Article 2 \"Marine transport, including technology of maritime shipping and cargo handling in seaports.\" This is, of course, the precise technology to suppl y for assisting Soviet wars of liberation.

When this \"aid and comfort\" is consider ed in the light of suppression of the facts, coupled with harassment of individuals a ttempting to bring these facts home to the American public, there is clearly a case for in-depth investigation of the motivation of top officials in the Nixon Administra tion, up to and including Mr. Nixon himself. Submarine and Anti-Submarine Warfare There is a long history of Western assistance to So viet submarine construction and anti-submarine warfare efforts. Extensive tsarist submarine work was adapted by the Soviets at the end of the 1920s and a few tsarist-model submarines were still opera ting in World War II. Soviet domestic construction began in 1928 with the L and M classes. The L-class was based on the British L-55 , which sank off Kronstadt and was raised by the Soviets; twenty-three of the L-class and one L-Spec ial were built to this model by 1938. The M-class, a small 200-ton coastal submarin e of limited performance, was made possible only by the introduction of electric welding under the terms of a General Electric technical-assistance contract. All subsequent Soviet submarine development has bee n heavily influenced by German U-boat designs and more recently by U.S. des igns. In 1926 a German naval mission under Admiral Spindler visited the USSR and provided the plans of the most successful German submarines, details of operationa l experience, and the services of German submarine experts. The Russians obtained set s of U-boat plans, the most important of which were those of the B-III type, on e of the most successful designs for a conventional submarine ever produced. As the type-VII, the B-Ill was the backbone of the German U-boat fleet in World War II . A variant of the design was built in Russia — first known as the N-class — nicknamed Nemka (\"German girl\") — and later as the S-class. The Chuka -class was based on German B-III plans; S-class (enlarged Chuka ) is the German type VII U- boat. Italian influence came in two submarine classes. Ei ght vessels in the Garibaldi -class were of Adriatico design and seventeen Pravda- class submarines were a development from the Garibaldi. Two submarines were bought from Vickers-Armstrong i n the United Kingdom in 1936, and the Soviet V-class comp rised Vickers-Armstrong submarines built in the United Kingdom in 1944 and transferred to the USSR under Lend-Lease. The United States sold submarine equipment to the S oviet Union in the first five or six years of the 1930s. A proposal was received by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut, in January 1930 for the constr uction of submarines and submarine ordnance equipment for shipment to the US SR. In a letter to the Secretary of State, Electric Boat argued that there was \"no o bjection\" to the construction of submarines for such \"friendly foreign powers,\" and further said that this was in the interest of the Navy, as it kept domestic shipbuild ers at work. The State Department,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"though admitting there was no legal restriction on shipments of munitions to the Soviet Union, said it viewed \"with disfavor\" the co nstruction of periscopes, submarines, and ordnance equipment for shipment to the Russians. Sample Page From Transportation Agreement Signed by President Nixon with the Soviet Union June 19, 1973 [English Version] There was also a flow of American technology under the Sperry Gyroscope technical- assistance contract for marine instruments, and man y Soviet engineers were trained by the company in the United States, although attempts in 1937-38 to buy fire-control equipment were thwarted by Navy Department officers . By 1937 Electric Boat was negotiating with the Soviets for construction of su bmarines, this time with the blessing of the State Department. The massive postwar expansion of the Soviet submari ne fleet has depended upon the designs and technical and construction resources of Germany and the United States. After World War II the Soviets carefully studied Ge rman submarines and operational techniques. Using equipment and material received u nder Lend-Lease, and transferring complete shipyards and great quantitie s of submarine-building equipment from Germany, a large submarine construction progra m was undertaken — a program still in progress in 1986. In 1972 the Soviet W-class attack submarine account ed for about half of the Soviet submarine fleet. The W-class is a direct copy of th e successful German type-XXI U- boat. The vessel has a 1,621-ton displacement and i s capable of traveling 11,000 miles without refueling. Although the Germans built 120 t ype-XXI boats by early 1945, few went to sea. Almost all of these completed submarin es fell into Soviet hands. Thus a substantial portion, perhaps one-quarter, of the So viet submarine force was built in Germany to German construction standards. A modific ation of type-XXI became the Soviet Z-class, slightly larger, with greater range . The most modern Soviet diesel- powered submarine, the F-class, was also developed from these advanced German designs. Early Soviet nuclear-powered submarines are similar to the U.S.S. Nautilus in configuration. The Soviet Y (\"Yankee\")-class is cop ied from the U.S.S. Polaris ballistic missile submarine, with plans obtained th rough the massive Soviet espionage program in Great Britain. Submersibles for deep-sea work have been purchased in the West, the most recent sale being the Hyco Pisces-IV sold in 1972. Missile-carrying submarines are fitt ed with GOLEM-class missiles. GOLEM I and GOLEM II are direct descendents of the German V-2, while GOLEM III is a two-stage solid-fu el equivalent of the Lockheed Polaris. In anti-submarine warfare — an obvious priority for the Soviets — we find repeated efforts to obtain Western advanced anti-submarine t echnology, especially sensor"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"technology, focusing on signal processing. This hig hlights the calculated planned nature of Soviet technology acquisition and the wea k Western response. Soviet military technology acquisition is focused u pon 14 key technology clusters. These target groups are of fundamental importance t o development of weapons systems. By concentrating on these fourteen groups, the Soviets try to acquire the broadest possible military advantages while simulta neously improving their own shortcomings. One of these 14 groups includes sensor technology, comprising radar devices, array processors, infrared technology and signal processi ng. An example from one of these groups illustrates activity by U.S. firms which app roaches treason. Array processors assist a computer in processing an d analyzing digital signals. This can be used to identify minute differences in sound s under the ocean, a means of locating enemy submarines. Obviously, if the Soviet s have this technology, they can track U.S. Navy submarines. In 1979 Geo Space Corporation of Houston, Texas sol d 36 array processors to the Soviet Union. Soviet Navy personnel were trained in the Geo Space plant in Houston. Soviet personnel carried the Geo Space units aboard Soviet submarines and installed the units with the shipboard computers. This activi ty surely fits the definition of \"aid and comfort\" to enemies of the U.S. Yet Department of Commerce merely fined Geo Space $36,000 and suspended its export privileges. When we compare the activity of Departments of Stat e and Commerce in administering the Export Control and Battle Act law s we find extreme weakness, amounting in many cases to ignoring the will of Con gress in favor of the Soviets. Yet we also find another phenomenon, explored below . The Soviet Union as a Source of Information In practice the Soviet Union is a more prolific sou rce of hard information on some technology transfers — information that can be blen ded with declassified U.S. files, and Congressional reports. The availability of data on the origin of the main engines of Soviet ships used on the Haiphong supply run and in the Cuban Missile Crisis is a prime example of the Soviet Union publishing detailed information not available from U.S. government sources and directly conflicting with official statements m ade by U.S. government officials. This case of the origin of Soviet vessels, for whic h ample and accurate hard data are available, is worth exploring. For most of the peri od since 1949, the Battle Act and the Export Control Act have supposedly prohibited the export of transportation technology for military purposes. However, the specific case-by-case determinations m ade by State, Commerce, and CoCom within the framework of these laws are classi fied. It is not possible to obtain"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"free access to the relevant decision papers to exam ine the manner in which the intent of Congress has been administered. We do know, howe ver, that any member of the CoCom (Coordinating Committee, the operating arm of the Consultative Group established by NATO and Japan in 1950 to coordinate the export controls of the major industrial nations) group of nations has veto power and that no shipment has ever been made to the Soviet Union without the unanimous approval of all members. Thus, the transfer of Danish marine technology in 1959 ha d implicit or explicit U.S. State Department approval. Some years ago research strongly suggested that the Soviets had no indigenous military transport technology: neither motor vehicl es nor marine diesel engines. Yet about 80 percent of the weapons and supplies for th e North Vietnamese were transported by some means from the Soviet Union. Th e greater part of these Soviet weapons went to Vietnam by Soviet freighter and the n along the Ho Chi Minh trail on Soviet-built trucks. By using data of Russian origin it is possible to m ake an accurate analysis of the origins of this equipment. It was found that all th e main diesel and steam-turbine propulsion systems of the ninety-six Soviet ships o n the Haiphong supply run that could be identified (i.e., eighty-four out of the n inety-six) originated in design or construction outside the USSR. We can conclude, the refore, that if the State and Commerce Departments, in the 1950s and 1960s, had c onsistently enforced the legislation passed by Congress in 1949, the Soviets would not have had the ability to supply the Vietnamese War — and 50,000 more America ns and countless Vietnamese would be alive today. The names of the ninety-six S oviet ships used on the Haiphong run were gleaned from Morskoi Flot and similar Russian maritime publications.

It merits a serious American response.\" — Wall Street Journal, December 29, 1980 Siberia is a vast store house of oil and gas reserv es. In the 1970s the Soviets brought off an almost unbelievable deal to develop these re serves. A known Soviet objective in economic warfare is to make Western Europe dependent on the Soviet Union. Such dependence will severely reduce European options in case of war with the Soviet Union. The Soviets designed a massive pipeline project large enough to change the entire Siberian infrastructure to channel these Siberian natural gas reserves to gas deficient Europe, thus making E urope dependent on a vital energy resource. At the same time the Soviets convinced th e Western deaf mute blindmen to finance this $22 billion deal and so finance their own destruction — just as Lenin predicted. The Siberian gas deal, known as \"Russia No. 6\" to t he financing bankers, is a 2,800 miles gas export pipeline from the Urengoy gas fiel d in Siberia to Uzhgorod on the Czech-Soviet border, where it feeds into the West E uropean gas pipeline network. Daily throughput is 2.8 billion cubic feet. Initially, even the U.S. State Department (October 1982) objected to the deal on the following grounds: • Russia No. 6 would make Europe 20%-30% dependent on Russian gas, thus crossing \"the threshold of prudent dependence on th e USSR,\" • the financing offered by Western bankers \"amounts to a subsidy of Soviet economic development,\" • resulting hard currency earnings from sale of the gas will \"have a strategic impact by allowing the USSR to continue to import Western goo ds and high technology equipment, alleviating serious domestic resource co nstraints.\" 28 In the late summer of 1981, the Soviet Union contra cted with U.S., French, West German, and Italian engineering firms for equipment for the Siberian pipeline. The Soviets required each European country to make avai lable substantial export financing to be eligible for pipeline contracts. Fi nancing offers by the European"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"export credit agencies were for subsidized interest rates, in most cases under 8%, at a time when interest rates ranged from 11% to more th an 20%. Using credit, the Soviets purchased power turbines, gas compressors, and moni toring, firefighting, and control equipment. Large diameter pipe was purchased and fi nanced as part of bulk orders of Western steel pipe regularly imported by the Soviet s. In late 1981 and early 1982, long-term gas supply c ontracts based on the new pipeline were signed between the Soviet Union and gas distri bution companies in West Germany, France, Austria, Switzerland, and later It aly. The new contracts significantly increased West European dependence on the Soviet Union for natural gas, in some cases pushing it above 30% (see Table 9-1). Such a level of dependence on Siberian gas is unwise because: • gas is a fuel particularly hard to replace at sho rt notice because of the way it is transported and stored; • gas is used in the politically sensitive resident ial and commercial sectors of Europe. By the end of the present decade and after equipmen t credits are paid off, expanded gas exports will earn the USSR $8-$10 billion annua lly in hard currency. This will be a most important source of hard currency for the So viets, offsetting an expected decline in crude oil export earnings.

Some of the most famous multinational corporations are sufficiently amoral to accept military contracts from both sides. This is not a new story. It occurs time and again in the history of the past century, but rarely has it been possible to identif y the double-dealing while in progress. While financing highly strategic projects for the S oviets, these multinationals are selling weapons and supplies to Western governments . An obvious deduction is that these corporations have little incentive to reduce world tension. They maximize profit by keeping both sides in a state of near conflict. As Charles Levinson, author of The Vodka Cola Pipel ine, phrases it: 29 Western workers must now be asking themselves [some ] questions: why should they, through their taxes, bail out the banks who lent mo ney to the enemy? Who gave Deutsche Bank permission to lend cheap money to Leo nid Brezhnev, freeing him to divert domestic resources to the huge standing Sovi et Army, Eastern Europe's \"enforcer.\" Under what authority do Exxon and Shell , working through layers of overseas subsidiaries and holding companies, push t o increase Western European dependence on Soviet energy sources? Despite the power of the interests at work, the sys tem is not yet concretised and may yet be reversible. But far more public examination and debate is needed. And as time goes on, the ability of the power elites to keep do wn protest on both sides grows greater. Recent experience cannot be allowed to bec ome a precedent: we cannot accept that human rights are worth less than a pipe line. The Reagan Administration Marshmallow Approach The initial public reaction of the Reagan Administr ation to Russia No. 6 was realistic enough. State Department issued a two page summary listing the dangers to world stability and Western freedom. Part of this report is reproduced on the first page of this chapter. Then came months of heated debate within the Admini stration and heavy outside pressure from the deaf mute blindmen on the Reagan Administration and Congress. In general, conservative members of the Administration and Department of Defense made strong arguments against U.S. technology or ex ports for the Russia No. 6 project. In particular, Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger and DoD Assistant Secretary of International Security Richard Perle m ade strong public arguments urging a widespread clampdown on U.S. subsidy of So viet economic development. They argued correctly that we compounded our own de fense problems with these projects. On the other hand, leftovers from the Henry Kissing er-Richard Nixon detente school won the day.

In brief, Russia No. 6 demonstrates the ongoing pol itical power of the deaf mute blindmen, in this case that group centered on David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan. The U.S., even after six decades of subsidy of the Soviet economy and with a defense budget approaching $300 billion annually, was press ured into a project that gave the Soviets hard currency earnings, subsidised credit, and our finest technology —at U.S. taxpayers' expense.

Explosives require chemical technology and, for example, under wartime circumstances fertilizer plants can be quickly converted to manufacture of e xplosives. Many nerve gases require chemical technologies similar to those used for production of agricultural insecticides. This interrelationship between chemic al technology and warfare is well known in Washington, yet the Soviets have tradition ally been allowed access to the latest of Western chemical technology under so-call ed cooperation agreements, through \"turn-key\" plants which have been used for military end uses. A Central Intelligence Agency assessment report 30 made in the late 1970s concluded that the \"USSR is highly dependent on Western chemi cal technology.\" At that time the CIA estimated that Western equipped plants acco unted for the following proportions of Soviet chemical production: 40 percent of complex fertilizers 60 percent of polyethylene 75-80 percent of polyester fiber 85 percent of ammonia production The CIA report did not, however, report on another critical fact: that Soviet plants producing these and other chemicals use almost enti rely technology copied or reverse engineered from Western equipment. There is no indi genous Soviet chemical technology. State Department Concurs in Explosives Manufacture Import of U.S. chemical technology for military pur poses goes back to the 1920s and has always received State Department support. A 1929 agreement stipulated that the Soviets could use Du Pont processes for the oxidation of ammonia to manufacture 50-65 percent n itric acid. Du Pont agreed \"to place at the disposal of Chemstroi sufficient data, information and facts with respect to the design, construction and operation of such p lants as will enable Chemstroi to design, construct and operate ammonia oxidation pla nts.\""},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Later in 1932, negotiations were concluded between Du Pont and the Soviets for construction of a gigantic nitric acid plant with a capacity of 1,000 tons per day. This approximates 350,000 tons annually. Twenty-five yea rs later, in 1957, the largest Du Pont-process nitric acid plant in the United States , at Hopewell, had an annual capacity of 425,000 tons. Under the 1929 earlier co ntract, Du Pont also supplied technical assistance to the USSR for a period of fi ve years. The firm inquired of the State Department whether this plant of \"excessively large capacity\" would meet with objections from the U.S. government: \"While we have no knowledge of the purpose of the proposed plant, yet the excessively large ca pacity contemplated leads us to believe that the purpose may be a military one.\" 31 The State Department position is summarized in a me morandum of April 6, 1932, which reviewed export of military materials to the Soviet Union and concluded that the department would have no objection to construct ion of such a large nitric acid plant. 32 The Soviets bought from Du Pont its ammonia oxidati on and nitric acid technologies. Du Pont had expended over $27 million developing th ese processes. In requesting advice from the State Department, Du Pont argued th at the process was neither secret nor covered by patents, that the end-use of nitric acid is the manufacture of fertilizer, that if Du Pont did not supply the process, it coul d be bought elsewhere, and that several plants had already been erected in the USSR by Casale and Nitrogen Engineering of New York. The letter from Du Pont to Henry L. Stimson of the State Department with reference to the proposed contract (dated April 20, 1929) sta tes in part, \"It is true of course that nitric acid is used in the manufacture of munitions .\" Du Pont then claimed, \"It is impossible to distinguish between chemicals used fo r strictly commercial purposes and chemicals used for strictly munitions purposes. \" And as justification for its proposal, the firm said, \"We submit that the contem plated contract will in no way give assistance for the manufacture of munitions which c annot easily be acquired elsewhere by the Soviets.\" Further, the company argued, there was nothing excl usive about the Du Pont process. The copy of the agreement in the State Department f iles indicates that the Soviet union [wishes] to use in Russia the Du Pont process for t he oxidation of ammonia and [Du Pont] to place at its disposal sufficient data with respect to the design, construction and general information as to permit the satisfacto ry operation of such plants... the Company shall serve the Russian Corporation in an a dvisory capacity and furnish upon request services of engineers and chemists so as to accomplish the purpose of the contract. By the late 1930s a Nitrogen Engineering-designed c omplex at Berezniki employed 25,000 workers and manufactured thermite, powder, a nd nitroglycerin. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the Soviets lagged in all areas of chemical production outside the basic chemical technology absorbed in t he 1930s and 1940s. This lag had major military implications and since 1958 has insp ired a massive purchasing"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"campagin in the West. In the three years 1959-61 al one, the Soviet Union purchased at least fifty complete chemical plants or equipmen t for such plants from non-Soviet sources. The American trade journal Chemical Week commented, with perhaps more accuracy than it realized, that the Soviet Union \"b ehaves as if it had no chemical industry at all.\" Not only was Soviet industry prod ucing little beyond basic heavy chemicals, but of greater consequence, it did not h ave the technical means of achieving substantial technical modernization and e xpansion in a product range essential for a modern military state. Western firms supplied designs and specifications, process technology, engineering capability, equipment, and startup and training pro grams. These contracts were package deals that provided more than the typical W estern \"turn-key\" contract. Such contracts are unusual in the West (except perhaps i n underdeveloped areas lacking elementary skills and facilities) but were very att ractive and highly profitable to Western firms. Many of the chemical plants built in the 1960 and 1 970s programs had direct military applications. In 1964 a British company — Power Gas Corporation, Ltd. — built a $14 million plant for the manufacture of acetic aci d in the USSR. In 1973 Lurnmus Engineering built another vast acetic acid plant wi th Monsanto technology and U.S. Export-Import bank loans. Hygrotherm Engineering, Ltd. of London contracted t o supply an automatic heating and cooling plant (with heat generators, circulatin g pumps, and control equipment) and other equipment for use in the manufacture of s ynthetic resisn. A plant was supplied for the production of synthetic glycerin, which is used in explosives manufacture. Other plants were for the production o f ethyl urea, synthetic fatty acids, sodium tripolyphosphate, carbon black, and germaniu m. All these products have military end-uses. Sulfuric acid, the most important of inorganic acid s and industrial chemicals, is required in large quantities for explosives manufac ture. Production of sulfuric acid in Russia increased from 121,000 tons in 1913 to just under 3,000,000 tons in 1953, 4,804,000 tons in 1958, and 8,518,000 tons in 1965. The Soviets have always utilized basic Western proc esses for the manufacture of their supply of sulfuric acid and have reverse engineered the equipment in their own machine-building plants. A recent Russian paper on sulfuric-acid manufacture indicates that in the mid-1960s, 63 percent of sulf uric-acid production was carried out according to a standardized version of one Western process. The remainder was produced by a \"Soviet process\" (utilizing fluidized bed roaster, electric precipator, towers, and contact apparatus) similar to the conta ct processes in use in the West. In 1965 Nordac, Ltd. of the United Kingdom sold a sulf uric-acid concentration plant with a capacity of 24 tons per day of 78 percent su lfuric acid to update Soviet sulfuric acid technology. Up to 1960 Russian output of fertilizers was mostly in the form of low-quality straight fertilizers. There was no production of the concent rated and mixed fertilizers that are used in the West.

Congressman Lipscomb protested the issue of a license for this sale (Congressional Record, Aug. 28, 1963).

H ockersmith, of the Office of Export Control in the Department of Commerce, repli ed, \"Our decision to license was heavily weighed by the fact that potassium fertiliz er can best be characterized as 'peaceful goods'\" (Aug. 21, 1963). Hockersmith did not, of course, deny that potash had an explosives end-use. A cluster of ten gigantic fertilizer plants for the Soviets was arranged by the Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Armand Hammer's c ompany) and built by Woodall-Duckham Construction Company, Ltd., and New ton Chambers & Company, Ltd., of the United Kingdom. Other fertilizer plant s were built by Mitsui of Japan and Montecatini of Italy. Ammonium nitrate, an ingredie nt in fertilizer manufacture, also has an alternate use in explosives manufacture. It is used, for example, in 60/40 Amatol in the explosive warheads of the T-7A rocket s. Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum is, of course , Moscow's favored deaf mute capitalist, possibly vying with David Rockefeller f or the honor. However, Armand has a personal relationship with the Soviets that could never be achieved by anyone with David's Ivy League background. One fact never repor ted in U.S. newspaper biographies of Armand Hammer is that his father, Ju lius Hammer, was founder and early financier of the Communist Party USA in 1919. Elsewhere this author has reprinted documents backing this statement, and tra nslations of letters from Lenin to Armand Hammer with the salutation \"Dear Comrade.\" That Armand Hammer and Occidental Petroleum would s upply the Soviets with massive plants that can quickly be converted to exp losives manufacture is no surprise. What is a surprise is that Armand Hammer has had fr ee access to every President from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan — and e qual access to the leaders in the Kremlin. 33 The DMB and Nerve Gas Technology Chemical weapons are poisonous gases used to kill o r incapacitate with toxic fumes either through the respiratory system or the skin. These gases are deadly in extremely small amounts, only one milligram of Sarin can be lethal. Their action is to inhibit the enzyme ac tion and inhibit normal body functions. They are extremely effective, causing de ath within minutes or more painfully over several hours. The most potent — supertoxic lethal — chemicals are nerve gases first developed just before World War II, never used in warfare and now stockpiled by the United States, the Soviet Union and France. These chemical agents were derived from research in insecticides. The major nerve gases are the G agents, Sarin (GB), Soman, Tabun, and the V agents such as VX. The original agent, Tabun, was discover ed in Germany in 1936 in the"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"process of work on organophosphorus insecticides. N ext came Sarin and Soman and finally the most toxic, VS, a product of commercial insecticide laboratories. The Soviet Union produced chemical weapons during t he 1920s by cooperating with Germany. During World War II the Soviet Union produ ced considerable amounts of chemical weapons. Soviet stocks were not destroyed after the war and Soviet production continues. According to the U.S. represe ntative at the United Nations in 1981, the Soviet Union maintained and operated at l east 14 chemical weapons production facilities. Soviet chemical weapons prod uction takes place in sealed-off sections of \"civilian\" chemical complexes, most bui lt by Western companies. Soviet stocks consist of the nerve gas Soman, a mus tard gas, hydrogen cyanide, and other chemical agents from World War II, e.g., phos gene, adamsite and tabun. Estimates of the total stockpile vary from about th e same amount as U.S. chemical agents to three times greater. There is no distinction therefore between commercia l chemicals such as fertilizers and chemicals used for war. In fact, a fertilizer indus try can, with little trouble, be converted into an explosive industry and insecticid es are the basis for chemical weapons including nerve gases. There are other direct links between the nerve gase s and commercial production. The very close chemical and toxicological similarity of organophosphorus pesticides to the nerve agents has made commercial pesticides itself a major field of investigation regarding chemical weapons. The best known example has been Agent Orange, a mix ture of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, used in Vietnam. In the process of manuf acturing trichlorophenol, an intermediate of 2,4,5-T, the highly toxic dioxin (T CDD) is produced in a side reaction. Dioxin is the same deadly chemical responsible for the disastrous accident at Seveso, Italy, where trichlorophenol was also manufactured as a feedstock. While the nerve gases are the most lethal and dange rous chemical warfare agents, other lethal chemicals also exist, including those which caused the 1.3 million casualties of gas warfare during World War I. The m ajor gases used were chlorine, phosgene and sulphur mustard. Other chemicals such as hydrogen cyanide and cyanogen chloride, which also have high toxicity le vels, proved to be too uncontrollable for efficient use during the first w ar. These chemicals attack the lungs or the blood cells. They can cause permanent health damage, but to induce death must be deployed in much larger doses than the nerve age nts. With the exception of mustard gas these are deceptive \"dual purpose agent s,\" widely used in industry for peaceful purposes, but capable of becoming weapons. Widespread use in the civilian chemical industry means that they are perhaps the m ost readily available chemical warfare agents for a country seeking a quick chemic al arms stockpile. Phosgene (Carbonyl Chloride, COCL2) is the most obvious exam ple. 50,000 tons of this highly toxic chemical were used for weapons du ring World War I. Today millions of tons are produced for dyestuffs and polyurethane building materials. Hydrogen cyanide (Hydrocyanic acid, HCN) is used for chemical fibers and produced in large amounts."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Unbelievably, Western companies have supplied not o nly \"turn-key\" plants, but the latest in information under long-term agreements.

Possibly the reported export of ballbearing machines to Russia t o produce bearings for Soviet missiles may leave some readers with an uneasy feel ing, but also with a vague need to come to grips more concretely with the alliance. In Angola the most skeptical reader can see the alliance working on a daily basis. Angola, a one time Portuguese colony, was \"liberate d\" ten years ago by the MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola), a Marxist organization in alliance with Angolian nationalist groups. The MPLA was not elected and has never held elections. MPLA seized power and has been kept in p ower by 36,000 Cubans and about 1,200 Soviet military personnel. The Cubans a nd the Soviets are in Angola for the same reason Angolan Marxists will not allow fre e elections: because Marxism does not represent the people of Angola. The United States has been inhibited from encouragi ng democratic, freely-elected forces by groups within the U.S. State Department a nd the so-called Clark Amendment (repealed in 1985), sponsored by former S enator Clark, which forbade the U.S. from assisting any group that might challe nge the Angolan Marxists. Yet the Soviets in Angola are challenged as they ha ve never been challenged before; for the first time in 60 years a Marxist regime is in danger of overthrow by internal democratic forces. Angolan guerrillas, known as UNI TA (National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola) have taken over one-thi rd of Angola, about 250,000 square miles, and control most of the countryside, particularly in the south. UNITA is an unusual organization. It is not America n-backed. In fact, it is American corporations and the U.S. State Department that hav e stopped a UNITA victory. UNITA is unusual also in that it believes in free e nterprise, free and secret elections, private property, and decentralization of political power. UNITA is led by Jonas Savimbi, aged 51, a ferocious-looking gentleman rem iniscent of television's \"Mr. T.\" Savimbi is a European educated black intellectual w ho believes in individual freedom."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Against Savimbi and UNITA we find the Soviet Union, Cuban forces, the U.S. State Department, American multinationals, and until rece ntly, the U.S. Congress. Some years ago the Senate passed the Clark Amendment, sp onsored by Senator Clark, which in effect prevented U.S. aid to this torch of freedom in southern Africa. The muddled, confused thinking of the United States is well illustrated by a statement made by former U.S. Ambassador to United Nations Do nald McHenry, to the effect that the U.S. should not be surprised that the Sovi ets are aiding Angolan Marxists: \"That the Soviets are present to assist the Angolan s and to assist the Namibians... is no different from the presence of the United States in El Salvador and U.S. assistance to E1 Salvador.\" The point, of course, that McHenry avoids is that t he Soviet objective, more than clearly demonstrated in the past 60 years, is a tot alitarian controlled society without individual freedom. The Soviets have indeed assisted Marxist Angola. As far back as 1981 Soviet military officers up to the rank of Colonel were killed and captured in Angola. Soviet Air Force personnel have been captured in Angola (see N ow , January 16, 1981.) The real oddity in Angola is that the single most i mportant factor preventing a free open society is an American multinational corporati on. As succinctly stated by Congressman William L. Dickinson (July 1985), \"Thes e Cuban troops are protecting American oil interests and they are preventing UNIT A from overrunning the MPLA.\" In northeast Angola is the Cabinda oil complex owne d by Gulf Oil Corporation (since March 1984, part of Chevron Oil of California). CAB INDA PROVIDES AT LEAST 80 PERCENT OF MARXIST ANGOLA'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE. Th e balance comes from diamond concessions operated by Anglo-Am erican Corporation. Soviet and Cuban assistance is paid for from these foreign exchange earnings. When we look closely at Chevron Gulf, we find that no less than a former U.S. Secretary of Defense, David Packard, has been in a position to thwart Gulf backing for Soviet Angola — yet did nothing. Gulf Oil Corporation owns Cabinda, and Gulf itself was taken over by Chevron in March 1984. Thus, we have two sets of directors to look at, the original Gulf Oil directors who for a decade allowed the Gulf Cabinda operation to finance Marxist Angola, and the Chevron directors who had the oppor tunity to change corporate policy towards subsidy of Marxist warfare.

At the same annual meeting that approved the Chevro n takeover of Gulf and so lent Chevron support to Marxist Angola, a Chevron direct or resigned. This was David Packard, Chairman of Hewlett-Packard and a former S ecretary of Defense. There is no record that Packard protested either Gulf suppor t of Marxism or objected that Chevron should not join the band of American corpor ations who have aided world revolution. We doubt that Packard resigned on groun ds of principle, because Packard was an Overseer of the Hoover Institution and Chair man of its Financial Committee back in the early 1970s when Hoover Institution Dir ector W. Glenn Campbell attempted to put pressure on this author to stop pu blication of the earlier version of this book, National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union. Another interesting facet to this story of Soviet-m ultinational cooperation is in the amount of federal taxes paid by these giant firms. In 1976 Gulf had a federal tax rate of 2%. In 1984 Gulf claimed a tax refund, even whil e showing a profit of $313 million. Gulf 1984 tax rate was minus 8.3% (with a refund of $26 million). So in the same year that Gulf contributed most of Marxist Ang ola's foreign exchange and paid Angolan taxes, it demanded $26 million refund from U.S. taxpayers. If payment of taxes is a measure of patriotism, then Gulf Oil all egiance is more than clear. Identification of the Deaf Mute Blindmen The severity of our charges in the Chevron-Gulf cas e suggest that we be doubly careful in identification of the deaf mute blindmen . Not all directors of multinational corporations fit the description. Some in fact deci dely do not. Not all politicians and bureaucrats fit the bill, although it is hard to fi nd exceptions in Department of State. Let's take a paradoxical example to demonstrate the need for care. In the Reagan Administration both Secretary of Defense Casper Wei nberger and Secretary of State George Schultz are former officers of Bechtel Corpo ration, the multinational construction firm. However, Weinberger is one of th e few in Washington to understand technological transfers. George Shultz o n the other hand has a long-time unchanging record in favor of continuing transfers. Yet both have been top officials within Bechtel Corporation. While Department of State has never produced a sing le opponent of transfers, the Department of Commerce has — Lawrence Brady. And al though Weinberger is at DoD, the same department has produced several deaf mutes from among its top officials. The previously cited David Packard, Chai rman of Hewlett-Packard, is a"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"major sponsor of Congressman Ed Zschau, a vocal act ive supporter of more aid to Soviet military power.

It will take pressure from grass roots Americans and indeed from all thos e who love freedom to knock sense into their elected representatives and then i nto successive administrations and finally into the deaf mute blind-men. There is, however, a startpoint which is demonstrat ed by the Chevron-Gulf case. Department of Defense has shown realistic concern o ver transfers of technology and the military end-use in Soviet world ambition. Why doesn't DoD start to consider Western technology to the Soviets in the award of D oD contracts? In brief, penalize those firms working both sides o f the street. If Chase Manhattan wants to finance Soviet contracts, all well and goo d, but it should not also expect a piece of the U.S. Defense pie at the same time. If General Electric wants to sell to the Soviets, OK, let G.E. go ahead —within the law — bu t not also simultaneously benefit from DoD contracts. If Chevron-Gulf want to work hand-in-glove with Soviet military ambitions, they should not also be able to bid on U.S. government contracts and claim federal tax refunds when the firm is maki ng substantial profit. When awarding DoD contracts, preference should be given to those U.S. and foreign firms who show enough sense to walk away from Soviet deal s."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":" CHAPTER XII Tanks \"In the building of bridges toward peaceful engagem ent nothing, of course, should be done which would threaten our national security.\" — William Blackie, Chairman, Caterpillar Tractor Company Production facilities for tanks and armored cars co mbine features required in automobile and truck production with those required for locomotive and tractor production. Consequently, agricultural tractor, loc omotive and automotive plants can be — and are — used to produce tanks, although mass production of tanks requires equipment changes and new machine installations. Such civilian-to-military plant conversions for tan k and armored-car production have been successfully undertaken in automobile and loco motive plants in many countries. In the United States the Ford Motor Company, Cadill ac, and Chrysler have mass- produced tanks. In Italy the Fiat Company and in Fr ance the Renault Company, Citroen, and other automobile manufacturers have pr oduced tanks. In England the Vauxhall Motor Company was a tank producer in World War II. Among locomotive manufacturers both Baldwin Locomotive and American Locomotive in the United States produced tanks in World War II. Tractor plan ts have been successfully converted to tank production — for example, Massey Harris in the United States and all Caterpillar tractor plants in the Soviet Union. A tractor plant is well suited to tank and self-pro pelled gun production. The tractor plants at Stalingrad, Kharkov, and Chelyabinsk, ere cted with almost complete American assistance and equipment, and the Kirov pl ant in Leningrad, reconstructed by Ford, were used from the start to produce Soviet tanks, armored cars, and self- propelled guns. The enthusiasm with which this tank and armored-vehicle program was pursued, and the diversion of the best Russian engineers and material priorities to military purposes, have been responsible for at lea st part of the current Soviet problem of lagging tractor production and periodic famines. Since 1931, up to a half of the productive capacity of these \"tractor\" plants has been used for tank and armored-car production. 34 In both the State Department and the German Oberkom mando files, there are reports confirming the planned adaptability of Soviet general-equipment plants for war use — that is, the plants were originally planned for w ar use. For example, \"The heavy industry plants are fitted with special attachments and equipment held in reserve which in a few hours will convert the plants into m unitions factories.\" 35 "},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Tank assembly, like the production of automobiles, trucks, and tractors, is normally straight-line with components fed into the main ass embly operation from subassembly lines. The components required for tanks are usuall y peculiar to such weapons. Tank power-plants and tank power-trains are not normally used in commercial-type vehicles in the West. However, in the Soviet Union commercial engines have been used in tank installations by combining two power p lants in one tank, for example, the SU-76 self-propelled gun with two standard Dodge au tomobile engines, or by adapting aircraft engines. 36 Machinery and machine tools for tank production are similar to those used in the production of heavy equipment, with additional spec ial-purpose tools. Transfer machines required for automotive-type engines, larg e boring mills, large planers, radial drills, and heavy welding equipment are also utilized. Consequently, any automobile, truck, locomotive or tractor production plant with straight-line assembly operations can be converted to the mass production of tanks by the addition of certain specialized equipment and b y utilizing components and subassemblies made elsewhere for the specific tank vehicle to be assembled. Soviet tractor plants were established in the early I930s with major U.S. technical and equipment assistance. The Stalingrad tractor plant was completely built in the United States, shipped to Stalingrad, and then installed i n prefabricated steel buildings also purchased in the United States. This unit, together with the Kharkov and Chelyabinsk plants and the rebuilt Kirov plant in Leningrad, co mprised the Soviet tractor industry at that time, and a considerable part of the Soviet tank industry as well. During the war, equipment from Kharkov was evacuated and insta lled behind the Urals to form the Altai tractor plant, which opened in 1943. Three postwar tractor plants were in operation by 1 950: the Valdimir plant opened in 1944, the Lipetsk plant in 1947, the Minsk plant an d the Kharkov assembly plant in I950. This was the basic structure of the Soviet tr actor industry in the 1960s and 1970s. These plants produced tractors with a heavy emphasi s on crawler (caterpillar-tread) models rather than the rubber-tired tractors more c ommonly used in the United States. The 1959 USDA technical delegation estimated that 5 0 percent of the current output was in crawler models, as contrasted to only 4 perc ent in the United States. The military implications of this product mix is obviou s from Table 12-1.

Little German d esign influence can be traced in the period before 1939. During the 1920s and 1930s the Soviets acquired prototypes from all tank-producing countries and based development of Soviet tanks upon these foreign models. The Soviet tank stock in 1932 is sh own in Table 12-2. From this stock of Western models, together with te chnical-assistance agreements with foreign firms and the continuing purchase of f oreign prototypes, the Soviets developed a formidable tank force for World War II. The Carden-Lloyd (the predecessor of the British Br engun carrier of World War II) was a 1.69-ton machine-gun carrier first produced b y Vickers-Armstrong, Ltd., in 1929. The Mark-VI model sold to the Soviets had a F ord Model-T 4-cylinder 22.5- horsepower water-cooled engine and a Ford planetary transmission. This became the Soviet T-27 light reconnaissance tank produced at t he Bolshevik plant in Leningrad. The Ordzhonikidze Tractor Plant at Kharkov started work on the T-26, based on the British Vickers-Armstrong 6-tonner at about the sam e time. There were three versions — A, B and C — of which B and C became the standard Soviet models produced until 1941. Similarly, the Soviet T-37 and T-38 amp hibious vehicles were based on the Carden-Lloyd Amphibian, known as the Model-A4 E 11 in the British Army.

Liddell Hart, ed., The Red Army (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co., 1956). Walter Christie, a well-known American inventor wit h numerous automotive and tank inventions to his credit, developed the Christie ta nk — the basis of World War II American tanks. Numerous Soviet versions of Christi e tanks and armored vehicles were produced in the late 1920s and 1930s. Two chas sis of the Christie M-1931 model medium tank (MB) were purchased by the Soviet Union in 1932 from the U.S. Wheel Track Layer Corporation. After further develo pment work this became not only the Soviet T-32 (the basic Soviet tank of Worl d War II), but also several other development models in the USSR: first the BT (12 to ns), followed by the BT-5 and the BT-28 produced at Chelyabinsk. The Soviet T-34 and the American M-3, both based on the Christie, had the same 12- cylinder aero engine, a V-type Liberty of 338 horse power. Ogorkiewicz comments on the Christie model series as follows: The power-weight ratio was actually higher than cou ld be efficiently used, but the Russians copied it all and confined their developme nt largely to armament, which increased from a 37-millimeter gun on the original models of 1931, to 45-millimeter guns on BT-5 of 1935, and eventually to short 76.2- millimeter guns on some of the final models of the series. Both the Soviet T-28 medium 29-ton tank and the T-3 5 45-ton heavy tank resembled British models — the A-6 medium tank and the A-1 Vi ckers Independent, respectively. Imported French Renault designs also contributed to Russian tank knowledge. During the 1933 entente between France a nd the Soviet Union, the Renault Company delivered $11 million worth of \"sma ll fast tanks and artillery tractors\" to the Soviet Union and supplied experts from the Schneider works and Panhard Levasseur, skilled in the armored-car and t ank field. The Famous T-34 Medium Tank The Soviet T-34 and the modified T-34/85 were first introduced in World War II and used extensively against Americans in the Korean Wa r. The model was later used in the Hungarian revolt and in \"wars of liberation\" to the present day. The T-34 is an"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"excellent design and a formidable weapon. It emphas izes the ability of the Soviets to design weapons while still dependent on the West fo r production facilities and basic technical advances. In 1931 the Russians bought two Christie tanks from the U.S. Wheel Track Layer Corporation in the United States. The Russians copi ed these, built Christie tanks, and then incorporated the Christie suspension system in to the T-34. The first Russian Christies had the same engines as the U.S. Christie — a Liberty 12-cylinder V-type of 338 horsepower with forced-water cooling. In the 19 20s the Chase National Bank of New York (now Chase Manhattan) attempted to arrange illegal export of large quantities of these Liberty engines to the Soviet U nion at the price of $2,000 each. In any event, the T-34 incorporated the Christie su spension from the United States, but generally used a 500-horsepower V-type diesel d eveloped from the German B.M.W. diesel engine. The T-34/85 was the T-34 with significantly increased firepower. Ball bearings on the T-34 and T-34/85 we re manufactured on Swedish equipment. The welding work on the T-34 was at first immensely crude, but as The Welding Engineer (Dec. 1952) pointed out: \"The T-34 was designed wit h one idea in mind — to provide firepower. Any humanitarian consideratio ns, like protection of the crew, are purely secondary.\" The original T-34s were built from several million tons of armor-plate imported from the United States. In July 1934 Henry Disston & Son s, Inc. requested War Department permission to accede to a Soviet request , \"in training their technicians to make tank armorplate of the same quality as they no w make for this Government\" (Russia 400.114, War Office). The T-34 was followed by the improved T-44 and then by the T-54, with the basic T- 44 chassis and using Christie-system torsion-bar su spension. This was the standard Soviet tank until recently; it was used in the Hung arian revolt in 1956, in South Vietnam in 1972, and still in use in most Warsaw Pa ct countries. The Red Army has always used diesel engines in its medium and heavy tanks. This tank-engine series is the V-2 and V-12 water-cooled , rated to 550 brake horsepower (bhp) at 2,150 revolutions per minute (rpm). Accord ing to Ogorkiewicz, the original Russian water-cooled V-12 engine was a successful d iesel adaptation of contemporary aero-engine designs. Used on all Soviet medium and heavy tanks up to World War II, it was a large 2,860 cubic-inch engine, based on a German B.M.W. aircraft design, and developed about 500 bhp. Soviet em-ephasis on d iesels has continued since World War II, while other Soviet armored vehicles h ave used automobile gasoline engines. The T-70 light tank uses two GAZ-202 70-ho rsepower engines from the Ford-Gorki plant. The SU-76 self-propelled gun also used two engines of the same Ford type geared together. The Soviets have continuously developed the same en gine for their battle line tanks including the T-34, T-44, T-54, T-62 and T-72. Thes e engines originated with a Hispano Suisa engine originally developed in the 19 30s as an aircraft engine.

The weight to po wer ratio is 2.6 kg/kw. The weight/displacement is 25.8 Kg per liter and the sp ecific fuel consumption is 210 g/kwh. The Soviets prefer not to use imported parts for fi eld military end uses. However, they do reverse engineer the latest advances in Western military technology obtained by illegal purchase or espionage. Examples are the gun ner's telescope on the T-62 which uses the same multi roundscales and movable index l ine found on the M-46s (U.S.) T- 152 co-axial telescope. The T-64 and the T-72 has a n analogue ballistic computer and a coincidence rangefinder comparable to those found on U.S. M-48 and M-60 tanks. These were probably obtained from U.S. equipment ca ptured in Vietnam. DMB Pleas of Ignorance A common statement from the deaf mute blindmen is t hat their contracts with the Soviet Union have no military potential and cannot therefore do any harm to our national security. These statements are not only fa lse, but these multinational businessmen know they are false. We cited William Blackie, Chairman of Caterpillar T ractor Company, in the epigraph to this chapter to the effect that \"building of bri dges\" should not \"threaten our national security.\" Yet Mr. Blackie knows full well the use to which the Soviets put the Caterpillar Tractor plants in the Soviet Union and the military use of Caterpillar tractor reverse engineered from U.S. models. His st atement is bland subterfuge. The American-built tractor plants at Stalingrad, Kh arkov, and Chelyabinsk were the only major tank producers of the Soviet Union up to World War II.

While preliminary work on the site of the Stalingrad Tractor Plant ha d been conducted for some time, the actual work on the construction of the principal de partments started only in June when the plans arrived from the United States. 37 The Stalingrad Tractor Plant, the largest in Europe , was a packaged factory built in the United States, dismantled, shipped to the USSR, and re-erected at Stalingrad under the supervision of American engineers. All it s equipment was manufactured in the United States by some eight firms; it went into production with the Harvester 15/30 model and the T-37 3-ton tank. The Stalingrad Tractor Plant was the first of three massive plants for the production of tractors in peace and tanks in war. It was built in every sense of the word in the United States and was reassembled in Stalingrad by 570 Americans and 50 Germans. The plant was delivered in component parts, install ed in a building supplied by McClintock & Marshall, and erected under the superv ision of John Calder of the Austin Company. Za Industrializatsiiu pointed out that \"it is very important to note that the work of the American specialists... was not that of consulting but of actually superintending the entire construction and the various operations invo lved.\" 38 Each item of construction and equipment was the res ponsibility of a major U.S. firm: the design of plant was by Albert Kahn, Inc.; the d esign of the forge shop was by R. Smith, Inc.; the design of the foundry was by Frank C. Chase, Inc. Equipment for the cold-stamping department came from Niagara and Blis s; equipment for the heat- treating shops was by Rockwell; equipment for the power station by Seper and Westinghouse. Equipment for chain-belting in the conveyor system was by Chain Belt Co., and the supply of buildings by McClintock & Marshall. The Stalingrad Tractor Plant, therefore, was Americ an in concept, design, construction, equipment, and operation. It could ju st as easily have been located outside Chicago, producing Harvester tractors, except for the placards claiming \"socialist progress\" and its massive tank quota. It is worthwhile to recall that the contemporary Soviet press was qu ite open about this U.S. assistance. For example, an article in Za In-dustrializatsiiu drew three conclusions: first, that the preparation of the pla ns for the Stalingrad plant by American engineers with \"participation\" by Soviet e ngineers made completion of the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"plant possible within a \"very short time\"; second, that work and training by Soviet engineers in the United States resulted in a \"consi derable improvement in engineering processes\" and the application of American standard s; and third, that work in the United States gave the Soviets a firsthand opportunity to study American t ractor plants and verify data on the operation of American machine tools. As early as 1931 the Chain Belt Company representat ive, who was installing a conveyor system at Stalingrad, reported that the ne wly opened tractor plant was making \"small tanks.\" In 1932 A.A. Wishnewsky, an A merican whose work took him into many Soviet f. ac-tories, reported that the pr incipal emphasis in all these new tractor plants was on the production of munitions and military supplies. In a ll factories, he stated, at least one department was closed, and he would from time to time run across \"parts and materials for military production .\" This was particularly true of Tractorostroy (sic), where emphasis was placed on t he production of tanks rather than tractors. \"In his opinion, at least for the time be ing, the development of tractor production there has been designed to lead up the p roduction of tanks for military purposes.\" Such early reports were confirmed a few years later by German intelligence, which reported that in 1937-38 the Stalingrad Tractor Pla nt was producing a small 3-ton armored car, a self-propelled gun, and the T-37 tan k, which was patterned on the British A-4 Ell. Recently, Stalingrad (now Volgograd) has produced t he PT-76, an amphibious unit in the Soviet tank stock, which was used in South Viet nam and elsewhere around the world. The U.S.-Built Kharkov \"Tractor\" Plant The Kharkov \"tractor\" plant was identical to the St alingrad plant. The original intention was to build Kharkov as an all-Soviet und ertaking, but American engineers were called in at a very early point. Leon A. Swaji an, a well-known engineer in the United States, became chief construction engineer a nd was subsequently awarded the Order of Lenin for his work. Swajian commented that no other construction job in his experience had required so much work in a single ye ar, and that in the United States such giant plants are not built all at once, but a few departments at a time, by subcontract. The same American supervising engineer s and similar U.S. construction equipment and methods were used. Thus, Swajian expl ained: Ford's River Rouge plant was more than a dozen year s in building. When I took charge [at River Rouge] it was already partly built ; I worked there six or seven years and when I left construction was still in progress. But in the U.S.S.R. with government financing and no other plants from which to buy spare parts, with the plant dependent on itself — down to the smallest op eration on the basic raw material — the whole plant must be built at once. And very s wiftly too, if it is not to tie up capital too long. The Kharkov job was pushed to com pletion more swiftly than any job I have ever had to do with. 39 "},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"As at the Stalingrad and Chelyabinsk tractor plants , the equipment was almost all foreign — either American or German, patterned afte r American makes. No equipment at the Kharkov plant was Soviet-made. The forge shop contained $403,000 worth of American forging machines and dies, and th e heat-treating equipment and automatic furnace-temperature controls were supplie d by Leeds and Northrup of Philadelphia. A report in late 1932 from the Kharko v Tractor Plant by, Ingram D. Calhoun, an engineer for the Oilgear Company of Mil waukee, stated that Kharkov was turning out eight to ten tanks a day and tanks took precedence over tractor production. Operators were being trained \"night and ... they can fool the tourists but not the foreign engineers,\" Calhoun added. 40 By 1938 Kharkov was producing self-propelled guns, armored cars, and the T-26 tank, which was patterned after the British Vickers-Armst rong 6-tonner. The U.S.-Built Chelyabinsk \"Tractor\" Plant The Chelyabinsk \"tractor\" plant was started in 1930 , without foreign technical assistance, as another duplicate of the Stalingrad Tractor Plant. One year later, in March 1931, a letter to the Soviet press, signed by thirty-five Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant engineers and economists, charged that the pr oject was \"on the verge of total collapse.\" American engineers, including John Calder, the expe rt troubleshooter, were then called in to take over construction of the plant an d initial operating responsibility. A pilot plant was established and operated by John Th ane and an American assistant, both of whom were former employees of the Caterpill ar Company. The chief consulting engineer from 1931 to 1933 was Edward J. Terry. The Stalinets S-60 tractor produced was an exact copy of the Caterpill ar 1925-31 model. Ex-Caterpillar engineers supervised operations. In May 1933 practi cally all the machine tools and production equipment in the plant were American, Br itish, or German. By 1937 the plant employed about 25,000 workers. Th e only tractor produced between 1933 and 1937 was the Stalinets (Caterpilla r) S-60, a 50-horsepower (drawbar) model of the crawler type. About 6,460 we re produced in 1937, a long way from the planned 50,000 per year. In 1937 the produ ction model was changed to the Stalinets S-65, which was a Caterpillar-60 with sli ghtly increased horsepower and a diesel engine. A total of just over 3,000 were prod uced, including another model with a gas generator. The Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant was also producing ta nks of the BT series, which was patterned on the American Christie. Monthly output in 1938 consisted of thirty-two of the 12-tonners and 100 of the BT-38, a 16-tonner. Thus, not only were all three of the new American-b uilt tractor plants producing tanks throughout the 1930s, but they were by far the most important industrial units producing this type of weapon. Today, these plants still can, and do, produce tanks. Yet multinational businessmen continue to blandly a ssert that their dealings have no impact on our national security."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":" Footnotes: 34 While, for example, the Soviet PT-76 tank used in 1 972 in Vietnam came from the American-built Stalingrad plant (now called Volgogr ad), the exact percentage of the plant's capacity used for tank production is unknow n. 35 Horace N.

The public plea of internationlist businessmen is t hat trade brings peace. This is usually phrased along the following lines. This exa mple is from Maurice Stans, friend of Richard Nixon, former Secretary of Commerce, and Wall Street investment banker: \"History has shown that where there is increasing t rade between countries... there is a tendency toward increasing understanding.\" Unfortunately for Maurice Stans' credibility, no hi storian or politician has ever produced evidence that trade necessarily and automatically leads to increased understanding. The statement has no empirical justi fication at all. It sounds good, that's all. Why not? Because no such evidence exists. While it is true that peace encourages trade, this does not mean that trade encourages pea ce. In fact, trade has often enabled aggressive countries to go to war —witness the avia tion gasoline and steel scrap shipments to Japan and Standard Oil's agreements on hydrogenation patents with I.G. Farben of Germany prior to World War II. The blunt truth is that trade with the Soviet Union from 1917 to the present has built the Free World an enemy of the first order. Moreove r, the technological component of this continuing trade enables the Soviet Union to p ursue its programs of world conquest. It costs the American taxpayer $300 billi on a year to counter this Soviet threat. Obviously, claims that increasing trade is accompan ied by increasing understanding are false. A more accurate characterization in the Soviet case appears to be that increasing trade is accompanied by increasing confl ict (i.e., misunderstanding), because the Kremlin is encouraged to believe that c apitalists are behaving as Lenin predicted they would behave. The concept of \"peacef ul trade\" with Communist"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"countries assumes some positive causal link between trade and peace. It is a false assumption. The overlooked link is the relationship between tra de and casualties, and is contained in one word: technology. From the Soviet viewpoint, the benefit of U.S.-Sovi et trade is the acquisition from the United States of the technology required for buildi ng and maintaining the Soviet power base. This subsidized technology is the basis of the Soviet military structure, as is proved by the Soviets' own statements. The armam ents produced by Russia's American-subsidized military-industrial complex are used to promote Soviet global expansion. There are four logical steps in this process: 41 1. Trade between the United States and the USSR (wi th its key technological component). 2. Consequent buildup of the Soviet military-indust rial complex. 3. Use of the U.S.-subsidized Soviet military-indus trial complex to provide inputs for Soviet armaments production. 4. Use of these armanents against the United States and its allies. This is the \"trade-technology-armaments-war\" cycle. It suggests that \"peaceful trade\" promoted by successive administrations should be en titled \"war trade.\" If any of the links in this cycle can be broken (or shown to be false), the argument collapses. However, no link is demonstrably false. Indeed, there is evidence that the trade-casualties link is stronger than even the mos t pessimistic have envisaged. We trade freely with European nations because these nations have no deceitful intent to use the technological component of this trade ag ainst the United States. Nor has the United States any hostile intent towards these Euro pean countries. Free trade is vital and necessary, and both sides benefit from its adva ntages. However, gains from free trade utlimately depend on intent . Where countries are potentially hostile and make hostile use of imported technology, the gains from free trade must be modified by the hostile intent of the trading partner. In other wor ds, \"peaceful trade\" is only peaceful if Soviet intent is peaceful. Why isn't this information and logic made available to the public? Then at least the DMB would have official opposition to their spuriou s arguments. For some reason or another the Washington bureaucracy in State and Com merce has by and large, with some exceptions, taken a position inconsistent with its own files. The Bureaucrats' View of \"Peaceful Trade\""},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"The State and Commerce Departments have consistentl y rejected the argument that \"peaceful trade\" can assist Soviet military objecti ves. For example, a 1969 State Department leaflet asserts (under the heading \"US e xports do not help Hanoi\"): Over two-thirds of our exports to the Soviet Union a nd East Europe are foodstuffs and raw materials for consumption within their economie s. There is no evidence that our exports of such goods to these countries release re sources for manufacturing war materials for North Vietnam. 42 What is wrong with this statement? The Soviet Union needs — and receives — U.S. techno logy, not \"foodstuffs and raw materials.\" The bureaucracy may claim U.S. wheat do es not go to Vietnam and Cuba, but it avoids the crucial point that export of our wheat to the Soviets released Soviet wheat for export to Hanoi. No economist will deny t hat our technical transfers release Soviet domestic resources for armaments production. The State Department assertion is therefore a compound of distortion and ignorance . These unsubstantiated distortions are given to Cong ress as verifiable truth. For example, Edwin M. Martin, Assistant Secretary of St ate for Economic Affairs, made the following statement to Congress in 1961: \"I don 't think there is convincing evidence that the net advantage to the Soviet Union of the continuation of trade is a major factor — or a particularly significant factor in the rate of their overall economic development in the long term.\" 43 This is an untrue statement. There is also confusion concerning the Soviet pract ice of copying. For example, the following exchange took place before a congressiona l committee in 1961. Mr. Lipscomb: Does the Department of Commerce feel that Russia h as developed a great deal of their agricultural equipment from pro totypes obtained both legally and illegally from the United States? Mr. Behrman: No sir, I don't think that the evidence we have in dicates that the equipment that they themselves produce copies — tha t they produce copies of equipment which we have supplied. 44 Again, a wildly untrue statement. Even well-informed members of Congress have taken p ositions directly opposed to the evidence. Senator Jacob Javits of New York comm ented: \"Trade with the West as a general matter must necessarily be a marginal fac tor in the performance and potentialities of the Soviet economy.\" 45 There exist, presumably unknown to Senator Javits a nd the others quoted above, three volumes of detailed evidence that totally refutes t hese statements. 46 A popular book in the 1930s was You Can't Do Business with Hitler! The moral and national-security arguments in this book apparently apply only to Hitler's brand of totalitarianism. There is extraordinary inconsisten cy in the treatment of Hitlerian totalitarianism and Soviet totalitarianism. Indeed, there is some direct evidence and a"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"great deal of indirect evidence that the policymake rs in Washington do not view the Soviet Union as a totalitarian power at all. At the end of World War II, the conclusion of an in teragency committee on German industry, with members from the State and Commerce Departments, was as follows: The Committee is unanimously of the opinion that th e major force for war represented in a motor vehicle industry is its availability as a major machine shop aggregation, under able management and engineering, which can be turned, by conversion, to production of an extremely wide variety of military products. Its role as a producer of combat and military transport vehicles ranks second in significance. 47 Yet today State and Commerce argue that the export of equipm ent for a motor vehicle industry is \"peaceful trade\" — even when milltary vehicles produced by previously exported technology are photographed in Vietnam, Cu ba, Afghanistan, Angola and Nicaragua. Obviously, no amount of hard evidence can shake the se people from their illusions. The policymakers are locked onto a brand of totalitarianism which, to them, is morally and strategically acceptable. U.S. assistance to the Marxist brand of totalitaria nism is not limited to the Soviet Union. In 1971, for example, the State Department a ttempted to help Allende, the Marxist president of Chile, to purchase aircraft an d paratroop equipment in the United States (Indianapolis News, July 1971). Three months later Allende attempted to impose complete Marxist control in Chile. Once agai n the State Department wants to help a Marxist clique to impose its rule on an unwi lling population. The assertion that we should exchange our technolog y for Soviet raw materials will not stand penetrating analysis. Soviet raw material s only become competitive to our enormous low-grade domestic reserves if their extra ction is subsidized by U.S. loans and guarantees — to the disadvantage of the America n taxpayer. From the national security viewpoint, the \"exchange\" is absurd. Once our technology is passed to the Soviet Union it cannot be reclaimed, it becomes an integral part of their military industrial operations. But Russian raw material sup plies, developed with our assistance, can be cut off any time the Soviets wis h. In other words, once again our policymakers exchange something for nothing and cha rge it to the American taxpayer and citizen. Useless Pinpricks as Policy In early May 1985, President Reagan embargoed U.S. trade with Nicaragua. This followed what a State Department official described as a \"disturbing pattern of behavior\" on the part of Nicaragua. But the White H ouse missed a point — and an opportunity. Nicaragua and its \"disturbing behavior\" is a mere i ncident in a vast ever-expanding global game. Moreover, the Nicaraguan embargo has l oopholes that make it virtually ineffective. For example, foreign affiliates of U.S . firms are not embargoed. In brief, if the invoice is on foreign subsidiary, that's leg al. And don't think American firms won't scramble for the loophole."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"The global problem is not pinprick Nicaragua — it is the unho ly alliance of the multinationals and the Soviet Union. Follow these logica: steps: • The Sandanista revolution only survives because o f Marxist suppression and Soviet logistical backing. • The Soviets survive and have become militarily aw esome because the West has a sixty-year-old policy of technical, economic, finan cial and even political subsidy of the Soviet Union. • The multinationals are the mainspring for technic al and economic subsidy, from Kama River to the latest CDC computers. And they ar e more than willing to bend the truth to make a buck. • Our political establishment, as exemplified in th e Council on Foreign Relations, is the mainspring behind political subsidy of the Sovi et Union, as exemplified in the Yalta agreement, National Security Memorandum No. 6 8 and so-called \"detente.\" Under this system the Soviet Union is never held fu lly accountable for its international acts. For example: • The Soviets illegally occupy the long independent countries of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. • The Soviet Union has occupied the long independen t nation of Afghanistan. • Soviet troops are based in Poland, Hungary, Ruman ia and Czechoslovakia. • Soviet troops are active in Cuba, Angola, and a d ozen other hot spots around the world including Nicaragua. This adds up to global aggression. Yet the politica l establishment and its Congressional allies told us that peaceful coexiste nce and detente with the Soviets would bring peace. The American public has never been told by any Admi nistration the Soviet definition of \"peaceful coexistence.\" That detente in the Sovi et interpretation includes the RIGHT to continue so-called wars of liberation and to further encroach upon the Western world. Western governments have persisted i n the illusion of detente as peace, knowing full well that the Marxist interpret ation of peaceful coexistence is aggression, that peace is indeed war. It is this official inaction that has encouraged th e deaf mute blindmen to further Soviet ambitions for their own personal gain. Multinational Businessmen and the Politics of Greed"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"Who benefits from technological transfers to the So viet Union? Basically two groups: the Soviets themselves and the comparative handful of companies, almost all multinationals, who set up and profit from Soviet c ontracts. Soviet business is profitable. Some American compan ies have been sucking in this profit since the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Chas e National was involved in illegal exports to the Soviet Union in the early 1920s, whi le Chase Manhattan was the lead financing bank for the Kama River project. Caterpil lar Tractor was involved in the First Five Year Plan in 1930, and still involved in the Siberian pipeline \"Russia No. 6\" project in the 1980s. The hundreds of examples cited here are not acciden ts. Many individual congressmen and persons outside government have attempted to st op the export of military goods to the Soviet Union in the face of business pressur es. Samuel Gompers tried in the 1920s. U.S. Navy of-ricers risked court-martial in the 1930s in their effort to stop President Franklin D. Roosevelt from approving the sale of military equipment to the Soviets. The Senate investigated the \"machine tools \" case in 1945-46 when Commerce officials tried to send tank-gun milling e quipment to the Soviet Union. Warnings were raised in the 1950s by Congressman Li pscomb and others about the results of building up Soviet military strength. In the 1960s individual American firms and engineers protested against the export of ball bearings processing equipment which could only be used to process bearings for Soviet missile-gui dance systems. In the 1980s Department of Defense has raised a clear warning. Are we to believe that Mr. Nicholaas Leyds, general manager of Bryant Chucking Grinder Company of Springfield, Vermont, did not know that his grinding machines are used to process the races for ball bearings in missile-guidance systems? When Bryant has sold the same machine to the U.S. govern ment for the same purpose? Or that the Hammer family does not know the results of its seventy year association with the USSR? In 1919 Dr. Julius Hammer was a memb er of the Executive Committee of the Communist party of the United Stat es and in 1985 Armand Hammer (his son and early business partner) is desc ribed as America's \"No. 1 Capitalist.\" It is not an accident. The deaf mute blindmen have always known the exact end-uses of the exported equipment. They have been brazen en ough to persist in building up the Soviet military-industrial complex while pleadi ng \"civilizing the Bolsheviks\" (1918) and \"peaceful trade\" (1985). Above all there are several disturbing aspects to t his whole business of selling our technology to the Soviets. First, multinational ban ks and business groups have their own people in all administrations pushing for their self-interested profitable projects. Second, the more prominent of these businessmen (Ar mand Hammer and David Rockefeller come to mind) deal directly with the So viet Union almost as independent fiefdoms. The business and personal relationships of Henry Ki ssinger and the Rockefeller family, for instance, are too close for administrat ive objectivity. Neither has Henry Kissinger been on the receiving end of a bullet, he doesn't have to pay the price for his"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"policies. Indeed, in most cases policymakers have never under taken any occupation where the cost of a wrong decision fell upon their own shoulders - and that may be one of the major problems. The following extract is from the conclusion of Kis singer's book Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy (p. 431): A statesman must act as if his inspirations were already experience, as if his aspirations were truth. He must bridge the gap between society's experience and his vision, between its tradition and its future. Note the words \"act as if.\" Act \"as if\" fantasy were reality is the clear implication. Act \"as if\" objectives (whatever they may be) are always moral. In other words, anything is real if you wish it to be, and anything is moral if you want it to be. Is it then accidental that Kissinger's de vastating detente policy was only beneficial to his proteges? (For example, the Rocke feller controlled Chase Manhattan Bank). Then the amoral two-facedness of many DMBs has been commented on by several observers: At times it seemed that the business world preferre d to ignore the policy makers in Washington. One prominent member of the council [Th e U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council] remembers meeting after Nixon's r esignation with four other industrialists, several admirals, and a member of t he Joint Chiefs of Staff late in 1974. One admiral bewailed the military disadvantages U.S . forces suffered because of certain technology transfers. The next day, the sam e industrialist attended a private dinner in New York given by a major investment bank ing house. The guest of honor was Dzhermen Gvishiani, the Soviet official whose s pecialty was buying high technology in the West. One after another, the thir ty other businessmen at the dinner rose to boast about the last big transaction they h ad made with Gvishiani. 'The dichotomy between the luncheon in Washington and th e dinner in New York was just astounding,' the businessman recalled. 'These guys were bragging as if they had just sold a ton of frankfurters.' 48 This atmosphere of \"bragging as if they had just so ld a ton of frankfurters\" has been officially encouraged because until very recently, no official in any Administration has stood up in public and castigated the deaf mute blindmen. In recent years Secretary of Defense Casper Weinberger and Assistan t Secretary of Defense Richard Perle have to some extent changed the nature of the public debate — but State and Commerce still drag their feet. Motivated by the lure of profit and in the absence of official chastisement, the deaf mute blindmen have run the show where trade with th e Soviets is concerned. Through the Export-Import Bank they have received o fficial, less than market loaves, subsidised by the taxpayer, for projects with milit ary potential. Ex-Im provided $153 million for Kama River, $180 million for Occidental 's string of chemical plants — at half the prime rate. When this latter venture was a pproved, William J. Casey was"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Chairman of Export Import Bank even while publicly today Casey disclaims knowledge of our build-up of the USSR. Other businessmen have appeared before Congress and made statements inconsistent with the bulk of the evidence. For example, we know that the Soviets have successfully reverse-engineered thousands of U.S. p rocesses. Yet one businessman appeared before Congress and denied the usefulness of the process: Senator Nunn: You say reversing engineering is very difficult an d time consuming even if they have the equipment itself, and all the plans and specifications? Mr. Bell: To put it in production. That is true. You can get a lot of valuable information off of it. But to put that equipment in to production, even if you had what I said, they do not have the components. That is the key to the whole thing. The best system engineer in the world, that is what we do in system engineering, is only as good as the elements he has to work with. They do n ot have the components in the Soviet Union. 49 Again Charles Lecht, former President of Advanced C omputer Techniques Corp., tried to advance the line that the only Soviet inte rest was curiosity rather than technological need: Primarily I have come to the conclusion that the co ncept that the Soviets want U.S. technology because they can't make it themselves or they can't buy it themselves is a fallacious one. I have concluded that the Soviet te chnology establishment — in the country which produces more scientific literature t han any other country in the world — is capable of producing what it wants. I have thu s concluded that the Soviets have been looking for U.S. technology primarily because they want to find out how our military materiel work, our missiles, our aircraft, our radar, our sonar, and the like. 50 In brief, the bottom line is greed and the greed ha s been allowed to reign supreme because official Washington has openly encouraged t echnological transfers.

Americans who ship crucial weapons and documents to them are criminals: criminals are glad to sign papers.\"  — George Gilder, New York Times Are these businessmen, the deaf mute blindmen inter nationalists, also guilty of treason? It is interesting to initially look at thi s question from the viewpoint of the other side, the Soviet side. Avraham Shifrin, a for mer Soviet Defense official, has a blunt conclusion. Shifrin calls the transfers treas on and \"they (the businessmen) should be shot\" (page 21). To take another example from the other side, the Ma rxist rebels in El Salvador, the Faranbundo Marti National Liberation Front, receive aid from the Soviet Union. At the same time they claim that our aid to the electe d Salvadoran Government makes our military advisors in El Salvador legitimate tar gets for assassination, i.e., the U.S. is an enemy just by virtue of economic subsidy. In brief, the other side interprets aid, even with no technological component, as equivalent to treason. In the original version of this book, National Suicide: Military Aid to the Soviet Union, published in 1974, we declined to term subsidy to t he Soviets as treason because the vital element of intent was missing. This conclusion was phrased as follow s: Do the actions described in this book [i.e. National Suicide] constitute \"adhering\" to these enemies, \"giving them Aid and Comfort\"? The actions do not legally constitute treason. The Constitution defines the term strictly, for the intention of the framers, with go od reason, was to deny Congress the right to interpret treason too freely. Moreover, th e body of relevant case law is not substantial. The Cramer and Haupt cases after World War I suggest that both intent to commit treason and overt treasonable acts are requi red, in addition to thorough proof. While the actions described here could be interpret ed as giving immediate \"Aid and Comfort\" to the Soviet Union, there is no specific evidence of intent, and in-. tent is a vital requirement. Idiocy, inefficiency, intellectu al myopia, and so on, do not suggest intent (p. 240). We need to pose the question again, given the accum ulating evidence of the last 11 years. Does this sequence of events and actions fal l within the meaning of treason? Specifically, does military aid to the Soviet Union constitute \"adhering to their enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort\"? as defined i n Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution of the United States. 51 "},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" Are the Soviets Enemies? The Soviets have always been explicit about their i ntentions — so was Hitler in Mein Kampf. Objective truth has no place in Communist morality, by their own statements. Any statement that will advance the cause of world comm unism is regarded as truthful, acceptable, and perfectly normal. As far back as 19 19, Zinoviev put it well in a statement that applies to the Viet Cong and the San danistas as much as to the revolutionary Bolsheviks: We are willing to sign an unfavorable peace. It wou ld only mean we should put no trust whatever in the piece of paper we should sign . We should use the breathing space so obtained in order to gather our strength. 52 This immoral dogma — moral only in Marxist ideology — was emphasized by Joseph Stalin: Words must have no relations to actions — otherwise what kind of diplomacy is it? Words are one thing, actions another. Good words ar e a mask for concealment of bad deeds. Sincere diplomacy is no more possible than d ry water or wooden iron. 53 In 1955 the staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on t he Judiciary examined the Soviet historical record and, not unexpectedly in the ligh t of the foregoing statements, came to the following conclusion: The staff studied nearly a thousand treaties and agreements ... both bilateral and multilateral, which the Soviets have entered into n ot only with the United States, but with countries all over the world. The staff found that in the 38 short years since the Soviet Union came into existence, its Government ha d broken its word to virtually every country to which it ever gave a signed promis e. It signed treaties of nonaggression with neighboring states and then abso rbed those states. It signed promises to refrain from revolutionary activity ins ide the countries with which it sought \"friendship\" and then cynically broke those promises. It was violating the first agreement it ever signed with the United States at the very moment the Soviet envoy, Litvinov, was putting his signature to that agreeme nt, and it is still violating the same agreement in 1955. It broke the promises it made to the Western nations during previous meetings \"at the summit\" in Teheran and Ya lta. It broke lend-lease agreements offered to it by the United States in or der to keep Stalin from surrendering to the Nazis. It violated the charter of the United Nations. It keeps no international promises at all unless doing so is clearly advantag eous to the Soviet Union. [We] seriously doubt whether during the whole histo ry of civilization any great nation has ever made as perfidious a record as this in so short a time. 54 More recently in the 1970s and 1980s the Soviets ha ve broken the SALT treaties and used the era of detente to develop an awe-inspiring weapons arsenal."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Consequently, the history of Soviet foreign relatio ns from 1917 to the present suggests, for those who can interpret history, two conclusions: 1. The Soviets will not keep their word in any foreign agreement. 2. Their intent is self-admittedly aggressive, with world conquest as the ultimate goal. The 1970s era of detente was a sham. Increased U.S. -Soviet trade, allegedly designed to lower tensions, was entirely contrary to histori cal observation and rational deduction. Mikhail Suslov, longtime Russian Communi st Party theoretician, stated in 1972 that the U.S.-Soviet detente was temporary and that, so far as the Soviet Union is concerned, merely an interlude to gain strength for the next stage of the battle against \"imperialist aggression.\" Suslov in 1972 re peated and reinforced Zinoviev's 1919 statement; there is no change of heart or dire ction. The Soviet Record of Aggression A review of the human cost of Soviet double-dealing emphasizes not only the risk we run by attempts to mellow Soviet statism, but the e xtreme seriousness of the actions of the deaf mute blindmen. In every year since the Bolshevik Revolution the So viets have murdered their own citizens for political reasons: that is, for allege d or real opposition to the Soviet state. The AFL-CIO has mapped Soviet forced labor camps. M oreover, in every year since 1917 the Soviets have attacked other countries or i nterfered massively in their internal affairs. 55 The human cost of the Bolshevik Revolution and the ensuing civil war in Russia has been estimated at 7 million Russians. Between 1930 and 1950 more than 20 million Russians died in forced labor camps. Khrushchev per sonally supervised the massacre of more than 10,000 Ukrainians at Vinnitsa. Soviet agents were in Spain before the Spanish Civi l War of 1936 and unquestionably had some role in starting it (cost: 275,000 killed) . The supply of Soviet armaments to the Spanish Repub lic is known from material in the records of the German military attache at Ankar a, Turkey. 56 Soviet arms shipments began in September 1936. Soviet intellige nce agents, operating in Spain before the war broke out, were under General Ulansk y, who was also responsible for logistics. In addition to supplies, the Soviets sen t 920 military \"advisers\": 70 air force of-ricers, 100 other officers (as early as Septembe r 1936), and 750 enlisted men. From September 1936 to March 1938 about 110 shiploads of Russian military supplies left Odessa en route to Spain, almost all from plants bu ilt by the deaf mute blindmen. Foreshadowing the situation when the USSR supplied Cuba and North Vietnam, only thirty-two of these ships were under the Soviet fla g — and most of these Soviet-flag vessels were foreign-built. These 110 vessels carri ed the following armaments to Spain from the new Western-built Soviet plants: Tanks and armored cars 731 Planes (mostly fighter aircraft) 242 Guns 707"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Antiaircraft Guns 27 Trucks 1,386 What was the U.S. technical component of these arms ? The tanks sent to Spain in 1936 were based on Briti sh Vickers or U.S. Christie designs. Soviet aviation technology was mainly Amer ican (except for French Potez and Italian seaplane designs). The guns were Krupp, but the trucks were Ford, Hercules, and Brandt — all from plants built by Ame rican firms just five years previously. After this, in 1937, Stalin's Red Army purge killed 30,000 — the cream of the Soviet military. Two years later, in 1939, Russia attacked Finland. Cost: 273,000 Finns and Russians killed. In 1939 or 1940, the Soviets murdered 30,00 0 Polish officers at Katyn. Persecution of Russians and the peoples of Eastern Europe continued after World War II, assisted by the British-American Operation Keel haul. In 1946 the Ukrainians tried unsuccessfully to figh t for independence, after having fought the Germans for four years. One after anothe r the East European peoples attempted to overthrow domestic communism, which su rvived only with Russian help and American inaction. In 1956 there was another Po lish revolt and a major outbreak in Hungary in which 25,000 Hungarians and 7,000 Rus sians lost their lives. In the early 1960s the Soviets began to look beyond their satellites, secure in the knowledge that the United States would not interven e to protect human rights in these countries. Then came the Cuban Missile Crisis of 19 62: the missile-carrying Soviet ships had engines manufactured by Denmark. Then the airborne Congo adventure. Then the Vietnamese War, in which Soviet advisers, as in the Spanish Civil War in 1936, entered at an early stage. In 1965, the year 1,369 Americans were killed in South Vietnam, 2,500 Russian engineers and experts were at work in North Vietnam, and Russian arms were even then in widespread use b y the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese. This was also the year in which Preside nt Johnson decided to expand trade with the Soviets in the guise of \"building br idges for peace.\" The continuing crisis in the Middle East has been d irectly dependent upon the supply of Soviet arms to militant Arab countries and gueri llas. In the I980s Soviet weapons and supplies keep wars going in Africa and Central America. Famine plagued Ethiopia is stocked with So viet weapons. In Afghanistan we have a Soviet invasion of an independent country , Marxist Angola and Marxist Mozambique are supplied with Soviet weapons and adv isers. In Angola the Soviets are in an unholy alliance with Chevron-Gulf. This o il multinational supplies the foreign exchange to pay the Cuban troops. The Gulf Cabinda installations are protected by Soviet and Cuban troops. In Korea we have direct killing of Americans with S oviet weapons.

Of the"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"10,218 American prisoners taken by the Communist fo rces, only 3,746 returned to the United States: 21 men refused repatriation and 6,45 1 American servicemen are listed as \"murdered or died.\" 57 The 130,000-man North Korean Army, which crossed th e South Korean border in June 1950, was trained, supported, and equipped by the Soviet Union, and included a brigade of Soviet T-34 medium tanks (with U.S. Chri stie suspensions). 58 The artillery tractors were direct metric copies of Caterpillar t ractors. The trucks came from the Henry Ford-Gorki plant or the ZIL plant. The North Korean Air Force has 180 Yak planes built in plants with U.S. Lend-Lease equipme nt. These Yaks were later replaced by MiG-15s powered by Russian copies of Ro lls-Royce jet engines sold to the Soviet Union in 1947. Between 1961 and 1964 the American casualty roll in Vietnam was relatively light, only 267 killed, and U.S.-Soviet trade was at a low level. In 1965 the Soviets stepped up the flow of military supplies and equipment to North Vietnam. President Johnson stepped up the flow of t echnology to the Soviets. The American toll mounted rapidly, demonstrating the ab surdity of the trade levels in peace agreement: 1965 1,369 killed 3,308 wounded 1966 5,008 killed 16,526 wounded 1967 9,378 killed 32,371 wounded 1968 14,592 killed 46,799 wounded After President Nixon took office in 1969 and initi ated detente with transfers of military technology, the American toll increased: 1969 9,414 killed 32,940 wounded 1970 4,422 killed 15,211 wounded 1971 1,380 killed 4,767 wounded 1972 300 killed 587 wounded About 80 percent of the armaments and supplies for the Vietnamese War came from the Soviet Union. Yet a key part of President Nixon 's policy was the transfer of technology to the USSR which aids Soviet war potent ial. Soviet military aid has been fundamental for the No rth Viets. In September 1967 the Institute for Strategic Studies in London reported that the Soviets sent numbers of MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters, Ilyushin-28 light bombe rs, transport aircraft, helicopters, 6,000 antiaircraft guns (one-half rada r controlled), surface-to-air (guideline) missiles, 200-250 missile launchers, se veral thousand air defense machine guns, and a training mission of about 1,000 men to North Vietnam. This aid was confirmed in April 1967 by former Assi stant Secretary of Defense John T. McNaughton, i.e. the Soviets supplied the \"sophi sticated equipment in the field of antiaircraft defense.\" Loss of 915 U.S. planes over North Vietnam between February"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"1965 (the date of the first U.S. air operations ove r North Vietnam) and the bombing halt of November 1, 1968 testifies to the accuracy and utility of the Soviet equipment. After President Nixon took office in January 1969 a nd expanded technical transfers, losses mounted, a total of more than 4,000 U.S. air craft by the end of 1972. Support by the Soviet Union for North Vietnamese ag gression in South Vietnam was no secret. Brezhnev, on his visit to Bulgaria on Ma y 12, 1967, demonstrated the solidarity of supposedly polycentralist-socialist E ast Europe on the question of Vietnam: You know well, comrades, that the Soviet Union is r endering great economic, military and political assistance to fighting Vietnam. This assistance is merged with the assistance coming from Bulgaria and other fraternal socialist countries. We are rendering it in response to a command of the heart, as people reared by the Communist party in a spirit of proletarian internat ionalism, in a spirit of high understanding of class tasks. And let the aggressor s know this: fighting Vietnam will never be left without the help of its true friends. Our answer has been and will continue to be commensurate with the requirements o f an effective rebuff to the unbridled imperialist interventionists. 59 The Soviet Union provided both the military and the economic means for the North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam. At the key ju ncture of the Vietnamese War, the Soviets were not only rapidly increasing their supplies, but were receiving in return less than one-seventh the value of the suppl ies in Vietnamese products. The balance was Soviet \"Lend-Lease\" for the takeover of South Vietnam. The Soviet Union has truly been the \"arsenal for re volution\" in Vietnam, and as Shirley Sheibla wrote in Barron's Weekly, the United States has been the \"arsenal for communism\" in the Soviet Union.\" 60 As the material presented in this book shows, the \" arsenal for revolution\" was built by Western firms and has been kept in operation with \" peaceful trade.\" When all the rhetoric about \"peaceful trade\" is boiled out, it c omes down to a single inescapable fact: the guns, the ammunition, the weapons, the tr ansportation systems that killed Americans in Korea and Vietnam came from the Americ an-subsidized economy of the Soviet Union. The trucks that carried these wea pons down the Ho Chi Minh trail came from American-built plants. The ships that car ried the supplies to Sihanoukville and Haiphong and later to Angola and Nicaragua came from NATO allies and used propulsion systems that our State Department could have kept out of Soviet hands — indeed, the Export Control Act and the Battle Act, ignored by State, required exactly such action. The technical capability to wage the K orean and Vietnamese wars originated on both sides in Western, mainly American, technology, and the po litical illusion of \"peaceful trade\" promoted by the deaf m ute blindmen was the carrier for this war-making technology. As U.S. casualties in Vietnam mounted, the lessons of history were clear for those with eyes to see — reduce trade with the USSR and a ll suppliers to North Vietnam, and so provide an incentive for the other side to d ecelerate the conflict. (This is not hindsight; the writer made this argument, in print, in the mid-1960s and throughout the 1970s. See Appendix C). Both the Johnson and Ni xon administrations irrationally"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"and illogically chose to expand trade — the carrier for the technology required to fuel the North Vietnamese side of the war — and so voted to continue the war. What is less obvious is that all Administrations ha ve been under heavy political pressure from the deaf mute blindmen to adopt this suicidal policy. Are the Deaf Mute Blindmen Guilty of Treason? The Soviet record is clear. Since 1917 the Soviets have in philosophy and action held that the United States is the main enemy. The Sovie ts talk as if the United States is an enemy. And Soviets consistently act as if the Unite d States is the main enemy. We also require a $300 billion a year defense budget t o protect ourselves from the Soviets. What does the U.S. Constitution say about treason? Here is Article III, Section 3: United States Constitution ARTICLE III, SECTION 3 TREASON AGAINST THE UNITED STATES SHALL CONSIST ONL Y IN LEVYING WAR AGAINST THEM, OR IN ADHERING TO THEIR E NEMIES, GIVING THEM AID AND COMFORT. NO PERSON SHALL BE CON VICTED OF TREASON UNLESS ON THE TESTIMONY OF TWO WITNESSES TO THE SAME OVERT ACT, OR IN CONFESSION IN OPEN COURT. THE CONGRESS SHALL HAVE POWER TO DECLARE THE PUNISH MENT OF TREASON, BUT NO ATTAINDER OF TREASON SHALL WORK COR RUPTION OF BLOOD, OR FORFEITURE, EXCEPT DURING THE LIFE OF THE PERSON ATTAINTED. Treason is defined in the Constitution as giving an y enemy of the United States \"aid and comfort.\" Does the record described in the prev ious chapters constitute \"aid and comfort\"? Obviously the record reflects considerably more tha n \"aid and comfort.\" The Soviets would have no effective modern military establishme nt without the assistance rendered by the deaf mute blindmen — on credit at t hat. The difference between 1985 and 1974 when we declin ed to suggest treason as an explanation is that there has now been a full decad e for the deaf mute blindmen to acquaint themselves with the facts, and draw back f rom those actions that could be interpreted as treason. On the contrary, not only have the subsidies expand ed, but they have openly included military technology. Henry Kissinger, Chase Manhatt an Bank and the suppliers of the Kama River plant KNEW the plant had potential to ma nufacture military trucks.

It is this fact of CLEAR KNOWLEDGE that p ushes us towards a conclusion of treason.

But the results have bee n available to the Government. On the other hand I have had major difficulties with U .S. Government censorship. I have 15 minutes to tell you about this work. In a few words: there is no such thing as Soviet te chnology. Almost all — perhaps 90- 95 percent — came directly or indirectly from the U nited States and its allies. In effect the United States and the NATO countries hav e built the Soviet Union. Its industrial and its military capabilities. This massive constructio n job has taken 50 years. Since the Revolution in 1917. It has been ca rried out through trade and the sale of plants, equipment and technical assistance. Listening to Administration spokesmen — or some new spaper pundits — you get the impression that trade with the Soviet Union is some new miracle cure for the world's problems. That's not quite accurate. The idea that trade with the Soviets might bring pe ace goes back to 1917. The earliest proposal is dated December 1917-just a few weeks af ter the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. It was implemented in 1920 while the Bo lsheviks were still trying to consolidate their hold on Russia. The result was to guarantee that the Bolsheviks held power: they needed foreign supplies to survive. The history of our construction of the Soviet Union has been blacked out — much of the key information is still classified — along wit h the other mistakes of the Washington bureaucracy. Why has the history been bl acked out? Because 50 years of dealings with the Soviets has b een an economic success for the USSR and a political failure for the United States. It has not stopped war, it has not given us peace. The United States is spending $80 billion a year on defense against an enemy built by the United States and West Europe. Even stranger, the U.S. apparently wants to make su re this enemy remains in the business of being an enemy. Now at this point I've probably lost some of you. W hat I have said is contrary to everything you've heard from the intellectual elite , the Administration, and the business world, and numerous well-regarded Senators — just about everyone. Let me bring you back to earth. First an authentic statement. It's authentic becaus e it was part of a conversation between Stalin and W. Averell Harriman. Ambassador Harriman has been prominent in Soviet trade since the 1930's and is an outspoke n supporter of yet more trade. This"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"is what Ambassador Harriman reported back to the St ate Department at the end of World War II: \"Stalin paid tribute to the assistance rendered by the United States to Soviet industry before and during the War. Stalin* said that about. two-thirds of all the large industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union has been built with the United States' help or technical assistance.\" I repeat: \"two-thirds of all the large industrial e nterprises in the Soviet Union had been built with the United States' help or technica l assistance.\" Two-thirds. Two out of three. Stalin could have said that the other one-third of large industrial enterprises were built by firms from Germany, France, Britain and Italy. Stalin could have said also that the tank plants, t he aircraft plants, the explosive and ammunition plants originated in the U.S. That was June 1944. The massive technical assistanc e continues right down to the present day. Now the ability of the Soviet Union to create any k ind of military machine, to ship missiles to Cuba, to supply arms to North Vietnam, to supply arms for use against Israel — all this depends on its domestic industry. In the Soviet Union about three-quarters of the mil itary budget goes on purchases from Soviet factories. This expenditure in Soviet industry makes sense. No Army has a machine that churns out tanks. Tanks are made from alloy steel, plastic s, rubber and so forth. The alloy steel, plastics and rubber are made in Soviet facto ries to military specifications. Just like in the United States. Missiles are not produced on missile-making machine s. Missiles are fabricated from aluminum alloys, stainless steel, electrical wiring , pumps and so forth. The aluminum, steel, copper wire and pumps are also made in Sovie t factories. In other words the Soviet military gets its parts a nd materials from Soviet industry. There is a Soviet military-industrial complex just as there is an American military- industrial complex. This kind of reasoning makes sense to the man in th e street. The farmer in Kansas knows what I mean. The salesman in California knows what I mean. The taxi driver in New York knows what I mean. But the policy maker s in Washington do not accept this kind of common sense reasoning, and never have done."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"So let's take a look at the Soviet industry that pr ovides the parts and the materials for Soviet armaments: the guns, tanks, aircraft. The Soviets have the largest iron and steel plant i n the world. It was built by McKee Corporation. It is a copy of the U.S. Steel plant i n Gary, Indiana. All Soviet iron and steel technology comes from the U.S. and its allies. The Soviets use open hearth, American electric furnaces, Americ an wide strip mills, Sendzimir mills and so on — all developed in the West and shi pped in as peaceful trade. The Soviets have the largest tube and pipe mill in Europe — one million tons a year. The equipment is Fretz-Moon, Salem, Aetna Standard, Mannesman, etc. Those are not Russian names. All Soviet tube and pipe making technology comes fr om the U.S. and its allies. If you know anyone in the space business ask them how many miles of tubes and pipes go into a missile. The Soviets have the largest merchant marine in the world — about 6,000 ships. I have the specifications for each ship. About two-th irds were built outside the Soviet Union. About four-fifths of the engines for these ships we re also built outside the Soviet Union. There are no ship engines of Soviet design. Those b uilt in side the USSR are built with foreign technical assistance. The Bryansk plant mak es the largest marine diesels. In 1959, the Bryansk plant made a technical assistance agreement with Burmeister & Wain of Copenhagen, Denmark, (a NATO ally), approve d as peaceful trade by the State Dept. The ships that carried Soviet missiles to Cuba ten years ago used these same Burmeister and Wain engines. The ships were in the POLTAVA class. Some have Danish engines made in Denmark and some have D anish engines made at Bryansk in the Soviet Union. About 100 Soviet ships are used on the Haiphong run to carry Soviet weapons and supplies for Hanoi's annual aggression. I was able to identify 84 of these ships. None of the main engines in these ships was designed and manufactured inside the USSR. All the larger and faster vessels on the Haiphong r un were built outside the USSR. All shipbuilding technology in the USSR comes direc tly or indirectly from the U.S. or its NATO allies. Let's take one industry in more detail: motor vehic les. All Soviet automobile, truck and engine technology comes from the West: chiefly the United States. In my books I have listed each Sovie t plant, its equipment and who supplied the equipment. The Soviet military has ove r 300,000 trucks — all from these U.S. built plants."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Up to 1968 the largest motor vehicle plant in the U SSR was at Gorki. Gorki produces many of the trucks American pilots see on the Ho Ch i Minh trail. Gorki produces the chassis for the GAZ-69 rocket launcher used against Israel. Gorki produces the Soviet jeep and half a dozen other military vehicles. And Gorki was built by the Ford Motor Company and t he Austin Company — as peaceful trade. In 1968 while Gorki was building vehicles to be use d in Vietnam and Israel further equipment for Gorki was ordered and shipped from th e U.S. Also in 1968 we had the so-called \"FIAT deal\" — to build a plant at Volgograd three times bigger than Gorki. Dean Rusk and Wait Rostow told Congress and the American public this was peaceful trade — the FIAT plant could not produce military vehicles. Don't let's kid ourselves. Any automobile manufacturing plant can produce military vehicles. I can show anyone who is interested the t echnical specification of a proven military vehicle (with cross-country capability) us ing the same capacity engine as the Russian FIAT plant produces. The term \"FIAT deal\" is misleading. FIAT in Italy d oesn't make automobile manufacturing equipment — FIAT plants in Italy have U.S. equipment. FIAT did send 1,000 men to Russia for erection of the plant — but over half, perhaps well over half, of the equipment came from the United States. From Gleason, TRW of Cleveland and New Britain Machine Co. So in the middle of a war that has killed 46,000 Am ericans (so far) and countless Vietnamese with Soviet weapons and supplies, the Jo hnson Administration doubled Soviet auto output. And supplied false information to Congress and the American public. Finally, we get to 1972 under President Nixon. The Soviets are receiving now — today, equipment an d technology for the largest heavy truck plant in the world: known as the Kama p lant. It will produce 100,000 heavy ten-ton trucks per year — that's more than AL L U.S. manufacturers put together. This will also be the largest plant in the world, period. It will occupy 36 square miles. Will the Kama truck plant have military potential? The Soviets themselves have answered this one. The Kama truck will be 50 per cent more productive than the ZIL-130 truck. Well, that' s nice, because the ZIL series trucks are standard Soviet army trucks used in Viet nam and the Middle East. Who built the ZIL plant? It was built by the Arthur J. Brandt Company of Detroit, Michigan."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Who's building the Kama truck plant? That's classif ied \"se cret\" by the Washington policy makers. I don't have to tell you why. The Soviet T-54 tank is in Vietnam. It was in opera tion at Kontum, An Loc, and Hue a few weeks ago. It is in use today in Vietnam. It has been used against Israel. According to the tank handbooks the T-54 has a Chri stie type suspension. Christie was an American inventor. Where did the Soviets get a Christie suspension? Di d they steal it? No, sir! They bought it. They bought it from the U. S. Wheel Track Layer Corporation. However this Administration is apparently slightly more honest than the previous Administration. Last December I asked Assistant Secretary Kenneth D avis of the Commerce Department (who is a mechanical engineer by trainin g) whether the Kama trucks would have military capability. In fact I quoted on e of the Government's own inter- agency reports. Mr. Davis didn't bother to answer b ut I did get a letter from the Department and it was right to the point. Yes! we k now the Kama truck plant has military capability, we take this into account when we issue export licenses. I passed these letters on to the press and Congress . They were published. Unfortunately for my research project, I also had p ending with the Department of Defense an application for declassification of cert ain files about our military assistance to the Soviets. This application was the n abruptly denied by DOD. It will supply military technology to the Soviets b ut gets a little uptight about the public finding out. I can understand that. Of course, it takes a great deal of self confidence to admit you are sending factories to produce weapons and supplies to a country providing weapons and supplies to kill Americans, Israelis and Vietnamese. In writing. In an election year, yet. More to the point — by what authority does this Adm inistration undertake such policies? Many people — as individuals — have protested our s uicidal policies. What happens? Well, if you are in Congress — you probably get the strong arm put on you. The Congressman who inserted my research findings into the Congressional Record suddenly found himself with primary opposition. He won't be in Congress next year. If you are in the academic world — you soon find it 's OK to protest U.S. assistance to the South Vietnamese but never, never protest U.S. assistance to the Soviets. Forget about the Russian academics being persecuted — we m ustn't say unkind things about the Soviets."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"If you press for an explanation what do they tell y ou? First, you get the Fulbright line. This is peaceful trade. The Soviets are powerful. They have their own technology. It's a way to build friendship. It's a way to a new world order. This is demonstrably false. The Soviet tanks in An Loc are not refugees from th e Pasadena Rose Bowl Parade. The \"Soviet\" ships that carry arms to Haiphong are not peaceful. They have weapons on board, not flower children or Russian tourists. Second, if you don't buy that line you are told, \"T he Soviets are mellowing.\" This is equally false. The killing in Israel and Vietnam with Soviet weapo ns doesn't suggest mellowing, it suggests premeditated genocide. Today — now — the Soviets are readying more arms to go to Syria. For what purpose? To put in a museu m? No one has ever presented evidence, hard evidence t hat trade leads to peace. Why not? Because there is no such evidence. It's an illusion. It is true that peace leads to trade. But that's no t the same thing. You first need peace, then you trade. That does not mean if you trade you will get peace. But that's too logical for the Washington policy ma kers and it's not what the politicians and their backers want anyway. Trade with Germany doubled before World War II. Did it stop World War II? Trade with Japan increased before World War II. Did it stop World War II? What was in this German and Japanese trade? The sam e means for war that we are now supplying the Soviets. The Japanese Air Force a fter 1934. depended on U.S. technology. And much of the pushing for Soviet trad e today comes from the same groups that were pushing for trade with Hitler and Tojo' 35 years ago. The Russian Communist Party is not mellowing. Conce ntration camps are still there. The mental hospitals take the overload. Persecution of the Baptists continues. Harassment of Jews continues, as it did under the T sars. The only mellowing is when a Harriman and a Rockefe ller get together with the bosses in the Kremlin. That's good for business but it's not much help if you are a G.I. at the other end of a Soviet rocket in Vietnam. I've learned something about our military assistanc e to the Soviets. It's just not enough to have the facts — these are ignored by the policy makers."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"It's just not enough to make a common sense case — the answers you get defy reason. Only one institution has been clearsighted on this question. From the early 1920's to the present day only one institution has spoken out . That is the AFL-CIO. From Samuel Gompers in 1920 down to George Meany to day, the major unions have consistently protested the trade policies that buil t the Soviet Union. Because union members in Russia lost their freedom and union members in the United States have died in Korea and Vietnam. The unions know — and apparently care. No one else cares. Not Washington. Not big business . Not the Republican Party. And 100,000 Americans have been killed in Korea and Vietnam-by our own technology. The only response from Washington and the Nixon Adm inistration is the effort to hush up the scandal. These are things not to be talked about. And the pr ofessional smokescreen about peaceful trade continues. The plain fact — if you want it — is that irrespons ible policies have built us an enemy and maintain that enemy in the business of totalita rian rule and world conquest. And the tragedy is that intelligent people have bou ght the political double talk about world peace, a new world order and mellowing Soviet s. I suggest that the man in the street, the average t axpayer-voter thinks more or less as I do. You do not subsidize an enemy. And when this story gets out and about in the Unite d States, it's going to translate into a shift of votes. I haven't met one man in the stre et so far (from New York to California) who goes along with a policy of subsidi zing the killing of his fellow Americans. People are usually stunned and disgusted . It requires a peculiar kind of intellectual myopia to ship supplies and technology to the Soviets when they are instrumental in killing f ellow citizens. What about the argument that trade will lead to pea ce? Well, we've had U.S.-Soviet trade for 52 years. The 1st and 2nd Five Year Plans were built by American companies. To continue a policy that is a total fai lure is to gamble with the lives of several million Americans and countless allies. You can't stoke up the Soviet military machine at o ne end and then complain that the other end came back and bit you. Unfortunately, the human price for our immoral policies is not paid by the policy maker in Washing ton. The human price is paid by the farmers, the students and working and middle cl asses of America."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"The citizen who pays the piper is not calling the t une — he doesn't even know the name of the tune. Let me summarize my conclusions: One: trade with the USSR was started over 50 years ago under President Woodrow Wilson with the declared intention of mellowing the Bolsheviks. The policy has been a total and costly failure. It has proven to be imp ractical — this is what I would expect from an immoral policy. Two: we have built ourselves an enemy. We keep that self-declared enemy in business. This information has been blacked out by successive Administrations. Misleading and untruthful statements have been made by the Executive Branch to Congress and the American people. Three: our policy of subsidizing self-declared enem ies is neither rational nor moral. I have drawn attention to the intellectual myopia of the group that influences and draws up foreign policy. I suggest these policies have no authority. Four: the annual attacks in Vietnam and the war in the Middle East were made possible only by Russian armaments and our past ass istance to the Soviets. Five: this worldwide Soviet activity is consistent with Communist theory. Mikhail Suslov, the party theoretician, recently stated tha t the current detente with the United States is temporary. The purpose of the detente, ac cording to Suslov, is to give the Soviets sufficient strength for a renewed assault o n the West. In other words, when you've finished building the Kama plant and the tru cks come rolling off — watch out for another Vietnam. Six: internal Soviet repression continues — against Baptists, against Jews, against national groups and against dissident academics. Seven: Soviet technical dependence is a powerful in strument for world peace if we want to use it. So far it's been used as an aid-to-dependent-Soviet s welfare program. With about as much success as the domestic welfare program. Why should they stop supplying Hanoi? The more they stoke up the war the more they get from the United States. One final thought. Why has the war in Vietnam continued for four long years under this Administration? With 15,000 killed under the Nixon Administration? We can stop the Soviets and their friends in Hanoi anytime we want to."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"Without using a single gun or anything more dangero us than a piece of paper or a telephone call.

Control Data Corp. Minneapolis, Minn., December 19, 1973. Hon. Richard T. Hanna, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D. C. My Dear Congressman Hanna: On Wednesday, December 5 , 1973, testimony was given before the Subcommittee on International Coop eration in Science and Space of the House Science & Astronautics Committee by Mr. B enjamin Schemmer, Editor, Armed Forces Journal International. This testimony included the statement that Control Data Corporation had advanced the status of Soviet Computer technology by fifteen years with the sale of a Control Data 6200 computer. Such a statement regarding transfer of technology t o the USSR is simply not factual and we are prepared to correct that misstatement as well as other incorrect and misleading references to Control Data's activities with the USSR at the pleasure of your Committee. Meanwhile we respectfully request t he consideration of the following. We have offered to the Socialist countries only sta ndard commercial computers, and these offerings have been in full compliance with t he export control and administrative directives of the Department of Comm erce. The statement regarding a proposed sale of the CYBE R computer is thoroughly confused. CYBER is a generic name denoting a line o f computers. The least powerful model is the Control Data 6200 which is installed a t the Dubna Nuclear Research facility near Moscow. Another is the CYBER 76 which is the most powerful and appears to be the model Mr. Schemmer is referencing . At the appropriate time we will seek advisory opinions and submit to the government export license requests for approval for applications in such areas as weather forecasting, simulation in the Worldwide Weather Watch Program, in econometric mod eling and in education. Competition from West Europe and Japan will be expe cted to address these applications with the same kind of technologies tha t we offer. Many persons, including some of the witnesses befor e your Committee, mistake the offering for sale of old or even current state of t he art hardware for transfer of advanced technology. This is not unusual because in many cases it is difficult for those who are not technically well-informed to dist ingush advanced computer technology. Attempting to treat such a broad and co mplex subject in an informative"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"and accurate manner in a brief statement results in inaccurate, unsubstantiated and misinterpreted inferences and conclusions. For exam ple, it is possible that a computer with a slower arithmetic/logic unit and a very larg e memory may represent more \"advanced\" technology when measured by the size of the problem to be solved than a faster machine with less memory. Also, many minicom puters contain circuit technology more advanced than that of more powerful computers. For this reason it is not possible to properly respond to Mr. Schemmer's remarks in a short letter, however the following are examples of those which need to b e carefully examined before conclusions are reached. All countries including the Socialists have a subst antial base of computer hardware technology on which to build further advances in th e state of the art. The major strength of the U.S. in computer technology is its ability to market superior cost/performance computer systems for a wide range of applications. This does not mean that for any given application or group of app lications, another country cannot build the equivalent as far as performance is conce rned or even exceed what the United States has available. Also, there is no evid ence to my knowledge that the USSR has ever been prevented from carrying out a mi litary project because of the lack of adequate computer technology. Further advances in hardware are less significant t han are software advances for applying computers. We believe that the United Stat es stands to gain significantly from transfer of Soviet knowledge in the basic scie nces. The USSR has many more scientists and engineers than do we, and the better ones in Russia have concentrated on the theoretical fields, such as physics, chemist ry and mathematics -- the latter discipline being of particular value in the design of logic and software in the computer field. We respectfully request that your Committee review the above points and consider incorporating them into the record. We would be ple ased to have the privilege of appearing before your Committee to give you our mor e detailed views on these potential relationships with the Socialist countrie s and in stating our reasons in support of Administration and Congressional trade i nitatives and objectives.

(This letter demonstrate s that the identification of Deaf Mute Blindmen must be made with care) TI's Fred Bucy Warns Against Selling Technology Kno w-How and Turnkey Semiconductor Plants to Communist Natio ns Even as West and East Bloc countries discuss relaxi ng the trade embargo on high technology, a sharp disagreement has developed betw een two major semiconductor manufacturers on how far this relaxation should ext end. One viewpoint is exemplified in last month's Wescon speech by C. Lester Hogan, p resident of Fairchild Camera & Instrument Corp., who wants few restrictions made i n East-West semiconductor trade. Hogan stands ready to sell semiconductor products a s well as the production equipment, technology, and management know-how to t he Communist countries. This would mean the Communists would manufacture high-le vel semiconductor products themselves. The French company, Sescosem, a divisio n of Thomson-CSF, has already broken the ice with the first turnkey semiconductor plant -- sold to Poland -- and Fairchild, waiting for the trade detente, does not deny having one quote outstanding on an MOS plant for Poland, and another two behind that for Russia. On the opposite side is Texas Instruments, whose ex ecutives take a dim view indeed of trade agreements with the Communist bloc, on the grounds that such agreements are not protected by patent rights and do not offer either open markets or the opportunity to build a decent market share. J. Fred Bucy, vice president of Texas Instruments, points out that \"it's one thing to sel l high-technology products in the foreign market, but quite another to sell the know- how to make these products.\" He is adamant against turnkey contracts, and sees an equa l risk in selling the Communists such pieces of production equipment as line-and-exp ose towers, diffusion furnaces, epitaxial reactors, and the like. \"It's axiomatic i n high-technology industries,\" says Bucy, \"that the only adequate payment for know-how is market share. No lump-sum payment or turnkey-service fee can be great enough to fund the research and development necessary to enable the seller to maint ain his advantage. You can be sure,\" he emphasizes, \"that if we give away the kno w-how without obtaining a market share, they won't buy a dime from us -- devices or equipment. We will be giving away the crown jewels.\" In Bucy's eyes, a big question with East-West trade is patent recognition. Because of the longstanding embargo on high-technology trade, few Western semiconductor patents are recognized by the Russians or other Eas tern Europeans. \"Since we can sell into the Communist community only through their gov ernments,\" says Bucy, \"the"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"only way we can participate in their markets is for them to agree to recognize our patents retroactively, pay us full royalties, and/o r give us access to sell directly in their markets on an equal footing against their state-own ed factories.\" Bucy also feels \"that if the free world is footloos e with its technology, it may be building a monster that soon will gobble up domesti c markets. The Communist countries will build their semiconductor capability with Western-supplied production equipment and know-how, and/or with Western-built t urnkey plants protected by high tariff barriers,\" he says, and when they get their costs down and their own markets saturated, they will be \"right out there exporting into ours.\" This means that any semiconductor plant set up in E astern European countries capable of anywhere near the capacity of typical Western ma nufacturing facilities will quickly saturate the domestic Communist market and be ready to export their overcapacity to the West. The semiconductor capability of the Comecon has bee n greatly exaggerated as well, according to Bucy. \"The shell game they're playing, \" says Bucy, \"is taking small quantities of laboratory-developed devices, giving them to people who are visiting Russia, and saying 'look at our capability -- now w hy not sell us the equipment to manufacture this, because we can do it ourselves an yway.' If they can, let them do it. The truth is, they don't have the capability of pro ducing in large quantities at high yields.

Irwin Miller) and Financing of Marxist Revolutionary Activities Within the United States. I. INTRODUCTION This Section has been reviewing available data on v arious; philanthropic foundations in an effort to determine if their activities are c onsistent with their announced goals. In this instance we have made n preliminary analysi s of the Cummins Eugine Foundation which although a legitimate philanthropi c enterprise, nonetheless would appear to serve as a conduit for funds to support b lack militants and organizations which are known to consistently promote radical rev olutionary activities. This analysis roughly outlines the data presently a vailable. Obviously, there is considerably more to be learned concerning CEF's ov erall activities. Additional inquiries to the Fill are contemplated and liaison has already been established with the Internal Revenue Service in an effort to develop ou r respective interests. Unfortunately, the complex nature of this tax exemp t foundation does not lend itself to an easy explanation. It is suggested that the re ader make frequent reference to the attached chart which will hopefully enhance underst anding of the organization. II. BACKGROUND The Cummins Engine Foundation (CEF) was established in 1954 as a philanthropic organization by J. Irwin Miller, Chirman of the Boa rd, Cummins Engine Coral)any, Columbus, Indiana. Mr. Miller is a highly respected 62-year old civic leader who in recent years has devoted much of his time and money to various charities and religious pursuits. He is regarded as a part of the \"avant garde of the civil rights movement.\" CEF is financed solely by Cummins Engine Company, w hich is the parent of a worldwide concern reputed to be the largest indepen dent producer of high speed diesel engines. In 1970 CEC's pretax profit was $44 ,564,365.00, of which five percent was allocated to CEF. CEF generally receives one to three million dollars annually. CEF is comprised of two sections: (1) the original County Related Philanthropic (CRP), which provides money for educational, health and social welfare projects in Bartholomew County, Indiana and (2) the General Phi lanthropic (GP). which was established in 1908. Little is known about the oper ations of the former and this report deals exclusively with the known activities of the GP section. which shares the pretax profits with the CRP."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"In an effort to assist in the cultural and economic development of the nation's black people, CEF's GP section provides large sums of tax -free dollars which are distributed through program directors in five cities, viz., Bal timore, Washington, D.C., I,os Angeles, Atlanta and Chicago. There appear to be no auditing procedures once the funds have been allocated by CEF to the program dir ectors. This situation creates broad opportunities for misdirection or misappropri ation of monies. The overall thrust of this report, therefore, is to illustrate how a s eemingly munificent activity can, by divers means, serve to aid the objectives of radica l individuals and organizations. Specifically, CEF has provided a vehicle whereby: (1) Monies were given to one organization earmarked for the use of another organization which in turn has recruited black acti vists to participate in revolutionary training in Communist China in December 1971: (2) CEF contributed $5,500.00 during 1970 to the In stitute for Policy Studies (IPS). A Resident Fellow of IPS also serves as the Washingto n Program Director for CEF; (3) CEF funds are utilized for the purchase and ope ration of printing equil)-ment ultimately used by groups advocating revolutionary social change; (4) A close working relationship exists between org anizations funded by CEF and certain Marxist-Leninist organizations. One of thes e is headed by James Forman. a principal advocate of black revolutionary training abroad; (5) A CEF Program Director was indicted for incitin g to riot during a demonstration at a peniteutiary in October 1970 while serving as a self-appointed spokesman for prisoners' grievances: (6) The aforementioned Program Director has purchas ed a 130-acre farm in his name. apparently using CEF funds. The announced purpose f or the farm is that it is to be used as a youth camp to \"train children in self-def ense and in African culture\": (7) Seemingly irregular fiscal practices exist with respect CEF-funded organizations:in Baltimore and inordinate amounts o f money are dispensed for such items as \"materials\"; (8) The possibility exists that certain \"dummy\" org anizations have been created in order to siphon-off funds which are destined for ot herwise legitimate activity. III . DETAILS To date the primary area of investigation into CEF activities has been concentrated in Baltimore, Maryland. The paucity of information con cerning CEF funded activities in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago and New York stems from the fact that investigation bas not yet been actively instituted in those areas . For this reason the scope of this report will be limited mainly to those activities o f CEF in the Baltimore, Maryland area."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"The CEF Program Director in Baltimore is Walter Liv ely, a 29-year old black activist who since 1961 has been variously involved with the Socialist party, CORE, U-JOIN (a jobs for blacks pro,ram he organized in Baltimor e), SNCC and the Urban Coalition. He now heads the Baltimore Neighborhood Commons (BN C), a corporation through whose bank account CEF channels a portion of its mo ney. Presumably, CEF money enabled Lively to establish the Liberation House Pr ess. which currently offers a full range of printing services at cut-rates to \"radical groups.\" Lively, with his fellow BNC officers, Austin Sydnor and Kenya Kiongozi, also operates the Liberation Bookstore. The BNC, the Liberation House Press, Liberation Boo kstore, and an office of the International Black Workers Congress (IBWC) are all located at the same address in Baltimore. Lively, Sydnor and Kiongozi also maintai n close liaison with the UBWC, the Black Panther Party (BPP) and SOUL, School (SS) , and significantly, these individuals were arrested and indicted for inciting to riot at a BPP-SS rally at the Maryland State Penitentiary in October 1970. In December 1970, Lively purchased for $15,000.00 a 130-acre farm in Bedford. Pennsylvania, where Liberation Press and SOUL Schoo l are to build a youth camp to \"train children in self-defense and African culture .\" (SOUL School is a \"non-profit educational institution\" whose literature in the pa st has advocated black revolution.) The matador in which BNC funds are expended seems t o suggest a lack of auditing procedures. From December 21. 1970 to September 17, 1971 a total of $46,-887.62 was withdrawn from the BNC account. Of this amount, checks totaling $17.135.00 were made payable to Cash or an officer of the BNC, usually for reason of \"materials\" or \"supplies.\" It should be noted that checks total ing $2,-830.14 were made payable to companies which deal in paper and printing supplies and $11,50S.00 was withdrawn for purchase of a printing press. Similarly suspect are the activities of organizations which have received CEF funds through BNC and Livel y. In 1971 CEF made available $12,000.00 to BNC design ated for the National Association of Black Students (NABS). an organizati on whose stated purpose is to provide a communications network for black college students. As of Novem-her 1971 NABS was recruiting revolutionary black students to travel to China with a group recruited by William Epton's Marxist-Leninist Colle ctive. The express purpose of the trip is to provide training for student organizers to further revolution in the United States. At least $5,000.00 from CEF was sent to BNC in 1971 marked for the Frantz Fanon Institute (EFI). FFI is allegedly an educational en tity dedicated to inculcating Marxist- Leninist teachings in the minds of workers and stud ents. Although a reference to its inception was made by radical activist James Forman at a NABS meeting in December 1970. the actual location of FFI is presen tly unknown. The available description of FFI's structure anti program was fou nd attached to an International Black Workers Congress (IBWC) mailing list. It shou ld be noted that James Forman founded IBWC and traveled to Algeria in 1970 obsten sibly to gather information for a book he was writing about Frantz Fanon. In September 1971 the three officers of the BNC tra veled to Gary. Indiana for the IBWC conference called by James Forman. The purpose of the conference war to instruct local chapters in the techniques of organi zing workers in factories to further"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"the cause of destroying capitalism and building a s ocialist state. Forman, who traveled to Hanoi and Peking in July 1971, had copies of the 16 page Manifesto of the IBWC distributed to the 200 conferees, who were present by invitation only. This document includes, among other objectives: the elimination o f \"parasitic capitalistic vultures\"; total disarmament of the U.S.; destruction of all p olice forces and their replacement with peoples militia; and an end to the blockade of Cuba. The program designed to effect these goals stresses teaching workers and st udents Marxist-Leninist ideology and promotes acceptance of money.from white institu tions as a good revolutionary tactic. The Manifesto concludes with a 6-point methodology for revolutiona ry work quoted from a 1970 North Vietnamese publication. Th e precise nature of the relationship betwen IBWC and BNC is unclear. It is nonetheless noteworthy that in April 1971. CEF'S program directors were said to be attempting to organize black American workers. Ivanhoe Donaldson, CEF's Washington, D.C. Program D irector, also serves as a Resident Fellow for the Institute for Policy Studie s (IPS) which has been characterized as \"a radical think tank.\" tie was se lected for the CEF position because of his contacts with \"leading black activists.\" Don aldson served concurrently as a leader for the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Com mittee (SNCC) in New York City and as an IPS fellow. During the period 1967-1969 Donaldson associated wi th Stokely Carmichael and SNCC leaders Stanley Wise and James Paul Garrett. I n October 1969, Garrett opened the Center for Black Education (CBE) which in 1971 received a lump sum of $10,000.00 from IPS. CBE is characterized 'as an ed ucational institution independent of and opposed to the aims of the American nation, and dedicated to the liberation of African people. CBE affiliates are involved with the African-orient ed Drum and Spear Bookstore, which was founded by Ivanhoe Donaldson and is manag ed by Marvin Holloway, who is also associated with IPS. Two other IPS affiliat es who are on the CBE staff operate the Drum and Spear Press in Washington, D.C. Intere stingly, CEF's list of projects includes a \"Drummonds Sphere Press\" in New York, wh ose purported function is to print black children's literature. To date no infor mation bas been developed to verify the existence of \"Drummonds Sphere,\" whose semantic similarity to Drum and Spear would seem more than coincidental. A survey of organizations involved in the CEF finan cial web reveals consist-eat efforts to disseminate revolutionary materials and information. For example, IBWC's program calls for the establishment of bookstores a nd printing concerns to better spread the word on Marxism-Leninism. Gwen Patton, f ounder of NABS, stated at an IBWC conference that efforts are being made to esta blish bookstores on or near black campuses and communities to circulate \"political ed ucation\" material advocating the Marxist-Leninist line. The Liberation House Press i n Baltimore, which is owned by Walter Lively, is described as a print shop for \"mo vement groups\" and operates in conjunction with the Liberation Bookstore. CBE in W ashington, with its close ties to the Drum and Spear Bookstore and Drum and Spear Pre ss, has sent its members to Baltimore to learn to operate Walter Lively's print ing press. Still unaccounted for is the mysterious Drummonds Sphere Press in New York."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"IV. CONCLUSION As previously noted the primary investigative activ ity in this case has been concentrated in the Baltimore, Maryland area. A con certed effort will be made to seek new data and refine that which already exists. It w ould appear that an exhaustive analysis of the complicated maze of subsidiary rela tionship and interlocking interests will take on greater significance when examined in detail. Obviously, additional investigation is required in order to supply information concerning the many unanswered questions. a few of which are as follows: (1) What are the motives of J.

(2) How much money goes to the respective programs and program directors? (3) What is the specific nature and organization of the vehicle used to disburse CEF funds in Atlanta, New York, Washington, D.C., Los A ngeles and Chicago? (4) What is the true relationship between CEF and I PS and what roles do IPS employees Ivanhoe Donaldson, Courtland Cox, Charles Earl Cobb and James P. Garrett play?

We have circulated certain information in our posse ssion to close associates. Without exception they are shocked, shaken, disbelieving... and angry. Before we spell out the details for you, how do we define treason? Treason is defined in the Constitution as \"aid and comfort\" to an enem y of the United States. Second, following this how do we define an enemy? We spend $300 billion a year on defense against the Soviet Union, so logically the Soviet Union is an enemy. We cannot SIMULTANEOUSLY have a $300 billion defense b udget against the Soviet Union and give \"aid and comfort\" for the Soviet military stru cture without raising the question of treason. This topic is discussed at length in a forthcoming book, The Best Enemy Money Can Buy. Who is this secret group? Why do we suggest treason ? US-USSR Trade And Economic Council, Inc. (TEC, for short) This bland official sounding title disguises a formal joint Soviet-American apparatus to conduit advanced technology with pure military applications to the Soviet Union.

Mutter, The Key U.S. Operative The key American operative in the New York office o f TEC is ALFRED J. MURRER, former Chairman of the Gleason Works, a large machi ne tool firm in Rochester, New York with plants in Belgium and West Germany. Murrer works closely day to day with the Soviet eng ineers. For our example here we select Alexander Y. Markov , listed as a Project Engineer. These two men joint ly screen American business companies and if they find the offered technology interesting, attempt to draw the firm into the TEC net. We can dismiss Alexander Markov briefly. Markov is a Soviet citizen, chemical engineer, suspected KGB, resident in New York for a lmost three years. Markov's job is to identify the usefulness of technology to the Soviet military complex. As Markov is a Soviet national, the question of treason does not arise. So far as we know Markov is a patriotic Soviet citizen doing his job. His on ly defect (that we have identified) is a habit of chainsmoking Turkish type oval cigarettes which overwhelms American visitors (unused to the pungent odor) in clouds of smoke. Alfred Murrer deserves more attention because he is a U.S. citizen, born Rochester, New York 1923, educated MIT and University of Roche ster. Before joining TEC, Murrer was Chairman of the Board of the Gleason Wor ks, with 42 years service. The Gleason Works is a long established prescision tool maker specializing in precision machine tools for cutting and grinding st raight, zerol, spiral, bevel, hyphoid gears and curvic couplings with associated tooling and equipment. It is vital to note that Gleason Works is in bad fi nancial shape, with heavy losses during the past few years. Every last machine tool produced by Gleason Works h as military applications . We know from experience that there is no purely civ ilian industry in the Soviet Union. All plants are first and foremost military plants. All technology is examiend first and foremost for military applications. This was demons trated 20 years ago in my three volume WESTERN TECHNOLOGY AND SOVIET ECONOMIC DEVEL OPMENT and since confirmed by dozens of defecting Soviet e ngineers. This thesis is accepted today by Department of Defense and Central Intellig ence Agency. (It is not accepted by Department of State, which operates in a fantasy world of its own making.) What is the relationship between the financially tr oubled Gleason Works and the Soviet Union TODAY?"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"At end 1985 Gleason had a gear-cutting machine popu lation in the Soviet Union in excess of 2500 units, including over 300 at the Kam a River Truck Plant, which produces military vehicles for Afghan genocide. Gleason has trained more than 300 Soviet engineers (actually technicians, but the Soviets classify them as engineers) to maintain the se Gleason machines. Their end use is preeminently military. Gleason services this 2500 machine tool population out of its Rochester, New York and Badour, Belgium plants. In addition, Gleason is building a gear arbor plant for the Soviets (how this ever passed Export Control is a s ignificant unanswered question). Gleason's subsidiary, Alliance Tool, supplies equip ment and systems for manufacture of carbide tooling, vital for many military applica tions. Mutter Uses Deceit To Entice U.S. Firms Into The TE C Net American businessmen faced by a Soviet national would presumably be cautious about disclosing technology of military significanc e. At least one would hope that is the case. However, an American faced by another American would assume that his guard can be dropped because the American negotiato r is looking out for U.S. national interests. In the case of TEC we have evidence that American n ationals in the organization are working for the Soviet side. Specifically we have evidence that Murrer is using deceit, i.e., false statements, to entice U.S. busi nessmen to transfer technology to the Soviet Union. Alfred Murrer made the following statement to an Am erican businessman (whom we shall call \"X\") in the presence of Alexander Markov . Businessman \"X\" was concerned that his technology might be copied by the Soviets. Not unreasonable, because every New York taxi driver and Chicago bartender knows th e Soviets copy our technology. When businessman \"X\" queried Murrer about this poss ibility, Murrer made the following reply: \"No. The Japanese went over a new Gleason cutter wi th rulers and cameras 'after hours' at a 1965 NMTBA Show (National Machine Tool Builders' Association) to duplicate it. The Soviets would not do this.\" This is a demonstrably untrue statement. It is, of course, common knowledge that the Soviets operate copying centers to duplicate the mo st useful of Western technology. What is highly significant is that Gleason gear-cut ting machines have been duplicated by the Soviets without permission. As Mu rrer worked 42 years for Gleason and ended up as Chairman of the Board, Murr er knows this. Here is an extract from a State Department report ( Decimal File 861.797/37):"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"\"Engineers sent by firms were offered individual co ntracts to stay and work directly for Soviet organizations in order to copy foreign e quipment. J.

Particularly when it involves technology with milit ary end use?

The above information generates highly disturbing conclusions . 2. The Administration is conning the American public . The Administration is playing a double game . It creates highly publicized \"spy trials\" and pro clamations about stopping the flow of military technology to t he Soviet Union. Why? Because the Administration knows that over 150 Soviet weapons systems are based on U.S. technology. 3. On the other hand, Mr. Reagan has ordered a step-up in transfers and the Administration is supporting a Soviet technical vacuum operation in New York. The Administration is checking the flow of \"secrets \" for public consumption while secretly aiding the transfer of technology behind the scenes to man ufacture the previously stolen \"secrets.\" 4. Don't waste your time writing angry letters to y our Congressman. They don't know enough or claim it's all perfectly legal. The vital task ahead in 1986 is to make the information — and more in our files — widely known. We are lifting the copyright on this issue. Please xerox and circulate as widely as you can. 5. We have to organize a nationwide conference on TECHNIC AL TRANSFERS: IS IT TREASON?, with all the many concerned people, organizations and interests. This means we have to forget incidental differences and unite on this one issue, i.e., the survival of the United States, at least until we achieve a sane policy.

Details of the case, which involves efforts by the Soviet bloc to obtain equipment crucial to the production of highly sought computer semiconductors and integrated circuits, emerged when a Spanish company that maint ains offices in Illinois agreed to pay a criminal fine of $1 million for illegally exp orting high-technology equipment between 1979 and 1982. U.S. Attorney Joseph E. diGenova issued a statement saying the violation, by Piher Semiconductores, S.A., of Barcelona, was \"one of th e most significant in the area of United States high-technology transfer.\" Under an agreement between the Department of Justic e and Piher, the company pleaded guilty to two felony counts, waived indictm ent by a grand jury and agreed to pay the fine. In addition, the company, which alrea dy has been barred for two and a half years from exporting U.S.-made products, will remain barred for an additional nine months. Equipment valued at $2.4 million was shipped to the Soviet Union and Cuba, and other highly sensitive items did not get through, a ccording to Pentagon and Department of Commerce officials familiar with the case. Those officials described the lot as items at the t op of the Soviets' list of material needed to help them move into the age of highly sop histicated, computer-dependent weapons. \"They have a major need for it in the military,\" sa id one Pentagon official, speaking on the condition he not be identified. \"It would pr obably narrow the gap considerably in weapons systems, lending a qualitative edge to t heir quantitative edge.\" Officials said the Soviet Union, which in the past has tried to obtain semiconductors and integrated circuits produced in the West, recen tly had shifted its emphasis to obtaining the equipment needed to manufacture the c ircuitry — the miniature wires that carry electronic data in such common gadgets a s pocket calculators and digital watches, as well as in the most sophisticated space weapons."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"\"Such equipment is among the Soviet bloc's most hig hly sought American high- technology goods needed for expanding and improving the bloc's lagging microprocessor and semiconductor production capabil ity,\" said Donald Creed, a Department of Commerce spokesman. He said departmental documents confirm that $2.4 mi llion of these goods were illegally re-exported to Cuba and Russia... The mos t sensitive, state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing equipment went to the S oviet Union,\" after first being shipped to Switzerland. Creed said the material shipped to Cuba, and additi onal equipment the Cubans were unable to obtain, \"would have given them the capabi lity to produce semiconductors and integrated circuits.\" \"As far as we know, the plant didn't get into produ ction,\" he said. \"They didn't get everything they needed.\" However, according to the agreement accepted by Piher, Cuba already has a semiconductor manufacturing faci lity in Pinar del Rio. The indictment said two senior officers of the Span ish company, Jose Puig Alabern and Francesc Sole I Planas, reached agreements with Soviet and Cuban trade organizations to obtain the equipment from U.S. man ufacturers. The two are believed to be in Spain and out of reach of U.S. law enforce ment officials. Piher itself apparently does not make semiconductor manufacturing equipment, according to a spokesman for a Silicon Valley marke t research firm. \"To my knowledge, they don't make equipment,\" said Jerry Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research Inc., a San Jose company that does ma rket research on the semiconductor industry. The indictment states that Puig reached an agreemen t with Imexin, a Cuban foreign trade organization, \"to provide and erect a complet e integrated circuit manufacturing facility\" valued at $19 million. It said Puig and Sole, who eventually quit the comp any, negotiated with Technoproimport, a Soviet foreign trade organizatio n, to sell the Soviets \"two highly sophisticated U.S.-origin integrated circuit manufa cturing systems.\" U.S. officials and information in the indictment sa id U.S. officials in Spain, checking at Piher facilities to determine whether the falsel y completed export license documents were being adhered to, were shown fake eq uipment intended to resemble that exported by Piher."}]
