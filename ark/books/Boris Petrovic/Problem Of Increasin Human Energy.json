The so-called law s of natur e are the action and i nteraction of the combined consci ousness es and wills which pervade the kos mos.

The etheric body , ether-body , æther body , or vital body is one of the subtle bodies in esoteric phi losophies. Aristotle's psyche thre ptikon (vegetative or nutritive soul) a lso bears com parison with the etheric bo dy . The term etheric in the Theosophy contex t seems to derive from the w ritings of C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Bes ant. In Theosophy, the P rana principle is un derstood as the vi tal, life-susta ining force of living beings and the vital ener gy in all natural proc esses of the universe.

Prana suffuses all living for m but is not itself the Atma or ind ividual sou l. These Rosicrucian teach ings, cal led Western Wisdom Teachings, explain that the v ital body is the same body as the etheric d ouble ; this body, through which vital force ingresses, is constituted b y four ethers.

ANIMA MUNDI (Latin) is the world soul, a pure ether eal spir it, which was proclaimed by some ancient philosophers to be dif fused throughout all nature. I t was thought to animate al l matter in the sa me sens e in which the soul was thought to animate the human. The philosopher Anaxagoras of Claz omenae, born about 500 BC, intro duced a new factor, nous (mind), which arran ged all other things in their proper or der, started them in motion, and contin ues to control them. Pl ato tended to treat nous as the only immortal part of the soul. Akasha ( Akash ) is the Sanskr it word meaning aether in both its elemental and mythologic al senses. In Hinduism Akasha me ans the bas is and esse nce of all things. The source of everything that e xists. One of the Panchamahabh uta, or five great elements ; its main characteristic is Shabda (sound). In Hindi the me aning of Akash is sky. So wha t is the Meeting Poi nt of Heaven and Earth? What is the me chanism described by sages as \"on ea rth as it is in heav en\"? Nous in Eastern Orthodox Christian ity is the e ye of the soul. Just as the soul of man, is created by God, man's so ul is intel ligent and noetic. St Thalassios wrote that God created bei ngs \"with a capacity to receive the Spir it and to attain kn owledge of Hi mself; He has brou ght into existence the sens es and sensor y perceptio n to serve such beings\". Eastern Orthodox Christians hold that God did this b y creating mankind with intelligence and noetic facu lties. Angels have intelligence a nd nous, whereas me n have reason, nous and se nsory perception. This follows the idea that man is a microcosm and an expressi on of the w hole cre ation or ma crocosmos; it is through the he aled and corrected nous and the inte lligence that ma n know s and experiences God.

Figure 17: Longitudinal EM Pump / Plasma vortex compression A Birkeland current generally refers to any electric curre nt in a space plas ma, but mo re specifically when charged particles i n the current follow magnetic fiel d lines (hence, Birkeland currents are als o known as field-aligned currents). They are caused b y the movement of a plasma perpendicular to a magnetic fie ld. It was Kristian Birk eland in 1908 who postulate d the existence of the currents that bear his name. And in 1939, Nobel Laureate Ha nnes Alfvén was the first physicist to promote Birkeland’s theory in a paper ab out electrica l currents generated by the solar wind. Alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe, it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic m agnetic fiel d. If astrophysicists recognized this simple fact, the glowing arm s of spiral galaxies would at last be see n as electromagnetic structures, subject to electromagnetic forces. The point nee ds to be m ade again and again: In our Electric Universe there is no ne ed for weird \"dark ma tter.\" Originally Birkeland curre nts referre d to electric currents that contribute to the aurora, caused by the interacti on of the plasma in the Sol ar Wind with the Earth's magnetosphere. The current flo ws earthw ards down the mo rning side of the Earth's ionosphere, arou nd the polar regions, an d spacewards up the e vening side of the ionosphere. These Birk eland currents are now sometimes called auroral electrojets. The currents were predicted in 1 903 by Norwegian explorer and p hysicist Kristian Birk eland,"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"who undertook e xpeditions i nto the Arctic Circle to study the auror a. In 1974, theoretical wo rk of Hannes Alfvén on fiel d-aligned electric curre nts in the aur ora (based on e arlier wo rk by Kristian Birke land) was confir med by satellite obs ervations. The discovery of Birkeland curre nts in Earth's m agnetosph ere has resu lted in a drastic change in our understandi ng of aurora d ynamics, now attributed to filamentati on of Birkleand charg ed-partic le sheets following the Earth's d ipole magnetic fie ld lines into vortex current bundles. Although p lasma vortex structures are well known phenomena in contemporary space plasma physics, few attempts have been made to associate p lasma vortices w ith large astrophysical objects. Indeed, Ha nnes Alfvén was a pioneer in this respect by associating the early solar system w ith a plasma vortex. By extrapolating the size and strength of magnetospher ic currents to galaxies, Alfvén sug gests a number of confined regions that flow through interstel lar clou ds and assist in ga laxy formation. Figure 18: Plasma vortex / Time mirror The vortices are produced by a phenomenon called PINCH EFFECT . A straight thread of electrica l current produces a cylindrical magnetic field, w hich attracts other curre nts flowing in the same directi on. The tiny current threads tend to PINCH together , drawing the plasma with them. The converging threa ds twine into a ro pe and become plasma whirlwinds. Pinches occur n aturally in electrica l discharges such as li ghtning bolts, the aurora, current sheets, and solar flares."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Figure 19: Time mirror functi on - Two emitters The curr ent state of civilization is u nsustain able due to irrational exuberance an d destruction of the biosphere.
