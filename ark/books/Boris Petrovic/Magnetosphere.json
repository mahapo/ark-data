However, there is a contin ual sup ersonic o utflow of ionized gas or plas ma from the sun that confines an d distorts the terrestria l magnetic fie ld into a ca vity with a long tai l extendin g hundreds of earth radii in the antisolar d irection. This cavit y, called the m agnetosph ere, is very responsive to cha nging solar w ind con ditions. Ph ysical processes occurr ing there in mo dulate the energy flow carried by the sol ar wind to the earth. At times the ma gnetic cavit y acts as a shield deflecti ng the incident energy; at other times it acts as an accelerator , driven by the so lar wind, creating char ged partic le beams that hit the ne utral upper at mosp here, causi ng it to light up with the bri lliant forms of the pol ar aurora.

Figure 2 shows the ef fect of this plasma, advancing as an i nfinite pl anar front against an initially dipolar fie ld. The plasma, being highly conductive, excludes fiel d lines from its interior . This e xclus ion is mathematical ly equivalent to the creation of an equ al and p arallel dipole m oment, i.e., the fie ld due to a simple current loop, at a distance be hind the front that is eq ual to the distance the earth's di pole is ahead of the front. If the front of the gas were not planar, as would necessar ily occur as the front moved past the earth, the strength of this image dipole and its positi on would both cha nge. In the case of the real m agnetosph eric configurati on, this image dipole descripti on is only approximate.

Bow Shock The wind of ions a nd electro ns that flo ws from the sun, the so lar wind, travels about 400 km per seco nd, almost 1 1/2 m illion km p er hour.

Perhaps the inte nsity of the rad iation belts and their int imate control (at most en ergies) b y the sol ar wind was rightl y a surprise, but we certai nly shou ld have been prep ared to observe some trap ped partic le flux. Fig.7 The m otion of charged partic les in the earth's m agnetic field is co mplicate d but is easily visual ized b y dividi ng it into three components.

If the m agnetic or electric fie ld in the ma gnetosphere is u nstead y, the particles w ill scatter and n ot retrace exactl y the sa me p ath as the y gyrate about magnetic fie ld lines, bounce a long the m or drift across them.

Even though this proc ess rando mly scatters particles in and out, it can le ad to a net motion if there ar e gradients in the particle distributi on. If A and B are two adjacent volum es with more particles in A than i n B, and if we scatter particles eq ually in A and B, more p articles w ill move from A to B than from B to A beca use there are mo re partic les in A to be scattered. So, too, in the magnetosp here partic les will be scattered or radi ally diffuse inward or outward depen ding on the radial gradients with a rate dependent on the am plitude of oscillations in the magnetic (or el ectric) field at the drift freque ncy of the partic le. This process is somewhat complicated b y the fact that particl es gain energy when the y diffuse inw ard and lose e nergy when the y diffuse out ward. Thus, keeping pr oper track of partic le energy is nec essar y in calc ulatin g radial gradients in the magnetos phere. Becaus e of the existence of this radial diffusion, partic les can get into the ma gnetos phere fro m the solar wind. This process ap pears to be mo re im porta nt at higher energies than at lower energies. At ener gies be low a few tens of keV, the el ectric field mu st be taken into accou nt in describ ing the mot ion of charg ed particles. The fact that this electric fie ld has lar ge temporal variations me ans that at low energies, esp ecially in the outer ma gnetosphere, particle trajector ies often switch from being closed an d totally inside the magnetos pheric cavity to be ing ope n to direct entry from (or exit to) the sol ar wind or, equally importa nt, open to direct entr y from the ma gnetotail. Thus, at the low est energies in the distant magnetosp here the charg ed particle population is ex tremely variab le. Finally, we note the existence of the earth's i onosp here w hich cons ists of electro ns and ions but w ith energies far be low those of the radiati on belt partic les. If it were possible to supply energy to these particles e ither by heating or through el ectric fields al ong the magnetic fiel d (so-call ed para llel electric fiel ds), then these co ld ion ospher ic particles could bec ome an im porta nt sourc e for the rad iation b elts.

Ordinary particl e-partic le collisions, w hich in the case of charge d particles ar e called Coulomb coll isions, are q uite rare in the radiation be lts, except at the foot of field lines where particles ca n hit the atmosphere. One type of partic le-partic le col lision that is thou ght to be i mportant for protons is charg e-exchange in w hich a fast proton gains a n electron from a cold hydroge n atom in the earth's atmosphere. The fast proton becomes a fast neutral particle an d escapes fro m the field line abo ut which it had b een g yrating.

Generally, thoug h, wave-partic le reson ances provide the col lisions for untrappi ng the radiation belt particl es. This is especially true for electrons that cannot char ge exchan ge. Very early in the history of the rad iation b elts it was noticed that electrons o n magnetic field lines that extend beyond 1.5 earth radii decayed from the belts much mo re quick ly than they should h ave due to particl e-particl e collisions.

The Plasmasphere An important source of charge d particles for the magnetos phere is the earth's ionosphere, but in gen eral these p articles are not ne arly so energetic as those particles that com e from the so lar wind. The ionosphere is cre ated principally by the ultraviolet radiation from the sun be ing abs orbed b y the earth's u pper atm osphere and there by being ionized. The temperature of the ionosp here is coo l (~2000 K) b y magnetos pheric standards but hot enough that it cou ld \"evaporate \" up magnetic fie ld lines and pop ulate the m agnetosph ere w ith a mo derately dens e population of cold e lectrons an d ions, perhaps 1 00 to 100,000 cm 3 depending on distanc e. Howe ver, this effect is seen o nly close to the earth. The lightning-g enerated whis tlers, thoug ht originally to control the fluxes of ener getic electrons, provide a useful di agnostic of the dens ity of the magnetosp heric pl asma because the y travel m ore slowly the denser the plas ma becom es. Furth ermore, one can use the dispers ion of the whistler, that is, its travel time as a functio n of frequ ency, to tell where the w histler tra veled. Thus, even without spac ecraft it was poss ible to tell that the magnetosp heric cavit y was filled w ith cold ionosph eric plas ma only out to about four earth radii, ab ove that distance the plasma d ensity sudd enly dropped. It was soon postu lated that the location of this drop i n plasma de nsity or plasmapause separated a reg ion in which the pl asma rotated abo ut the earth, the plasmasphere, from a region i n which the plasma moved b ut did not rotate in closed p aths around the earth. The re ason for this outer region of circ ulatio n was the drag on the cavit y by the solar wind. If the drag we re sim ple viscosit y, then two eddies would be set up at dawn and at dusk. However, if the dra g were caus ed by electric al conn ection bet ween the solar wind and the magnetos phere, the plasma in this outer region could dr ift throug h the magnetop ause out into the solar wind and be lost.

The e lectric field that is associ ated w ith the particles w hich at small radial dista nces drift around the earth is ca lled the corotati on electric fiel d. The pl asmapause occurs ap proximate ly where the corotati on electric fie ld equals the co nvection el ectric field.

Magnetosp here Dynamic s One of the earliest expla nations for the source of the aurora w as made shortl y after the advent of the spac e era by J. W. Dungey who proposed that the magnetiz ed plas ma in the so lar wind merged wi th the magnetize d plasma in the terrestria l magnetos phere so that the ma gnetic fie ld of the earth and the sun beca me co nnected, or recon nected, since this process wa s suppos ed to start and stop. This reconn ection m odel provided a simple explan ation for the co nvection e lectric field d iscussed a bove, provided a source for the ener gizatio n of aur oral partic les, and pre dicted inti mate co ntrol of magnetosp heric proc esses by the orientatio n of the ma gnetic field in the so lar wind, i.e., the interpla netar y magnetic fie ld. As shown in Figure 1 1 , this m odel pred icts a neutral point or lin e on the front of the magnetosp here at which magnetic en ergy is rele ased to the plasma and o ne in the ma gnetotail aga in at which plasma is en ergize d. While in fact this m odel was propose d as a stea dy state mo del which can be treated sim ply in terms of electric fields an d plasma drifts, it is convenie nt to think in term s of magnetic field lines m oving. Thus, in Dungey's model, fiel d lines i n the solar wind of directio n opposite to the terrestrial fie ld join with the earth's fiel d when they are co nvected aga inst it. This early insight into ma gnetospher ic behavior did not ach ieve un iversal acc laim an d it is only recentl y that it has become g enera lly accepte d. The m odel mo st easily explai ns the entry and behavior of solar flare partic les in the ma gnetotail and p olar caps; the response of geo magnetic activit y to the solar w ind velocit y and the ma gnitude and directio n of the interp lanetar y magnetic field; the v ariations in m agnetospher ic param eters such as the size of the polar ca p, position of the polar cus p and field strength in the magnetotai l; and the structure of the magneto pause."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Fig.11 Although the Du ngey reconnectio n model is co uched in steady state term s, the rea l magnetosp here is sel dom in a stead y state.

In short, the ma gnetosphere, bec ause of reconn ection, is very dynamic. This c yclic proc ess of flux transfer to the tai l and back to the magnetosp here is ma nifeste d in the aurora l zone as a ma gnetos pheric su bstorm wi th brighten ing an d motion of the aurora as w ell as ener gizatio n and injection of magnetosp heric partic les."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Fig.12 If the m agnetosph ere is d ynam ic, the ma gnetopaus e is even mo re so beca use, not only are the processes op erating at the magneto pause sens itive to external con ditions, but also the ma gneto pause m oves very rapidly in respons e to sol ar wind and magnetosp heric press ure chang es.

These stress es are transmitted to the ion ospher e via current s ystems which flow along magnetic fie ld lines and clos e in the ionosp here across fie ld lines.

We note that stress es exerted b y interna l magnetosp heric proc esses behave in the same way and have similar effects on the ionosp heric pl asma. Thus, explosive reconn ection in the ma gnetotail can p ush the ionosphere pl asma toward the da yside at auror al and sub aurora l latitudes j ust as the solar wind pul ls plasma acr oss the polar cap. While the ma gnetic fie ld lines in the ma gnetos phere ar e very good con ductors for the electric currents flo wing par allel to them, the y are not perfect conductors. At present, much contro versy ensu es as to what is the reas on for the bre akdow n in con ductivity. Are the plasma waves present due to the various magnetosp heric insta bilities sufficient to cause the resistivit y or do the currents beco me resisti ve bec ause the current dens ity exceeds the thresho ld for wave generatio n itself? If the currents become unsta ble, does the potential dro p along the field extend for larg e distances (thous ands of kilometers) or is it confi ned to a narrow layer (term ed a dou ble la yer) that ma y be less than a ki lometer thick? Despite not knowing the answers to these questi ons, it is obvious that potentia l drops do occur al ong fie ld lines in these currents and that these potenti al drops h ave serious cons eque nces for the m agnetosph ere. In partic ular, it is be lieved that aur oral arcs ar e caused b y beams of electrons accelerated to a few keV i n energy by such potential dr ops. Potential dro ps which accelerate electrons dow n can acce lerate io ns up the fie ld lines and he lp pop ulate the radi ation be lts, at least at lowes t ener gies. As stated above, the reco nnectio n process is sensitivel y depende nt on the or ientatio n of the m agnetic field i n the solar wind w hich in turn is quite variabl e. This variab ility leads to varying magnetosph eric stresses and var ying rates of transfer of magnetic fiel d lines from one p art of the system to another . The magnetosp here ap pears to get out of balance in this process, and re ach a metastable state, one from which it is read y to fall. This fall is called a substorm and is pro bably triggered b y the ons et of explosive reconnecti on in the near m agnetotai l. The substor m is assoc iated w ith particle energization, add itiona l stress es and acco mpanying magnetic fie ld-aligned electric currents on the nightsi de, the br ighten ing an d motion of auroral for ms, and a host of other phenomena that could for m the basis for an entire revie w article them selves. Suffice it to say that substor ms are o ne of the m ost fundamenta l phenomena of the terrestri al ma gnetosphere a nd one of the most controversial. Other M agnetosp heres All the planets that have been explored to date have magnetosph eres. In the case of Mercur y, Jupiter and Saturn, the magnetosp here is du e to the sol ar wind interacting wi th a magnetic fiel d arising from sourc es interna l to the pla net. In the case of Venus a nd probab ly Mars, the m agnetic field creati ng the magnetos phere or iginates in the solar wind. Very few observa tions exist for satel lite ma gnetospher es.

Thus, a wa ke is form ed beh ind the mo on which is a solar wind void, but this region has little rese mblance to a ma gnetospher e. Io, the innermost Gali lean sate llite of Jupiter , may have its ow n ma gnetic field but the present evide nce is incomplete. Thus we will restrict our discuss ion to the planets. Fig.13 Mercur y, which is clos est to the sun, has a magnetic m oment over 2000 tim es sm aller than that of the earth. The h igher d ensity of the sol ar wind at Mercur y togeth er with the smallness of its magnetic m oment results in a much smaller m agnetosph ere. The distance to the subsol ar point is one-tw entieth of that in the earth's magnetosp here. In fact, even though Mercur y is much smaller tha n the earth it fills m uch of the magnetosp here, as illustrated in Figure 1 3 . Thus, there do es not appear to be an analogue to the earth's radi ation be lt at Mercur y. The fact that Mercur y has little or no atmosphere m eans that it also has l ittle or no ionospher e and the dynamics of the magnetosp here of Mercur y should be quite d ifferent from the terrestrial m agnetosph ere. Neverthe less, an apparent substorm wa s reported d uring the first encounter of M ariner 10 with Mercur y. Jupiter, in co ntrast , has a ma gnetic moment 20,000 tim es larg er than that of the earth. Since it is five times the di stance from the sun, the solar wind is 25 times l ess dense, and the resulti ng distance to the subso lar poi nt on the Jovian ma gnetopaus e is about 100 tim es larger than the terrestri al distanc e. If we could see Ju piter's ma gnetosphere i n the night sky, it would app ear larger than our moon. Even thoug h the ra dius of Jupiter is 11 times that of the earth, the pla net fills onl y a ver y small portion of the ma gnetos phere"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in comparison with the earth. The Jo vian magnetosp here has t wo very important differences from the terrestri al ma gnetospher e. First, Jupiter rotates more ra pidly and has a much stronger ma gnetic field so that the cor otation electric fie ld is stronger . Thus, rotational forces are m uch more important than at earth and the ma gnetos pheric p lasma rotates w ith the planet over most of the m agnetospher e. Second, Jupiter has four ma jor moons insi de its magnetosp here together wi th a small moon and a dust ring clos e to the planet. The mo ons an d dust ring can both abs orb charg ed particl es from an d release charged p articles to the magnetosp here. The ma jor sourc e of partic les app ears to be volcan ic eruptio ns on the moon Io. The lar ge size of the Jovian m agnetosph ere all ows energetic p articles to be accel erated to extrem ely high energies and ca n store l arge fluxes of these p articles. Thus, the Jovian ma gnetospher e presents a radi ation haz ard to the sp acecraft that v isit Jupiter . Satur n's magnetic m oment, while mu ch sm aller than Jup iter's, is stil l 600 tim es larger than that of the earth. The m agnetic mo ment of Satur n is aligned ne arly along the rotation axis an d thus its ma gnetospher e does not undergo the daily chang es of sha pe of the terrestrial m agnetosph ere cause d by the alter nate poi nting of the magnetic di pole axis more toward then m ore away from the su n. Saturn's m agnetosph ere also co ntains moons that are both sources and si nks of partic les. The largest satel lite Titan h as an atmosphere but has not y et been pr obed cl osely enough to see if it has volcan oes like Io's. Saturn is fam ous for its ex tensive ring s ystem and these ri ngs absor b the ra diatio n belt particles as the y diffuse i nward toward the pla net. Thus, the ener getic particle flux does not build up to the levels it does at Jupiter . The observed fluxes are in fact similar to those in the terrestria l magnetosp here. The m agnetosph ere of Uranus w as the su bject of much speculation before the arrival of the V oyager 2 spacecraft in Januar y 1986 bec ause the rotationa l axis of Uranus is nearly in the ec liptic pl ane. For many years, as Ur anus orb its the sun, the rotation a xis points near ly at the sun. I t was thought that if Uranus h ad an intri nsic ma gnetic fie ld, the magnetic di pole axis might be near ly along this rotationa l axis. In this case the magnetosp here of Uranus m ight have its north polar ca p facing the sun and its south polar cap d irectly away from the sun. One-quarter Ura nian year later the dipole would be perpen dicular to the so lar direction and the ma gnetospher e would resem ble that of the earth again. No one antici pated the actual n ature of the intri nsic ma gnetic field of Uranus. The di pole axis was not closely aligned w ith the rotatio nal axis but at an an gle of 60 0 to it. This causes the ma gnetospher e to undergo la rge v ariations in or ientation relative to the solar w ind flo w in the course of the 17-hour Ur anian day, providing a complexity to magnetos pheric pr ocesses that rivals the com plexity of the Jo vian magnetosp here."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Fig.14 Although V enus is si milar in size to the earth an d has a spin rate that, while smaller than that of the earth, is not so sm all that w e would expect dynamo actio n to ceas e, it does not have a measura ble intri nsic ma gnetic field.
