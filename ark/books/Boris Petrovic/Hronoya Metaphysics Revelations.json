The esoteric mentality is embodied in various forms of thought. It appears in theological and magical contexts, in which hidden knowledge of the godhead and the universe are transmitted, or else as a method of exegesis of canonical works disclosing an encoded level of meaning. Esotericism also has a secular form, in which it serves as the basis for socio-political explanations which assume that nothing is as it appears, and that society is, in fact, gover ned by secret organizations pulling on hidden strings. In its political contexts, the esoteric mentality is a breeding ground for a multitude of conspiracy theories, which assume hidden centers of power behind what appear to be individual, unrelated actions. The psychoanalytic concepti on, which maintains that people’s actions are guided by a repressed, guarded region of consciousne ss controlled by an inner censor, is also a complex instance of the esoteric outlook. Some theories of the unive rse or of society are extremely remote from the revealed surface of things. Moder n physic s postulates the existence of partic les which have never been observed; or the Marxist perspective, which maintains that the ideological and economic structu re of society is determined by the level of develo pment of mean s of product ion. Yet, the enormous gap between these theories and what is revealed on the surface is not sufficient for them to be consider ed esoteric teachings. In additio n to the existenc e of such gaps, esoteric concep tions claim that the existence of the esoteric is dependant on intentional concealment and camouf lage (which does not hold true, for example, in the case of moder n physics ), or that essentially, the esoteric may only be expressed through indirect symbo ls. We might say that what is comm on to all types of esoteric ists is the metaphor of the “key”. Esotericists do not underst and, interp ret and explain; rather, they open, decipher, liberate or expose. The remark ably varied structur e of esoteric knowledge includes multip le comple x techniques for approaching the hidden : the adopt ion of a precise and strict method of thought in order to penetrate the deep metaphysical structu re of being, enterin g alternative states of consciousnes s to facilitate insights from other planes, the use of various magical techniques , the interpr etation of dreams and their analysis for the purpose of revealing the repressed level of the ego, in order to overcome internal censorship, and many, many othe rs. Aside from the esoteric mentality, which postulat es the existence of the esoteric and seeks to attain it, esoteric teachings form a body of knowledge whose dissemin ation is severely restricted. These restricti ons are meant to carefully screen the listening public in the case of oral transmission, and to impose limits on copying"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and circulation, and later on in time, on the printing, of the written word. As a result of these restrictions, complex strategies of encoding and double speech and writing were developed, which were supposed to enable the transmis sion of secret information to the worthy elect, without preliminary filtering of the congregatio n of listeners or readers. This was accompanied by an intricate network of unique intepretative techniques, which were indispensable for penetrating the deeper level of things. Naturally, strictly esoteric traditions were not written down at all. Oral transmis sion enables control over the identity of the receivers and constant supervision over what is revealed and clarified through the medium of conve rsation. Writing, even if in veiled form, is a relaxation of the strictest restricti ons of esotericism. One who writes d own his words seeks to transcend the gap s of spac e and time between himself and his readers, who are not his immediate conversational partners. Once the words have been comm itted to writing , he may no longer restrict access to them, unless he took care to write in a veiled or hidden fashion. The restrictions on the dissemination of knowledge, and the relation between knowledge, status and power give esotericism an important role in determining social stratificati on. Esotericism is, among other things, a means of protecting the privileged position of a group in the society by limiting the dissemin ation of the knowledge that endows it with its status. For many of its devotees esoteric ism is as well a way of protecting the multitute or the uninit iated from the destructive power of truth. At the root of the elitist political esoteric outlook as Leo Strauss developed it, is the idea that social order will collapse under complete condit ions of transp arency. If philosophy is the love of truth as a way of life, it has to go under ground since it poses a serious threat to the social order which is inherently established on myth. The problem of transparency extend s beyond the political structur e and instituti ons to the self. It might be argued that not only social order and institut ions will collapse under complete condit ions of transp arency, but the self will be under mined if it become s completely transparent to itself. After all, repression and its relative self-deceptio n, are necessary forms of self-maintenance. It is no wonder that in the history of esoterical ly minded ideologies, redemptio n is conceived to be the achievem ent of transparency. Both within mystical traditi on, but as well within psychoanalytic concepti on of health and harmony. (It is worthwhi le noting that the word apocalypse mean s unveiled) . Esoteric ism as a gener al problem stands therefore at an interesting intersection of hermeneutics and political theory. It is both presumed to be a strategy of reading and interpreting texts, as well as a basic mode of power and its relationshi p to truth "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" ................................."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Mankind and the emerging gal actic consciousness It is our human body that responds to cosmic influences in a distorted fashion.

As an example, we can consider focusing on music, and having inhibited other senses and physical consciousne ss. Consequently , decreasing the flow of sensory information release s new energy within the available energy budget ; decreases system bus overhead in favor of active processes; and decreases system metabolic noise. ● Stable focus of attenti on independent of its content. The perpetuated effort to stabilize the focus of attention leads to the willingly regulated limbic system and a weakening of its feedbac k on the flow of consciousnes s. After that change, normal consci ousne ss is not the \"fighter for ends\" anymo re, while a new, extended, consci ousne ss represents a \"detached observer\" capable of observing his environment as it is. This leads towar ds \"ultimate reality\", without the sympathetic burst of unsupervised ANS. ● Stabil ization of basic physio logical rhythms and constitutin g consci ously controlled center of physical consciousne ss. As a consequence, the global information exchange cycle is increased for an amount necessary to control these rhythms in a normal state, and metabol ic noise become s discrete instead of wide-band.

On the other hand, if waves are regular (no matter if they are large) it would be much easier to maintain a stable focus of attention.

In fact the correspond ing Period-Dista nce-Inv erse Velocity relati onship T 2 = R 3 = Vi -6 allows Vi to play a major role in the computation of planet ary angular momentum ( L ). Most of the angular momentum of the solar system is in the planets, not in the Sun. This is because the massive Sun rotates very slowly, whereas the planets, less massive but far away, move rapidly enough in their orbits that their angular momentum is greater. This is particularly true for the gas giants. (Angular momentum is a quantity for rotating or revolving objects that is somewhat analogous to momentum for objects moving in a straight line. The angular momentum, L, of an orbiting object is given by the equation L = mav, where m is the mass of the object, a is its semi-major axis, and v is its average orbital velocity . For a rotatin g object, angular momentum is given by L = Cmr2 w , where C is the object's moment of inertia coeffic ient, m is its mass, r is its radius, and w is its rotational velocity in radians per second. Table 29.1 lists the angular momentum of various solar system objects.) Other important characteristics of the solar system involve the physical properties of its various objects. The planets differ in composition , with the controlling factor being distance from the Sun. The inner, terrestrial planets are rocky and metallic, the outer gas giants are primarily hydrogen and helium, and outermost Pluto is icy. The planets and their satellites resemble miniature solar system s, and most satellites orbit regularly in the equator ial plane of their planet ... (Jeffrey K. wagner ; Chap. 29. Constraints on Solar System Formation in Introducti on to the Solar System, Holt, Rinehart & Winston, Orlando 1991:426) Consequently angular momentum is essentially the product of the mass , the mean distance and the mean velocity . However, because of the relation Period-Distance- Velocity relationship: T 2 = R 3 = Vi -6 the relation: L = Mav may be expressed in the form Mass x Vi 2 x Vr , which r educes further to become simply : Mass x Vi : Angular Mom entum L = mvi Angu lar mome ntum is often expressed in absolute terms, but for com parison and general purpo ses it may also be calcul ated with respect to unit y with Earth providing the fram e of reference for the mean periods, the mean distanc es, the mean veloc ities, and also the plane tary masses (the mass of Jupiter being 317.88 times that of Ear th, etc.).

Geostationary orbit tends to skim the inner boundary of the plasma sheet, and the radiati on belts and ring current are located near GEO, as well. During solar quiet times, the bodies orbiting at this location are typically at dipolar-like field lines. During large magnetic storms, the bodies orbiting at GEO are within stretched field lines.

But external sources also existed: magnetic storms (typically changing the field by 1% or less) were world- wide phenomena and seemed to indicate that a power ful electric current was established around the Earth's equator, flowing at an undeter mined distance fo r many hours or even days. Arthur Schuster in 1911 gave it the name we still use, the ring current [Smith 1963]. The polar aurora (sometimes known as aurora borealis or norther n lights) also seemed to be linked to the magnetic field. Its dancing and glowing ribbons (usually a shade of green, but sometimes red) tend to maintain a constant distance from the magnetic pole of about 2-3000 kilometers (i.e. a constant \"magnetic latitude\") ; near the magnetic pole itself they are rarely seen. In great magnetic storms they tempo rarily descend to lower (magnetic) latitudes and become visible at centers of population , more distant from the poles. At such locations the aurora is a rare phenomen on, but it isn't so for residents of central Alaska or Canada. Auroral ribbons often consist of many parallel rays (Figure 11), constantly fading or brighten ing, each aligned with the dir ection of local magnetic field lines. As found in 1741 by Hiorter and Celsius in Sweden [Beckman, 2000], bright display s are also accompanied by local disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field, often several times stronger than those of world-wide magnetic storms. "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":" Figure 59: Photos of aurora l ovals t aken in Alaska What caused all this? Kristian Birkeland (1867 -1917) in Norway thought (correctly) that the glow came from fast electr ons hitting the high atmospher e, and tried to simulate the phenomen on on a small scale [see Stern, 1989]. Inside a glass vacuum chamber [Bruntland, 1998] he sent an electron beam towar ds a magnetized sphere representing the Earth, which like Gilbert he named terrella ( Figure 12 ). He found that such beams tended to follow magnetic field lines, which guided them to the poles of a magnet or a terrella inside the chamber . The renowned French mathematician Henri Poincaré (1854-1912) then calculated that, at least with straight conver ging field lines, such electr ons would in fact spiral along those lines and would be reflected from regions of more intens e magnetic field, closer to the cone's ape x. Auroral outbursts were known to be associated with solar activity, and Birkeland guessed that they originated in beam s of electr ons emitted from the Sun. However , neither he nor his younge r associat e, the mathematician Carl Störmer (1874-1957), could explain why the aurora avoided the magnetic poles themselve s, preferring instead to occur in large ring-shaped r egions ar ound them [Störmer, 1955]. Birkeland also observed magnetic disturbances a ssociated with auroras, using a netwo rk of 4 ground stations, and concluded that they ar ose from electric cur rents flowing in the high atmospher e, along auroral arcs, linked at their ends to distant space, where the circuit somehow closed. The auroras a nd their associated currents occasionally intensified for an hour or so, and Birk eland ter med such events polar magnetic stor ms. Unlik e regular magnetic stor ms, these wer e localized and could not"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"be observed at lower latitudes, wher e most m agnetic observatories (a s well as centers of popu lation) were located. The correlation between magnetic storms and activity on the Sun indeed suggested that something was being emitted by the Sun towards Earth. But not beam s of electrons, as Birkeland had suggested, for it could be shown that electr ostatic repulsion would disperse such beams long before they reached Earth. Instead, Sydney Chapm an (1882-1970) and Vincent Ferraro (1907-1974) proposed in 1930 that the Sun emitted huge clouds of plasma, contain ing equal numbers of positive char ges and electrons. Bein g electr ically neutral, such a cloud could travel with out dispersing . However, it could not penetrate the Earth's m agnetic field. To do so, its ions and electrons wou ld have to attach thems elves to terrestrial field lines and sh are them with terrestrial plas ma, e.g. that of the ionosphe re. By the theo rem of field line preservatio n of the \"f reezing\" of field lines (s ee section 13 on the solar dynamo), partic les which in itially did not shar e field lines cannot sudden ly start doing so. Field lines link ed to the Earth's po les would therefore remain con fined inside a \"Chapm an-Ferraro cavity\" around which the cloud would wrap itself. The sudden confinement was e xpected to comp ress the Earth's fiel d lines, and explained a small abrupt jump in magnetic intensity (\"sudden commencem ent\") observed on the surface at the s tart of many magnetic stor ms. Ch apman and F erraro speculated that somehow the c avity also generated the rin g current, but how this happened they did not know . The ring current presumably consisted of charged particles trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. Störmer traced some of their motions by numerical calculations (in 1908 these had to be done by hand), but his work concent rated on partic les with extremely high energies, not like those of the aurora. S. Fred Singer however showed [Singe r, 1957] that low energy particles, of either sign, could also do the job, provided their numbers were large enough. Such particles spiraled around field lines while sliding along them, but the sliding motion would stop and reverse (as Poincaré had shown) whenever the particle approached regions of more intense magnetic field. In the field of the Earth, the magnetic intensity increased as one approached the \"feet\" of the field line in the atmosphe re, since these were the points (on any given field line) closest to the center of the Earth. Many trapped particles would therefore be reflected before reaching the dense atmospher e, and could stay trapped for a long time, bouncin g back and forth across the equ ator ( Figur e 13 ). "},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":" Singer noted a slow secondary mechanism that would meanwhile move trapped partic les from their guiding field lines, attaching them to neighb oring ones and gradually transporting them all the way around the Earth (see fig. 4, [Stern, 1989] ). Electrons would be transported in one direction, ions in the opposite one--and in either case, the electr ic current they carried around the Earth was in the direction required by the ring current.

This \"i nner radiati on belt\" turned out to be a secondary p roduct of the cosmic radiati on, wh ich is a popu lation of extremely energetic protons bel ieved to fill our galaxy . Cosmic rays provide a rather wea k source, but the trapping is quite stable, allow ing the pr otons to accumul ate over a long time. The inner belt, peaking at distance s between 1.3 and 2 R E (earth radii) from the Earth's center, was dense enough to constitute a radiation hazard (astronauts can cross it safely, but only if they do not linger), however it was not extensive enough to carry the ring current. That was done by the outer radiation belt (2-8 R E ), found to contain protons and electr ons of moderate energies but in much greater numbers. Magnetic storms greatly increased its populati on, and with it also the intensity of the ring cur rent, though some of the outer belt and of the ring current existed at all times. The Sun indeed emitted plasm a which flowed out radially at great speed, but again, it did so at all times, not just during magnetic stor ms as Chapm an and F erraro had assumed. That wa s the solar wind, predicted in 1958 by Eugene P arker, after he tried to calculate the equil ibrium structur e of the Sun's cor ona. The calculati on indicated that an e xtremely hot plasm a like that of Sun's co rona cou ld not be held in gravitati onal equil ibrium, the way the Earth's atmo sphere was. Instead, Parker's calculation sugge sted that the Sun cont inually sloughed o ff plasm a in a superson ic stream, e xpanding radially in all direction. Though Parker's prediction was at first controversial, spacecraf t instruments soon confirmed it. In 1961 its fl ow was measured by a \"F araday cup\" placed aboar d Explo rer 10 by Herb Bridge and Brun o Rossi (19 05-93), and mo re extensively by the sp ace pr obe Mariner 2 in 1962. By then Explor er 12 had crossed a well defined boundary on the sun-facing side of the \"Chapman-F erraro cavity\" (renamed by Tom Gold \"magnetospher e\"), sugge sting that the cavity also existed at all times. The boundary was named \"magnetopause.\" The \"sudden commencement\" jumps of the magnetic intensity, at the onset of many magnetic storms, turned out to mark the arrival of fast plasma clouds, which plowed through the ordinary solar wind and created shock fronts ahead of thems elves. One featur e which no one had expected before the satellite era was the long magnetic tail behind the Earth. On the sunwar d side the solar wind compr essed the magnetospheric cavity, creating an abrupt boundary at an average distance of about 10.5 R E , though some interplanetary clouds, associated with magnetic storms, could push it to distance s of 6 R E and even less. On the night side, on the other hand, the Earth's field lines were stretched out in two great bundles, each linked to one of the polar caps ( Figur e 14 ). Later spacecraf t would observe these bundles at distances of more than 3 times that of the Moon , 200 R E from Earth and beyond . Wedged between the two bundles--the two \"tail lobes\"- -was the tail's plasma sheet, a layer of hot plasma which turned out to be the main sour ce of auroral electr ons. The magnetic fie ld of the plasm a sheet is wea k, with hairpi n-shaped magnetic field lines, and that tur ned it into a somewhat un stable region, the origin of many of the magnetic distur bances observed in space and on the gr ound. The r eason auroras ar e rare near the m agnetic poles, but occur fairly regularly along large rings surrounding each pole, is that a uroral electr ons (and their as sociated electr ic currents) ar e guided"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"along magnetic field lines. Magnetic fiel d lines from the \"aur oral oval\" lead bac k to the plasm a sheet, wher eas those fr om the magnetic poles them selves (a nd the regions near them) end up in the twin bund les of the tail lobes, which contain rather little plasm a. Birkeland's observations were also validated, again with some modif ications. What he called polar magnetic storms are now known as magnetic sub storms, so nam ed by Chapm an wh o at first viewed them as comp onent parts o f magnetic stor ms--before it was realized that they occurred at other times as well. They r epresent vio lent change s in the plas ma she et which ener gize its ions and elect rons, hurl them earthwar d, and in that way contr ibute to the ou ter ring cur rent. Magnetic stor ms, following the ar rival of a fast cloud, create very powe rful disturbances of this kind and s eem to be the main agent r eplenishing the ring current, thou gh the details stil l need to be wo rked ou t. The electric current system, which Birkeland claimed accompanied the aurora, was also observed, though its structur e was somewhat different from what Birkeland had proposed. It forms an intricate pattern first traced by Alfred Zmuda and James Armstrong, using a \"piggybac k\" (free ride) magnetometer aboar d the Navy satellite Triad. Milo Schield, Alex Dessler and John Freemen, who theoretically predicted such currents in 1969, named them \"Birkeland currents\" and the name is still used. Birkeland currents provide the energy for most auroral arcs, but auroral electrons are then energized only close to Earth, gettin g their main push in the lowest 1-1.5 R E of their guiding field lines. Magnetic Rec onnection In such a brief description it is hard to do justice to the e xtensive field of magnetospheric physics. Like most physical p rocesses, those of the magnetospher e, too, must usu ally be paid for in energy, the universal cur rency o f physics. Ex cept fo r the inne r belt, the sour ce of that energy seems to be the sol ar wind. If the sep aration between inte rplanetary and ter restrial field lines wer e strictly enfor ced, it would be rather difficult to transmit ener gy from one region to the other, but there exists a loophole. Magnetic fie ld lines can change their linkage and \"reconnect\" in new way s, if the plasm a in which they ar e embedded flows th rough an \"x-type neutral poi nt\" (o r \"neutral line\") at whic h the fie ld intensity drops to zero and field lines cr oss in the patter n of the letter x. James Dungey in England proposed [Dungey , 1961; Stern, 1986] that two such points were formed on the magnetopau se, the boundary of the magnetospher e. One occured on the sunwar d side, where interplanet ary magnetic field lines and terrestrial lines formed an x-shaped neutral point (or a continuous line of such points), at which they split up and reconnected. If the interplanetary field points exactly south, the plasm a flows along the thick arrows in Figure 15--the solar wind plasma arriving from the left and the magnetospheric plasma coming from the right. The norther n half of the terrestrial line then connects to the northern half of the interp lanetary line, a"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"similar process joins the souther n halves, and the plasm as attached to the newly reconnected l ines then flo w outwards--up or down, in Figure 15. This, Dungey assumed, created \"open\" field lines, starting in the polar regions of Earth and extending to interplanetary space, and along such lines, energy and plasma easily flowed from the solar wind to the magnetosphe re. The process ended (in Dungey's original theory) at a second neutral point in the distant tail, where reconnecti on re-united the two terrestrial halves and the two interp lanetary halves, after whic h the tw o plasm as wer e again sep arated. If the interplanetary field lines pointed not southwar ds but just slanted towar ds the south, reconnecti on is a bit more complicated, introducing a bend in each \"open\" field line, at which the direction of the terrestrial line gradually change s over to that of the interplanet ary one. If the field line slants northwar ds, the bendin g is more severe--the northern half of the terrestrial field line must link up with the interplanet ary half which comes from the south, and vice versa. If the northward slant is steep, reconnecti on is expected to become increasingly difficult--the interplanetary field lines just have the \"wrong direction\" for linking up. The actual process is probably much more complicated, but one of its predictions was amply confirmed. It was found [Fairfie ld and Cahill, 1966] that the most important factor promoting magnetic substor ms, large Birkeland currents and other active phenomena was the slant of the interplanetary magnetic field. With southwar d slant activity was likely, with northwar d slant it was inhibited, and other factors-- such as the vel ocity and density of the sol ar wind--were much les s important. Magnetic r econnection may al so occur in the plasm a sheet, constitut ing there an important element o f the substor m process, but details wi ll have to wait fo r more thorough studies of the magnetospher e, using simultaneous d ata from a much lar ger number of satellites than is av ailable now. Reconnect ion, accelerati on and ener gization of plasm a in the magnetospher e all involve a compl icated interp lay between magnetic and electric fields. Static magnetic fields can trap a nd steer electr ons and i ons witho ut changing their energy. Since the fields do not have to supply energy, they c an maintain the trapping indefin itely without requiring any additional energy input. On the othe r hand, an electric field, a region of electr ic forces, is not only able to energize particles, it can also help them move f rom one fie ld line to another, e.g. enter regions of magnetic trapping or escape from them. Electr ic fields ther efore have a central r ole, both in bringing fresh particles into the rin g current, as happens dur ing magnetic stor ms, and in adding ener gy to those particles. In additi on, electric f orces parallel to magnetic field lines ar e also instrumental in accelerating (negative) aur oral electr ons down ward.

Figure 61: Ph ysical aspects of the Earth soul function (NAS A) The Eart h's Dynamo If a fluid dynamo exists inside the Earth, it has to be in its core, with about half the radius of the Earth. The reason is that the process requires a conducting fluid, and the propagation of earthquak e waves has sugge sted the core is liquid, with a solid inner core in its middle [Brush, 1980]. Its high density fits a liquid metal, generally believed to be iron (possibly, with other elements dissolved in it), a relatively abundant element. The iron has sunk to the center of the Earth because it is heavy, the same reason that mo lten iron sinks to the bottom of a blast furnace. For a while, around 1950, another idea was proposed, namely that every spinning massive object developed an intrinsic magnetic field, proportional to its angular momentum. According to that view, the field asymmetries observed on the Earth' s surface were due to secondary process es, such as the circulation of liquid iron in the core. While Gilber t suggested that the Earth rotated because it was magnetic, this"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"explanation argued the opposite- -the Earth was magnetic because it rotated. Arthur Schuster (1851-1934) was the first to propose the idea [Schuster , 1912; Warwick, 1971], and its main supporter in the 20th century was Patrick M. Blackett (1897- 1974), a British physicist who was awarded the 1948 Nobel prize for his work on cosmic rays [Blackett, 1947]. By then it was known that in electr ons and protons, spin and magnetic moment were related: couldn't the same hold for matter at large? However, the observ ation that the field did no t weaken in deep mine s [ Runco rn, 1948 ; includes appendix by Sydney Chapman] was evidence against the idea, and Blackett finally ruled it out by an experiment with a spinning gold sphere [Blackett, 19 52]. Meanwhi le other physicists--in itially, Walter Elsasser at Columbia U.-- tried to find mathem atical solutions to the dynamo problem [Elsasser, 1946, 1947, 1956 b]. The method devised by Gauss to represent the Earth's internal field outside the region of electr ical currents can be gener alized to describe any toroidal and poloidal fields, and this generalizati on should in principle be applicable to represent the flows and fields in the Earth' s core. Unfortunately, because of Cowling's \"anti-dynamo\" theorem, no axially symmetric solutions were expected, leading researchers to assume a most general class of fields and motions. This produced compl icated relations, which led to even mo re comp licated ones, with no closur e in sight. For a while some scientists wonder ed whether any solutio ns existed at all. Then in 1964 Stanislaw Bragins ky [1964a, b] in Russia surprised the world by producin g an entire class of solutions which were almost symmetric- -a symmetric field, plus a small additi on. Because the additi on was s mall, the pr ocedur e conver ged. All these were solutions of the \"kinematic dynamo problem,\" in which the flow patter n of the conduct ing fluid could be freely specified. A realistic model of the dynamo also requires a mechanism and a source of energy driving the flow. Bullard [1949] pointed out that a modest amoun t of heat generation by radioactivity would suffice. Bragins ky suggested that the solidif ication of molten iron and its deposit ion on the inner core could also supply the heat which produced the flows and thus drive the dynamo effect. Considerable progress has taken place since then [Levy, 1976, Inglis, 1981, Jacobs, 1987 (vol. 2), Buffett, 2000, Roberts and Glatzm aier, 2000]. The problem of feedbac k from toroidal to poloidal modes was addressed by the \"alpha-mode\" dynamo of Steenbeck, Krause and Rädler[19 66] of the Institute of Astrophysics in Potsdam, Germany. They showed that fluid turbu lence whose st atistical properties had no mirror symm etry could lead to a mean electr omotive force, driving electric currents whose magnitude was __times the magnetic intensity, in the direction of the underly ing average field. This may be viewed as a generalizati on of Parker's idea for explaining the solar cycle. An interesting \"dynamo experiment\" in the laborato ry was reported by"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Lowes and Wilkinson [1963], who spun two iron cylinders (each representin g an eddy) inside a containe r of mercury, at right angles to each other. When the angular veloc ity exceeded a certain value, the magnetic field jumped to a new higher plateau, and that wa s viewed as the in itiation of dynamo action. One interesting development has been the mathem atical simulati on of the dynamo process, using high-speed compute rs [Glatzm aier and Roberts, 1997 ; Glatzm aier et al., 1999; Coe et al, 2000]. The simulati on assumes a heat source in the core and heat loss through the core-mantle interface. Dynamo action is generally obtained, but the complexity of the f ield and the frequency of main field reversals (discus sed in the ne xt section) depend greatly on the distrib ution of the heat loss--whether it was uniform across the interface, highest at the pole, equator or in between, etc. The simulati ons also found occasional \"excursions\" in which the field seemed to head towar ds a reversal but then reasserted its original polarity, a class of events also deduced from the paleomagnetic record. Interestingly, a simulation run with a much smaller inner core produced no reversals at all."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":" Figure 62: Northern hem isphere auroral ring Figure 63: Plasm a clouds near Earth (NASA)"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" Figure 64: High-Ener gy plasm asphere occurrences and quantum pheno mena "},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Figure 65 : Hurric ane L ili (NAS A) Figure 66: Stratospheric quantu m phenom ena of elves and jets ejected during high- power storms (NAS A)"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":" 1.

This is different from the cosmic microwave background and is also referred to as the electr omagnetic quantum vacuum since it is the lowest state of otherwise empty space. This energy is so enormous that most physicists believe that even though zero-point energy seems to be an inescapable consequence of elementary quantum theory, it cannot be physic ally real, and so is subtracted away in calculations. A minori ty of physicists accept it as real energy which we cannot directly sense since it is the same everywher e, even inside our bodies and measuring devices. From this perspective, the ordinary world of matter and energy is like a foam atop the quantum vacuum sea. It does not matter to a ship how deep the ocean is below it. If the zero- point energy is real, there is the possibi lity that it can be tapped as a source of power or be har nassed to gener ate a pr opulsive force for space travel. The propellor or the jet engine of an aircraft push air backwards to propel the aircraft forward. A ship or boat propellor does the same thing with water. On Earth there is alway s air or water available to push against. But a rocket in space has nothing to push against, and so it needs to carry propellant to eject in place of air or water. The fundamental problem is that a deep space rocket would have to start out with all the propellant it will ever need. This quickly results in the need to carry more and more propellant just to propel the propellant. The breakthrough one wishes for deep space travel is to overcome the need to carry propellant at all. How can one generate a propulsive fo rce with out carrying and ejectin g propellant? There is a force associated with the electr omagnetic quantum vacuum: the Casimir force. This force is an attraction between parallel metallic plates that has now been well measured and can be attributed to a minutely tiny imbalance in the zero-point energy in the cavity between versus the region outside the plates. This is not useful for propulsion since it symm etrically pulls on the plates. However if some asymmetric variation of the Casimir force could be identified one could in effect sail through space as if propelled by a kind of quantum fluctuation wind. This is pure speculation. The other requirement for space travel is energy. A thought experiment published by physicist Robert Forward in 1984 demonstrated how the Casimir force could in principle be used to extract energy from the quantum. Theoretical studies in the early 1990s verified that this was not contradict ory to the laws of thermodynamics (since the zero-point energy is different from a thermal reservoir of heat). Unfortunately the Forwar d process cannot be cycled to yield a continuous extraction of energy. A Casimir engine would be one whose cylinders could only fire once, after which the engine become usele ss. Origin of zero-poi nt energy "},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The basis of zero-point energy is the Heisenber g uncertainty principle, one of the fundamental laws of quantum physic s. According to this principle, the more precisely one measures the position of a moving particle, such as an electr on, the less exact the best possible measurement of momentum (mass times velocity) will be, and vice versa. The least possible uncertainty of position times momentum is specified by Planck's constant, h. A parallel uncertainty exists between measurements involving time and energy. This minimum uncertainty is not due to any correctable flaws in measurement, but rather reflects an intrinsic quantum fuzziness in the very nature of energy and matter. A useful calculational tool in physics is the ideal harmonic oscillator: a hypothetical mass on a perfect spring moving back and forth. The Heisenber g uncertainty principle dictates that such an ideal harmonic oscillator -- one small enough to be subject to quantum laws -- can never come entirely to rest, since that would be a state of exactly zero energy, which is forbidden. In this case the average minimum energy is one-half h times the fr equency, hf/2. Radio waves, light, X-rays, and gamma rays are all forms of electromagnetic radiatio n. Classically , electr omagnetic radiati on can be pictured as waves flowing through space at the speed of light. The waves are not waves of anything substantive, but are in fact ripples in a state of a field. These waves do carry energy, and each wave has a specific direction, frequency and polarizati on state. This is called a \"propagating mode o f the elect romagnetic field.\" Each mode is subject to the Heisenber g uncertainty principle. To underst and the meaning of this, the theory of electromagnetic radiation is quantized by treating each mode as an equivalent harmonic oscillato r. From this analogy, every mode of the field must have hf/2 as its average minimum energy. That is a tiny amount of energy, but the number of modes is enormous, and indeed increases as the square of the frequency . The product of the tiny energy per mode times the huge spatial density of modes yields a very high theo retical energy density per cubic centimeter . From this line of reasonin g, quantum physics predicts that all of space must be filled with electr omagnetic zero-point fluctuations (also called the zero-point field) creating a universal sea of zero-point energy. The density of this energy depend s critically on where in frequency the zero-point fluctuati ons cease. Since space itself is thought to break up into a kind of quantum foam at a tiny distance scale called the Planck scale (10 -33 cm), it is argued that the zero point fluctuations must cease at a correspon ding Planck frequency (10 43 Hz). If that is the case, the zero-point energy density would be 110 orders of magnitude g reater than the radiant ener gy at the center of the Sun. Connection to iner tia and gravi tation When a passenger in an airplane feels pushed against his seat as the airplane accelerate s down the runway, or when a driver feels pushed to the left when her car makes a sharp turn to the right, what is doing the pushing?

Einstein's general relativity succe ssfully accounts for the motions of freely-falling objects on geodesics (the \"shortest\" distance between two points in curved spacetime), but does not provide a mechanism for generating a gravitational force for objects when they are forced to deviate from geodesic tracks. It has been found that an object under going acceleration or one held fixed in a gravit ational field would experience the same kind of asymmetric patter n in the zero-point field giving rise to such a reaction force.

In balancing and reconc iling these opposites we achieve a higher unity. In marked contrast to the gener al religious suppression of Eros, tantra does this by glorifying our erotic and se xual nature. Sexuality is a sacred ritual of union through the sensual and ec static celebrati on of differences. It is the li fe force.

If this search for the Beloved is the major sexual goal, and if it can be gained only partially and fleeting ly with a human partner, then it is quite natural to think of the lasting and blissful union of the soul with God in sexual terms, as many mystics have done. This concept of the soul's union with God as a sexual union is paralleled in the romantic ideal of love with a human partner as an act of worship. The overwhelming nature of desire leads us to experience it as a supernatural force. The soul abides in the heart of the flesh. In the ecstasy of sexual union we rise to the supernatural level, are possessed by a male or female deity, and mingle with the divine. Orgasm corresponds to the soul's ecst asy pos sessed by God. Union of Opposit es Tantra is perhaps the oldest form of Eastern alchem y. According to tantric philosophy the whole universe is built up of and pervaded by basic forces which are in intimate and intricate union. These forces, named Shiva and Shakti, are personified as male and female deities. Of this divine pair, Shiva is the subordinate one, for it is the Female Principle that ultimately underlies all manifestation. There is a tantric saying, \" Shiva without Shakti is a corpse. \" The core experience of Tantra is revelati on of its sexual secrets. Sexual union symbolizes the quintes sence of the elements.

The hidden potency of the sexual act is the bluep rint or seed of all creatvity. When we understand the practical teachings of Tantra, a whole new perspective and experience of life opens. Tantra is a process that fosters the holistic harmonization of the male and female elements of our psychobi ological self, ameliorating the war of the sexes. Through rapport and empathy we come to understand the Other. Empathy needs a face! Devotion needs a face. Psychol ogically , there is a harmonization of the inner-mate archetype s of Anima and Animus , soul-fi gures which functi on as guides to deeper regions of the psyche. They lead to wholeness, integrati on, self-actualization. In Jungian psychol ogy a man's inner femin ine self is termed anima or soul; a woman' s masculine component is called animus or spirit. Their merging creates a psycho logical and spiritual androgyny , another expression of wholeness. Western forms of Tantra include a series of Sex Magick rituals designed to bring the individual to self-realizati on. The central aim of Western magic is to attain or stabilize the emergence of Knowled ge and Convers ation of the Holy Guardian Angel, or the daemon, one's true spiritual identity . This implies drawing closer to the consci ousne ss of one's authentic individuality, in contradistincti on to the active consci ous personality . We can achieve a form of sacred marriage with the inner mate, known in alchemy as the coniunct io . This union produces a Magickal Child that symbo lizes our potent ial for realization of the Higher Self, self-actualization. These western alchemic al goals and procedur es paralleled Eastern alchemy, with its concer n for the elixer of immortality and the extraction of spirit from matter and its liberation through meditati on. Chines e alchemy is a mixtu re of alchemy, kundalin i and tantric yoga. Its secret is the great creation of a golden fetus which represents the seed of enlightenment.

The spectrum of tantric practices includes not only sexual trance, but physic al culture, breath control, superconcent ration, mental and spiritual discipline, and the mystic arts. Much like Western magic, tantra employs candles, incense, bells, magical wands and chalices, spells, magic circles or mand alas, bodily postures, occult gestur es, symbo lical designs, and words of power. These are employed to enhance and bring bodily functions under the control of the will and exert a subtle inner alchemy . There is a hermetic distillatio n of a quintes sence from the bodily fluids which reinvigorates the physical body.

The meaning of sexual ity is that i t facilitates the birth of self-awareness. Self-questioning When life is good we take it for granted. But sorrow dispels our illusions. Sorrow can make us do many things. In my view the main purpose of sorrow is to make us question why things are as they are. We need to question our life, our beliefs, our values. We can escape this questionin g so long as we can blame someone for our failures. When we can no longer blame someone then we can escape this questioning by relying on our social supports, especially by joining groups of fellow sufferers. When this ceases to be rewarding, or becomes too stressful, then we can escape this question ing by immersing ourself in religion. But even religion can fail us. We can still escape this question ing so long as we can fall back on sexual activity (primarily that of sexual intercourse, and secondar ily that of masturbation) when all other conso lations fail. Sexuality is the last conso lation. When even sexual activity itself becomes the source of obvious sorrow then, for the idealist, self-question ing can no longer be avoided. It will have to be faced, sooner or later. This pattern of self-question ing is the way that the sublimation of sexuality leads to an holistic ethics (rather than to a puritan one). In the atte mpt to escape from the sorrows o f everyday life, the two attractions that r emain after social support is exhausted ar e the consolations of sexual pleasure or the consolati ons of religion. Sexual desir e is much gr eater than the attracti ons of religion since s exual desir e is powerful enough and compulsive enough to override the sense of individuali ty.

Time travel, it is claimed, is possible if a wormhole can be held-open. It is also claimed that a wormhole can be held-open by what are called \"exotic materials\".

Thus, light + light = blackness. The two waves, hence, must be exactly out-of-phase with each other in order to cancel-out in this fashion. This is exactly what is required for a wormhole to be held-open. In the context of partic le interacti ons, this can be viewed as a particle interacting with its opposite, for example, a photo n with a photon hole (or matter with antimatter) yielding a wormhole. See the \"Space- Grid\" text at the link bel ow for further details. Backgr ound radiation must be precisely canceled- out by other out-of-phase radiation that can be purposefully introduced (by any time and space travelers). At the place where these two types of radiation might interact, the void is increased because cancellation (and close to zero radiation pressure at this point) causes space-time to bend (or warp) into a tunnel through hyperspace--even when there is no matter present! It has been proposed by others that such \"exotic materials\" might consist of vacuum fluctuations of the electr omagnetic field. These are viewed as a promising form of exotic materials that can hold-open a wormhole. Anothe r possibi lity is that time- reversed radiati on could somehow be produced , which also might cancel-out ordinary long-wavelength radiation. Perhaps, out-of-phase radiati on is time-reversed radiatio n, ordinary radiati on travelin g backward-in-time. Indeed, this is somewhat reminiscent of R. P. Feynman' s (and others) theory of positrons (positively charged electr ons) being electrons traveling backward-in-time. At the quantum level, the laws of physic s are time-symm etric and time-travel is commo nplace. Thus, that photons can travel backw ard-in-time, should also not be surprising. Hence, in the regions where cancellation of light with light occurs (light + light = blackne ss), the two slit experiment might be explained as photons being out-of-phase and canceling ordinary quant a, yielding blackne ss. The author is in general agreement with the finding that exotic materials can hold open a wormhole, if the proposed fluctuatio ns yield a negative radiation pressure effect i.e., the author's picture of gravity .

This shielding creates an artificial wormhole at the shell's center of mass, which is an open- space at the center of the shell. Hence, a permanent wormhole is created where there is no matter at all. Perhaps, this wormhole might be large enough to for a body or spaceship to enter. If tidal forces are limited by the quantum gravity proposal stated above, perhaps, they will not tear- apart a space-traveler who enters the permanently -open wormhole. This idea has its own text; See the \"Space P ortal\" text at the link bel ow. In the author's work on relativity and inertia, it appears possible that a wormhole is opened -up when an object is actually at the speed of light. The forwar d motion of the object, therefore, accumulate s the exotic materials mentioned above. The object falls- into the void at its leading edge and into the wormhole. This is equivalent to the accumulation of exotic materials that can cancel-out long-wavelength background radiatio n. A wormhole, hence, can be created also by an object's forward motion. Since an ordinary object can never reach the speed of light (according to Einstein), falling into a wormhole by one's forward motion can never actually happen in practice. See inertia and relativity text link bel ow for further details. Wormholes might also be at the core of all matter (as in the shell example above). This viewp oint gives the incoming radiati on that makes-up the quantum gravitational field (described in the gravity text) a place to go. The incoming radiation, hence, is attracted to the radiati on void and \"falls\" into a higher dimensional hyperspace--a wormhole. If this were true, all matter contains a wormhole within, at the center of mass. The wormhole, perhaps, is the center of mass--a singularity of sorts. Perhaps, this is the reason that Newton found (and proved) that objects behave as if all of their mass is concentrated at their centers. This was no co incidence. On the downside, much o f the author's work sugge sts that five dimen sional hyperspace is not a very appealing place to travel through. It is the realm (the author believes) of the Hig gs fields, the storehouses for matter and radiation. Light, sparks, flames etc. come to our dimensions f rom the Higgs fields in hypersp ace. Hence, if a time-traveler wanted to travel thr ough a wormhole through these hyperspace dimensions, he/she h ad better have on a fi re-protected suit. The fifth dimension is very hot!"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Since the laws of physics are symmetric with respect to time, where there is a black hole, there must be also a white hole. Indeed, in particular solutions of general relativity, white holes are even predicted. If a black hole is an object that things fall into but not out of, a white hole is an object that things can come out of but not fall into. Hence, one might be able to jump into a black hole and come out of a white hole (Hawking, 1993). If, as stated above, there are physical limits to the tidal forces of a black hole, one might survive such a trip with out being stretched- out to infinity. Thus, quantum gravity perhaps allows the possibil ity of the wormhole and white hole schem es for time and space trav el. Figure 85: Conver ging plasm a instab ilities and the cre ation of a gravit ation al co llapse Science fiction writers, to avoid undue delays in the story's plot-line, need a way of beating the speed- of-light speed limit of the universe. Most readers of this magazine are familiar with the gimmicks that have been used for faster -than light travel: warp drives, detou rs through hypersp ace, matter-to-tachyon conversi on, trans-sp atial jumps, and dives past the singularity of a rotating black hole. But perhaps the faster- than light mechanism which has the best credent ials in orthodox physics is the wormhole , also known as a Schwartzschil d wormhole or an Einstein- Rosen brid ge."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"The wormhole idea comes from Einstein's theory of general relativity itself using \"Schwartzschi ld geometry \", a way of inscribin g a space-time coordinate system on the highly curved space in the vicinity of a black hole. A wormhole is a funnel -shaped tunnel that can connect one complete universe with another or can connect two separated r egions of the same unive rse. In the latter case it is a short path connecting two distant locations in space. Thus it the SF writer's dream, a spatial shortcu t that a space traveler might use to bypass the speed-of-light barrier and travel almost instant aneously from one place to another within our universe. However, there is a basic problem with wormholes as a transport system. Wormholes, as described by the equations of general relativity , are dismayingly unstable. In fact, any wormhole connection that happen s to form between two points in space should pinch closed again so rapidly that neither material objects nor light-beam messages can pass across the wormhole \"bridge\" during its brief existence. Thus a wormhole, at least in its pristine form, is unsuitable for the instantan eous space transport that SF writers ma y have in mind. Most physicists will find this result very satisfying, for it avoids a sumultaneity parado x. Einstein's special theory of relativity treats space-time in a very even- handed and symm etric way. It requires a complete equivalence of \"inertial reference frames\", space-time coordinate systems moving through space with any constant speed (includ ing zero). These must be equivalent by any internal measurement that would single out one such frame as special. For example, no measurements made inside a spac eship traveling at near light-speed can show different results from similar measurements made when the ship was at rest in space. In special relativity \"at rest in space\" is a me aning less concept, since that condit ion is undetectable. Thus, a semi-per manent wormhole would present a problem for special relativity not only because it would breach the light-speed barrier but also becau se the reference- frame symmetry would be broken. If a wormhole connect ion between separated regions of space existed only long enough to permit a message to be sent, it would seem that a reference-frame test could be made that would single out one reference frame as \"preferred\". Absolute spac e would be detected and defined . The satisfying instability of wormholes has now been called into question. Last Fall a paper by Michael Morris, Kip Thorne, and Ulvi Yurtsever was published in the conservative and prestigious journal Physical Review Letters which change s all this. The authors describe how an \"advanced civilization\" might: (a) create a large wormhole ; (b) stabilize it to prevent its re-collapse; and (c) convert it to a time machine, a device for traveling or at least commun icating back and forth in time. This remark able paper, which borders on science fiction in its approach, has a very serious purpose. There is presently no well-established theory that can accommodate both quantum mechanics and the physic s of strong gravit ational fields within the same mathem atical framework. The paper of Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever is a vehicle for guessing, in a rather unorth odox way, what restrictions a proper theory of quantum gravity might place on the physics of wormholes. The authors demonstrate that general relativity contains within its framewo rk mechanism s that appear to permit both faster-than-light travel and time travel. If these physic al calamities are to be averted, the authors argue, it can only be done through a proper theory of quantum gravity ."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"To devotee s of science fiction, however, these aren't calamities at all but delight ful prospects. So let's discus s how Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever propose to create a stable wormhole, with the idea that someday we may be able to build one (or at least write a good story about it). Empty space, when examined with quantum theory on a sufficiently small distance scale, is not empty at all. Even at nuclear dimen sions (10 -13 cm) empty space is filled with particle-antipart icle pairs that are continually flashing into a brief existence, bankrolled on the credit of borrowed mass-ener gy, only to wink out of existence again as the law of conservati on of energy reasserts itself. If the length -scale is contracted to a size appropriate to quantum gravity (10 -33 cm) this quantum fireworks intensifies to a \"quantum foam\" of violent fluctuations in the topology and geometry of space itself. Quantum black holes form and vanish in a span of time of 10 -23 seconds; highly curved and convoluted regions of space in ant physically allowed configu ration have a similarly brief existence. In this environment Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever speculate, it my be possible for a civilization considerably more advanced than ours, by \"pulling a wormhole out of the quantum foam and enlarging it to classical size\" to create a connect ion between two nearby points in space. This would use the well-known quantum mechanical process called \"tunnel ing\", a jump from one allowed energy state to another across a barrier of intermediate states that ar e forbidden by energy conservation. To stabilize the wormhole pulled from the quantum foam, preventing its immediate recollapse, Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever propose to use an electric field of such enormous strength that it creates enough energy in the mouth of the wormhole to force it to remain open. They suggest that this might be accomplished by placing a pair of spheres with equal electric charges at the two spatial entrances of the wormhole. The spher es would be held in place by a delicate balance, the force of their gravitati onal attractio n just offsetting the force of their electrical repulsion . Such a system might be very small, an atom-sc ale opening permitting the passage of only a few photons at a time, or it might be lar ge enough to pass a large vehic le. Having produced this stabilized wormhole the engineering can begin. The size of the connect ion can be enlarged or contracted depending on energy considerati ons. The two portal ends of the wormhole connection can be separated from each other. For example, a portal placed aboar d a space ship might be carried to some location many light years away. Such a trip might require a long time, but during the trip and afterwar ds instantaneous communicati on and transport through the wormhole would be available. The ship could even be supplied with fuel and provisions through the portal. A similar scenario has already been described in Poul Anderson's The Enemy Stars , in which starships were required to travel at sub-ligh t speed s, but they carried onboard matter transmitters that permitted instantaneous transmi ssion of crew and supplies f rom Earth. This brings us to the last point of the Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever paper, the construct ion of a time machine. Suppose that initially a wormhole establishes a connect ion between two spatial points A and B that have no motion with respect to each other and are simultaneous in time. By \"simultaneous\", a slippery concept in relativity, we mean that an observer at A who determines a clock reading at B would get the same reading via normal space (by light beam signals corrected for transit time, for example) as he would through the wor mhole."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Now suppose, in the spirit of the Twin Parado x of special relativity, that portal B is placed aboar d a space ship while portal A remains on Earth. The ship carrying B , say, accelerate s rapidly to 86.6% of light speed and travel s a distance of one light-year, then reverse s its course and returns to Earth at the same speed. On its arrival portals A and B are placed near one anothe r. At 86.6% of the velocity of light any clock aboar d the ship will run at just half the speed of a similar clock on Earth due to relativistic time dilatio n. Therefore at the end of the trip the ship's clock will be one year slow, as compar ed to an identical clock that remained on Earth. And, as Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever point out, portal B will also be one year slow as compar ed with portal A . Now a message sent through B to A will emerge one year in the future of B , and a message sent through A to B will emerge one year in the past of A ! Similarly a traveler making the same trips through the wormhole will travel one year into the future or the past. The wormhole connecti on through space has been transformed to a connecti on through time, a wormhole time machine. Does this device, embodying faster-than-light space travel as well as time travel, demonstrate that special relativity is wrong? Does it show that Einstein's speed limit had been defeated? Not at all. The restrict ions usually associated with special relativity implicitly assume that no time travel is possible. Clearly one could travel, in effect, at an infinite velocity by travelin g from one place to another at some sub-light velocity and then on arrival traveling backwards in time to the instant of departu re. To put it another way, the simultaneity measurements prohibited by special relativity must lead to a definite and unambigu ous determinati on of the simultaneous readings of two clocks separated in space. The clock-compar isons made possible by wormholes are not definite, becaus e one clock could be in the future of the other, displaced by any time interval produced by the travel histories of the portals. Special relativity, which after all is embedded in the theory of general relativity that produced these revelati ons about w ormhole physics, is pr eserved. The law of physics that would be destroyed by the construct ion of a wormhole space- time connecti on is causality , the mysterious principle that prohibits communicati on backwards in time, that requires a cause to precede its effect s in time sequence in all space-time reference frame s. Causality as a law of the universe would not survive even a two-way communicati ons link across time, let alone a portal permittin g trans- time matter transmis sion. The principal purpose of Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever in discus sing what an advanced civilization might do with wormholes, as menti oned above, is to demonstrate in effect that if causality is to be preserved as a law of physics, it must be saved at the quantum level. Quantum gravity, a theory -to-be which has not yet been develo ped, must impose some new physical limitati ons that make impossible the producti on of stable wormholes by the Morris-Thorne-Yurtsever scenario. General relativity, our present theory of gravity, prohibits neither faster-than- light space travel nor time travel with wormholes, but it does require that the two go together . Writers of hard SF should have fun with that one!"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":" Figure 86: Creation of two conver ging pl asm a instab ilities in Earth ’s orbit Would-be wormhole engineers face the challengin g problem of how to stabilize a wormhole, a topological shortcut from one part of the universe to another . Wormholes have a strong tendency to pinch off and disappear . It is well established that a sizable quantity of negative mass-ener gy is needed to overcome this tendency . That requirement has been perceived as a \"show-stopper \" because our universe does not seem to contain \"exotic matter\" objects with negative masses. The only known way of producin g negative mass-ener gy in the laboratory, the Casimir Effect, can only make it in exceedingly tiny quantit ies. However, Sergei V. Krasnikov of the Central Astronomical Observatory in Pulkovo, Russia, using Einstein's gener al theory of relativity , may have found a way around the negative energy problem. (For a discus sion of earlier work of Krasnikov, see my column in the September ­`97 Analog ). Krasnikov has devised a new class of"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"wormholes that have the unusu al characteristic of \"puck ered\" throats. He has shown that for these wormholes, the negative mass-ener gy needed for stabilization is supplied solely by quantum fluctuati ons of fields in the vacuum. Thus, these wormholes need no \"exotic matter\" for their construc tion. His calculati ons indicate that it may be possible to construct a large transversable wormhole using only normal positive-ma ss matter and fields. To underst and what Krasnikov has accomplished, let us start with a review of the history of wormholes. For more than 80 years, Einstein's gener al theory of relativity has remained our \"stand ard mode l\" for gravity . In 1935 Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen discove red that implicit in general relativity is a tunnel-l ike structur e in the topology of space-time, which we now call a wormhole. The mathem atical equation (or \"metr ic\") of a wormhole describes a curved- space object that is a shortcut through space-time itself. A wormhole may connect two regions of space-time in the same universe (or can even connect two separat e universe s). In principle, a wormhole can also make a \"timel ike\" connection between one time and another in the same region of space, so that it becomes in effect a time machine, allowi ng communicatio n and travel between the past and the future. However, some wormhole theorists, including Steven Hawking, have sugge sted that our universe may enforce a \"chronology protection \", with increasing vacuum fluctuations destroying any wormhole that is on the verge of become a time machine. These characteristics of wormholes were used in my hard SF novel, Einstein's Bridge , in which alien-constructed wormholes were used for inter-universe commun ication, transport, and ultimately for destroying and \"rewindi ng\" our own universe back to 1 987. The mathematic al possibil ity that wormholes may exist, implic it in Einstein's equations, raises a number of interesting questions: • Are there classes of w ormhol es that are \"stabl e\", tha t continu e to exist for extend ed ti me per iods ? • Are there classes of worm holes that are \"transversab le\", in the sense that light or matter or even people could pas s through the m? • Do na tural wormhol es exist, and if so ho w can we find the m? • Could art ifici al wormhol es be produced, and if so ho w can we ma ke the m? • Could worm holes be used for fa ster-than-ligh t trav el and/or for ti me trav el? Not all of these questions can be consider ed here, but all of them have been at least partially addressed in several of my previous columns (see my Alter nate View colu mns numbers 33, 39, 53, and 69 , published in Analog in the June-`8 9, May-`90, July-`92 and mid-December -`94 issues)."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"If wormholes are to be used for FTL commun ication or transportation, the issue of stability is an extremely important one. In 1962, Wheeler and Fuller demonstrated that Einstein- Rosen wormholes (or \"bridges\") are extremely unstable, so that if such a wormhole should happen to appear spontaneously it would pinch off so rapidly that not even one ph oton of light could pass through it befo re it closed. In 1988 Michael Morris and Kip Thorne of Cal Tech showed that stable wormholes are possible after all, and they described how a stable wormhole might be constructed by an \"advanced civilization\" (i.e., not us.) They found that to stabilize a wormhole, a region of negative mass-ener gy was needed in the wormhole's \"throat\". They suggested creating this negative energy region by using the Casimir effect, a quantum effect in which long-wavelength vacuum fluctuations are suppressed in a region between conduct ing surface s. Morris and Thorne sugge sted creating the required region of negative energy by placing two electrically charged spherical capacitor plates in the curved space of the wormhole throat (with each sphere geometr ically inside the other, and with the spheres spaced about a proton diamet er apart!). Subsequent analyses showed that a Morris-Throne wormhole would have to be of planetary dimensions, would require planet-ma ss quantities of negative mass- energy, and that the tidal forces created by the space curvatur e of the wormhole throat would be likely to destroy atoms (or people) attempting passage through it. Therefore, Morris-Thorne wormholes, while perhaps stable, cannot be consider ed to be transvers able. A few years later, Matt Visser of Washington University in St. Louis suggest ed a more user-friend ly class of transv ersable wormhole. He describes his flat-sp ace wormholes as produced by cutting holes in two separated regions of space time and then sewing the edges of the holes together with cosmic string. In other words, two joined regions of flat space are framed by a loop of \"cosmic string\" of negative mass and string tension. The cosmic string (anothe r exotic artifact of general relativity) provides the needed negative energy. However, it is questionable (a) whether cosmic strings actually exist in our universe, (b) if they do, whether they can have negative mass and string tension, and (c) whether the tendencie s of the wormhole to close up and of the negative- tension cosmic string loop to expand could be precisely balanc ed to produce a stable Visser wormhole. Therefore, neither Einstein-R osen, Morris- Thorne, nor Visser wormholes appear ed feasible for FTL transport in our universe. At this point let us inquire just what theorists like Einstein, Thorne, Visser, and Krasnikov are doing when they use mathe matics to design a wormhole. General relativity provides us with a procedu re for designing a wormhole (or any other space warp) by following these thr ee steps: 1. Describe the kind of spac e-curvatur e that is desired by using a \"metric\", a symmetric 4 × 4 matrix that is a m athematical description of curved space- time. 2. Solve Einstein's equations for the \"stress-ener gy tensor\" (a mathematical descrip tion of how mass- ener gy from matter and fields is distribu ted in space), such that the stres s-ener gy tensor will produce the desired m etric."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"3. By successive approxi mations, find a configurat ion of matter and fields that will produce the requir ed stress-ener gy tensor . That's all there is to it. However, while many wormhole theorists have been able to carry out steps 1 and 2, the problem lies in accomp lishing step 3. Einstein's equations tell us that the stress-ener gy tensor needed to produce the metric for wormholes (and other space warps like \"warp- drives\" that are of interest to SF readers and writers) requires a large quantity of negative mass-energy that must be concent rated in a very small region of space. This violates what theorists call the \"Weak Energy Condition\" and has been viewed as requiring the existence of \"exotic matter\" having negative mass-ener gy. Unfort unately, all the matter and fields of our acquaintanc e have positive mass-ener gy. There has been a growing consen sus among physicists that the requirement of negative mass-ener gy makes it impos sible to construc t a wormhole with normal matter and that some \"exotic\" material like Visser's neg ative-tension cosmic would be r equired. However, this consensus may be wrong. Krasnikov has shown a third way of obtain ing the negative energy needed to form a stable wormhole. He demonstrat es that the fluctuating energy of the vacuum itself can be used as the source of negative mass energy, so that the wormhole that can be construc ted with only normal matter and fiel ds. Empty spac e, according to quantum mechanics, is not static and unchangin g, as one would naively expect. As the quantum vacuum is examined microscopically at smaller and smaller distance s, it is found that virtual particles with both positive and negative energies spontaneously appear and then disappe ar, their brief period of existence governed by Heisenber g's uncertainty principle. Krasnikov's calculati ons indicate that the negative energy part of this process is useful for wormhole engineer ing. Krasnikov separated the stress-energy tensor, developed in step 2 above, into two parts, one part from the mass-ener gy of quantum vacuum fluctuati ons and the other part from the matter and fields that form the construction materials of the wormhole. He performed \"heroic\" calculati ons with a fast computer using the large numerical relativity program GrtensorII . From these calculatio ns he demonstrated that for his particular kind of puckered wormhole, the second part of the str ess-energy tensor (the non-quantum- mechanical part) has positive energy and therefore can be produced, at least in principle, using only ordinary matter and fields. Moreover, he has shown that there is no particu lar size limitati on to the new class of wormholes, and that they cou ld be made as large as is needed. It is not clear from his publications whether Krasnikov has actually evaluated the quantum mechanical part of the stress-ener gy tensor. However, it appears that for the new class of wormholes the requirement for exotic matter seems to have been ,with the quantum vacuum itself provides the negative energy contribution from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field, the neutrin o field, and the massless scalar fie lds (as predicted by some theories). The metric of Krasnikov's new wormhole has a very simple mathem atical form, a simple four-term equation. However, the curvatu re of space in the throat of the"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"wormhole is peculiar . It is wrinkled or puckered like crepe paper, folded into sine- wave rings from the center to the edge to make a sinusoidal ly varying space warp. Krasnikov has not reported the results of step 3 of the procedu re above, so we do not know what configu ration of matter and fields might be needed to produce this metric . In particu lar, we do not know whether the needed matter densities and field strengths lie within the ranges of what is cur rently feasible. These \"engineering details\" need to be worked out. Even if only normal positive-ma ss matter is required, it may well turn out that Krasnikov wormhole can only be built out of \"unobtanium\". Also, the tidal forces from the space curvatu re and gravitati onal field gradients in wormhole throats need to be examined, to determine whether a space traveler passing through a wormhole throat of reasonable size would have a chance of survival. Moreover , Krasnikov's calculations and assumptions need to be verified by other relativity theorists. In particular, it is well known that calculations of the mass-ener gy of quantum vacuum fluctuati ons are tricky, and that results can be wrong by many orders of magnitude. It is important to verify that Krasnikov has avoided this pitfall. Nevertheles s, an important step has been made in the theory of wormholes. It has been demonstr ated that stable transver sable wormholes construc ted from normal matter are possible, at least in principle.

Tesla's experimental measurements of the wave length and frequency involved closely match Schum ann's theoretical calculations. Some of these observ ations were made in 1899 while Tesla was monitoring the electr omagnetic radiati ons due to lightnin g discharges in a thundersto rm which passed over his Colorado Springs laboratory and then moved more than 200 miles eastward across the plains. In his Colorado Springs Notes, Tesla noted that these stationary waves \"... can be produced with an oscillator ,\" and added in parenthesis, \"This is of immen se impor tance.\" 6 The importance of his observations is due to the suppo rt they lend to the prime objective of the Colorado Springs laboratory . The intent of the experiments and the laboratory Tesla had constructed was to prove that wireless tran smission of electr ical powe r was possible. Schumann Resonance is analogous to pushing a pendulum. The intent of Project Tesla is to create pulses or electrical disturbances that would travel in all directions around the Earth in the thin membrane of non-conductive air between the ground and the ionospher e. The pulses or waves would follow the surface of the Earth in all directions expanding outward to the maximum circumference of the Earth and contracting inward until meeting at a point opposite to that of the transmitter. This point is called the anti-po de. The traveling waves would be reflected back from the anti-pode to the transmitter to be reinforced and sent out again. At the time of his measurements Tesla was experiment ing with and researching methods for \"... power transmis sion and transmi ssion of intelligible messages to any point on the globe. \" Althou gh Tesla was not able to comme rcially market a system to transmit power around the globe, moder n scientific theory and mathematical calculations support his content ion that the wireless propagation of electrical power is possible and a feasible alternative to the extensive and costly grid of electrical transmis sion lines used today f or electrical po wer distr ibution.

This system was originally built by Robert Golka in 1973-1974 and used until 1982 by the United States Air Force at Wendover AFB in Wendove r, Utah. The USAF used the coil for simulating natural lightning for testing and hardening fighter aircraft. The system has a capacity of over 600 kilowatts. The coil, which is the largest part of the system, has already been built, tested, and is operati onal. A location at a high altitude is initially advantageous for reducing atmospheric losses which work against an efficient coupling to the Schumann Cavity. The high frequency, high voltage output of the coil will be half wave rectified using a uniquely designed single electr ode X-ray tube. The X-ray tube will be used to charge a 130 ft. tall, vertical tower which will function to provide a vertical current moment. The mast is topped by a metal sphere 30 inches in diamet er. X-rays emitted from the tube will ionize the atmospher e between the Tesla coil and the tower. This will result in a low resistance path causing all dischar ges to flow from the coil to the tower. A circulatin g current of 1,000 amperes in the system will create an ionizatio n and corona causing a large virtual electr ical capacitance in the medium surrounding the sphere. The total charge around the tower will be in the range of between 200-600 coulombs. Discharging the tower 7-8 times per second through a fixed or rotary spark gap will create electrical disturbances, which will resonantly excite the Schumann Cavity, and propagate ar ound the enti re Earth."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":" The propagated wave front will be reflected from the antipode back to the transmitter site. The reflected wave will be reinforced and again radiated when it returns to the transmitter . As a result, an oscillation will be established and maintained in the Schum ann Cavity. The loss of power in the cavity has been estimated to be about 6% per round trip. If the same amount of power is delive red to the cavity on each cycle of oscillati on of the transmitte r, there will be a net energy gain which will result in a net voltage, or amplitude increase. This will result in reactive energy storage in the cavity . As long as energy is delive red to the cavity, the process will continue until the energy is removed by heating, lightning discharges, or as is proposed by this project, loading by tuned circuits at distant locations for power distribution. The resonating cavity field will be detected by stations both in the United States and overse as. These will be staffed by engineers and scientists who have agreed to partic ipate in the experiment . Measurement of power inserti on and retrieval losses will be made at the transmitter site and at distant receiving locations. Equipment constructed especially for measurement of low frequency electr omagnetic waves will be employed to measure the effectivenes s of using the Schumann Cavity as a means of electr ical power distribut ion. The detection equipment used by project personne l will consist of a pick up coil and industry standard low noise, high gain operational amplifiers and active band pa ss filters. In additio n to project detection there will be a record of the experiment recorded by a netwo rk of monito ring stations that have been set up specifically to monito r electromagnetic activity in the Schumann C avity. The extreme low frequencies (ELF), present in the environment have several origins. The time varying magnetic fields produced as a result of solar and lunar influences on ionospheric currents are on the order of 30 nanotesla s. The largest time varying fields are those gener ated by solar activity and thunderstor ms. These magnetic fields reach a maximum of 0.5 microtesla s (uT) The magnetic fields produced as a result of lightning dischar ges in the Schumann Cavity peak at 7, 14, 20 and 26 Hz. The magnetic flux densities associat ed with these resonant frequencies vary f rom 0.25 to 3.6 picotesla s. per root hertz (pT /Hz1/2). Exposur e to man made sources of ELF can be up to 1 billion (1000 million or 1 x 10 9 ) times stronger than that of naturally occurring fields. Household appliances operated at 60 Hz can produce fields as high as 2.5 mT. The field under a 765 kV, 60"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Hz power line carrying 1 amp per phase is 15 uT.
