Milosz"},{"pageContent":"PART 1"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONA DARK MUSEHidden, secret, esoteric, unknown: these are some dictionary definitions for\"occult.\" The word itself has its roots in the Latin occulo, to hide, and islinked to the technical astronomical term \"occultation,\" as when one heavenlybody obscures or \"occludes\" another by passing in front of it. In the popularmind however, \"the occult\" is an all-purpose term indicating a variety ofthings, from Satanism, witchcraft and tabloid horoscopes, to internet psychicsand UFOs. Although not entirely incorrect, this catch-all phrase indicates thekind of deterioration language undergoes over time. The occult or \"occultism\" isan umbrella term for a number of disciplines and beliefs which are generallyagreed to be scientifically invalid and, in practice, worthless. Erroneous andmisguided at best, at their worst - in, for example, the gruesome activities ofsome overzealous Satanists' - some forms of occultism can indeed be dangerous.And yet, the origin of this popular notion of the occult is as occult - that is,unknown - as these practices themselves.Although the several mystical and religious philosophies that make up the basicworld view of occultism reach back to antiquity, the notion of the occult, as weunderstand it today, stems from relatively more recent times. Babylonianastrology, the Greek mysteries, hermetic philosophy, Gnosticism, Kabbalah,alchemy and other forms of occult thought are millennia old, but it was notuntil the rise of science in the late 17th century that these and otherdisciplines related to them became hidden and esoteric in the way they are seento be today. Throughout the ages, the spiritual demands placed on practitionersof these arts were rigorous and hence, only the elite were allowed to engage inthem, thus making them esoteric or secret to the profane. But they werenevertheless recognized as significant pursuits, worthy of respect anddeference. One sign of the importance hermeticism, for example, held can be seenin the fact that in 1460, Cosimo de' Medici, patron of the great Renaissancemagician Marsilio Ficino, commanded his scribe to break off translating Plato,in order to concentrate on a newly found batch of manuscripts, purported to bethe work of Hermes Trismegistus himself. Not long after, Isaac Newton, father ofthe modern scientific worldview, would busy himself much more with hisexplorations of alchemy and Biblical exegeses than with the theory of gravityfor which he is remembered today. Newton is perhaps the last of his breed, forwith the triumph of the Age of Reason, which, ironically, he helped bring about,the occult ideas and theories which he devoted innumerable hours to, becameunquestionably passe. Materialism, scientific reason, mathematical logic and anamenability to being measured - the epistemological criteria that still reignwith us today - became the sine qua non of truth and any knowledge or beliefthat did not meet these astringent requirements was summarily jettisoned. Whichis exactly what happened to the occult.To be sure, immense gains and much profit came from this advance. But there werealso many losses. One central loss was that, with the rise of scientism - thebelief that the above criteria were sufficient to account for all the phenomenaof existence - the sense of meaning that, in different ways, accompanied beliefin religion, dissolved. Another was that with the increasing power of themetaphor of the machine - Newton's clockwork universe - the specifically humanworld of feelings, emotions, aesthetics, moral values and other immeasurablephenomena, were more and more seen to be illusory, or, at best, a pleasant butultimately insignificant by-product of the purely material processes going inthe human body.The utilitarian advantages of the scientific worldview understandably occludedthese more subtle considerations. Yet a sensitive minority remained troubled andsought support for their resistance. And it was at this point, I believe, that`the occult' came into existence. In it the Enlightenment figures and earlyRomantics who questioned the new paradigm found a body of rejected knowledge, acounter-history and alternative narrative to human existence, one that ranparallel to the increasingly successful scientistic view. And as it dealtprimarily with inner, spiritual things, it was one that readily lent itself tothis sensitive minority, comprised, for the most part, of artists, poets andwriters. In their battle against the encroaching complete scientification ofhuman experience, in the last few centuries poets, artists, and writers haveoften found considerable assistance in the strange yet sometimes oddly beautifularray of rejected knowledge that makes up the occult.Starting with the Enlightenment and continuing on to the modern period, whatfollows is, I believe, a representative, though not exhaustive, survey of someof the main characters who over the last few hundred years have dipped into thismagic bag, along with samples of some of the occult texts they drew out, and,glimpses of some of the figures responsible for them. What these adventuroussouls came away with was often crazy, sometimes hilarious, and, on occasion,clearly insane. But it was just as often profound and, in more than oneinstance, possessed of a transformative, supernatural beauty .The book is slanted towards writers and poets, but other studies, drawing oncomposers and artists, could tell a similar tale. Yet there is some fundamentallink between magic and writing. We speak of magic spells. The grimoires ofwitchcraft have their roots in grammars. In ceremonial magic, reciting thecorrect word at the proper time determines the success or failure of theoperation. Kabbalah, from which most of modern magic derives, is based almostexclusively on the secret meaning of language. And Thoth, the Egyptian god ofwriting, with whom the figure of Hermes Trismegistus, author of some 365 books,was linked, was also a god of magic. Clearly the power of words is shared byboth the poet and the mage.Welcome, then, to the world of the occult. And to the dreams and occasionalnightmares inspired by its dark muse.NOTE1 See \"Blood-drinking devil worshippers face life for ritual Satanic killing.\"Guardian 1 February 2002.

After all, theEnlightenment saw the triumph of reason and science over superstition andreligious prejudice. But there is rarely a sudden and absolute disappearance ofa practice or belief that has been a central part of human culture. This isespecially true for magic, which has been around for millennia, and is stillwith us today. For the scientific account of things, the magical view had indeedbeen eclipsed. But for the popular mind, it was clearly present.In the Paris of 1784, for example, alchemists, kabbalists, astrologers and otherwonder workers could be found practically everywhere. Street venders soldengravings of the mysterious Comte de Saint-Germain. Booksellers hawked heftyvolumes on the secret occult arts. Faith-healers and alchemical physicians did abrisk trade among the poorer classes. Newspapers ran accounts of extraordinarycharacters like Leon le Juif, who possessed a magical mirror, and M. Ruer, whohad discovered the Philosopher's Stone. Talking dogs, a child who could seeunderground, men who walked on water, and reports of strange creatures like themonster with a man's face, lion's mane, bull's horns, snake's scales and bat'swings, peppered the daily press. Even eminent authorities like Restif de laBretonne and Mirabeau accepted the idea that Frederick II had produced satyrsand centaurs via experiments with sodomy ... Magic had so firm a grip on theFrench popular consciousness that, according to the historian Robert Darnton,the authorities found alchemists, sorcerers and fortune tellers much betterplaced as spies and police informants than their usual source, the priests.'This fascination with occultism was not limited to the French, and a similar, ifless extroverted appeal was exhibited across the channel, in England, as well asin other cities on the continent.The popular press of Enlightenment France may strike us as not too dissimilar totoday's tabloids; but there remained other, less suspect areas in which a moreserious interest in occultism prospered. One, the central one with which thisbook is concerned, was literature. The other was politics. The followingselection on Enlightenment Occultism aims to give some idea of how thesecurrents came together and helped shape the culture of the time.SWEDENBORGPerhaps the greatest occult figure of the 18th century was Emanuel Swedenborg(1688-1772), whose sober and methodical approach to the hidden mysteries set astandard too often ignored by later devotees. For most of his adult life abrilliant and prolific scientist, Swedenborg wrote an immense number ofscientific studies on everything from metallurgy to the anatomy of the brain. Hewas also a statesman and assessor of Swedish mines, as well as an inventor ofconsiderable talent: when given the task of transporting several ships inlandacross mountains, Swedenborg managed it successfully, well ahead of schedule.Many of his scientific insights were also well ahead of their time, and if fornothing else, he would be remembered for these today in his native Sweden. Butin 1745, at the age of 57, something happened. A profound spiritual crisisinvolving weird prophetic dreams and shattering hypnagogic visions - including avisitation from Christ - shook Swedenborg's strictly scientific consciousnessand launched him on a new career as a cartographer of strange inner landscapesand occult worlds. He spoke with the dead, journeyed to other planets, and moststrikingly, visited heaven and hell, returning to write an immense book aboutwhat he saw there. He wrote other immense books as well, most of them explainingin a dry, scholarly style the true meaning of the Bible. Swedenborg's influenceon western culture has been great; his readers have included Goethe, WilliamBlake, Coleridge, Balzac, Baudelaire, Yeats, Strindberg and Arnold Schoenberg.What appealed to them was the air of sanity and common sense with whichSwedenborg made even the most incredible pronouncements: that people on the moonspeak from their stomachs, for example, or that Martians have two-tone faces.But in the same book he could speak of hell as a psychological condition, anidea which at the time seemed radical, but which today we can appreciatereadily.The standard account of Swedenborg's career has his plunge into other worldshappening out of the blue, but Swedenborg's initiation into the occult was notquite as precipitous as that. Before his voyages to heaven and hell, Swedenborghad devoted a considerable time to various occult practices: breath control,meditation, automatic writing, as well as visionary methods based on a form ofsexual mysticism. Swedenborg's links to London were many, and during an earlyvisit in 1710, he may have joined a Jacobin Masonic Lodge. During a later visit,in 1744, there is reason to believe Swedenborg became a member of the Moravians,a secret society led by the eccentric Count Zinzendorf. Zinzendorf propagated amystical political doctrine whose aim was to bring about the millennium byuniting Christians and Jews through kabbalism - a theme common to manyEnlightenment mystics. Swedenborg was in London, staying in Wellclose Square,when his mystical experience occurred, and he may at that time have receivedsome kabbalistic tutoring from Samuel Jacob Chayyim Falk, mentor perhaps toanother Enlightenment occultist, Cagliostro. Falk, who was born into a Polishcommunity of the followers of the `false Messiah', Sabbatai Zevi, came toEngland in 1742, and set up shop - literally - on the old London Bridge, whichin those days was lined with houses. Here he ran an alchemical laboratory, whilemaintaining from his home in the East End a secret occult school. AlthoughSwedenborg later claimed not to have studied Kabbalah, he is known to havevisited Jewish districts in Amsterdam, Hamburg, Prague and Rome, and evidencefrom his own writings suggests a familiarity with kabbalistic thought. Lovingerotic union is part of the ritual worship of the Jewish mystical community,reflecting the original creative act of the Godhead, as well as thereunification of male and female energies. In his own work, Swedenborgemphasized that in heaven, angels continue to make love, and in the Latinversion of his book Conjugal Love, Swedenborg spelled out in detail methods ofbreath control and meditation enabling a practitioner to maintain an erectionand remain within an orgasmic trance for considerable periods.2For the literary minded, one theme stands out from Swedenborg's massive edifice:the idea of `correspondences'. This will turn up in a host of different ways inthe centuries after his death, both as a central axiom of magical thinking aswell as a core theme of symbolist poetry. Swedenborg argued that the physicalworld is rooted in a higher, spiritual world, and that correspondences existbetween the two. In grasping the links between the physical and the spiritualworlds, we come closer to understanding the divine design. Swedenborg'scorrespondences are perhaps the most thorough expression of the alchemical axiom`as above, so below'; they are also a powerful embodiment - literally - of theidea that man is a microcosm, containing within himself the entire cosmos. In anage moving inexorably toward the `trousered ape' of Darwinian thought,Swedenborg argued conversely that man is truly made in the image of the divine,and spoke of the ultimate reality as Universal Man, the Anthropos, a themecentral to kabbalistic and hermetic teachings.In the 19th century, Baudelaire took the idea of correspondences and infused itwith elements of synesthesia and the notion of the unity of the arts. But forhis own time and immediately after, Swedenborg was known mostly as a prophet ofa new age. The Church of the New Jerusalem, of which William Blake was a member,was founded after Swedenborg's death and preached an apocalyptic doctrine thatwent well with the social and political ferment brewing across Europe.Other central figures of the Occult Enlightenment, like Franz Anton Mesmer(1734-1815), Giuseppe Balsamo (1743-1795) - better known as Cagliostro - and theComte de Saint-Germain (1710-1784?) weren't writers. Most balanced accountsadmit there was something of the charlatan in all three. Yet it is difficult toaccept this as a complete assessment of their careers, and some idea of theirlife and times is essential in any survey of magic in the 18th century.MESMERMesmer, who considered himself a strict scientist, began life in Iznang, avillage on the German shore of Lake Constance. He studied at a JesuitTheological School, and later registered as a law student in Vienna. He thenturned his attention to medicine and in 1766 earned his medical degree with adissertation on the influence of the planets on human diseases - evidence' thatancient hermetic ideas were still respectable in the mid18th century. Little isknown of Mesmer's youth, and there is some question as to how he supportedhimself during his university days. In his monumental Discovery of theUnconscious, Henri E•Ellenberger speculates that Mesmer may have been helped bysecret societies. If so, this would not be unusual; the late 18th century was atime rife with secret societies and occult organizations. As the Baroness d'Oberkirch, an aristocratic socialite and intimate of mesmeric circles in Parisand Strasbourg, remarked: \"Never, certainly, were Rosicrucians, alchemists,prophets, and everything related to them so numerous and so influential.Conversation turns almost entirely upon these matters; they fill everyone'sthoughts, they strike everyone's imagination ... Looking around us, we see onlysorcerers, initiates, necromancers and prophets.s'Mesmer's financial problems were solved when he married a wealthy widow and sethimself up in Vienna. He became a patron of the arts and his friends includeGluck, Haydn (both masons) and the Mozart family. Wolfgang Mozart - who as aFreemason and quite possibly a member of the Illuminati would be no stranger tosecret societies - performed his first opera, Bastien and Bastienne, in Mesmer'sprivate theatre.' Of Mesmer's estate, Leopold, Wolfgang's father, had this tosay: \"The garden is incomparable, with its avenues and statues, a theatre, abirdhouse, a dovecote and a belvedere on the summit. i5Mesmer first hit upon his discovery while treating a Fraulein Oesterlin in1773-1774. Fraulein Osterlin suffered from several severe.symptoms, and Mesmernoted the cycle of their appearance and withdrawal. Mesmer was aware thatdoctors in England had experimented with treating patients with magnets, anddecided to do the same. He attached magnets to Fraulein Oesterlin's stomach andlegs. She improved considerably. Mesmer came to believe that it was not themagnets alone that cured her, but his own animal magnetism. The age of mesmerismwas born.The basic tenets of mesmerism are that a subtle, physical fluid fills theuniverse and forms a connecting link between man, the earth and the stars;disease is the result of blockages of this fluid in the body; and techniquesexist to enable these fluids to move more freely. The famous `mesmeric passes'were attempts by practitioners to help the magnetism in its flow. It's clearthat while he didn't consider himself an occultist, many occultists do in factadhere to some form of Mesmer's basic idea. A form of it is evident in muchholistic healing. It is also clear that a very similar notion appeared in the20th century in the form of Wilhelm Reich's `orgone energy'. In Reich's case,the relationship between an uninhibited, healthy flow of orgone energy and sexwas unambiguous. In Mesmer's case, the animal aspect of his magnetism raised aconsiderable number of eyebrows.Strangely, Mesmer's first official recognition came when he was asked byPrince-Elector Max Joseph of Bavaria to testify in an inquiry into the allegedcures of a faith healer, J j. Gassner, who performed what could only be calledexorcisms. Mesmer agreed that Gassners' cures were authentic, but claimedspirits had nothing to do with it. Gassner merely succeeded through using hisanimal magnetism.Like many others, Mesmer was drawn to Paris. He arrived in 1778, proclaiming hisdiscovery. In the shadow of the Revolution, it was a strangely restless place.An unstable government, a catastrophic financial situation, widespreadcorruption, a weak king and a spendthrift queen, combined with reckless marketspeculation, gambling and loose morals to create an atmosphere of uncertaintyand unease. A disastrous war with England led to a hysterical enthusiasm for theAmerican War of Independence. It was a climate in which some sudden, radicalshift was expected. Haughty, prickly and egotistical, Mesmer's domineeringpersonality and courtly manners - not to mention his animal magnetism - helpedhim gain access to Parisian society. He settled in a private mansion in PlaceVendome, and accounts of Mesmer's success in curing a variety of ills percolatedthrough society. `Mesmeric baths' and a collective treatment, the banquet,became popular pastimes among the rich, ill-disposed and, often, hypochondriacalaristocracy. A mesmeric Society of Harmony was set up in 1783, adding to thealready numerous secret societies; branches appeared throughout France, theiraim to spread Mesmer's teachings. By 1784, his success had peaked. There weremany cures, and Mesmer had several champions, yet he eventually fell foul of thescientific establishment, as much for his alleged quackery as for his success.Yet, it has to be admitted that the frequent dishabille of Mesmer's attractivefemale clients, the orgy-like atmosphere of a mesmeric salon, and theorgasmic-like `magnetic crisis' that signalled the start of a cure, did notproduce the appearance of a sober, scientific pursuit. After a damningexamination by the Academy of Sciences, including, famously, Benjamin Franklin,and his embarrassing failure to cure the blind pianist Maria-Theresia Paradis,Mesmer's fortunes took a downward turn. He was ridiculed in cartoons andsatirical plays. Although he was always able to find clients, his star hadwaned, and he died, embittered and alone, in his native Austria at the age of78. Although his name has become part of the language - we speak of beingmesmerized - the credit for discovering what mesmerism actually was went to hisone-time disciple, the Marquis de Puysegur, who, while magnetizing a patientdiscovered he had put him to sleep. The term hypnotism was coined half a centurylater by the Englishman James Braid.Whatever Mesmer's own fortunes, mesmerism took on a life of its own. In thehands of disciples like Nicolas Bergasse and Jacques-Pierre Brissot it took on aradical social character, propagating a variant of Rousseau's noble savage,championing primitive nature over decadent society. In various other forms itcombined with spiritualism, Swedenborgianism, freemasonry, and strains ofRosicrucianism to add an esoteric and occult flavour to the edgy politicalclimate. Freemasonry especially, which spoke of spiritual egalitarianism anduniversal brotherhood, seemed to embody many of the ideals which would latererupt catastrophically in the French Revolution - hence the antipathy shown itby both the aristocracy and the Church. Freemasonry had enjoyed a revival in theearlier part of the century, and in a few decades had burgeoned into a tanglednest of competing and confusing secret societies, offering ever higher and moreobscure grades - with some, like the Illuminati, following a mystical/politicalagenda. Along with competing lodges in England, Scotland and the continent, in1777, it received an additional mystical jolt from perhaps the most flamboyantoccultist of the lot, Cagliostro.CAGLIOSTROCagliostro started life in Sicily as Giuseppe Balsamo, although there is stillsome dispute over whether Cagliostro and Balsamo were in fact the same man. LikeRasputin, his name elicits a vague sense of someone sinister, yet few peoplehave any concrete idea who or what he was. Carlyle's tags of \"King of Liars\" and\"Great Quack Face\" are understandable, given that the sole source of anyinformation about Cagliostro in Carlyle's time was the biography written by hismurderers, the Inquisition. Among other claims to fame, Cagliostro was the lastperson executed by the Inquisition, more than likely strangled by his jailer inthe Castel San Leo in Rome. The picture of Cagliostro as a spiritual swindlereven hit the big screen, when Orson Welles portrayed the Sicilian mountebank inthe 1949 film, Black Magic. Even Goethe, no stranger to the occult sciences,satirized him in his play The Grand Copht. Yet if Cagliostro's reputation isunderstandable, it is not entirely accurate. Like many occult masters,Cagliostro didn't rule out fakery if it would secure his aims. Yet those aimswere often noble, and there was something about his presence that suggested acertain dominance and personal force.'Balsamo left home in his teens after being thrown out of his seminary school forimprovising on a sacred text he was reading aloud to the class: he substitutedthe names of local prostitutes for those of saints. For the next twenty years hewandered across Europe, practising a variety of trades: forger, alchemist,copper smelter and travelling doctor touting a borax-based skin lotion. Thewandering life was common to many hermetic philosophers: Paracelsus' travels arelegendary, as were Cornelius Agrippa's, and at some point during his travels,Balsamo met another 18th century occultist, the celebrated rake, Giovanni JacopoCasanova. (Decades later, in his declining years, Casanova spitefully recalledCagliostro as `badly hung'.) Up until his thirty-fourth year there is little todistinguish Balsamo from the other adventurers who scrambled across Europe,living by their wits and trusting in the credulity and ennui of the well-heeledfor their livelihood. Then, on a visit to London in 1776, Balsamo changed hisname to Cagliostro and he literally became a different person. The central causeof this transformation was freemasonry.Balsamo had always been attracted to the occult - his days as a travellingalchemist say as much. It is even possible that he may have met Swedenborgduring his first visit to London in 1772; although in his last days by then,Swedenborg was lucid until his death, the date and time of which, incidentally,he accurately predicted. Certainly by his next visit in 1776 Cagliostro wasfrequenting Swedenborgian circles, and possibly visiting the kabbalist Falk. Butafter being admitted to the Esperance Lodge of Freemasons, on 12 April 1777 atthe King's Head on Gerrard Street in Soho, he adopted freemasonry as his life'smission. He soon developed a curious new form of Masonic initiation, theso-called Egyptian Rite. Accounts differ as to how he came across this. Some sayhe was initiated into the Egyptian Rite by the Comte de SaintGermain. Betterevidence suggests that the ubiquitous Falk was responsible. Cagliostro himselfclaimed that during a visit to London he discovered in a bookstall a manuscriptarguing the Egyptian origins of freemasonry. This trope of the magical bookappearing strangely at the right moment will be repeated several times in thehistory of magic: the `editor' of Bulwer-Lytton's Zanoni meets a Rosicrucian ina Covent Garden bookshop, the authenticity of the Hermetic order of the GoldenDawn stemmed from a bookstall in Farringdon Road, and Gustav Meyrink is savedfrom suicide by a magical pamphlet sliding under his door. Whether or not thebook actually existed seems irrelevant. Cagliostro's belief in his Egyptian Ritewas unshakeable, his oratorical gifts persuasive; he had found his life'scalling, as well as an interesting way to make a living. Calling himself theGrand Copht - after the prophet Enoch, supposed founder of Egyptian masonry -Cagliostro took to the roads, doing the occult circuit, bringing a higher, moreinspiring initiation into what had become for many a routine social club.Cagliostro was very successful. Entering Venice, Berlin, Leipzig and St.Petersburg in his black coach covered in kabbalistic symbols, he must have beenan impressive sight, as he headed for the local Masonic lodges. Yet not everyonewas satisfied with his plan to heal the rifts and schisms in the craft. Hereceived some resistance in 1784, during the general Convent of Freemasonscalled together in Paris by the lodge `Les Amis Reunis', otherwise known as thePhilalethes, or `lovers of truth'. Cagliostro's demands that all of the lodgesrecognize the preeminence of his Egyptian Rite did not go down well, nor did hisrequest that the Philalethes destroy all their records meet with much approval.Whatever its source, Cagliostro's motives for promulgating the Egyptian Ritewere noble, and for all their occult character, in keeping with Enlightenmentideals of egalitarianism and brotherhood. Like Zinzendorf and Falk, who wasknown to associate freely with Christians, Cagliostro's aim was to unitedisparate groups under a common Masonic goal: the regeneration of mankind. Withthis in view, the Egyptian Rite admitted Jews and, in a radical break withMasonic tradition, women as well.As well as a Mason, Cagliostro was something of a healer, and the transformationfrom fly-by-night adventurer to the Grand Copht seemed to have increased hispowers consider ably. Unlike Mesmer, who was criticized for treating onlywealthy patients and for ignoring the needy, Cagliostro often refused to servethe rich. In European capitals, he would head to the poor district, take humblelodgings, distribute money and treat the sick, refusing any payment. In hisdisplays of clairvoyance, he often employed children as mediums, and it is truehe resorted to trickery on occasion. Yet, there are numerous accounts of hisaccuracy. Baroness D'Oberkirch, who was not one of his supporters, admitted thathe was right about several items he communicated to her at their first meeting,facts which he could not have known; and later, while in Strasbourg, when heannounced to her the death of the Empress of Austria, the news of the empress'sdemise only arrived three days later. Other evidence of Cagliostro's powers wasgiven by the Marshall von Medem, the orientalist Count de Gebelin and theCardinal Rohan.Mention of Rohan brings us to the `Diamond Necklace Affair'. Although Cagliostroplayed an insignificant part in the swindle, he was shattered by it. When thescandal broke, his reputation was in shreds, and his magnificent self-confidencenever recovered. He defended himself, and was acquitted, but this was only aftera year in the Bastille awaiting trial. The impression he made destroyed hisreputation. In court he launched into a long soliloquy, speaking of hisaristocratic parentage, calling himself \"a noble voyager, Nature's unfortunatechild.\" This drew laughter, not sympathy, and with his long hair and greentaffeta coat, he cut a ridiculous figure. His life story, complete with accountsof his mystic travels in Asia, Africa and Arabia failed to impress, and he wasbanished from France.Cagliostro became a wanderer again, but his bad publicity preceded him and hewas thrown out of practically every place he sought refuge. Strangely, inLondon, where his Egyptian Rite did not draw many initiates, he wrote a Letterto the French People. It sold well in Paris, and seems in some ways to predictthe coming deluge. He speaks of not returning to Paris until the Bastille istorn down, and hints at a drastic change in government. It was perhaps theseprophecies that made the Vatican regard him as a dangerous political revolution.Attempting to promote freemasonry in Rome, Cagliostro was arrested and chargedwith plotting to overthrow the Church, something that the Illuminati indeed hadin mind. In 1789 he was thrown into prison. At the age of 52, he was executed.Reports of his death were not believed, and in 1797, when French soldierscaptured the San Leo prison, they searched for him. It was not until a reportordered by Napoleon confirmed his death that the world finally accepted that theGrand Copht was gone.LE COMTE DE SAINT GERMAINIn the 18th century wit, a knack for conversation, an ingratiating manner andthe ability to seem perpetually fascinating, were as much in demand askabbalistic knowledge and alchemical skill. The man who was known as the Countof Saint-Germain, or le Comte de Saint-Germain, or, on occasion, `derWundermann', had these qualities and, like many occultists who followed him, hepurposely encouraged an air of mystery about his past. Little is known of hisorigins. He may or may not have been born in 1710 in Portugal, into a family ofSephardic Jews. It's also possible that he was Frances Ragoczy, a Transylvanianprince who died in SchleswigHolstein, Germany, in 1784, only to be seen fiveyears later, in 1789, in Paris, during the Revolution. Lastly, he may still bealive today, secure in a Himalayan inner sanctum, awaiting the right moment forhis return. Certainly since the 19th century he has become, like the WanderingJew, a figure of myth, restored and revamped in different fashions to fill aplace in various occult pantheons. His central occult claim was to haveperfected the alchemical elixir vitae, which cured all ills and bestowedimmortality. Madame Blavatsky included him among her Tibetan masters, and inmore recent years the right-wing American spiritual teacher Elizabeth ClareProphet dusted off the count and employed him as spokesman for her less thaninspiring pronouncements. Indeed, if the count were alive today, he would morethan likely find a comfortable niche for himself as a talk show host, or atleast a frequent guest among those who are famous for being famous.The man called Saint-Germain did possess a genuine charm and culture, as well asan impressive knowledge of chemistry and history, which allowed him to speakwith authority both on alchemy and the past, and this in a way that suggested heactually did witness the events in question. He seemed to always dress in blackand white, was an accomplished violinist with a good singing voice, had a fluentcommand of several European languages, and a knack for perfecting dyes for silkand leather. That he could also transform base metals into gold, remove flawsfrom diamonds, had, two thousand years earlier, invented freemasonry and hencewas much older than he looked are more doubtful claims. Saint-Germain's youthfulappearance may have been a result of a practice that probably accounts for hishabit of not eating at the many banquets and feasts he nevertheless enlivenedwith his wit and acumen. It is more than likely that he was a vegetarian andgenuinely did not relish the ample portions that made up the well-heeled 18thcentury menu. He claimed to eat only a special elixir that he prepared himself,but it is also possible that he ate a normal meal beforehand unobserved.The first mention of Saint-Germain is in a letter from Horace Walpole in 1743,where he remarks of his appearance in London. Soon after he was expelled from.England on suspicion of being a spy for the Stuart pretenders. He then went toFrance and became a favourite of Louis XV, more than likely through theinfluence of Madame de Pompadour. Saint-Germain was an accomplished ladies' man;he would often make a present of an eau de toilette that he claimed preventedwrinkles, saying it was a small token of his esteem. Like Casanova, who thoughthim a charlatan (but admired his skill with the female sex) and Cagliostro - whomay have received the Egyptian Rite from him - Saint-Germain floated acrossEurope, working as a magician, wit and spy. He was known in Vienna as aconfidant of Counts Zabor and Lobkowitz, and it was in their company that he metand befriended the French Marshal de Belle-Isle, who brought him to France.Before meeting Louis XV, he moved to Holland and called himself Count Surmount;there he set up several successful factories for the ennobling of metals. In1762 he arrived in St. Petersburg, and became involved in the conspiracy to makeCatherine the Great Queen of Russia. He became a great friend of Count AlexeiOrlov, and was even made a Russian general, calling himself General Welldone -whether in jest or earnest is unknown. In Nuremberg in 1774 he received thesupport of the Margrave of Nuremberg, Charles Alexander, and it was here thatthe story of his being Prince Ragoczy began. When the margrave discovered thatthis particular Prince Ragoczy was dead, along with his brothers, SaintGermainhad to move on. He was by now in his sixties. Luck was with him, and in 1779 hecame under the protection of the landgrave Charles of Hesse-Cassel. At thelandgrave's castle in Schleswig-Holstein, Saint-Germain tutored his patron inthe occult sciences, a position he held for five years, until his death - ormost recent disappearance - in 1784.Descriptions of Saint-Germain range from \"the completest charlatan, fool,rattle-pate, windbag and swindler\" (Count Warnstedt), to \"perhaps one of thegreatest sages who ever lived\" (Charles of Hesse-Cassel), to \"a highly giftedman with a very alert mind\" who nevertheless was \"completely without judgment\"and who gained his notoriety through \"the lowest and basest flattery of which aman is capable . . .\" (Count Alvensleben, Prussian Ambassador to Dresden). Hewas, it seems, a man of considerable culture and wit, with a sincere interest inchemistry, who used the mystification of the occult to open doors that mayotherwise have remained closed. What actual contribution he made to the hermeticarts, however, is unclear.THE UNKNOWN PHILOSOPHERThe life of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin had none of the eventfulness of Mesmeror Cagliostro, and although he moved among them, he did not try to ingratiatehimself with the aristocracy as did Saint-Germain. Saint-Martin was a truehermetic philosopher, deeply concerned with mankind's spiritual destiny, aprofoundly serious individual. Like Swedenborg, he had a message. He is not outto impress or mystify, but to educate and inspire. His central theme is one thatwill blossom with the Romantics of the next generation. Man, he tells us, isreally a god, or at least has the potential to be one, a belief he shared withhis contemporary William Blake. With Blake, Saint-Martin believed that theexternal, physical world of space and time is the result of some primevalcatastrophe, a `fall' from our inherent divinity, into the limits of finitude.And like Blake, Saint-Martin sees the magician's task as the opening of thedoors of perception, and a return to our birthright.Louis Claude de Saint-Martin was born in Amboise, in the province of Touraine on18 January 1743. His parents were pious Catholics, and although his mother dieda few days after his birth, his stepmother seems to have taken her placeadmirably, and Saint-Martin remained devoted to her throughout his life. Afrail, delicate child - he once remarked that a deficiency in his astral partsaccounted for his ill-health - a book on self-knowledge that he read in hisyouth set him on the mystic path. Reading it he embarked on a life-longdetachment from the world, and took his first steps on a voyage into theinterior. He studied at the College of Pontlevoi, his father having in mind forhim a career in law. Although SaintMartin completed his studies, he felt noattraction to the bar, and convinced his father to allow him to enter militarylife. An influential relative secured a lieutenant's commission in the regimentof Foix. Army life may seem an unusual choice for a mystic, particularly afragile one, but in 1766, after the Seven Years War and the Treaty ofVersailles, Europe was at peace, and would remain so for some time, andSaint-Martin found ample time to pursue his studies in philosophy and religion.It was in 1767, while stationed at Bordeaux, that he met the man who wouldchange his life. Don Martines de Pasqually de la Tour - otherwise known asMartinez Pasquales - was a follower of Swedenborg, a Rosicrucian, and the headof an order of Masonic illuminism known as the Elect Cohens - Cohen being Hebrewfor priest. Pasqually's background is vague: Spanish or Portuguese, it isuncertain if he was a Christian or a Jew He was, however, a serious occultist,and his Order of the Elect Cohens practised a variant of ceremonial magic thatinvolved number mysticism, kabbalism and a form of theurgy, the calling down orinvoking of god forms. His meeting with Pasqually had the effect on Saint-Martinthat freemasonry had on Cagliostro: he had found his life's calling. In 1771 heleft the military and devoted the rest of his life to preaching firstPasqually's occult doctrine, and then his own form of theosophical wisdom. Forthe next few years, Saint-Martin travelled across France, visiting Paris, Lyonsand Bordeaux; during this time he communicated with other Martinists, includingthe novelist Jacques Cazotte.In 1772 Pasqually left France for St. Domingo, where, in 1774, he died inPort-au-Prince. The Martinists were left adrift, Pasqually failing to initiatethem into the final reaches of their hierarchy. Rather than despair,Saint-Martin wrote the first of a number of books, Of Errors and of Truth, andin his social life he tried to pass on the truths of mysticism, while revealingthe errors of the atheistic philosophy propagated by Voltaire and theEncyclopedists. These were the years of Cagliostro and Mesmer, of Jean BaptisteWillermoz and Lavater.Saint-Martin moved among the aristocracy, and became involved with mesmericcircles in Lyons and Paris. The Lyons mesmerists were especially rich in occultinfluences, having in their midst Rosicrucians, Swedenborgians, alchemists andkabbalists. Willermoz, Saint-Martin's close friend, a member of practicallyevery secret society of the time, believed he received secret messages from God,through the medium of mesmeric somnambulists. Saint-Martin helped Willermozdecode these messages, and he was also helpful to Mesmer's important disciple,Puysegur. Saint-Martin joined the Parisian Society of Harmony in 1784, but feltthat Mesmer's emphasis on the physical action of his fluids strayed dangerouslyclose to materialism, and that this could attract the attention of unwantedastral spirits.Saint-Martin decided that the anxious climate of the time suggested caution.During his lifetime he published his works under the pseudonym of `the UnknownPhilosopher.' His biographer and interpreter A.E. Waite remarks that hispersonal safety was a consideration: this was, after all, the time of the GreatTerror. But Saint-Martin's membership of secret societies was also a reason. Theruse was pointless, and the identity of the Unknown Philosopher was soon commonknowledge. Like other occult seekers, Saint-Martin travelled abroad, visitingItaly, Russia, Strasbourg and London, where he met William Law and theastronomer Herschel. August 10 1792 found him in Paris, where \"the streets nearthe house I was in were a field of battle; the house itself a hospital where thewounded were brought.\" He had already been made penniless by the Revolution and,in 1794, when an edict exiled the nobility from Paris, he returned to - hisbirth place, Amboise. His time there was spent trying to wed his politicalconcerns with his spiritual insights.Saint-Martin's last years were spent in the study of Jacob Boehme, the `TeutonicTheosopher' whose ideas influenced people like William Blake and Hegel. A 17thcentury cobbler, Boehme had a mystical experience staring at the sunlightreflected on a pewter dish. He then claimed to see the 'signature' of things andwent on to write weighty tomes in an. obscure alchemical language. Dark andprofound, SaintMartin worked at unifying Boehme's vision with his earlierMartinist doctrines. He seemed to have sensed that his last days were upon him,and writing to the end, after a brief fit of apoplexy, he died on 13 October1803. Followers of his ideas came to be called Martinists as well, causing someconfusion among occult historians.Saint-Martin's central theme is that mankind's mission is to `repair' the world.A similar doctrine appears in the Kabbalah, in which creation is the result ofan overflowing of the sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Our job is to somehow clearup the mess. Walter Benjamin, an unorthodox kabbalist with Marxist leanings, sawhistory as an unending series of accidents, rather like an infinite pile-up onsome eternal motorway. Saint-Martin would have agreed, but would not have sharedBenjamin's confidence in Marxist ideology; rather he counted on our capacity tomake contact with our pre-lapsarian source. Tolstoy, August Strindberg and O.V.Milosz were among his readers. Perhaps A.E. Waite provides the best descriptionof the Unknown Philosopher:The Unknown Philosopher ... was a man of many friends, of strong attachments ...Saint-Martin is almost the only mystic who was also in his way a politician,with a scheme for the reconstruction of society; an amateur in music; anapprentice in poetry; a connoisseur in belles lettres; a critic of hiscontemporaries; an observer of his times; a physician of souls truly, but inthat capacity with his finger always on the pulse of the world.KARL VON ECKHARTHAUSENKarl Von Eckharthausen, who, with Saint-Martin and Kirchberger, Baron deLiebistorf, carried on one of the most detailed and enlightening occultcorrespondences of the time, is little known or read today. Aside from studentsof European mysticism and Christian theosophy, the group among whomEckharthausen receives passing interest are the readers of the notoriousAleister Crowley, the most celebrated - if that is the correct word - magicianof the 20th century. It was in fact Eckharthausen's book The Cloud upon theSanctuary that set Crowley off on his colourful, if morally ambiguous career.Crowley first came across the notion of a hidden community of spiritual adeptsfrom reading A.E. Waite's Book of Black Magic and Pacts; in it, Waite refersobscurely to such a secret society. Crowley wrote to Waite, asking for moreinformation. Waite suggested reading Eckharthausen. Crowley did. In his`autohagiography', The Confessions of Aleister Crowley, the Great Beast remarksthat:The Cloud upon the Sanctuary told me of a secret community of saints inpossession of every spiritual grace, of the keys to the treasure of nature, andof moral emancipation such that there was no intolerance or unkindness ... theirone passion was to bring mankind into the sphere of their own sublimity ... Iwas absorbed in The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, reading it again and again,without being put off by the pharisaical, priggish and pithe- cantropoid notesof its translator ...What Eckharthausen himself might have thought of this endorsement is unknown,but one assumes he wouldn't have cherished the idea that as `satanic' a figureas Crowley was inspired by his devotional tract. What attracted Crowley was theidea of a secret, hidden Church, a congregation of the elect, an inner circle ofadepts, devoted to the noble cause of truth. The idea appealed to Crowley'staste for mysteries, as well as his own penchant for elitism, a sensibilityshared by many occultists. Crowley himself would soon join the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn; kicked out of that, he became head of another occultorganization, the O.T.O., or Order Templi Orientis, then started one of his own,the Argentinum Astrum, or Silver Star. Crowley was not the only occult thinkermoved by such a notion. Madame Blavatsky spoke of the Hidden Masters, secure intheir Himalayan stronghold, steering man in his spiritual evolution. Ever sincethe Rosicrucians in the 17th century, the notion of some hidden brotherhood,devoted to mankind's spiritual growth, has been a key theme of occultistthought. In the secret society ridden 18th century, Eckharthausen's tract hit avery responsive nerve. And like the Rosicrucian myth, whether such a hiddenbrotherhood really existed or not was unimportant: people interested in itsexistence acted as if it did.Eckharthausen's brotherhood, however, differed from the Rosicrucians in onerespect. Where the authors of the Fama Fraternitas and other Rosicrucian tractsspoke of their brotherhood as an actual body, made up of definite members, asany other kind of society would be, Eckharthausen makes clear that his hiddenChurch is not some inner circle of, say, the exterior Catholic Church, or somesociety like the Freemasons. It is much more a community of like-minded souls,an idea found in Swedenborg and in 20th century occultists like RD. Ouspensky,who, in his spiritual travels, came upon a variety of individuals bearing themarks of a dawning cosmic consciousness. Like Ouspensky, for Eckharthausen, thisshift in consciousness from the mundane to the mystical is both the aim of hisspiritual elect, acid the sign of membership within it.Karl Von Eckharthausen was born on 28 June 1752 at the Castle of Haimbhausen inBavaria. Like Saint-Martin, he lost his mother at birth, but Eckharthausen'sappearance in the world was a source of double sorrow. He was an illegitimatechild, his mother the daughter of the overseer of the estate. His father, thecount, was nevertheless very affectionate, treated him well, and gave him a fineupbringing and education. But his double loss of mother and legitimacy instilledin Karl a lingering melancholy, and, again like Saint-Martin, he early ondeveloped a retiring attitude to the world, and a profound sense of detachmentfrom it.Eckharthausen studied at Munich, then went to Ingoldstadt to pursue philosophyand law. As we will see, Ingoldstadt was the base for Adam Weishaupt's notoriousMasonic splinter group, the Illuminati. Weishaupt was a professor of canonicallaw at the university, and one wonders if Eckharthausen came into contact withWeishaupt or was, indeed, one of his students. The Illuminati were a kind ofsecret society behind the secret societies, and it is not too far-fetched to seein Eckharthausen's hidden Church, a more spiritual version of Weishaupt'sinvisible brotherhood. Eckharthausen's concerns were more religious thanpolitical, and although he speaks of a \"theocratic republic,\" which will one daybe, \"Regent Mother of the whole world,\" Weishaupt's Enlightenment rationalismwould have repelled Eckharthausen's mystical temperament.Karl's father procured for him the title of Aulic Councillor, and in 1780 hebecame censor at the Library of Munich - a perhaps enviable position for awriter - then in 1784, Keeper of the Archives of the Electoral House. Accordingto A.E. Waite, Eckharthausen produced sixty-nine works, turning his hand todrama, politics, religion, history, art criticism, as well as his mystical andoccult books. Few of these, if any, are read today, and in his own lifetime, hewas most famous for a handbook of Catholic prayers entitled God is Purest Love.This went into some sixty editions in Germany and was translated into severalEuropean languages, as well as Church Latin. His influence on the mysticalcurrents of his time was considerable. Saint-Martin remarked that he was moreinterested in Eckharthausen than he could express; among other things, the twoshared a profound interest in number mysticism, a practice that occupiedSaint-Martin in his early days with Martines de Pasqually, and to which hereturned in the last decade of his life. And their mutual correspondent, BaronKirchberger, writing to Saint-Martin, spoke of Eckharthausen as \"a man ofimmense reading and wonderful fertility ... an extraordinary personage.\" It wasto Kirchberger's great regret that a proposed meeting at the Swiss frontier hadto be called off on account of the Councillor's health. At their meetingKirchberger hoped to receive a communication of the Lost Word fromEckharthausen, who, we assume, had found it. Any information on what may havepassed between them is, like the word itself, lost. Amiable, charitable, highlycultured and devout, Eckharthausen married three times, had several children,and died, after a painful illness, on 13 May 1813.WILLIAM BECKFORDAlong with mystical politics and the regeneration of the world, occultism duringthe Enlightenment also took on a less idealistic character and appeared in waysmore concerned with aesthetics and the search for exotic and sensational formsof entertainment than with revelation. One such form was the Gothic novel.Supernatural entities, haunted castles, secret societies and evil sorcerers werethe stock in trade of pioneers like Walpole and of later contributors likeRadcliffe and Lewis. One early and singularly brilliant work in the genre thatcombined elements of occultism, the satanic and the taste for `the East' thathad obsessed Europe after the publication of Antoine Galland's Frenchtranslation of The Arabian Nights in 1717 was William Beckford's Vathek (1786).Written in French allegedly in a Kerouac-like burst of inspiration, Vathekbrings together a variety of dark fascinations that would later become familiarto late 19th century decadents: diabolism, sadomasochism and other forms ofperverse sex, orientalism, extravagant hedonism, ennui and an all-aroundinterest in the forbidden. Where occultists like Cagliostro saw in `the East' aspiritual locale offering a greater tolerance than Catholicism, for Beckford,`the East' was the source of luxurious and inevitably debilitating pleasures.The erotic, the strange and the exquisite were the touchstones of Beckford'sEast, much more so than any transcendental wisdom. In the 19th century, thisstrain of exotic occultism would be taken up most vigorously, if there is such athing as vigorous decadence, by the French Romantics.William Beckford (1760-1844) became the richest young man in England when hisfather died in 1770. The ten year old Beckford inherited a fortune made inplantations in the West Indies. Beckford, who travelled through Europe andproduced a work of travel writing, Italy, with Sketches of Spain and Portugal,never visited the source of his wealth, and this lacuna in his education causedhim little regret. Like his idealized self-image the Caliph Vathek, Beckford wasmore concerned with spending his fortune than with appreciating the roots of it.Educated by tutors, Beckford's first steps in his journey to the east camethrough the influence of the artist Alexander Cozens. Born in St. Petersburg andtrained in Rome, Cozens had opened a drawing academy at Bath, near Fonthill,Beckford's family seat and site of Fonthill Abbey, Beckford's fabled Gothicfolly. Cozens taught Beckford drawing - his sketches can be found in his travelwritings - but more important for a history of occultism, he introduced theyoung heir to the delights of The Arabian Nights. To a young man who could havepractically anything, the exotic atmosphere of fantasy, sensuality, criminality,drugs and magic made a powerful impression, and in many ways Beckford spent therest of his long life living out the consequences of this early influence.Part of Beckford's excursions into decadence included, at the age of 17, anillicit attachment to William Courtenay, a ten year old boy. (That their nameswere the same suggests a certain narcissism.) Beckford's passion had to simmerat a distance, however, and Courtenay met some competition from the advances ofLouisa Beckford, wife of Beckford's cousin Peter. Consummation of both affairswas difficult, though not impossible. One successful venture was a pagan comingof age party that Beckford planned for himself at Christmas in 1781. Like amini-version of De Sade's 120 Days of Sodom, Beckford, Louisa, Courtenay -secured through the help of Cozens - and a handful of other young and willingparticipants, locked themselves away for three days and three nights in themillionaire's estate; this birthday rave eventually became the inspiration forVathek. Along with rare foods, rich wines, incense-clouded rooms, forbidden sexand the occasional magical ritual, part of Beckford's weekend pleasure domeincluded the `Eidophysikon' of Philip James de Loutherbourg, an Enlightenmentversion of a multi-media display or `light show'. De Loutherberg was aclassically trained painter championed by Diderot; among other accomplishmentshe was elected to the Royal Academy at the age of 22. He later worked for DavidGarrick's Theatre in Drury Lane where he laid the foundations for modernscene-painting and what are since called special effects. De Loutherberg madethe occult rounds: he did a portrait of Swedenborg, was a follower of Mesmer,and had met Cagliostro in 1783 at a Masonic lodge in Strasbourg, later becomingan initiate of his Egyptian Rite. De Loutherberg settled in London in 1785,lived in Hammersmith and devoted himself to mesmerism and the pursuit of thePhilosopher's Stone; among other occult notables, Cagliostro was one of hisguests.After his wild weekend, Beckford's taste for oriental magic, as well as forsodomy and adultery, became well known. He frequented occult circles in Londonand Paris, knew the Swedenborgian violinist Francois-Hippolyte Barthelemon andthe kabbalistic painter Richard Cosway. Beckford was in Paris for the early partof the crucial occult year of 1784, when the mystical tide was still rising.Later, the current would begin to ebb with Mesmer's fall, the growing antipathyto freemasonry, and Cagliostro's embroilment in the `Diamond Necklace Affair'.Yet, aside from some titillating dabbling, Beckford's contact with the occultwas for the most part superficial. His one real encounter proved unsettling andclosed the door on any future initiations. During his visit to Paris in 1781,Beckford made the acquaintance of the architect CharlesNicholas Ledoux. Ledouxwas a Freemason and practising occultist, and his architectural style ran to thefantastic. In 1784, he and Beckford renewed their acquaintance, and Ledouxoffered to show Beckford his crowning achievement, \"the most sumptuous apartmentI ever erected.\" Beckford's own architectural taste was outre and he was eagerto see Ledoux's handiwork. After an hour's drive from Paris they arrived at ahidden chateau. Ledoux had explained that his client's interests were \"not ofthe common world\" and that his own appearance was \"very peculiar.\"After passing through several chambers, Beckford reached a splendid salon, andthere Ledoux introduced him to an old man. Though of small stature, he had apowerful presence, and his odd and antique dress piqued Beckford's interest. Theold man asked Beckford to regard the many works of art that adorned the room.Beckford was intrigued by a large bronze cistern, resting on a green porphyrybase; it was filled to the brim with water. After studying it for a few moments,something peculiar began to happen.As I stood contemplating the last gleams ofa ruddy sunset reflected on itsplacid surface (Beckford wrote in a letter to Louisa) the old man, risen atlength from his stately chair, approached and no sooner had he drawn near, thanthe water becoming agitated rose up in waves. Upon the gleaming surface of theundulating fluid, flitted by a succession of ghastly shadows, somewhatresembling ... the human form in its last agonies of dissolution ...The images moved quickly, but Beckford had seen enough to produce a genuinefrisson. He later told Louisa that what he had seen in Ledoux's apartmentreduced \"to insignificance all Loutherberg's specious wonders,\" and that thephantasmagoria \"froze\" his \"young blood.\" His reactions, however, did notingratiate him with Ledoux and the mysterious old man. After remarking that\"This is most frightfully extraordinary,\" a shaken Beckford was led away,apparently having failed the test. Passing out of the inner sanctum, Beckfordcaught a glimpse of a candle-lit chamber, and heard the low sound of voiceschanting. When asked what was taking place, an impassive Ledoux remarked thatthe place was dedicated to a \"high, but not entirely religious purpose.\" It'sconceivable, as Joscelyn Godwin speculates in The Theosophical Enlightenment,that Ledoux, through Loutherberg, saw Beckford as a potential ally - or morelikely patron - of some secret society, and brought him to the threshold ofinitiation. Beckford, however, was an inveterate dilettante, and to himhenceforth the portal was closed. After this unsettling experience, Beckfordapparently lost all interest in the occult.JACQUES CAZOTTEMost readers of occult literature know of Jacques Cazotte through the story ofhis remarkable prediction of the fates of several of the aristocracy andintelligentsia at the hands of the Revolution. The tale turns up in most bookson prophecy or clairvoyance. In 1788, Cazotte was present at a dinner partygiven in Paris by the Duchesse de Gramont. One of the guests, Guillaume deMalesherbes, a minister and confidant of Louis XVI, proposed a toast \"to the daywhen reason will be triumphant in the affairs of men.\" A day, he added ruefully,\"which I shall never live to see.\"Cazotte, responding to Malesherbes' remark, rose from his seat and announcedthat he was wrong. \"You, sir,\" he said, \"will live to see that day. It will comein six years.\" Cazotte then went on to say that the Revolution was soonapproaching, and that the lives of everyone in the room would be profoundlyaffected by it.Naturally, everyone wanted to hear what would happen. Jean de la Harpe, astaunch sceptic and radical atheist, was intrigued by Cazotte's confidentmanner, and quickly wrote down his reply. He intended to produce his noteslater, in order to show how wrong Cazotte had been, and to prove once again thatprophecy was mere superstition. As it turned out, La Harpe's notes, discoveredafter his death in 1803, are the strongest evidence for the accuracy ofCazotte's vision.Cazotte regarded his fellow guests and told them what was in store. The Marquisde Condorcet, a celebrated philosopher and proponent of progress would, Cazotteannounced, die on the floor of a prison cell, after taking poison to avoidexecution. When Condorcet replied that such fate had little to do with an age ofreason, Cazotte replied that nevertheless, his suicide would take place duringsuch a reign. A favourite of Louis, Chamfort would, Cazotte went on, cut hisveins several times, but not die until some months later. Dr. Vicq d'Azyr wouldbe assisted in a similar fate, having his veins opened by someone else. Theastronomer jean Bailly would die on the scaffold, a victim of the mob, as wouldMM. Nicolai, Roucher, and Malesherbes. Even their host, the duchesse, would meether end in the same way, along with many other of the ladies present.After hearing this, La Harpe asked about himself. He, Cazotte replied, would notdie, but would instead become a Christian: to the atheistic La Harpe, a fateperhaps worse than death. When asked about his own future, Cazotte likenedhimself to the man who, during the siege of Jerusalem, walked about its wallscrying \"Woe to Jerusalem,\" only to be crushed in the end by a stone from a Romancatapult.Within six years everything Cazotte had said became true. Condorcet poisonedhimself in a prison cell. When threatened with arrest, Chamfort tried to killhimself, but bungled the job, and later died at the hands of the doctor treatinghis wounds. Dr. Vicq d'Azyr avoided the guillotine by having his veins opened bya fellow prisoner. The rest were guillotined, and La Harpe, horrified by thecarnage of the Revolution, entered a monastery and became a devout Catholic.Cazotte, an ardent royalist, was not however killed by a Roman catapult, butexecuted by the tribunal in 1792 after plans he had made for acounter-revolution had fallen into the wrong hands. Before any of this had cometo pass, La Harpe had mentioned Cazotte's prediction to many friends, andBaroness d'Oberkirch records in her memoirs that she had come across the storyin 1789. As for the reign of reason that Cazotte assured Malesherbes he wouldlive to see, as Christopher McIntosh makes clear in Eliphas Levi and The FrenchOccult Revival, by 1792, a number of `cults of reason' had sprung up inrevolutionary France, the aim of which was to take the place of the detestedChurch.Jacques Cazotte was born in Dijon in 1719, and was educated at a Jesuit College,in preparation for a career in law. After qualifying in 1740, he went to Paristo enter the Marine Department of the civil service, and while there became partof several literary circles and salons and wrote his early works. His officialduties kept him occupied with various posts on land and at sea, and during thewar of the Austrian Succession, he was involved in naval campaigns against theEnglish.Between 1747 and 1759, Cazotte moved back and forth between France and theisland of Martinique in the Caribbean, enduring ill health, miserableconditions, financial problems, official mistreatment and a general run of badluck. Back in France, in 1760, Cazotte's luck turned, and he was saved from ruinby inheriting a large house in Pierry, near Epernay, from his clergyman brother.There Cazotte married, had three children, and remained for the rest of life,which he devoted to being an amateur litterateur. One of the works he producedduring this time was The Devil in Love.Most of Cazotte's works deal in some way with the weird, the strange and theoccult, and his interest in these was not strictly literary. At some point inthe 1770s he became involved in the Martinist lodges following the teachings ofMartinez de Pasquales. It is unclear if he joined after Pasquales' death; if so,he may have been initiated into the order by SaintMartin, and if that is thecase, he may have been a Martinist of a different stamp. He was clearly a closeassociate of the Unknown Philosopher, to the extent that Madame la Croix,Saint-Martin's confidant, became a member of the Pierry household, assistingCazotte in seances and other occult experiments. As Brian Stableford suggests',the occult atmosphere of The Devil in Love is light and playful. However seriousCazotte may have taken his Martinist beliefs, he is concerned here withentertaining. Indeed, Cazotte's tonguein-cheek presentation of ceremonial magicmay have been influenced by Saint-Martin's rejection of the theurgic practicesof his teacher. Although affirming the efficacy of ritual, Saint-Martineventually discarded it as dealing solely with inferior realms. Cazottepublished The Devil in Love in 1772, and rewrote parts of it at different times,so although he may have started work on it years before meeting Saint-Martin,his association with the Unknown Philosopher could have influenced the work.That association came to an end in 1789, a year after his famous prediction.Cazotte, the royalist, could not abide Saint-Martin's brief admiration for theideals of the revolutionaries - one shared and soon dropped by manyEnlightenment occultists. Cazotte was by this time well known as an occultist,and his last work, Arabian Tales, written as a kind of sequel to The ArabianNights, is in the tradition of exotic occultism inaugurated by Galland'stranslation and developed in the Romantic years by other occultists like Gerardde Nerval. The Devil in Love, though light fare, links the practice of magic toeroticism, a union that went through several permutations in the followingcenturies. That the devil appears here both as a beautiful woman and a camelsuggests the dangers present in sex and the heathen East. Yet any moralizing onthe part of Cazotte - and the different endings he wrote and rewrote suggestthat Cazotte himself was unsure what the moral of the fable is - can be excusedin a work that contains the overwhelmingly poignant line \"Ali Biondetta - ifonly you were not that hideous dromedary.\"JAN POTOCKIThat sex and the East were linked to magic was not something to put off anotherEnlightenment occultist. To the eccentric Pole, Count Jan Potocki (1761-1815),the three were a positive attraction. Most English readers know Potocki as theauthor of The Manuscript Found in Saragossa, one of the strangest works of 19thcentury literature. Modelled on The Arabian Nights, The Saragossa Manuscript, asit is often called, is a weird farrago of stories within stories, with anoverall supernatural bent. Over a period of 66 days, Alphonse van Worden, ayoung Walloon officer, recounts his adventures amidst gypsies, kabbalists,demons, corpses, astrologers, the Wandering Jew, secret societies and obligingoriental ladies. As Potocki's single masterpiece, The Saragossa Manuscript alonewould be sufficient evidence of its author's eccentricities. Yet Potocki's ownlife, as well as that of his great work, have a history far stranger than mostfiction.Born in one of Poland's wealthiest aristocratic families, by the end of hislife, Potocki had become something of a superman. A famed traveller,ethnologist, linguist and fantasist, Potocki combined Enlightenment rationalismwith a Romantic appetite for the strange and uncanny. His many accomplishmentsinclude an ethnographic excursion to Mongolia (following journeys to Tunisia,Egypt, Turkey and Morocco), the first balloon flight over Warsaw, fluency ineight languages (including the secret patois of the Circassian nobleman),opening the first free reading room in Poland, a period of service with theKnights of Malta (including a sea battle against the Barbary pirates), and aquest for the original manuscript of the Arabian Nights. In between all of this,Potocki found time to devote himself to writing, as well as to a profound studyof occultism. He also found himself embroiled in the mystical politicalintrigues that made Europe in the days before the Revolution a warren of secretsocieties and esoteric enclaves.Among the many cities to which Cagliostro brought his Egyptian Rite was Warsaw,where he opened a lodge in 1780. By this time, a powerful splinter group hademerged within the Masonic fold. On 1 May 1776, Adam Weishaupt, a professor ofcanonical law at Ingoldstat University in Bavaria, gave birth to his brainchild:the Illuminati. Drunk with the elixir of Enlightenment rationalism, Weishaupthad a vision of a free, egalitarian Europe, rid of the tyranny of the monarchiesand the Church. To achieve his end, Weishaupt inaugurated a secret society. Hethen became a Freemason, in order to appropriate the lodges' vast network ofcontacts and hierarchies. His disciples quickly infiltrated most other lodges,which were already filled with members of various other secret secret societies.(The situation resembles somewhat the plot of Chesterton's The Man Who wasThursday) Cagliostro, it is believed, was an early convert to Weishaupt's cause,and it is possible that at least some of the activity of his Egyptian Riteinitiations included drawing in potential new followers. It's possible thatPotocki was initiated into Cagliostro's Warsaw lodge: it's clear at any ratethat he was a Mason. If so, and if Cagliostro was sifting his initiates for newrecruits, then Potocki was certainly the kind of man he would target.Two factors suggest this indeed may have been the case. One is Potocki's passionfor anything Islamic. Like William Beckford, - an early reading of the ArabianNights proved decisive; Potocki spoke fluent Arabic, and after his visit toConstantinople, the Count often dressed in burnous and fez. This is significant,not only in the general sense of `the East' as a metaphor of mystery andexoticism, but in the more specific sense that, among the many eminent figuresthat Weishaupt claimed were initiates in the Illuminati, Mohammed figureslargely. The fact that the prophet himself was a member of Weishaupt's societywould certainly have piqued the young Count's interest.Stronger evidence for a connection between Potocki and the Illuminati however isThe Saragossa Manuscript itself. Throughout his life Potocki advocated aninconsistent array of political beliefs; but in the atmosphere ofpreRevolutionary Paris, like many others, he more than likely shared in the hopethat a new Golden Age was about to dawn. An activist by nature, participation ina society dedicated to help bring this along would have appealed to him. Secretknowledge and scenes and motifs of initiation run through The Manuscript Foundin Saragossa. One of its central figures, the Great Sheikh of the Gomelezfamily, is the head of a gigantic scheme that in many ways resembles themachinations of Weishaupt. Sentiments of tolerance, egalitarianism, universalbrotherhood, and what we today would call multiculturalism - all part of theIlluminati platform - are evident throughout the book. Other `evidence' is thefact that Potocki set his adventure in Spain. With his formidable erudition,Potocki may have been aware of earlier, Spanish Illuminist sects, like theAlumbrados, or `Illuminated Ones', who began in Guadalajara in the early 1500s.The Alumbrados believed in an \"illumination by the Holy Spirit\" and persisteduntil the Inquisition suppressed them in 1623, accusing them, among otherthings, of practising sexual perversion. He may also have been aware of anothersect of `Illuminated Ones', the Roshaniya, who flourished in Afghanistan also inthe 1500s. Like Weishaupt's Illuminati, the Roshaniya aimed at gaining politicalcontrol by upsetting the status quo; for some authorities, there is a possibleconnection between the Roshaniya and another Islamic secret society, the 11thcentury Assassins. Here Potocki's love of Islam would have forged a link.'All this is speculation. What's not in doubt are the genuine occult themes thatappear throughout The Saragossa Manuscript. I can only mention some of these.The gallows that the young Alphonse finds himself under after his night ofpassion with Emina and Zubeida suggest the Tarot trump of the Hanged Man, asymbol of spiritual death and initiation. The weird adventures and tales withintales, in which Alphonse is unsure whether he is awake, dreaming or under theinfluence of hashish, is a reminder of the ambiguous nature of reality. Theytake place within the liminal space between sleep and consciousness, thehypnagogic realm of magic and the paranormal. Several well known occult figuresappear: Apollonius of Tyana, Knorr von Rosenroth, and Simon Magus. Several`doublings' too: the Celestial Twins, invoked by the student kabbalist, suggestalchemical themes of integration as well as the esoteric notion of thedoppelganger or astral body. Many of the doublings are of a sexual nature,suggesting strange erotic practices. Alphonse's encounter with Emina andZubeida, whom he meets in a cellar, indicates the uncertain territory he isabout to enter. These delightful but possibly dangerous twins are`subterraneans', creatures of the underworld. They are also devotees of astrange, foreign faith.One motif that Potocki shares with William Beckford, whose Vathek he wouldsurely have known, is a stairway of 1,500 steps. In Beckford's Arabiannightmare, the steps lead upward, to the top of Caliph Vathek's hubristic tower.In Potocki, they lead down, into a cave and the underworld. Here Potocki alludesto the central secret society of European legend: the Rosicrucians. InRosicrucian legend, Christian Rosenkruz, the mythical founder of the society,was buried in 1484, in a hidden tomb, after dying at the age of 106. In 1604,the tomb was said to have been discovered and, inside, his uncorrupted body layin a seven-sided vault, lit by a powerful lamp. The Rosicrucians werehermeticists, kabbalists and alchemists; one of their tracts promise that anyonecoming forth to join them would receive \"more gold than both the Indies bring tothe king of Spain.\" The gold they meant, however, was not the vulgar metal, buta more spiritual kind. The cave Alphonse finds himself in is illuminated by manylamps; there he finds a massive vein of gold and the tools necessary to extractthe precious metal. Each day he digs out a quantity equal to his own weight. Thegold he extracts is surely Rosicrucian, and the fact that Christian Rosenkruzreceived his occult wisdom in Damascus would be another enticement for theIslamophile Potocki.The count's mystical proclivities, however, did not save him from a macabrefate. The collapse of the Illuminati, suppressed in 1785, along with the entireMasonic project, filled Potocki, as well as many of his contemporaries, withdespair. The Revolution had turned into a charnel house, with the dictatorNapoleon rising out of the slaughter. Personal scandal troubled him too; incestwas mentioned in connection with his divorce from his second wife. Alone in hiscastle on his Podolia estate, ill health, boredom, melancholia anddisillusionment led to morbid fantasies. The thought that he had become awerewolf obsessed him. Potocki is said to have taken the silver knob of a sugarbowl, filed this into a bullet, then had it blessed by his chaplain. Then, on 20November 1815, he put the barrel of his pistol in his mouth and pulled thetrigger. A sad end to a man whose brilliant masterpiece - full of tolerance,curiosity and a lively interest in the beliefs of other cultures - displays thebest virtues of the occult Enlightenment.THE ILLUMINATIOf the many branches that grew from the Masonic tree, none gathered as muchcalumny as Adam Weishaupt's Bavarian Illuminati. Founded on 1 May 1776, twomonths before the American Declaration of Independence, Weishaupt's dreams of anegalitarian Europe, as well as his means of fulfilling them, were soundlycrushed less than a decade later. In 1785, both freemasonry and the Illuminatiwere outlawed by the elector of Bavaria. The ostensible reason for theirsuppression was the suspicion that the Illuminati were implicated in an Austrianplot to subvert Bavaria and bring about its annexation to the House of Hapsburg.But a general uncertainty about the political ideals of freemasonry, mixed withsensational, if exaggerated `exposes' of some of the society's beliefs andpractices, as well as personal revelations about Weishaupt, created anatmosphere inimitable to secret societies of any kind. By 1789, when the aims ofuniversal brotherhood and freedom began their descent into the Terror, esotericgroups of any sort had acquired a bad reputation.If it's true that in actual practice the Illuminati achieved appreciably little,it's also true that in myth they have exerted an influence on modern occultthought equal to the Knights Templars, Rosicrucians and Freemasons, with all ofwhom they have been linked at various times. It's one of the ironies of historythat this should be the case, because in its inception, the Illuminati was infact an opponent of all mysticism and occultism, seeing in these the veryobscurantism it was created to combat. Weishaupt (1748-1830) was a fanaticalrationalist, dedicated to annihilating religion and other superstitions, whichhe saw as leaden constraints on the . human mind. Perhaps his early instructionin a Jesuit college implanted this hatred; if so, it also instilled anadmiration for his instructors' organizational skills. Weishaupt's scheme was inmany ways a gigantic oxymoron: he adopted the strict hierarchical forms ofreligious orders and mystical societies, in order to promote a philosophy ofrational egalitarianism. Perhaps it was this internal contradiction, and not theelector of Bavaria, that brought about the society's downfall.Weishaupt's skill at political machination began early, during his universityyears, when he intrigued his way into coveted positions. It was also then thathis taste for disciples and need to dominate began to appear. As J.M. Roberts inThe Mythology of the Secret Societies suggests, an early reading of accounts ofthe Pythagoreans and the ancient Greek mysteries piqued an appetite forinitiations, rites and trials. This led naturally to freemasonry. But at thefirst portal, Weishaupt was turned away, mostly because he couldn't afford thedues. Undeterred, his answer was to form his own society.Weishaupt's original goal was to break the iron grip the Jesuits had on Bavaria,which in an increasing enlightened Europe, remained in an intellectual MiddleAge. Soon, though, his plans grew, until they were encapsulated in a succinctand, to the persons in question, distinctly dangerous formula. The Illuminatiwould work toward a future in which:Princes and nations shall disappear without violence from the face of the Earth,the human race will become one family and the world the abode of reasonable men.Morality alone will bring about this change imperceptibly ... Why should it beimpossible that the human race should attain to its highest perfection, thecapacity to judge itself? ... this revolution shall be the work of SecretSocieties.A year after starting the Illuminati, Weishaupt tried again to join theFreemasons. This time he was successful, entering a Strict Observance lodge.Thus began his infiltration into the elder society. His aim was to select themore enlightened members of the craft, and to slowly introduce them toIlluminist ideology. It met with some success. Taking the code name Spartacus,with his associates Baron von Knigge and the bookseller Johann Bode, Weishaupt'sinfluence reached across Bavaria, setting up Illuminist camps in several Masoniclodges. Munich and Eichstadt became centres for Illuminist training, and in manyother lodges Illuminist ideas penetrated the Masonic orthodoxy. True to hisJesuit upbringing, Weishaupt justified his less-than admirable means by pointingto the desirable end, and his success seemed to corroborate this. Beyond Bavariathe order reached to central and southern Germany and Austria; Italy, Grenoble,Strasbourg and Lyon felt its influence. Mozart, Schiller and.Goethe wereabsorbed, and there was talk in Vienna that Joseph II would soon be too. By 1782it had about three hundred members, and in the next year, it reached Bohemia andMilan, with Hungary soon to follow Oddly France, no stranger to secretsocieties, resisted incursions.Things began to unravel when Baron Knigge and Weishaupt quarrelled. Knigge wasan altogether more mystical soul than Weishaupt, having been a Mason and amember of other secret societies when recruited into the Illuminati. It was infact his failure to enter a Rosicrucian sect that interested him in Weishaupt'sOrder: the promise of secrets and hidden knowledge attracted him powerfully.Knigge brought in many new members, but when his advance along the Illuministpath seemed oddly stalled, he confronted Weishaupt, who, rather than lose atalented convert, revealed the real plan of the society. Weishaupt graduallygave way to Knigge's increasingly more mystical designs, a development totallyat odds with his initial aims. Eventually, Weishaupt decided that Knigge wouldhave to go. The Baron did, but not before revealing the society's secrets to itsopponents.Other problems cropped up. Masons not attracted to Weishaupt's revolutionarydesigns began to speak openly against the Illuminati. Dark rumours circulated.Less circumspect Illuminists spoke about the inequities of kings and princes.Like today, suspicion that members of the order had already infiltrated thegovernment was widespread. Disaffected members warned of the society's hideousplans. The newspapers called for action, and on 23 June 1784, the citizens ofBavaria were forbidden to belong to any secret society of any sort. A deluge ofpublications denouncing the Illuminati appeared, along with a trickle ofpamphlets defending the Freemasons and distinguishing them from Weishaupt'sperfidious association. These did little to stem the anti-esoteric tide. Lessthan a year later, another edict appeared, specifically condemning theIlluminati and Freemasons. Governments across Europe followed suit and turned awary eye upon the orders.In the years that followed, a mass of evidence - some credible, most of ithysterical rubbish - appeared, linking freemasonry in general and the Illuminatiin particular to a number of plots to subvert European civilization using, amongother methods, violent means. Weishaupt's declaration that the revolution he hadin mind would be a moral one and that the old regime would \"disappear withoutviolence\" was, not surprisingly, ignored in the mass paranoia. By the time ofthe Revolution, if any had ever paid heed to this proclamation, they now saw thereal outcome of Illuminist politics. Conspiracy theories are not limited to ourown time and place. By 1789, for the popular mind, secret societies were behindthe convulsions rocking France.The most influential proponent of the conspiracy theory approach to theRevolution was the splenetic Abbe Barruel, a priest and ex-mason who had escapedthe Terror by taking refuge in England. In a daunting four volume work, Memoirespour sevir a 1'historie dujacobinism (Memoirs Illustrating the HistoryofJacobinism) (1797), Barruel revealed the secret sinister plots against themonarchy and Church hatched in Masonic lodges across the continent. For mostreaders the sensational style, impressive detail and persuasive convictionobscured the fact that the Abbe was, for the most part, making it all up. Yearslater, in Nightmare Abbey (1818), poking fun at the Gothics, Thomas Love Peacockwould use Barruel as the source of Scythrop Glowry's ludicrous \"passion forreforming the world.\" Peacock's friend Percy Shelley, however, was enthralled byBarruel, reading the Memoirs repeatedly, and in another historical irony,developing a passionate belief in Weishaupt's ideals, the condemnation of whichwas the aim of Barruel's book.Shelley's fascination with Barruel grew out of his love for secret societies - along fragment remains of a story about the Assassins - and he was more thanlikely moved by passages such as:The name of Illuminee which this Sect ... has chosen, is of ancient standing inthe annals of disorganizing Sophistry. It was the name which Manes and hisdisciples first affected, gloriantur Manichaei se de caselo illiminatos. Thefirst Rosicrucians also, who appeared in Germany, called themselves Illuminees...Later Romantics like Gerard de Nerval and Fernando Pessoa would also trace thisoccult family tree, and a species of mystical genealogy remains a standard tropein popular books of the genre.Barruel's masterwork is no dry factual account:At an early period of the French Revolution there appeared a sect calling itselfJacobin, and teaching that all men were equal and free! In the name of theirequality and disorganizing liberty, they trampled under foot the altar and thethrone; they stimulated all nations to rebellion, and aimed at plunging themultimately into the horrors of anarchy ... Whence originated these men, who seemto arise from the bowels of the earth, who start into existence with their plansand their projects, their tenets and their thunders, their means and ferociousresolves; whence, I say, this devouring sect? Whence this swarm of adepts, thesesystems, this frantic rage against the altar and the throne, against everyinstitution, whether civil or religious, so much respected by our ancestors?The answer is out of the bosom of freemasonry. We've seen that to some degree,freemasonry in some forms housed some elements of radical politics, or ratherthat some Freemasons were also enlightened in a social and political sense.Also, in the years running up to the Revolution, enlightened intellectuals likeVoltaire, d'Alembert, Diderot, and Helvetius (a central source for Weishaupt'sworldview) did meet in a kind of secret academy, modelled to some degree on aMasonic lodge. Masonic lodges provided a milieu in which members of differentsocial strata could meet on equal terms, the aristocracy with the bourgeoisie, acharacteristic that the impecunious Mozart in Vienna appreciated greatly. Andfreemasonry in the late 18th century was characterized by a high intellectualprestige, freedom of thought, and a curiosity about new ideas. The Grand OrientLodge of France numbered Voltaire, Bailly, Helvetius and Danton among itsmembers. But freemasonry en masse was not an agent of the Revolution. Likewise,at the time of the Illuminati scandal, secret societies with the opposite intentexisted as well. In Prussia, for example, Masonic Rosicrucianism sought todistinguish itself from the Illuminati and its radical politics, warning of itsroots in deism, and calling for a renewed resistance to rationalism,egalitarianism and irreligion. And Weishaupt was not the only character eager toappropriate the Masonic network for his own ends. The Jesuits wanted to as well,as did the followers of Mesmer, Swedenborg, Saint-Martin and other occultists;it was not until their influence was felt that freemasonry took on its mysticalcharacter. Yet for the average citizen, these distinctions made little impact.The hidden hand of freemasonry was the evil genius behind the collapse of theancien regime, and its sinister agents were still at work, plotting furthermayhem.Barruel was aware that Weishaupt's association with freemasonry was purelymercenary, and that the Illuminati's occult trappings were a kind of sheep'sclothing cloaking the radical wolves. Yet, Barruel seemed to believe thatalthough antithetical, Weishaupt's and the original Illuminati housed identicalthreats:He must have had some notion of the antient Illuminees, for he adopted theirname, and the disorganizing principles of their horrid system. These notionswere strengthened, without doubt, by his favourite application to thedisorganizing mysteries of Manichaeism ... But, perfect atheist as he was, andscorning every idea of a God, he soon despised the twofold God, an AntientIlluminism, and adopted the doctrines of Manes only in as much as theythreatened every government, and led to universal anarchy ...Among other fascinating, if unbelievable, accounts, Barruel tells his readers ofhis own harrowing experiences in his confrontation with the order. \"During thelast twenty years,\" he writes, \"it was difficult, especially in Paris, to meetpersons who did not belong to the society of Masonry.\" He goes on:I was invited to a dinner at a friend's house and was the only profane in themidst of a large party of Masons. Dinner over and the servants ordered towithdraw, it was proposed to form themselves into a lodge, and to initiate me. Ipersisted in my refusal, and particularly refused to take the oath of keeping asecret, the very object of which was unknown to me. They dispensed with theoath, but I still refused. They became more pressing, telling me that Masonrywas perfectly innocent and that its morality was unobjectionable: In reply Iasked whether it was better than that of the Gospel. They only answered byforming themselves into a lodge, when began all those grimaces and childishceremonies which are described in books of Masonry, such as Jachin and Boaz. Iattempted to make my escape, but in vain ...Fearing he would not be allowed to leave unless he submit, Barruel gave way, butnot before he was assured that he would not be asked to do anything that wouldgo against his conscience. At that point the brethren gathered round him, andthe initiation began:At length the Venerable with the utmost gravity put the following question:`Brother, are you disposed to execute all the orders of the Grand Master, thoughyou were to receive contrary orders from a king, an emperor, or any othersovereign whatever?' My answer was `No.' `What? No?,' replies the Venerable withsurprise! `Are you only entered among us to betray our secrets! Would youhesitate between the interests of Masonry and those of the profane? You are notaware then that there is not one of our swords but is ready to pierce the throatof a traitor.'At which point, Barruel tears off his blindfold and shouts his defiance.Immediately the whole lodge clap their hands in sign of applause, and theVenerable compliments me on my constancy. `Such men are for us, men ofresolution and courage!'`What,' said I, `men of resolution! And who do you find who resist your threats!You, yourselves, gentleman, have not all said YES to this question: and if youhave said it, how is it possible that you can persuade me that your mysteriescontain nothing against honour or conscience?'The tone I assumed had thrown the lodge into confusion. The brethren surrounded.me, telling me I had taken things too much in earnest, and in too literal asense: that they had never pretended to engage in anything contrary to theduties of every true Frenchman, and that in spite of all my resistance I shouldnevertheless be admitted. The Venerable soon restored order with a few strokesof his mallet. He then informed me that I was passed to the degree of Master,adding, that if the secret was not given to me, it was only because a moreregular lodge, and held with ordinary ceremonies, was necessary on such anoccasion. In the meanwhile he gave me the signs and passwords for the thirddegree, as he had done for the other two. This was sufficient for me to beadmitted into a regular Lodge, and now we were all brethren. As for me, I hadbeen metamorphosed into apprentice, fellowcraft, and master, all in one evening...At some later point in his membership, Barruel did receive the final initiation,and was made privy to the central Masonic secret. He describes the revelation inthe third person. After an apprentice had taken his oath, the Abbe tells us,\"the Master said the following words to him: `My dear brother, the secret ofMasonry consists in these words EQUALITY AND LIBERTY; all men are equal andfree; all men are brethren.\" This formula, he tells us, was later expanded tomean \"the twofold principle of liberty and equality is unequivocally explainedby war against Christ and his Altars, war against Kings and their Thrones!\"WILLIAM BLAKEWilliam Blake (1757-1827) is not usually considered an occultist. For a longtime, the standard view of Blake was that he was a natural mystic, naive in theRomantic sense, unintellectual, primitive, and uninfluenced by book learning ofany sort. Although his `prophetic books' were thought incomprehensible, in someways he was considered a `simple' poet; poems like \"The Tyger\" and others fromSongs of Innocence and of Experience still turn up regularly in anthologies ofchildrens' poetry. Yet the image of Blake as a kind of unlearned genius, singinghis songs as unselfconsciously as a bird, is wrong. Even if we plump for Blakeas an 18th century shaman, we are still somewhat off the mark. He was, ofcourse, inspired; Blake considered himself a prophet, and accounts of hisvisionary experiences, both by himself and those by others, are clear evidencethat he had some strange faculty for perceiving what he called the spirit world,and which we today would consider expressions of the unconscious. Yet, as thelate poet and Blakean scholar Kathleen Raine makes clear, it is a mistake tothink of Blake as \"an example of the spontaneous manifestation of archetypes.\"In books like Blake and Tradition (1968), Raine argues persuasively that Blakesaw himself as a poet in the hermetic tradition, drawing on the rich undergroundstream of ancient magical and occult knowledge, and hammering out in hisdidactic and aphoristic verse a new synthesis of what she calls the \"perennialphilosophy.\" Yet Blake was not only an astute student of the occult thinkers ofthe past. The London Blake lived in was awash in the same currents of magicalthought and radical politics that flooded France, and the research of scholarslike Marsha Keith Schuchard suggests that the image of Blake as a kind of holyman, aloof from the influences of his own time, is inaccurate. Though not mad,as some of his contemporaries believed, Blake certainly confessed to someeccentric beliefs, and it would not be wholly mistaken to see him in the companyof those we might consider crackpots, cranks and charlatans.Blake's natural affinity to mystical visions and paranormal events surfacedearly; as a young boy he was beaten by his father for saying he saw angels in atree, and on another occasion he was saved from a second beating only throughthe solicitations of his mother. Throughout his life friends and associatescommented on Blake's distracted air; there is evidence that at times his visionsinterfered with his capacity for work (as an engraver) and he may, like othervisionaries (C.G. Jung comes to mind), have experienced at least onenearpsychotic episode. Blake's confidence in the truth of his visions (theearliest perhaps a sighting of God at the age of four in Soho) led him to rejectthe rationalist psychology that would label such things madness and to explorealternative accounts of reality. Blake is important in the history of occultismbecause he stands at the threshold of the radical split between the scientificand hermetic worldviews that ushered in the 19th century. Unlike hiscontemporary Goethe, Blake did not try to keep united these sundering visions ofmankind and the world. Blake was not anti-intellectual, but he knew that therise of scientism - the belief that the methods and vocabulary of science caneventually account for the whole of reality - spelled disaster for the spiritualin man. Against the rising trend to explain man's interior world in terms ofsensory impressions and associative psychology - Locke's tabula rasa - Blakedeclared instead that the imagination was the source of all, and that thephysical external world of the senses was a mere shadow of the infinite realmswithin. In different ways in the 19th century writers as disparate as BulwerLytton, Eliphas Levi, Arthur Rimbaud, W.B. Yeats, Blake's first editor, and manyothers would carry on this struggle, basically restating in their individualways Blake's original hermetic insight. It is, in fact, the central Romantictheme. Blake is doubly interesting in this sense because, although a man of theEnlightenment, he was practically unknown during his own life, and only came toprominence in 1898 through the efforts of Yeats and his fellow editor, E .J.Ellis. Thus, as we will see, Blake, the forerunner of the Romantics, became apublic figure and prophet at a time when the inheritors of his visionary flamehad nearly burned themselves out, and his great cause of the imagination haddwindled to a decadent withdrawal from the world.Blake's earliest influence - aside from the visitations of angels - was theBible, but growing up in a family of dissenters, it was not unusual for him tobe drawn to interpretations of holy script that ran counter to the orthodoxaccount. His first introduction to Swedenborg may have been through his olderbrother James; in any case, in a dissenting household a variety of unorthodoxbeliefs were probably readily available. That Swedenborg spoke soberly andpersuasively about visits to heaven and hell no doubt interested the youngmystic. It is even possible that Blake may have seen Swedenborg; in 1772, thelast year of his life, the magus of Stockholm lived in a lodging house inClerkenwell. Blake would have been fifteen then, and could very easily have comeacross the philosopher.In 1783, the Rev. Jacob Duche, ex-Chaplain to the Continental Congress, startedthe London Theosophical Society, a radical Swedenborgian group. Along with Blakeits members include William Beckford's friend Philip de Loutherberg, the Swedishalchemist and Freemason Augustus Nordenskold, and Blake's fellow artists JohnFlaxman and William Sharp. Earlier I remarked on the similarity between Blake'sideas and those of Saint-Martin. It's possible the two met, as both SaintMartinand Cagliostro visited the group in 1787. Ironically, if Blake and Saint-Martindid meet, then of the two, Blake was truly the unknown philosopher, sufferingneglect and obscurity throughout his life.Blake would have known of De Loutherberg's `Eido- physikon' as well as his workat David Garrick's Theatre in Drury Lane; as his biographer Peter Ackroydsuggests, it is possible to see the influence of De Loutherberg's stage magic inBlake's dazzling illuminated books. Blake knew other `magical' artists as well.Richard Cosway was one of Blake's teachers at Par's Drawing School in theStrand. He was also a practising magician, blending mesmerism, Kabbalah,ceremonial magic, drugs and ritual nudity in his devotions. (Oddly, Cosway,unknown today, was very successful in his time, and famous as much for hisextravagant dress and enormous self-regard, as for his nicknames the MacaroniPainter, `Dicky' and Billy Dimple.) Swedenborg we know spoke openly about sex,and Blake's work, both his poetry and art, is suffused with a robust mysticaleroticism as well as a Michaelangeloesque glory in the human body. But it ispossible that he, and his devoted wife Catherine, professed a more than symbolicbelief in the power of the naked body. His patron Thomas Butts was fond oftelling the story of coming upon William and Catherine in their summer house inLambeth and finding them in the nude. Blake is supposed to have said \"Come in!It's only Adam and Eve.\" They had been reciting passage from Paradise Lost intheir own Garden of Eden. Blake was also known to busy himself with eroticdrawings depicting a variety of combinations and practices.With the painter Henry Fuseli, a close friend and supporter, Blake shared a lovefor the erotic, the Gothic and the sublime, as well as an openness and interestin the Semitic races, something he had in common with his contemporaryesotericists. Another occult artist who met Blake late in his life was JohnVarley, a practising astrologer and `zodiacal physiognomist'. With Varley Blakeconducted a series of seances during which he saw and drew the visionary headsof the famous dead: Socrates, Mahomet, Voltaire and Richard Coeur de Lion wereamong Blake's astral sitters. (It was also then that he saw his eerie \"Ghost ofa Flea.\") This was not Blake's first encounter with astrology and heads: in 1791he had executed a series of engravings of heads based on Lavater's philosophy ofphysiognomy, selections from which were published in issues of The Conjuror andThe Astrologer's Magazine.Blake's other occult influences were literary. There was Swedenborg of course.But, as The Marriage of Heaven and Hell suggests, Blake came to reject centralelements in Swedenborg's teachings. These were replaced by his deep study ofParacelsus and Jacob Boehme. (It will be remembered that Saint-Martin was also aprofound reader of Boehme.) A wandering scholar and physician, like Blake, the15th century alchemist Paracelsus rejected orthodox beliefs and accepteddoctrines, disregarding the experts and trusting in his own instincts andnatural insights. In many ways, Paracelsus is the patron saint of theRomantic`s; his central belief is that the truth of the universe lies in thehuman imagination, an insight that inspired Blake's life long \"mental fight\"against materialism and repression. From Boehme Blake absorbed the vision of theUniversal Man - something Swedenborg professed as well - and the belief that thewhole of existence is engaged in a perpetual creative conflict between will anddesire or, as later philosophers would put it, being and nothingness. Blakedeclared that \"Without Contraries there is no Progression\" and his work is fullof immense striving, a sense of cosmic struggle and labour.Blake was also attracted to the neoplatonic thought of Thomas Taylor. A bankclerk and mathematician, Taylor was obsessed with Plato, and taught himselfGreek in order to read him and the other classical authors. Like Blake Tayloropposed Newton and materialist science, and it interesting to remark thatneither Blake nor Taylor could have known of Newton's own obsessive pursuit ofoccult knowledge. Newton's volumes of Biblical exegesis and alchemical study didnot come to light until the twentieth century. In lectures given at the house ofBlake's fellow painter John Flaxman, Taylor introduced Blake to the notion ofthe prisca sapientia, the `primal wisdom' first brought to man through Orpheus,Hermes, Zoroaster, then later continued via Plato, Plotinus, Proclus andlamblichus. As in the work of the contemporary Neoplatonist John Michel, much ofthis wisdom is couched in mathematical and geometric forms, with which Blake hadsome difficulty. Taylor apparently once tried to teach maths to Blake, who wasnotoriously recalcitrant, and it is telling that Blake's style is all OldTestament and Gothic, and lacks the principle of geometric balance, order andrestraint that we recognize as classical. Mention of John Michel brings us toBlake's fascination with ancient Britain, with the megaliths and \"druid stones\"that had recently come to popular attention through the work of WilliamStukeley. Like contemporary New Agers, Blake believed that the Ancientspossessed a wisdom and a knowledge lost to us, a capacity for spiritual visionand life that was quickly fading in the triumphant rise of science. And liketoday, the London of his time was populated with a collection of societiesinterested in reviving the ancient practices and embodying the lost wisdom;Blake himself was at the centre of one, playing guru to a group of artists whocalled themselves `The Ancients', because of their fascination with the art ofthe golden past, a conduit to which they found in Blake's own work.NOTES1 Robert Darnton Mesmerism and the End of the Enlightenment (Cambridge: HarvardUniversity Press, 1969) p. 34.2 For the material on Swedenborg, Cagliostro and Falk, I am indebted to JoscelynGodwin's brilliant study, The Theosophical Enlightenment (Albany: StateUniversity of New York Press, 1994) pp. 94-97, and to Marsha Keith Schuchard'sseminal essay \"Yeats and the `Unknown Superiors': Swedenborg, Falk andCagliostro\", in Secret Texts: The Literature of Secret Societies (New York: AMSPress, 1995).3 Darnton pp. 70-71.4 Mozart's interest and involvement in Enlightenment occultism was profound; in1789, he attended a fancy dress party in Vienna, dressed as a Hindu philosopher,and handed out esoteric riddles in the form of sayings of Zoraster.

It is true that his tone, his gestures and his manners werethose of a charlatan, boastful, pretentious and arrogant, but ... his ordinaryconversation was agreeable and instructive, his actions noble and charitable,and his healing treatments never unsuccessful and sometimes admirable: he nevertook a penny from his patients.\"7 In his introduction to the Dedalus edition of Judith Landry's translation.8 For a longer account of Weishaupt's illuminated predecessors, as well as ahistory of The Manuscript Found in Saragossa, see my article \"The MysticalCount\" in Fortean Times #140 November 2000."},{"pageContent":"ROMANTIC OCCULTISM`Romantic' and `Romanticism' are both highly ambiguous terms providing aconfusing array of definitions and usages. In his important study Classic,Romantic and Modern (revised edition 1975), the cultural historian JacquesBarzun lists some ninety differing and contrasting uses of `romantic': most,since the collapse of Romanticism itself as an artistic and cultural movement,harbouring a pejorative meaning. To most people today notions of magic or theoccult are highly `romantic', meaning they are unrealistic, mere fantasies,dreams and products of the imagination. The fact that for the popular mind theimagination is seen as the source of error and unreality shows how far our ownmodern consciousness is from the Romantic sensibility. With William Blake,Paracelsus and other hermetic thinkers, the Romantics saw the imagination as thecentral source of existence, the fundamental creative power, and the mostgod-like of human faculties. In many ways the Romantic Movement, begun byWordsworth, Coleridge and Goethe in the last years of the 18th century, andcarried on in different forms into the mid 19th century by European and Americanwriters, poets and artists, was a defence of the imagination against theencroaching reductionism of science. In its battle against superstition,scientific thought, the great liberator of the Age of Reason and theEnlightenment, had unburdened the human mind of a number of chains. Yet in theprocess of `freeing' man from the falsehoods of religion and the constraints ofpolitical and social oppression, it had reduced his stature considerably. Therationalism and materialism that did away with religion left man little morethan a mechanical toy, a puppet pushed and pulled by the impersonal forces ofnature.Although it was clearly a reaction against the-Enlightenment, Romanticism didshare many themes with its predecessor. The rights of the individual, fought forby the Enlightenment, became, under the banner of Romanticism, a belief inindividuality itself. Individuality, personality, subjectivity were positivegoals, because it is only as a true individual that man could experiencefreedom, and not be merely the atomistic recipient of an abstract `right'. In asociety moving, even with the best intentions, towards total rationalisation,where the unique human being would be reduced to his function in an harmoniouslyoperating system, the Romantic individual recognized a dangerous levelling, andopposed his own uniqueness to uniformity and mass production. For the Romantic,this individuality expressed itself most powerfully in the artist, the unique`creative genius', although it often settled for the unusual and idiosyncratic.This focus on the uncommon led, as one historian put it, to \"an apotheosis ofthe strange and bizarre, the eccentric and weird, the demoniacal and reckless.\"'We have already seen an obsession with the eerie and exotic in the oriental andGothic craze of the late 18th century. These remained, but the Romantic added tothem an exploration of the workings of the mind. It is no surprise that in hismassive history of the unconscious, Henri F. Ellenberger includes a lengthyexamination of Romantic poetry and literature.If the Enlightenment occultists can be said to have worked, howeverunsuccessfully, toward a revolution in society, envisioning a world of religioustolerance and universal brotherhood, after the Terror and the rise of Napoleon,the Romantics shifted the scene of the battle. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Blakeall shared in the glow of the Revolutionary dawn; yet when the bloodbath beganthey, and others, pulled away in disgust. It would be easy to see this as aretreat into quietism; but that in itself is a safe, reactionary response. TheRomantic rejection of politics was not a retreat, but an advance into a moreexciting, unknown and dangerous world: the mind. It was, as the critic ErichHeller calls it, \"a journey into the interior.\" In one of his many aphorismsNovalis remarked \"We dream of journeys through the universe - is not theuniverse in us? We do not know the depths of our mind. The mysterious path leadsinwards. Eternity with its worlds, the past and future are in us or nowhere.\"More than a century later, the poet Rilke, a late Romantic and early modernist,would formulate the same theme more briefly: \"Nowhere,\" he said, \"will the worldexist but within.\"Many factors led to this development. The early roots were in the ProtestantReformation, which emphasized the individual's personal relationship to God.Another source was the rise of the modern novel. Samuel Richardson's Pamela,published in 1740, taught Europe how to daydream, thus preparing the way for theRomantics.' There had been earlier novels, like Robinson Crusoe and Don Quixote.But Richardson's prolonged account of an infinitely attenuated seductionprompted readers to plunge into an imaginative reconstruction of lives much liketheir own, only more interesting, and not tales of `long ago and far away.' Oneresult of this opening of the inner worlds was an exploration of the odd quirksand characteristics of the unconscious and irrational, best exemplified inColeridge and DeQuincey's fascination with dreams, somnambulism and othermanifestations of the dark side of the mind. Another was a renewed interest inthe occult tradition of the Counter-Enlightenment.With the exception of Goethe, the Romantics can be seen as a great, thoughfailed, experiment in the history of western consciousness. With them and theirdescendants, the union of artist and magician reaches its most clear expression.With them, however, also arises the dangers of a too total rejection of themundane and everyday, in favour of magical realms and other worlds. It's notsurprising that the poet and mage should be linked: both use words in order toproduce a desired effect, and as magic moved more and more away from themedieval sense of controlling angels and demons, and closer to the kind ofvisionary powers we've seen in William Blake, the distinction between the twoseemed one of mere terminology. By the time of Arthur Rimbaud and the earlySymbolists, the distinction itself is pretty much lost, with the poet becomingthe new high priest of the mystical religion of Art. Yet with the completefusion of art and magic, the religion of Art begins its decline. The followingsection traces the Romantic notion of the poet as magician from its earliestinception in Germany, through perhaps the greatest occult fiction of 19thcentury English literature, to its late blossoming in the work of the FrenchRomantics, who prepared the way for decadence and the fin de siecle.GOETHEThat Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), Germany's greatest poet, had aninterest in the occult is clear from Faust. Based on an historical character,the original Faust legend goes back to medieval times and prior to Goethe'sthere were earlier dramatic renditions of the tale, notably ChristopherMarlowe's. Yet it is to Goethe's Faust (Part I 1808; Part II 1833) that most ofus turn when we think of pacts with the Devil, of things Mephistophelean, and ofthe dangers of a too obsessive pursuit of knowledge and arcane secrets.The historic Doctor Faust was born in Knittlingen, Wurt- temberg, in 1480, anddied at the hands of the Devil in Staufen, near Freiburg, in 1539: at leastaccording to the plaque that adorns Staufen's Lion Inn, the scene of thedoctor's demise. According to Melanchthon - friend of Martin Luther - Fauststudied magic and the occult sciences at the University of Cracow, in Poland;similar courses of instruction were also given at the Universities of Salamancaand Toledo. In Cracow Faust reportedly scoffed at the miracles of Jesus, andloudly boasted that he could repeat them at any time. Though many werescandalized by these remarks, others were impressed; years later, whilelecturing on Homer at the University of Erfurt, Faust allegedly invoked thespirits of Achilles, Ulysses and Hector to entertain his students. According tothe Abbot Johannes Trithemius, Faust had good reason to boast of being \"the mostaccomplished alchemist that ever lived. ,3 Nevertheless, a Franciscan monkimplored Faust to give up his black arts and to return to the Church. Faustinformed the monk that this was impossible, as he had already sold his soul tothe Devil; and as the Devil had kept his side of the bargain, Faust intended tokeep his. There are reports of Faust's powers of prediction and other wonderworking - he was reportedly kept in the employ of Baron Anton von Staufen, andforced to produce artificial gold - and stories about the Devil accompanying himas his `familiar' in the form of a dog.The first Faust book appeared in 1587; written in German, it told the story ofFaust's pact with the Devil, and of his bizarre adventures. It was something ofa bestseller, and within a few months it appeared in several different piratededitions. By 1588, the story had crossed the English Channel; there it receiveda more serious and eloquent treatment by Christopher Marlowe. In 1593, soonafter Marlowe's murder., a troop of English actors brought a production of theTragical History of Doctor Faustus to Germany. Through some metamorphosis, thetragedy became a comedy, and the comedy was then transformed into a puppet show.It was more than likely in this form that the young Goethe first came upon whatwould become his most famous work.In the medieval legend Doctor Faustus is a conceited braggart, who meets hiscomeuppance through a rash pact with the Devil. In Goethe's hands, the tooobvious cautionary tale becomes an archetype of western consciousness, and apowerful symbol of the perils of a one-sided development. Goethe contributed anew term to describe the growing modern sensibility: Faustian, meaning aninsatiable, hubristic hunger for knowledge at whatever cost, a desire topenetrate into the innermost regions of life, regardless of the consequences. Inthe Decline of the West (1918), the historian Oswald Spengler divided the courseof human history into three periods: the Classical, the Magian and the Faustian.Writing little more than a century ago, Spengler saw the last period as our own;and, as the title of his book suggests, he recognized it was on its way out.Goethe's interest in magic, the occult and hermetic thought began early, andalthough it went through many changes, it remained with him throughout his life.He begins his autobiography, Dichtung and Warheit (Poetry and Truth) (1811-1812)with an account of the astrological backdrop to his birth:My horoscope was propitious: the sun stood in the sign of the Virgin, and hadculminated for the day; Jupiter and Venus looked on me with a friendly eye, andMercury not adversely; while Saturn and Mars kept themselves indifferent; themoon alone, just full, exerted the power of her reflection all the more, as shehad then reached her planetary hour.'At the time of Goethe's birth in Frankfurt-on-Main, in the not too-distant cityof Mannheim, alchemy was still popular. Although experimental science had beenencroaching on alchemy's domain for nearly a century, it had not yet completedits colonization. As late as 1787, the Berlin Academy investigated the claims ofa Professor at Halle who was said to have transmuted base metals into gold.While scientists scoffed at such claims, the fact that they felt obliged toinvestigate them suggests that alchemical notions had not yet been completelyousted from the popular mind. In Mannheim, at any rate, alchemy was still afavourite pastime: many of the leading citizens had alchemical laboratories, andthe craze was so wide spread that the city authorities had to ban it. As withmuch alchemical activity, a great deal of this was prompted by the promise ofquick riches, yet, in the part of Germany where Goethe was born, a deepermotivation was at work. German Pietism was strong in Frankfurt, and much of thePietist doctrine had its source in the writings ofJacob Boehme. Boehme, as we'veseen, was a central figure for 18th century occultists like Saint-Martin andWilliam Blake, and his works presented a form of Christian mysticism couched inalchemical language. As Ronald Gray in his book Goethe the Alchemist (1952)suggests, it's probable that where Pietism was strong, some notion of thespiritual value of alchemy was also present.' In any case, by the time theteenaged Goethe returned to Frankfurt from his studies in Leipzig, he was drawninto the occult milieu, and had embarked on an intensive study of alchemicalwritings.He was introduced to alchemical literature by his friend and spiritual mentor,the Pietist Fraulein von Klettenberg, with whom he began a serious study ofhermetic authors like Paracelsus, Basil Valentine,J.B. van Helmont and GeorgeStarkey. Goethe's belief in the efficacy of alchemy, however, had a more thanintellectual basis. Goethe had returned from Leipzig suffering from a kind ofnervous breakdown, and the condition lingered well after his return, troublinghim and exasperating his parents. Fraulein von Klettenberg belonged to a Pietistcircle, one of whose members was a Dr. Metz. Along with a charming andingratiating manner, Metz spoke mysteriously of a \"Universal Medicine\" thatcured all ills, a claim, we've seen, made for the alchemical elixir vitae. Metzalso spoke allusively of certain kabbalistic and alchemical books through thereading of which one could discover the means of producing this universalmedicine oneself. Although he doesn't say it openly, with his hermetic knowledgeand occult medicine, Metz seems to fall into the profile of a Rosicrucian, oneof whose tasks, as we've seen, was to act as a kind of travelling physician,tending to the sick of body and soul. Goethe, at any rate, met that criteria,and soon after being introduced to von Klettenberg's circle, his conditionworsened. He was, it seemed, near death and his mother, also a member of thePietist group, beseeched the mysterious Metz to use his miracle drug. As Goethewrites:In this last extremity my distressed mother constrained the embarrassedphysician with the greatest vehemence to come out with his universal medicine.After a long refusal, he hastened home at the dead of night, and returned with alittle glass of crystallised dry salt, which was dissolved in water andswallowed by the patient. It had a decidedly alkaline taste. The salt wasscarcely taken than my situation appeared relieved; and from that moment thedisease took a turn which, by degrees, led to my recovery.'Impressed by Metz's wonder drug, Goethe remarks that, \"I need not say how muchthis strengthened and heightened our faith in our physician, and our industry toshare in such a treasure. \"After his cure, Goethe began his alchemical studies in earnest. Von Klettenbergalready had a small alchemical laboratory set up in her house, and soon afterGoethe set up one of his own in his parents' attic. A furnace, a retort, somealembics and a sand bath were put to the service of producing the liquorsilicum, or `flint juice', made from melting down pure quartz flint with amixture of alkali, and which was supposed to result in a transparent glass,which dissolves on exposure to air, and displays a perfect clarity. This liquorsilicum would serve for Goethe as the alchemical `maiden earth', the virginprima materia upon which further operations could take place. Yet, diligentthough he was, Goethe had to admit that however thorough his preparations, theresult was never as pure as he had hoped, and he eventually halted hisexperiments.Goethe's interest in practical alchemy faded, but not his passion for occultliterature. Following his studies with Fraulein von Klettenberg, Goethe plungedinto the depths of Jacob Boehme, Swedenborg, Thomas Vaughan as well as manyother, lesser known luminaries. He was particularly drawn to the allegedwritings of Hermes Trismegistus, the patron saint of alchemy. The notion oftransformation, so crucial to his own ideas about evolution and themetamorphosis of plants, which predated Darwin, remained key, and it was throughhis interest in alchemy that Goethe became particularly interested in theRosicrucian legacy. A fragment entitled Die Geheimnisse (The Mysteries), writtenbetween 1784 and 1786 - the years in which he first began his botanical studies- was intended to be a poem about the Rosicrucians. For Goethe, the rose andcross was a powerful symbol of the unification of opposites, a centralalchemical concern. One Rosicrucian work that Goethe read with evident interestwas the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreuz, most probably written by thealchemist and hermeticist Johann Valentine Andrea. Andrea (1586-1654), aLutheran theologian, was responsible for other Rosicrucian tracts, like the FamaFraternitas, which appeared in Germany in 1614, announcing the existence of thesecret brotherhood, and calling for serious seekers of spiritual truth to jointhem. One well-known applicant was the philosopher Rene Descartes, who wasdismayed at his inability to locate any members of the sect. Sceptical friendssuggested this was not unusual as the Rosicrucians claimed to be an invisiblesociety; later, troubled by reports that he himself was a Rosicrucian, Descartesappeared before his friends and declared that as they could see him quite well,he could not possibly be a member of the hidden lodge.Goethe read the Chymical Wedding in 1786, many years after his alchemicalexperiments. But its effect was considerable. He wrote to his friend Charlottevon Stein that after reading it he felt that \"there will be a good fairy tale totell at the right time, but it will have to be reborn, it can't be enjoyed inits old skin.\" The fairy tale told at the right time seems to have been Goethe'sMdrehen, The Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and The Beautiful Lily.The Marchen, or literary myth, is a peculiarly German form. Novalis, whoincluded a similar tale in his novel Heinrich von Ofterdingen, called theMarchen \"a dream vision ... beyond logic ... an assembly of wonderful things andhappenings ... a pregnant chaos.\" Alchemical symbols and themes abound inGoethe's tale, first published in a collection called Conversations of GermanEmigrants in 1795. The `conversations' are a cycle of stories told by thearistocracy that had been driven from their homes during the years of theTerror, and had fled to Germany to avoid the guillotine. Appalled by the horrorsof the Revolution, Goethe had hoped to show how the principles of harmony, theunification of opposites and the disinterested appreciation of beauty couldprovide the basis for a new, spiritually whole society. Needless to say,Goethe's vision of a new Europe came to naught. Along with Andrea's Rosicrucianfable, another influence were the Letters on Aesthetic Education of his friendFriedrich Schiller. In his letters, Schiller argued that the truly freeindividual could arise only through the harmonizing of both the sensual and therational aspects of the personality, a unification of Geist and Natur a themethat would occupy many thinkers of the time, like Hegel, Coleridge and Heinrichvon Kleist. Goethe agreed with Schiller, but believed that his own contributionto the cause could only be put forth in more poetic, symbolic forms. The resultwas the beautiful, though not immediately comprehensible, Fairy Tale.Goethe himself was not forthcoming with interpretations of the story. Heremarked that it \"will remind you of everything and of nothing,\" and said thathe would reveal its true import only after \"99 others had failed to do so.\"Others certainly have tried. Ronald Gray devotes a chapter to the alchemicalexegesis of the Mdrehen, and in Goethe and the Philosopher's Stone (1965), AliceRaphael offers ajungian reading of the tale. In terms of esoteric influence,however, perhaps the greatest interpreter has been the early 20th centuryAustrian philosopher, educator and architect, Rudolf Steiner. Steiner's`supersensible' reading of this and all of Goethe's work is at the centre of hisoccult system, anthroposophy, whose headquarters in Dornach, Switzerland is amassive citadel of Expressionist architecture, called, appropriately enough, theGoetheanum. However, whether one accepts Steiner's, or any other interpretation,Goethe's tale is undoubtedly reminiscent of the dream-like, mystical and obscureallegories at the heart of alchemical literature.NOVALISIf one word encapsulates the essence of German Romanticism it is Sehnsucht.Langenscheidt's German-English Dictionary translates this as \"longing, yearning,hankering, pining, languishing, nostalgia,\" but there is really no strictEnglish equivalent. `Unfulfillable' or `inexpressible' longing perhaps comeclosest, but there is something in the original German that is distinctlylacking in any English translation. Sehnsucht conjures up horn calls far off inthe dark forest, the poignant glow of the sunset, which we will never reach, nomatter how quickly we race to the horizon, the snow-capped peaks of a distantmountain range. Beauty, distance, and the sense of something infinitelydesirable just beyond our grasp: it is perhaps in music that we can feel itsfull effect, yet on a coarse and profane level we can see pornography as aneveryday example of this poetic condition'. These willing and available womenstimulate an appetite they can never gratify. And like pornoaddicts, theRomantics who succumbed to Sehnsucht eventually discovered it was verydifficult, if not impossible, to deal with an actual world of flesh and blood.In the end many of them found themselves stranded between an imaginary realm ofinfinite beauty, which nevertheless slipped through their fingers, and aconcrete reality which invariably proved too much for their sensitive natures toendure.One poet above all is associated with the idea of Sehnsucht, the ultimate symbolof which became the illusive `blue flower' of his unfinished novel Heinrich vonOfterdingen (1800). Georg Friedrich Philipp von Hardenberg - better known asNovalis, Latin for `newly ploughed field' and his mother's maiden name - wasborn on 2 May 1772 (less than two months after Swedenborg's death) on the estateof Oberwied- erstedt, not far from Halle, on land acquired by a branch of hisancient family in the 17th century. His father, Baron Heinrich Ulrich Erasmusvon Hardenberg was a strict convert to Count Zinzendorfs Moravian Brotherhood,and enforced a sombre and joyless regimen of piety and religious observance. Ahumourless character, Baron von Hardenberg refused to speak with his neighbours,considering trivial talk unChristian. His relations with the wider world wereequally curt: a story tells of his once reading of the French Revolution in anewspaper; the reports of atheism and other antiChristian sentiments enragedhim, and he threw the paper down, vowing never to look at one again, a pledge byall reports he assiduously kept.Novalis's mother, however, was affectionate and indulgent, and did her best toshield the young poet and his siblings from their father's wrath. Novalis grewup, as many poets do, in isolation, wandering through his family's mansion andestate on the Harz river, alone with his thoughts and the landscape. A sicklychild, in many ways Novalis' early years resemble those of Saint-Martin and Karlvon Eckharthausen. As his translator Arthur Versluis remarks \"perhaps it wasjust this isolation, this childhood in which (he was) left to (his) own devices,which began to disclose the manifold inner world to Novalis ...\"s The rigid andrarely interrupted routine of the outer world was compensated for by aburgeoning complex interior realm, a shifting scenery of myth, early poeticintuition and magical realities.Arguments with his father eventually exiled Novalis from his home - a commonpredicament that would be later mirrored in the poet's cosmic loneliness:perhaps the most well known of Novalis's aphorisms reads, \"All philosophy ishomesickness.\" He moved to his uncle's estate in Lucklum, where the library wasa welcome change from his father's devotional tracts. In 1791 he left to studylaw at Jena, where he was a student of Schiller, and in 1793 he readmathematics, chemistry and philosophy at Wittenberg, where he became friendswith the philosophers Friedrich Schlegel and Johann Gottlob Fichte. It was alsoat this time that he met the twelve and half year old Sophie von Kuhn, whoplayed a tragic Lolita to Novalis' not-quite middle-aged Humbert Humbert.Novalis was immediately struck by Sophie's beauty, and reports are that otherswho met her shared his enthusiasm. But it is difficult not to find somethingmorbid in the 24 year old Novalis' obsession with a girl just reaching puberty,although he was not alone in such predilections: the equally romantic and evenmore morbid Edgar Allan Poe married the thirteen year old Virginia Clemm at theage of 26.Novalis kept his engagement to Sophie a secret, fearing his father would objectto their marriage: more on the grounds of Sophie's humble background than ontheir age differences. His father, however, was uncharacteristically taken withthe girl, which says much for her charm, and consented to their union. Sadly,fate conspired against Novalis, and in November 1795, Sophie fell seriously in,with a tumour of the liver. By spring of 1796, her condition had improved, butby the summer it declined, and an operation was necessary. Others followed, butwere unsuccessful, and, after a long, agonizing struggle, she died in March of1797, not yet sixteen. Less than a month later his brother Erasmus also diedfrom consumption, the same disease that would eventually kill Novalis himself.Early death, loss and mourning were abundant influences on Novalis' worldvievy.While it's clear that Novalis' love for Sophie was sincere, one can't help butwonder at the psychological underpinnings of his infatuation. As John Neubauerin his study of the poet remarks, examples of her letters suggest that Sophiewas as unequal a partner intellectually as she was sexually; and Novalis' friendthe theologian Friedrich Schliermacher commented that he did not believe Novalischose \"his beloved correctly, or rather, that he had even found her; I am almostconvinced, she would not have sufficed him, had she stayed alive.\"' Novalis hadalready had at least one affair before meeting Sophie, and his university dayscarousing with Friedrich Schlegel more than likely included some sexualactivity. But although he was sexual active, he also felt a need to repress hisurges. Erotic fantasies and day dreams obsessed him, and he often sought thecompany of sexually unattainable women in order to mitigate these desires. Thesexual act itself also repelled him; speaking with his brother about his firstencounter with Sophie, he remarked that his \"tender feelings\" for her dissolvedwith the first \"vulgar signs of favour.\" It may be reading too much into aperhaps harmless infatuation, but Sophie seems in many ways a figure of pureSehnsucht: an ideal beauty, who remained, at least for the present, untouchable.Between pure sexual fantasy, and the reality of actual sex, she shimmered like apromising dawn. With Sophie's death, that unattainability became permanent; itwas only then that Novalis allowed himself to recast her as a symbol of mysticalunion, an expression of the erotic spirituality common to the alchemical,hermetic and kabbalistic tradition in which Novalis found himself.All of Novalis' work is saturated in the Pythagorean, hermetic themes of unitywith the divine. Like Swedenborg, Blake and many others, Novalis saw theexternal, physical world as a symbol of a deeper, spiritual reality. WithSophie's death, Novalis saw in his chaste love for her a means of breakingthrough the outer shell and entering the radiant source. That transition,according to him, took place on 13 May 1797, when Novalis had a mysticalexperience, while contemplating Sophie's grave. There, as he recorded in hisdiary, \"I was indescribably happy- moments of flashing enthusiasm - I blew thegrave away like dust - her presence was palpable - I believed she would stepforward at any minute.\"In the two months prior to his experience, Novalis practised a form of `activeimagination', engaging in various spiritual disciplines the aim of which was toprepare him for his breakthrough. These were, in part at least, strenuousattempts to curb his sexual fantasies while maintaining a strict focus on hislove for the deceased teenager with whom he hoped to soon be rejoined in death.A diary of the time records a struggle between \"sensuous imaginings\" and hisdetermination to maintain his \"engagement in a higher sense.\" Novalis, likeother, later dark romantics - Wagner and Mahler come to mind - sought in death arelease from life's illusions; yet it was only in a higher, spiritual union,that his sexual hunger could be allowed free expression. One product of thistension are the' mystico-erotic Hymns to the Night (1800), one of the few of thepoet's works published in his life time. In the third hymn we find a poeticizedaccount of Novalis' grave experience.In preparation for his mystical encounter, Novalis visited Sophie's gravefrequently, poured over her letters and mementos, and read spiritual andmystical literature. How much his vision of Sophie was a product of his ownpowerful imagination is debatable, and the fact that sophia is Greek for wisdom,union with which is the central aim of mystical practice, cannot have escapedthe attentive reader. That he practised conjuring her image up is clear frompassages in his diary. A week before the vision, he recorded seeing her inprofile, sitting beside him on his sofa, wearing a green scarf. One inspirationwas a letter from his brother Carl, who spoke of a sudden yearning to die,brought on by a thunderstorm. He spoke of the \"genuine sincerity\" with which hecontemplated being struck by lightning, the flash transporting one to \"theeternal embrace of our beloved ones.\"Death, for Novalis, meant transfiguration, an ecstatic escape from time andspace, a notion shared by many Romantics, and captured in the canvases of theRomantic painter Caspar David Friedrich. Whether this was so, or whether thegrave meant sheer oblivion, Novalis did not have to wait long to find out. In1798, Novalis met Julie von Charpentier, and his obsession with Sophie hadapparently abated enough for him to become romantically involved with her. Theirengagement, however, was doomed. Although his literary career was beginning toblossom (he had already met Goethe, and in Jena Novalis was the centre of acircle which included Ludwig Tieck, the Schlegel brothers, Friedrich Schellingand Friedrich Schliermacher) the tuberculosis that destroyed his brother wasravaging his own delicate frame. He continued to write and to fulfill his dutiesas an inspector of the Saxon salt mines but in October of 1800 his lungssuffered a major collapse. His health declined and on 25 March 1801 - four yearsand six days after Sophie's death - he and his beloved met in what we mustassume was a more lasting union. At the age of 28, Novalis died.E. T.A. HOFFMANNPerhaps the most romantic of the Romantics was a strangely self-dividedindividual whose wild dual personality and bouts of alcoholic excess werecomplemented by a meticulous concern for social duty and a work schedule thatwould daunt even the most disciplined character. Ernst Theodore Amadeus Hoffmannwas by day a respected juror and civil servant, holding at different times inhis life positions with the civil administration in Poland and the PrussianSupreme Court in Berlin. By night, however, he was something very different. Aconsiderable graphic artist, Hoffmann was also a composer. Although most of hismusic is lost today, he is known to have written ten operas (one of which,Undine, is arguably the first Romantic work in that form) two symphonies, twomasses, several cantatas, much incidental music and dozens of chamber works. Hewas also a capable conductor, know for his productions of Mozart and Gluck, aswell as a brilliant music critic. Hoffmann's essays on Beethoven, at a time whenthe public had yet to acquire a taste for him, as well as on the idea of musicas an autonomous spiritual world helped, more than anything else, to create theimage of the composer as the hierophant of a higher, ideal realm. With Coleridgeand Baudelaire, Hoffmann is one of those rare writers who turn criticism into anart. His essays and reviews arguing for an appreciation of music as aself-sufficient non-representational art form - for the superiority ofinstrumental against vocal music, a preference practically unheard of in his day- would influence important musical theorists like Schumann, Wagner andSchopenhauer, and would later feed the aesthetic doctrine of Symbolism, whichwould dominate the late 19th century. This is not surprising: music, and the`superior world' that it depicted, was the central experience of Hoffmann'slife. In \"Beethoven's Instrumental Music,\" Hoffmann expressed the reason forthis in a succinct formula. \"Music,\" he wrote, \"reveals to man an unknown realm,a world quite separate from the outer sensual world surrounding him, a world inwhich he leaves behind all precise feelings in order to embrace an inexpressiblelonging.\"Like Novalis, Hoffmann too knew Sehnsucht. Yet it was not only in his writingson music that Hoffmann spoke of another world. If it already seems that he wasgifted enough for several people - and to some extent Hoffmann was severalpeople - he was also the author of some of the most bizarre and beloved storiesand novels of the 19th century. In many ways Hoffmann is like a cross betweenEdgar Allan Poe and Hans Christian Andersen, both of whom read his tales withprofit. His stories have the glitter and dazzle of fairy tales, yet are oftenshot through with a disturbing, macabre sensibility. Yet, like Goethe, he is oneof those German authors that have never really got across to an Englishreadership. Most people know Hoffmann today, if at all, in a form that wouldhave pleased him: as the inspiration for Offenbach's light opera The Tales ofHoffmann, and for Tchaikovsky's ballet, The Nutcracker. Yet Hoffmann's weirdtales of magical initiation, alchemy, strange states of consciousness and otheroccult themes display a psychological insight comparable to Baudelaire,Dostoyevsky, and Kafka.Ernst Theodore Wilhelm Hoffmann was born in Konigs- berg in 1776; later headopted the name Amadeus in honour of his beloved Mozart. He had an unhappychildhood, and the neglect he suffered at the hands of his parents wasexacerbated by their early separation and divorce. Orphaned at an early age, hewas brought up by strict relatives in a household made up of a grandmother,three aunts and a puritanical uncle. Perhaps the sudden loss of his parents andthe absence of a personal golden age led to his love of music and its promise ofan `ideal' realm. At any rate, his fascination with it began early, and anencounter with Mozart's Magic Flute set the stage for his later creations.Mozart's musical Masonic fairy tale of initiation and the eternal war betweengood and evil, symbolized by the magus Sarastro and the Queen of the Night,became the blueprint for Hoffmann's own tales. All of Hoffmann's stories engagethis archetypal theme, which is the romantic conundrum par excellence: the clashbetween the dull world of routine necessity, and the pressing claims of theimagination. Hoffmann, who had a foot in both worlds, felt the stress andfriction between them throughout his life, and it took its toll; he was knownfor his sudden shifts in temperament, plunging from childlike gaiety into darkintroversion, from warm conviviality into silent isolation. He was a man ofmasks, of fragments and unsettling inconsistencies. It would be trendy to speakof him as postmodern, but it's obvious that the kind of all-embracing unity thata Goethe managed to effect was denied him.Whether it was fate, his unconscious, immaturity, or Poe's `imp of theperverse', throughout his life, Hoffmann seemed to create a crisis wheneverthings ran too smoothly for him, and the claims of routine and normalitythreatened to submerge too deeply the longings for the other world. AsGovernment Assessor in Posen, he jeopardized a comfortable position by drawingcaricatures of local dignitaries; his excellent graphic work had him exiled toPlock, an unspeakably dull provincial town, where he had little to do but regrethis rashness. Years later, in Berlin, the pattern was repeated when he satirizedthe Director of the Police Commission in his last novel, Master Flea. Hoffmannspoke of his intentions, and word of his acid wit got around; proceedings werebegun against him. The book was eventually published with the offending partsexcised.In between these two incidents, which were simply the most prominent, Hoffmanncarried on a dizzying career. His own life displays the same crowded backdropand rapidity of change common to his stories, and throughout it Hoffmann showeda profound disregard for whatever physical effects this might entail. In a wayit isn't surprising that he should die, paralyzed and in poverty, at the age of46 - yet still dictating his last works - shattered by the accumulatedbuffetings of alcoholic excess, liver degeneration and a nervous disorder,locomotor ataxia.Yet Hoffmann's life was an embodiment of his central themes: the uncertainty ofidentity and the conflict between the `two worlds'. Occult and paranormal ideasrun throughout his stories. Mesmerism, hypnotism, somnambulism, multiple selves,the world of sylphs and salamanders, the perpetual battle between the dark andthe light: these are the basic elements of his tales. But the recurring myth isthe contrast and tension between the everyday world and that of magic. Nowheredid Hoffmann depict this with greater conviction that in The Golden Flower Pot(1814), which is generally considered his greatest work. Like Goethe andNovalis, Hoffmann used the Marchen, but with an important variation. UnlikeGoethe and Novalis, Hoffmann sets his initiation story in the context of theeveryday world, and brings magic down to earth. He is, as Jeremy Adler suggests,one of the first writers of the city, before Baudelaire and Poe.\"' WhereGoethe's Fairy Tale has the odd, unfixed quality of a dream, Hoffmann's Dresdenis immediately recognizable. His stories get their effect from the convincingdepiction of the magical world invading the everyday. This is Hoffmann's`serapiontic principle', first proposed in his The Serapion Brotherhood (1819).The book is about a group of poets and artists who take their name from a madnobleman who believes he is a monk martyred during the reign of Emperor Decius.When his followers point out that the towers they see are of those of Bamberg,Serapion denies this, and says they are indeed those of Alexandria in the SecondCentury AD. When they point out that this is madness, he reminds them that theyforget that the world they see is within their minds. Reality is within, not outthere: the central Romantic theme. Yet, Hoffmann recognizes that this can leadto a dead end, both in life and in art. Novalis' hermetic Mdrehen depictsanother reality, but one too detached from this one to be convincing. The`serapiontic principle' argues that in order for magic to be effective, it hasto be made convincing, which means that it has to be rooted somehow in thisworld. \"There is an inner world,\" Hoffmann wrote, \"and a spiritual faculty fordiscerning it with absolute clearness - yes, with the most minute and brilliantdistinctness. But it is part of our earthly lot that it is the outer world, inwhich we are entrapped, that triggers this spiritual faculty ... it is the outerworld that causes the spirit to use its powers of perception.\" Hoffmann'sstories are still so readable today because he rarely loses sight of this'intuition. And the aesthetic principle at work in his stories is also thepsychological one at work in Hoffmann's life. It's reminiscent of the fairy taleof Goldilocks. Too much reality and life becomes dull, pointless and insipid;too much imagination, and we become Brother Serapion, living in a solipsisticdream world. But when the combination is \"just right,\" - as it is so often inHoffmann's stories - then we get `magic.\"' Not ethereal fairy worlds, or flat,dreary realism, but a sparkling, intoxicating tale that stimulates ourimaginative and creative spirits - a kind of literary champagne, againappropriately enough, for Hoffmann. The only other writer to portray this dualreality with such clarity and force is David Lindsay, author of the gnosticclassic A Voyage to Arcturus (1920); but Lindsay's vision is grim, oftenpessimistic, and he lacks Hoffmann's inviting good humour; we might say he isBeethoven to Hoffmann's Mozart.In his life Hoffmann never realized the \"just right\", the fruitful combinationof the two worlds, that he achieved in his stories. Yet, for the Romantics, lifeand art are two sides of the same adventure, and what makes The Golden FlowerPot an inexhaustible source (a \"pot of gold\") is that by reading it, we aredrawn into the very myth it presents. Hoffmann is the first writer with whom theequation Poetry=Magic is made clear; the reader, by association, is madeaccomplice to the alchemical transformation. The props of Hoffmann's initiatorytale come for the most part from Le Comte de Gabalais (1670), an occult novel inthe Renaissance Rosicrucian manner, depicting the elemental world of Paracelsus,by the Abbe Mont- faucon de Villars. The student Anselmus, a clumsy, dreamyyoung man with a taste for poetry, is troubled by a recurring vision of aglittering green snake.\" The snake, it turns out, is Serpentina, the daughter ofthe Archivist Lindhorst, who is in reality an elemental salamander, exiled toearth for a transgression committed millennia ago. Anselmus, who is alsoattracted to the beautiful but worldly Veronica (who wants him to become Hofrathand lead a sensible, respectable life), is hired by Lindhorst to copy out amagical manuscript, which indeed relates the story of his primeval fall fromgrace, and of his perpetual battle against the forces of darkness, symbolized inthe story by the evil apple woman ... The story's tension lies in Anselmushaving to choose between the two worlds, and much of it is influenced byHoffmann's reading of G.H. Schubert's Ansichten von der Nachtseite derNaturwissenschaft (Views from the Nightside of Natural Science) (1808), at thetime an immensely popular work of Naturphilosophie, which dealt with theirrational and what we might call paranormal side of existence. In the end,after a series of trials and fantastic adventures, Anselmus, like Hoffmann,plumps for Serpentina, and with her and the Magus Lindhorst, they retire totheir \"freehold in Atlantis,\" Schubert's symbol for mankind's original state ofunity with nature. Yet the reader, who we must assume has at least the potentialfor poetry, or magic, is also a participant in the dialectic, and having readHoffmann's account, must decide whether it is merely a diverting story, or ametaphor for his existence ... Relating an account of his magical past, thearchivist is accused by the philistines of oriental bombast, and is requested totell them something that is true. Lindhorst replies that he knows no story moretrue than the one he is telling them. 1, for one, agree: under the deceptivesurface of an entertaining fable, Hoffmann has managed to articulate the centralmyth of human life.EDGAR ALLAN POEEdgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), like Hoffmann, is another serious writer who hasbecome, for the general reading public, merely a teller of gruesome horrorstories. For myself as an adolescent in the 1960s, these were made intocinematic and highly enjoyable pulp by the filmmaker Roger Corman. \"The Raven\"is one of those poems you learn - or used to learn, at any rate - early on inEnglish lessons in the US, and \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" has to be one of the mostanthologized stories ever, turning up in scores of `Tales of Terror' typecollections. But there is of course another side to Poe, a side that fellowpoets like Charles Baudelaire, J.K. Huysmans and Stephan Mallarme knew andappreciated, unlike the Americans of Poe's own time, or the later seriouscritics, like Henry James and T.S. Eliot, who saw in his work nothing but anunfortunate influence on juvenile minds.Poe's own life is a horror story more unsettling than any he wrote. Althoughit's accepted that accounts of his depravity and drug addiction are exaggerated,it is true that his life, beginning with a runaway father and the loss of hismother at the age of two, was a series of painful mistakes, defeats andfrustrations. In true Romantic fashion, Poe died under mysterious circumstances,at the age of 40.13 Like Novalis' Sophie, Poe's own child-bride, Virginia, diedof consumption, her demise being the ostensible cause of Poe's last decline andsupposed final, destructive binge. For most of his life, Poe lived in abjectpoverty, and even with literary triumphs and fame - \"The Raven\" was the oneclear success in his lifetime - he barely earned enough from his work as criticand editor to keep body and soul together. In Poe's case, this may not have beenthat problematic, as the separation of soul from the confines-of the body washis central metaphysical concern.Like Hoffmann, Poe was a divided man, a self-professed rationalist (inventor ofthe tale of detection) who was obsessed with notions of the soul and the worldbeyond, an idealist poet who was chin deep in the cut-throat world of antebellumAmerican journalism. Also like Hoffmann Poe was fascinated by the human mind andexplored its lesser travelled environs, experimenting with hypnagogia,somnambulism, dreams and mesmerism. Poe's internal division even went so far asto form for him the blueprint of the psyche: he accepted the tenets of`Facultative Psychology', which argued that different mental faculties, likerationality, the `Moral Sense' and the `Aesthetic Sense', exist in isolationfrom each other. Again like Hoffmann, Poe tried to unify his many and disparateselves through the magic wand of Art. Any reader of Poe's critical works soonbecomes acquainted with a dictum that runs through them like an idee fixe: unityof effect. That a man whose inner world harboured a mob of selves would beenamoured of unity is understandable. But Poe's vision of a unified world wentbeyond the printed page; or rather, although the paraphernalia of his poems andstories include reanimated corpses, premature burial, doppelganger, andfiendishly beating hearts, their subject is the knowledge of the true world,lying beyond the veil of the senses, that \"wild, weird clime that liethsublime/Out of SPACE, out of TIME.\" As one critic writes, \"The direction ofPoe's mind, the thrust of his imagination is ... away from the body toward thespirit, away from the `dull realities' of this world, toward the transcendentconsciousness on a `far happier star'.\"14That Poe is, like Novalis, essentially concerned with the 'journey into theinterior' may come as a surprise to readers who remember him for conte cruelslike \"The Pit and the Pendulum,\" or for psychological thrillers like \"The BlackCat.\" But Poe's stories and fables can be seen as inward voyages to a visionaryconsciousness. In his Marginalia, Poe wrote of his experiences of hypnagogia,that half-dream state that exists between waking and sleeping. These visions, hewrites \"arise in the soul ... only at its epochs of most intense tranquillity... at those mere points of time where the confines of the waking world blendwith those of the world of dreams. I am aware of these `fancies' only when I amon the brink of sleep, with the consciousness that I am so ... (they) have inthem a pleasurable ecstasy, as far beyond the most pleasurable of the world ofwakefulness, or of dreams, as the Heaven of the Northman theology is beyond itsHell. I regard the visions, even as they arise, with an awe which, in somemeasure, moderates or tranquillizes the ecstasy - I so regard them, through aconviction (which seems a portion of the ecstasy itself) that this ecstasy, initself, is of a character supernal to the Human Nature - is a glimpse of thespirit's outer world ...\"15Hidden knowledge, strange journeys, and weird, uncommon landscapes often formthe content of hypnagogic hallucinations, and also of Poe's stories. \"ThePurloined Letter,\" \"The Balloon Hoax,\" and \"The Domain of Arnheim\"; thoseunusual interior spaces, like the House of Usher or Auguste Dupin's study: allsymbolize, perhaps, the dark recesses of the mind, or idealized retreats inwhich to dream and meditate. And while clinical psychologists andneuroscientists may see hypnagogic visions as the flotsam and jetsam of anidling brain, for poets like Poe and visionary occultists like Swedenborg theyare the signposts pointing to an undiscovered country of the soul. No doubt, thevoyage outward may be risky. Poe knew this, as do the narrators of \"MS. Found ina Bottle,\" \"A Descent into the Maelstrom\" and The Narrative of Arthur GordonPym. But he also knew it was the only trip worth taking.Poe was a student of occult literature, and hermetic and alchemical themesappear throughout his work, in symbolic fashion in tales like \"The Fall of theHouse of Usher,\" \"The Assignation\" and \"Ligiea,\" as well as in morestraightforward satires like \"Von Kempelen and his Discovery.\"'6 But in histhree `mesmerism tales', \"A Tale of The Ragged Mountains\" (1844), \"MesmericRevelations\" (1844), and \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\" (1845), hisbelief in the possibility of piercing the veil between the `two worlds' ispresented in almost straightforward reportage. Poe was a perpetrator of literaryhoaxes; and as one critic points out, at the time, a fad for pseudo-science hadhit the States.\" \"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\" caused a stir in Englandas well as America, prompting practising mesmerists and poets like ElizabethBarrett Browning to write to Poe, asking if the account was true. But if Poe'saccount of a mesmerist keeping his deceased subject in a state of suspendanimation for seven months, at the end of which his body dissolves into \"anearly liquid mass of loathsome - of detestable putridity\" carries more macabreeffect, \"Mesmeric Revelation,\" is closer to Poe's metaphysical target, and is asort of dry run for the full blown apocalypse in his magnificently bombastic andeerily prescient prose poem Eureka (1848), written shortly before his death.Poe got most of his information about mesmerism from the Reverend Chauncy HareTownshend's Facts in Mesmerism (1840). It is clear why Townshend's bookimpressed him. The rationalist Poe had little interest in spiritualinterpretations of Mesmer's ideas; he was looking for facts, as both the openingsentence of this story, and the title of the Valdemar account attest. Writing tothe poet James Russell Lowell, Poe remarked \"I have no belief in spirituality. Ithink the word a mere word. No one has a conception of spirit. We cannot imaginewhat is not.\" What we can imagine, or at least what Poe could and does in\"Mesmeric Revelation\", is an infinitely refined matter that is `unparticled',not distinguishable by minute parts (atoms) but unified. This unparticled matterpermeates the universe and is, for Poe, and for the mesmerized hero of his tale,God.18 This unparticled matter is hidden to our usual senses, but can beglimpsed in half-dream states and in mesmeric trance. Strangely, the notion of akind of matter unperceivable by our normal senses, and within which other kindsof beings exist, will resurface in the work of Lord Lytton, Eliphas Levi and Guyde Maupassant. Poe's report from beyond was so convincing that a Swedenborgiangroup wrote to him, informing him that they could corroborate his findings. Poesomewhat peevishly informed them that, \"The story is pure fiction from beginningto end.\" Yet he was at pains to argue that the vision of his longer work Eureka,basically an elaboration of what we find here, was true. Poe's selfdivision randeep, yet even if we are left unimpressed by his account of an unparticledomnipresent divine substance, the remarkable prescience exhibited in Eureka isenough to suggest that hypnagogic states and mesmeric trances can afford insightinto some unusual aspects of reality. Poe expected much of Eureka, believing itwould establish him as an important metaphysical thinker. The book was a flop,yet within its florid pages, Poe predicts black holes, the expanding universe,curved space, galactic clusters, the discovery of a new asteroid orbitingbetween Mars and Jupiter, as well as other cosmological notions like theanthropic principle, unthought of at the time of writing. Critics had no ideawhat to make of it, and given Poe's reputation as a drunkard and drug-taker, itisn't surprising that they relegated his metaphysical flights to the samecategory as pink elephants. Their ignorance shattered Poe. To his publisherGeorge Putnam Poe announced \"I have solved the secret of the universe!\", anddemanded a first edition of 50,000 copies. Putnam squeezed out an advance of$14, and the 500 copies he printed didn't sell.Most readers may find Poe's vision too abstract to offer much existentialcomfort, yet embedded in his unparticled matter is a Christian moral. When asked\"to what good end is pain,\" Poe's mesmerized savant replies, \"The pain of theprimitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life inHeaven.\" Like others we will encounter, Eliphas Levi, Baudelaire, Rimbaud andMalcolm Lowry, Poe's way was the way of suffering. We hardly need to bemesmerized to imagine that he would try to find some meaning in it.BALZACA story about Balzac tells how, before locking himself in his study, he wouldundress and hand his clothes to his servant, with the command that he was not toreturn them until he had written his quota for the day. Apocryphal, no doubt,but rooted in truth. Balzac did don a monkish robe before setting down to aday's, or rather a night's work - his usual schedule was to rise at midnight andwork until eight. And he did produce an enormous amount of words each night: oneestimate places an average output at around sixteen printed pages. Balzac'sproduction was the literary equivalent of the `progress' that was changing thelandscape of France in the first half of the 19th century. Not counting thepseudonymous works of his early years, between the age of 30 and his death in1850 at the age of 51, Balzac produced over a hundred novels and short stories,not to mention his non-fiction works. He was slowed down only in his last yearsby his final illness, which was clearly brought on by his crushing schedule. TheIndustrial Revolution had ushered in a new age of factories, mass production andassembly lines, and Balzac's incredible flood of language rivalled the mostprodigious of these new \"satanic mills.\" He was, as he called himself, a \"mindfactory,\" and his fluency has led some critics to see in him little more than anegotistic hack with an insatiable need to see his name in print. Suchaspersions, however, are wasted on Balzac. He was Olympian enough to be allthese things, and still be one of the 19th century's giants of literature.Coleridge and De Quincey had their opium, Baudelaire his wine and hashish, Poehis drink. Balzac had thick strong black coffee: one estimate puts his workingintake at around fifty thousand cups. Made by his own hand, this powerful brewfuelled the writing of his Gargantuan La Comedie Humaine and eventually weakenedhis heart enough to kill him. Balzac's aim in this mountainous chain of novels,unfinished at the time of his death, was to portray \"the history of the humanheart traced thread by thread.\" His vision was of a vast prose epic depictingthe realities of the modern urban world burgeoning around him. Master criminals,financiers, socialites, prostitutes and the new urban poor: their story would betold against the remorseless backdrop of their heartless-mistress, Paris. It isa bit odd then to realize that this Titan of realism, whom Zola would laterchampion as a precursor to his own sociological novels, was an unrepentantlife-long mystic to whom the outer, visible world was only a symbol of an inner,spiritual realm.Honore Balzac - he later adopted the aristocratic `de' when he published hisfirst novel under his own name - was born in Tours in 1799. Like Poe andHoffmann, Balzac had a dual temperament, clearly fashioned from what heinherited from his parents. Balzac's father was a child of the Enlightenment andthe Revolution, an agnostic rationalist with a keen nose for business andfinance. Balzac's mother, whose indifference and cold-heartedness to the boy islegendary, was a reader of Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, and a follower ofMesmer, all three of whom would become central influences on the fledglingnovelist. It isn't surprising that in Seraphita Balzac would focus on thearchetypal symbol for the union of opposites, the androgyne. The alchemicalfusion embodied in that sublime creature Seraphita/Seraphitus, spoke also ofBalzac's need to bring together, and hence pass beyond, the opposites in hisnature.Balzac's belief in the occult is well documented. \"All his life,\" his biographerStefan Zweig wrote, \"Balzac clung to the most primitive forms of superstition.He believed in amulets, always wore a lucky ring with mysterious orientalsymbols and before taking any important decisions he would consult a fortuneteller like any Parisian seamstress.\"\" During a trip to Vienna Balzac met theOrientalist Baron Joseph de Hammer- Purgstall, whose book on the Hashishinstarted a vogue for eastern mystical conspiracy theories. The baron gave Balzaca magical talisman, a ring engraved with strange Arabic characters. Balzaccalled the talisman `Bedouck' and carried it everywhere, believing it wouldbring good luck, invisibility, long life, and success with women. Other storiesattest to what most biographers consider Balzac's credulity.But Balzac's deep belief in occult phenomena went far beyond these superficialsigns. He was, along with Poe and Hoffmann, a profound student of Mesmer, and ofthe novels making up his Comedie Humaine, at least four - Louis Lambert (1832),Seraphita (1835), Ursule Mirouet (1842), and Cousin Pons (1847) - deal directlywith mesmeric and theosophical ideas. Like Poe, Balzac was convinced that in the`mesmeric trance', consciousness was put into \"a state in which the inner sensemade contact with the spiritual world, freeing the inner man to wander throughspace and time ...\"20 Balzac had flights of metaphysics equal to Poe's, but hiscentral obsession with `magnetism' was its manifestation in the human will. Willpower for Balzac was a very definite thing, an actual force emanating from thepersonality, generally through the eyes. The stuff of pulp thrillers,immortalized in De Maurier's Svengali, for Balzac and other writers, like hisfriend Theophile Gautier, it was a fact, and Balzac himself was living proof.Gautier, who used magnetic tropes in many of his stories, spoke of Balzac's\"lightning-like glances, so brilliant, so charged with magnetism,\" andremonstrated with him for using his powers to seduce women. It isn't surprisingthat Balzac should be interested in will power, given his own remarkable fund ofit. He believed that at birth each of us is given a fixed amount of thismagnetism, and that with its use, it is burned up, never to be restored. In manyways his novels are thought experiments in which he explores the different waysin which his characters expend their vital fluid. Balzac was always impressed bysheer, ruthless will. Perhaps the archetypal expression of this is the ambitiousRastignac looking at Paris from his garret window and saying, \"It's between youand me now!\"But Balzac was also interested in other, more subtle powers of the will. InLouis Lambert, his idealized self portrait, he depicts a young man with almosthallucinatory powers of imagination. When Louis first discovers the world ofliterature, it is as if he has discovered himself for the first time. Readingbecomes \"a species of hunger which nothing could allay.\" \"Whenever I wish it,\"he tells the narrator - Balzac himself- \"I can draw a veil over my eyes. Then Isuddenly see within me a camera obscura, where natural objects are reproduced inpurer forms than those under which they first appeared to my external sense.\"\"When I read the story of the battle of Austerlitz ... I saw every incident. Theroar of the cannon, the cries of the fighting men rang in my ears and made myinmost self quiver ..Clearly Louis has discovered Hoffmann's other world, the imagination. Yet astreak of romantic pessimism makes Balzac kill off Louis, a victim of the verymagnetic powers that carry him to the beyond. Balzac believed that a tooenergetic use of the vital fluids leads to death, and again, his own volcanichistory seems to corroborate this. This is the direction Romantic occultism willtake as the century progresses. Unlike Blake and Goethe, from Novalis on, theidea that the external world can be transformed into the other world through theimagination, is dropped, and in its place we get the belief that this world is atrap, or at least that it is a sphere too crude and imperfect for sensitivesouls like Romantic poets. The option then is to escape this world, and the bestway of doing this is, of course, through death.In Seraphita Balzac brings together several different occult themes: theandrogyne, the other world, mesmerism and Swedenborgianism. Balzac's Swedenborg,however, is a particular variant, and is characteristic of the occultsmorgasbord that made up alternative thought in 1830s Paris. Of mesmerismGautier said that it supplied himself and other writers with a system of \"thefantastic, the mysterious, the occult and the inexplicable.\" The same can besaid of Swedenborg's doctrines. Balzac knew of them only through a French digestof the mage's work; most of his other knowledge came secondhand through hismother. Another influence was the interesting figure of David Ferdinand Koreff,a German physician who had once held a chair in animal magnetism at theUniversity of Berlin, and who had now moved to Paris. Koreff was a confirmedmesmerist, and introduced the cream of the Parisian literary world to Mesmer'sideas. A witty, cosmopolitan character, Koreff knew Hoffmann, who he apparentlyresembled, and, as Hoffmann's work was then enjoying great Parisian acclaim,this cachet made him a desirable guest with the literary set. Among his friendsand clients were Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, Musset, Prosper Merimee, Chateaubriand,Stendhal, Benjamin Constant, Heinrich Heine and Balzac.Balzac was a voracious reader with an insatiable hunger for knowledge and ideas.He was not, however, a particularly analytical or systematic thinker, and themesmerism that came to him had already passed through a gauntlet of other occultideas, all of which he absorbed into his capacious mind. Mesmer and Swedenborgmet in their belief that in its attempt to account for the external world,rationalist science ignored the deeper questions of man's inner being. Thatinner being's transfiguration is the theme of Seraphita. The ostensibleinspiration for the book was a sculpture by a minor 19th century artist,Theophile Bra, a work depicting Mary holding the infant Christ, surrounded byangels. Angels hold an important place in Swedenborg's philosophy - they are, infact, humans who have passed over the threshold - and Balzac had had the idea ofwriting a novel about one for some time. Bra shared with Balzac a deep interestin esoteric thought, and his statue seemed to have a profound effect on him.Balzac's angel became the hermaphroditic creature, Seraphita/ Seraphitus, withwhom two mere humans are in love: to the woman he appears as a man, to the man,she is seen as a woman.Seraphita/Seraphitus is the child of a devout Swedenborgian couple who, duringthe nine months of pregnancy, performed daily prayers and spiritual meditations.The result was a kind of Rosemary's Baby in reverse. The couple's spiritualpreparations were so intense that on the day of the child's birth, Swedenborg,ten years dead, appeared before them and congratulated them on their work.Balzac wasn't the only one fascinated by hermaphrodites. Around the same timeGautier had published his Mademoiselle de Maupin, a light, frivolously shockingtreatment of the theme, remembered now mostly for its influential \"art for art'ssake\" preface. For all his interest in mesmerism, Gautier was very much a man ofthis world, and he really shared very little of Balzac's passion for the beyond.Yet both may have seen that, along with the long esoteric tradition of androgynein alchemy and Kabbalah, the idea is also a metaphor for the artist's soul.Balzac himself said that the artist is something of a man/woman. Seraphita,though not his best work, does do something to bear this reflection out.GERARD DE NERVALIf Gerard de Nerval is known at all to English readers, it's more for hisBohemian eccentricities than for his work as a writer. He is, for instance, theman who walked a lobster on a blue ribbon along the Palais-Royal in Paris, andwhen questioned why, replied: \"It does not bark and it knows the secrets of thedeep\". Others may recall that he once sported a human skull as a wine goblet,claiming that it had been his mother's, and that he had to kill her to get it.(She in fact had died when he was two and he never knew her.) Or there was thewigwam he invariably brought when staying at a friend's, a cumbersome articlethat was nevertheless more mobile than the immense Renaissance bed he bought forthe imaginary consummation of an impossible love affair. (Unused, the bed wasfinally palmed off on his great friend, Theophile Gautier.) Nerval was alsoknown for carrying an apron string around with him that at different times hevariously explained as being the Queen of Sheba's garter, part of Madame deMaintenon's corset, or an indefinite accessory of Marguerite de Valois. Foryears, friends like Gautier, Baudelaire and others looked at the antics of lebon Gerard with amusement, seeing in them little more than the jeux d'sprit oftheir talented, if distracted, friend. But soon the eccentricities passed intomore perplexing behaviour, and it became clear that something was wrong. Gerardhad cleared the threshold of a peculiar kind of madness and was, it seemed,unable to return. In the end, homeless, destitute and quite insane, on a frigidJanuary night in 1855 he put his prestigious apron string to more definite useby hanging himself with it in the filthy rue de la Vieille-Lanterne, a squalidalley near the rue de Rivoli. He was forty-six and had only recently beenreleased from his second extended stay in a mental asylum.Of the French Romantics, Nerval was the one most susceptible to the influence ofHoffmann and the German Romantics; he was also an encyclopedic student of theoccult. A visionary like Blake, Nerval, like the student Anselmus, was aware ofthe other world, and pursued it as his great dream throughout his life. In theend, however, the tables were turned and the dream - now often a nightmare -pursued him. There is a grim irony to be found in the fact that Nerval took thename Aurelia, the title of his most famous work, from a story in Hoffmann's TheSerapion Brotherhood. When the black night of madness descended over him - whichAurelia (1855), his masterpiece, recounts in unsettling detail - Nerval, likeBrother Serapion, found himself in a world no longer bordering on the territoryof reality.Gerard de Nerval was born Gerard Labrunie in Paris on 22 May 1808. His father, astern, taciturn individual, was a surgeon-major in Napoleon's Grand Armee; soonafter his birth, his mother, Marie-Antoinette-Marguerite Laurent, leaving Gerardin the care of a nurse, followed her husband on a Russian campaign, and died atthe age of twenty-five from a fever contracted while crossing a bridge litteredwith corpses. She was buried in Silesia. Gothic ghosts and Hoffmahnesquesettings were not the only spirits drawing Gerard to the misty Teutonic forests.His mother's dreamlike memory - the dream of a memory, in fact - also gave himthe material with which to reinvent himself. After years of signing himselfsimply `Gerard', he adopted a new identity that was a near mirror image of hismother's maiden name. \"de Nerval\" was the esoteric nexus of a host of imaginedhistories, the focal point of what Nerval called his genealogie fantastique.Along with showing his clear descent from the Roman Emperor Nerva, his new nomede plume, he claimed, undoubtedly linked him with the German king Otho and theNapoleonic line ... Less doubtful, it was also a secret code for a patch of landin his beloved Valois, owned by his mother's family, the `clos de Nerval', or`black vale'. Yet Richard Sieburth, in his masterful introduction to a recentcollection of Nerval's writings, suggests other, more initiatory meanings atwork in Gerard's new self: \"Nerval\" speaks both of Avernus, the mythologicalportal to the underworld, and vernal, the promise of rebirth21. That Nerval madethe descent is unquestioned - his genealogie fan- tastique dates from his firstmental breakdown in 1841. His subsequent return trip, however, was less secure:from his mother he also inherited a peculiarly personal form of Sehnsucht: aperpetually unfulfilled search for the Feminine Ideal, an anima image he wouldhouse in unlikely candidates with generally disastrous consequences.A precocious child, rejecting his father's wish that he follow in his footsteps,while still a teenager Gerard published several slim volumes of verse. He hadalready met Gautier, a friendship that would last his lifetime, and by nineteenhad made a name for himself with a translation of Goethe's Faust, of which theOlympian himself spoke highly. In 1830 Nerval took part with Gautier and otheryoung Romantics in the theatre riots surrounding Victor Hugo's Hernani, and soonafter plunged headfirst into Bohemian22 life. His cronies at this time includedPetrus Borel, the self-styled lycanthrope; Charles Nodier, supposed initiateinto secret societies; Theophile Dondey, who wore glasses when he went to bed sohe could see his dreams; and Alphonse Esquiros, author of the occult novel TheMagician and later friend of the kabbalist Eliphas Levi. An inheritance from hisgrandfather of some 30,000 francs allowed Gerard to travel to the south ofFrance and Italy; it also gave him the wherewithal to found a magazine, Le Mondedramatique. This folded within a year, and Nerval's small fortune was dissipatedin promoting the career of his ill-chosen ewig weibliche, Jenny Colon,'describedby one critic as \"a plump, blonde, second rate actress of easy virtue . . . \"23It is doubtful whether Nerval ever possessed jenny; like Novalis, with whosework he was well acquainted, Nerval's women served more as imaginativestimulators than sensual gratifiers and when it was clear he could do no morefor her, she dropped him.Now heavily in debt, Nerval entered into a spiral of overwork and nervousexhaustion that would continue until his death. He made several attempts tobecome solvent, becoming in quick succession a dramatist, man Friday andcollaborator with Alexandre Dumas, journalist, diplomat, critic and man ofletters. Nothing came of this, and Nerval's fortunes were so low that, after hisdiplomatic mission to Vienna, he had to make part of his way back to Paris onfoot. Signs that something drastic was on its way appeared: his dispatches backto Paris showed evidence of delusions of grandeur, of a personality crackingunder the strain. In Vienna he played the role of the literary wit, moving in amilieu of eroticism, conspiracy and mesmeric party games, but fissures wereopening in his sensitive, gentle soul, and portions of the other world welled upinto his waking life.A series of violent episodes during the mardi gras season ended in his arrestand hospitalization. For nine months he was a patient at the Monmartresanatorium of Dr. Esprit Blanche. A sense of his condition can be had from aletter he wrote at the time:You see spirits who talk to you in broad daylight, at night you see perfectlyshaped, perfectly distinct phantoms, you think you remember having lived inother forms, you imagine you are growing very tall and that your head istouching the stars, the horizon of Saturn or Jupiter spreads before your eyes...2aDepending on your view of things, this is either sheer schizophrenia or a toointense glimpse of that other world that visionaries like Swedenborg and Blakefrequently visited. In his account of his own `descent into the unconscious',C.G. Jung remarked that others had been shaken by these storms, Nietzsche andthe poet Holderlin with whom Nerval felt a deep kinship. They had been broken bythese eruptions (both went mad) but Jung, whose account reads like a classicdepiction of psychosis, believed he withstood them because, along with his ownbrute strength, he had a raft of solid, middle class responsibilities to supporthim: his family, his profession, his obligations to his patients .2' Nerval,like Nietzsche and Holderlin, was a drifter in life; Gautier, perhaps hisclosest friend, described Nerval as an \"apodal swallow ... all wings and nofeet.\" It is easy to see how such a creature would be prey to strong winds. Yetit is too easy to relegate Nerval's visions to the dustbin of insanity. Yearslater, another visionary poet, Rene Daumal, wrote an essay in which he arguedthat he, too, had visited the exact same dreamscape that Nerval depicts in hispoignant Aure'lia. \"So, I was not alone!\" Daumal, another precocious poet,exclaims, at the beginning of \"Nerval the Nyctalope. ,21 Jung's collectiveunconscious, the weird terrain of alchemical allegory, and the clinicallyobserved phenomenon of shared dreams gives support to Aldous Huxley's muchquoted remark that the mind has its own \"antipodes, its Africas and Borneos.\"Nerval may have been merely a dreamer thrust too roughly into the geography ofhis own soul.One mystic landscape he certainly did share with others was the orient. A fewmonths after his release, Nerval embarked on a journey to the east. FromMarseilles Nerval headed into the mythic realms of Cairo, Alexandria, Acre,Beirut, Syria, Smyrna and Constantinople, with many other stops along the way.Part rest cure, part `esotourist' expedition, Nerval's year long wanderings wereas much a descent into his own occult heritage as they were a de rigueur GrandTour for self-respecting Western Orientalists. The Arabian Nights, Vathek andThe Saragossa Manuscript had created an appetite for accounts of exotic traveland strange customs. Hugo, Gautier, Chateaubriand and Lamartine had allcontributed to the fad; now Gerard was heading back to the source. Indeed, inthe first wave of his madness, after a night in which he expounded ecstaticallyon a number of occult topics, Nerval refused to be accompanied home by a friend,and explained that he was not heading back to his room. \"Where are you goingthen?\" the friend asked. \"To the East,\" was Gerard's wild reply.Inspired by Faust, the teenage Nerval had plunged into hermetic literature.Another guide was the ex-rabbi Alexander Weill, who Nerval had met in Frankfurtwhile researching the play Leo Burckhart, which he co-wrote with Dumas. Weillwas a kabbalist and student of the hermetic mysteries, and it is believed thathe introduced Nerval to the serious study of the hidden tradition. Mystical andoccult themes saturate Nerval's work27. The early play The Alchemist was basedon the life of the Renaissance esotericist Nicolas Flamel; years later he wouldwrite Les Illumines, its title taken from Adam Weishaupt's secret society.Nerval shared Abbe Barruel's belief that the Illuminati were the hidden handbehind the Revolution, and in Les Illumines he brings together a grab bag ofarticles dealing with characters like Jacques Cazotte, Cagliostro, the strangeRaoul Spifame, Restif de la Bretonne and others, all against a backdrop ofEnlightenment occultism. His often impenetrable series of poems, Les Chimeres,are rich in dark references to Pythagoras, Egyptian and Greek mythology, andChristian mysticism. But it is in Voyage in the Orient that Nerval gave a freehand to both his occult preoccupations and his need to fictionalize himself.Whether Voyage in the Orient is \"an odyssey - that of Nerval's souli2\" or \"atissue of fabrications\" and a \"Borgesian voyage through the library,\"29 it, asits translator remarks, undoubtedly represents \"the synthesis of Nerval'sesoteric thought,\" and places him \"somewhere between William Blake and MadameBlavatsky.i31Voyage in the Orient is full of exotic impedimenta: hashish, eroticism, strangedream states and astral doubles, secret societies and mystic religions,subterranean kingdoms, elementals, Zoroastrianism, the Druse, and the mythologyof the `preAdamite races'. Among other works, it draws heavily on Silvestre deSacy's Memoire sur la dynastie des assassins et sur 1'origine de leur nom(1809). Using the frame of The Arabian Nights, Nerval inserts novella lengthtales into his reportage and travel writing. \"Makbenash\" is a retelling of thecentral Masonic myth, the murder of Hiram Abif. It's unclear what level offreemasonry Nerval achieved; although it is clear he was well versed in Masoniclore, his actual status in the craft is vague. The chapter is the finale to \"TheTale of the Queen of the Morning and Soliman the Prince of the Genii,\" whichNerval claims he heard being told by a professional storyteller over a two weekperiod in a cafe behind the Beyazid mosque in Istanbul, a trope that, true ornot, hearkens back to Jan Potocki's own account of his search for the originalmanuscript of The Arabian Nights. In Adoniram, Nerval's name for Hiram Abif, wefind his idealized self-image, the creatorprophet, murdered by the philistines.The Queen of the Morning is, of course, Sheba, with whom, we know, Nerval had apeculiarly unique relationship.EDWARD BULWER-LYTTONAlthough he is remembered today for the unforgettable opening line \"It was adark and stormy night,\" (Paul Clifford (1830)), in his day, Bulwer - later LordLytton (1803-1873) - was an immensely popular novelist, writing a series of verysuccessful `silver fork' romances, which combined gothic melodrama withfashionable settings.31 Perhaps his best known work is his historical novel, TheLast Days of Pompei (1834). But along with being a bestselling novelist,BulwerLytton may also have been the single most important occultist of the 19thcentury; in several highly entertaining works he introduced a variety ofesoteric and magical themes which were to prove immensely influential. His TheHaunter and the Haunted (1859) - also know as The House and the Brain - is oneof the best Victorian ghost stories, appearing beside Poe and M.R. James inclassic anthologies. Strikingly modern in its scientific investigation of theghost - Lytton was one of the first psychic investigators, predating the Societyfor Psychical Research by decades- it remains a powerfully evocative tale,disturbingly eerie in atmosphere, and containing a description of a magicianthat ranks besides Tolkien's Gandalf. A Strange Story (1861), an oddly neglectedwork, centres on reincarnation and the alchemical quest for the elixir of life.Two other novels, however, draw heavily on Bulwer-Lytton's interest inRosicrucianism, esoteric knowledge, and the idea of a superior type: hisRosicrucian work Zanoni (1842), and the occult science-fiction tale The ComingRace (1871). Both would become central texts of the modern occult revival.Bulwer-Lytton was one of those embarrassingly versatile Victorians, combining asuccessful career as a politician, with a prodigious literary output, and asocial life that would make tabloid front pages today: an original dandy, amongother accomplishments he is responsible for the rule of black evening dress formen. Bulwer-Lytton's literary life began with the Byronesque Ismael: An OrientalTale (1820), which set him squarely among the fashionably dark and brooding. Alater novel, Pelham (1828), proved successful, yet a disastrous marriage, ascandalous affair and Lytton's extravagant lifestyle, soon put him beyond thepale. Penniless and ostracized - his aristocratic mother cut off her supportbecause of his outrageous behaviour - Lytton discovered a sympathy with thesocial outcast and outsider; this inspired his successful `Newgate novels', aseries of narratives romanticizing criminals. This feeling for the outsiderwould also have occult repercussions. In the outcast of society, Bulwer-Lytton'sevolutionary intuition saw possibilities not available to the law-abidingcitizen. Such characters, he recognized, may have more potential for spiritualgrowth and experience than the average citizen, safe within the bounds ofmediocrity and routine. This was, of course, a theme that would strike homelater in the century. Decades before Nietzsche first presented the idea,Bulwer-Lytton was suggesting that the higher type, when it arrives, might verywell find itself \"beyond good and evil.\" In The Coming Race, which introducedthe mystic force vril, by now a staple of the `occult Nazis' sub-genre32, Lyttonpresented his readers with an entire civilization of such supermen. With hisfirst meeting with one of these beings, Bulwer-Lytton's hero remarks that \"Ifelt that this man-like image was endowed with forces inimical to man.\" TheVril-ya are \". . . a race akin to man's, but infinitely stronger of form andgrander of aspect, and, inspiring the unutterable feeling of dread. ,33 TheVril-ya live for hundreds of years, and it is possible that Bernard Shaw mayhave had BulwerLytton's `coming race' in mind when he wrote of his `Ancients' inhis creative evolutionist play Back to Methuselah (1924). Certainly one ofBulwer-Lytton's readers who harboured similar suspicions about human evolutionwould prove immensely influential in the history of occultism: Madame HelenaPetrovna Blavatsky.Lytton's interest in the occult started early. At eight, the young Edward foundhimself \"ankle-deep in the great slough of Metaphysics,\" when he was introducedto his grandfather's library. An early acquaintance was the Rev. Chauncey HareTownshend, whose Facts in Mesmerism proved a central influence on Poe. In hisearly twenties, while on a visit to Paris, Lytton went through a kind of psychiccrisis. Retreating from society life, he headed to Versailles for some months,where he spent hours walking or riding alone. In a letter to a friend heexplained that \"I know by experience that those wizard old books are full ofholes and pitfalls. I myself fell into one and remained there forty-five daysand three hours without food, crying for help as loud as I could, but nobodycame.\" This unsettling experience - repeated at different times throughout hiscareer - would later emerge in Bulwer-Lytton's work as the episode of \"TheDweller of the Threshold,\" from Zanoni. It is an encounter with one's \"shadow,\"with all that is corrupt and evil, the dark side of the soul, a necessary trialbefore advancing to the higher stages of initiation. Among the later esotericthinkers to adopt this theme was Rudolf Steiner, who incorporates it into thescheme of spiritual evolution presented in his book Knowledge of the HigherWorlds and its Attainment (1909).Lytton's disturbing rite of passage did not prevent him from becoming anesoteric mover and shaker among the spiritually curious Victorians. As JoscelynGodwin makes clear in his exhaustive study, The Theosophical Enlightenment,Lytton was at the centre of several occult circles, \"the pivotal figure ofnineteenth century occultism.\"\" Among other notables, Lytton entertained therenowned spiritualist Daniel Dunglas Home, who held seances at Knebworth,Lytton's estate. (Robert Browning, less open-minded, vilified Home as thedespicable \"Mr. Sludge, Medium.\") At Gore House, the Kensington home of LadyMarguerite Gardiner, the Countess of Blessington (Albert Hall stands theretoday), Lytton rubbed esoteric elbows with Benjamin Disraeli, Philip Henry, theFourth Earl of Stanhope (friend of Richard Cosway), John Varley and otherluminaries. Among an evening's entertainments were Lytton's and Disraeli'spsychic experiments, and Varley's accounts of the mad poet, William Blake.Although a highly sought after convert, Lytton's refreshingly balanced approachto spiritualism - he believed in the phenomena but rejected the explanation(spirits of the dead) - earned him the respect of other sympathetic but criticalminds, and the contempt of strict devotees. Lytton likewise believed in theefficacy of magical rituals, but denied that spirits or demons were at allinvolved; instead he argued that what was at work was some unknown force,directed by the human will, and which would eventually be understood by science,a theme close to the heart of The Coming Race. Lytton had ample opportunity toinvestigate his theories on at least one occasion. In 1861, with two otherwitnesses, Lytton observed Eliphas Levi, the celebrated `Professor ofTranscendental Magic', raise the shade of Apollonius of Tyana on the roof of thePantheon, a large store on Regent Street. Levi is generally credited with beinga powerful influence on Lytton. But, as Joscelyn Godwin contends, the exactopposite may be true. In which case it is Bulwer-Lytton, and not Levi, as it isusually understood, who was the key figure behind the influential French occultrevival of the late 19th century, a development that led directly to what weknow as occultism today.Whatever the case, it is undoubted that Zanoni is one of, if not the mostimportant occult work of the 19th century. Set against the backdrop of theFrench Revolution and the rise of the Terror, it is a veritable encyclopedia ofoccult science. Lytton provides lengthy disquisitions on Platonism, Pythagorasand the Neoplatonists; Kabbalah, herbalism, and the notion of correspondences;the gnostic hierarchy of planes, the astral world, elementals, secret societies;occult physiognomy, Mesmer, Cagliostro, and Jacques Cazotte. Ostensibly amelodrama along the lines of Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (1820), with acomplex plot and several characters, Zanoni is an initiation allegory, depictingthe responses of its protagonists to the challenges of the spiritual path.Zanoni himself is a kind of cross between the Scarlet Pimpernel and the Comte deSaint Germain, a mysteriously ever-youthful figure, possessing strange powers,who appears when needed and disappears in the blink of an eye. With his mentorMejnour, a dark, somewhat sinister character- an early prototype of the `comingrace' - he is one of the last remaining members of an ancient occultbrotherhood, a society of adepts that predates the historical Rosicrucians bymillennia; Zanoni, we are told, is at least five thousand years old. Tired ofhis eternal life, Zanoni wishes to sacrifice his immortality for the love of awoman, the beautiful Viola. Mejnour, who has jettisoned love in favour of thechill satisfactions of occult power, warns him of his wish. Viola, thoughdesirable, is still only a woman, a mere mortal ignorant of the austererealities of the spirit. Glyndon, a promising artist caught between the commandsof his soul and the attractions of success, compells Zanoni to present him toMejnour as a candidate for initiation. The occult action is still thrilling, andthe philosophical subtext remains powerful. Zanoni recognizes that the truemagician is the artist, and through the novel he remonstrates with Glyndon,urging him to forgo the occult path and to perfect his art. Yet Glyndon, eagerand overconfident, rejects Viola, whom he also loves, and gives himself over toMejnour's charge ... And in the background the repellent Nicot, an opportunisticpainter who sells his services to the highest bidder, plots the downfall of allthat is superior to him: Lytton's take on the bloodthirsty Jacobins. The bookbegins with the narrator meeting Glyndon, now an old man, in the occult bookshopof John Denley in Covent Garden, an actual place, well known in early 19thcentury occult circles. A conversation on Rosicrucianism starts up, and later,after Glyndon's death, the narrator receives a strange manuscript, written in anunknown cipher3S. It is the story of the remarkable Zanoni. Dickens was later toadapt Lytton's plot and its climactic scene for his own Revolutionary work, TheTale of Two Cities.Lytton is one of the few artist-magicians who avoided the pessimism and defeatthat plagued other devotees of the other world. Perhaps his early encounterswith `The Dweller of the Threshold' helped stabilize his personality. Beingbrought up in an aristocratic household must have helped as well, althoughduring his time of scandal, Lytton faced poverty and calumny, so his life wasnot always roses. Unlike Nerval or Hoffmann, there is something verydown-to-earth about Lytton, and his fascination with the occult never becomesobsessive; hence his attempts to understand it scientifically. In some ways hereminds us of Swedenborg, able to fulfil his responsibilities in this world, aswell as in the other. The kernel of Zanoni was with Lytton for many years.Originally based on a dream, it appeared first in a short story \"The Tale ofKosem Kosamin the Magician\" (1832) and saw magazine publication in an incompleteform as Zicci (1838). The question remains of Lytton's own association with theRosicrucians, or any other occult society. Although it has been frequentlyreported that Lytton was a member of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, a kindof precursor to the more well known Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, bothJoscelyn Godwin and Golden Dawn scholar Robert Gilbert argue persuasively thatthis was not the case. That a modern Rosicrucian group would want Lytton iscertain. But like his assessment of the spiritualists, Lytton's own evaluationof the organizations he was aware of is not encouraging. In a letter to HargraveJennings, author of The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Their Mysteries (1870) - abook that tells us more about Jennings' obsession with phallic imagery thanabout the Rosicrucians - Lytton wrote that he possessed the \"cipher sign of `theInitiate',\" but that the current pretenders to Rosicrucianism could notunderstand it. He also added darkly that the Rosicrucian Brotherhood stillexisted, but not under a name recognized by outsiders, which suggests that hedid know it, and hence was not an outsider.There is no record of Lytton joining any Masonic lodges, although it's possiblethat during a stay in Frankfurt he was initiated into the Asiatic Brethren, aMasonic offshoot whose origins go back to the 18th century heyday of secretsocieties, and who were believed to have dissolved after the disastrous end ofthe Illuminati. Yet, in Zanoni itself, and in Lytton's other occult works, thereis nothing that could not be discovered in existing works by a diligent student,and Lytton, we know, was an omnivorous reader. But this shouldn't persuade usthat he was not a true adept. The esoteric message of Zanoni, wrapped within thecloak of Enlightenment occultism, that the true magician is the inspired artist,is an arcane wisdom on a par with any other.ELIPHAS LEVI1875 was a year of occult coincidence or synchronicity, depending on youroutlook. It was the year of Edward Alexander - better known as Aleister -Crowley's birth. It was the year Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and ColonelHenry Steel Olcott formed the Theosophical Society in New York City. And it wasalso the year that saw the death of Alphonse Louis Constant, author ofimpassioned, if ill-argued, socialist tracts and who, in the last years of hislife, became better known to students of the occult arts as Eliphas Levi, theProfessor of Transcendental Magic.Born in 1810 in Paris, Constant's life as a magician was relatively short,beginning with the publication of Dogme de la Haute Magie in 1854. Prior to thathe had earned a living in a number of ways, maintaining a precarious existenceon the periphery of the Parisian literary world. His first incarnation, however,was as a priest. The son of a shoemaker, Constant grew up in humble surroundingsnear the Boulevard Saint Germain, not far from the legendary Cafe Procope, afavourite of Enlightenment luminaries like Denis Diderot. Like many drawn to themystic path, young Alphonse was dreamy and solitary, and his quick mind andnative intelligence impressed the parish priest, who helped to get Alphonse sentto the `little seminary' of Saint Nicolas du Chardonnet, and from there to SaintSulpice. Here he studied for the priesthood until he was eventually relieved ofthe cloth for \"preaching doctrines contrary to the Church.\"Exactly what those doctrines were is unclear, but it is very likely they had todo with sex. Alphonse's doubts about the priesthood came in the form of a younggirl he tutored for her first Holy Communion. The girl's mother begged Constantto instruct her, saying that a man of his kindness couldn't refuse. In thegirl's beautiful blue eyes, he discovered a need for human love. Suddenly thethought of a life of cold renunciation repelled him, and he abandoned thepriesthood just before taking his vows. The Church and its doctrines, however,remained a powerful influence, and in his later books he is at pains to arguethat there is no essential difference between Christian dogma and magical truth.Defrocked and jobless, for a time Constant joined a touring theatrical group. Atalented artist, he provided illustrations for a magazine called Beautiful Womenof Paris and the Provinces, as well as for an edition of Dumas' The Count ofMonte Cristo. Later, his hand would depict less fetching shapes, like the darklypopular image of the Baphomet devil, by now reproduced in hundreds of works onSatanism. But Constant's most public persona was as the writer of fiery, ifunconvincing, socialist tracts, filled with revolutionary rhetoric. WhatConstant may have lacked in dialectics he made up for in conviction; one of hisworks, The Gospel of Liberty (1839), earned him an eight month prison sentence.In the strange history of occult politics, Constant is one of the few occultistswith a left bias.Constant's first experience of occult politics happened through his friendshipwith Alphonse Esquiros, who was for a time one of Gerard de Nerval's literaryacquaintances. Esquiros is forgotten today, but his weird novel The Magician maybe due for a rediscovery: the plot includes a harem of dead courtesans, a bronzeautomaton, and an hermaphrodite who is in love with the moon. Esquiros invitedConstant to visit a strange visionary, an aged prophet named Ganneau, who calledhimself `The Mapah'. Involved in a bizarre messianic royalist intrigue, Ganneauwore a woman's cloak while preaching to his disciples of the creation of theuniverse and the fall of man. White froth gathered around Ganneau's lips, whilehis wife, who sat motionless, claimed to be the reincarnation of MarieAntoinette. Ganneau himself said he was Louis XVII. Originally inclined toscoff, Constant was impressed with the weird scene in the Mapah's squalid attic.Another impressed spectator was a young student named Sobrier who, under theMapah's influence, believed he was \"predestined to save the world by provokingthe supreme crisis of universal revolution.\" A decade later he got a chance totest this theory. Calling for revolution, Sobrier, accompanied by two streetArabs, marched through the streets of Paris, carrying torches, beating time, andgathering a huge crowd. The mob surged through the streets and stopped beforethe Hotel des Capucines. What happened next.is uncertain, but according toLevi's account, in the confusion a shot was fired, and a riot broke out. Therevolution of 1848 had begun.Constant's personal life was unsatisfying and disappointing, and it was thebreakup of his marriage that prompted the transformation into Eliphas Levi. Theassistant headmistress of a school became his lover and bore him an illegitimatechild. But Constant had become infatuated with one of her students; in 1846,Constant abandoned the headmistress and married seventeen year old NoemieCadiot. The union was ill-starred; a daughter died at the age six, and soonafter her death, Noemie deserted the grief-stricken Alphonse. That a split wasimminent may have been obvious. In 1852, a year before Noemie left him, Constantbecame involved with the eccentric Polish emigre Hoene Wronski. A soldier in thePolish and Russian armies, Wronski studied at the Observatory at Marseillesbetween 1803 and 1810, where he developed a fantastically complex theory of theorigin and structure of the universe. Wronksi was a colleague of the majorastronomers and physicists of the day, but his reputation was shredded when hepublished the results of his findings. These were so outlandish that theInstitute of Marseilles forced him to leave; for the rest of his lifeintellectual persecution and calumny dogged him. Nevertheless, Wronksi wascommitted to his vision of a universal and fundamental knowledge, and it wasthis self-belief that ignited the flame of occultism in Constant. Wronski'svision was essentially Pythagorean: that number was the key to the mysteries ofthe universe. Among other pursuits Wronski devoted himself to a perpetual motionmachine, squaring the circle (a solution to which Levi himself would propose),and a `predicting machine' he called the `prognometre'.Wronski called his synthesis of philosophy, science, politics and religionmessianisme, and it was this vision of a unified knowledge that plunged Constantinto the deep waters of the Kabbalah. The result was Dogme de la Haute Magie,translated into English as Transcendental Magic (1896) by A.E. Waite. It waswhile writing this that Constant's wife left him. Constant contributed to aleftist journal, the Revue Progressive, owned by the Marquis Montferrier. TheMarquis became acquainted with the young Noemie and invited her to contribute aswell. Sunk into his kabbalistic studies, Constant was unaware that Noemie hadbecome Montferrier's mistress. By the time he did it was too late. Devastated,Constant endured a terrible initiation. He emerged from his trial a changed man.When the Dogme appeared on the Parisian bookstalls Alphonse Louis Constant wasno more. In his place stood Eliphas Levi, master of the mystic arts.Although Levi's writings are full of portentous references to the secretmysteries of the Talmud, the Zohar and other Hebrew texts, he is by mostaccounts an unreliable guide to the secrets of the Kabbalah, with scant, if any,knowledge of the original tongue. It would be churlish to fault him for adoptingthe Hebrew equivalent of his name, but readers drawn to his works are oftendisappointed with what they find. This is a mistake. One doesn't go to Levi fora scholarly interpretation of notoriously difficult texts. One reads him for thesheer fun and romance of his books. In 1801 Francis Barrett, a student ofoccultism, put together a book on ritual magic called The Magus. Barrett was afriend of the bookseller John Denley, whose Covent Garden bookshop appears inLytton's Zanoni, and according to most accounts, The Magus is made up oftranscriptions of several magical texts Barrett borrowed from Denley. There isno doubt that at least three quarters of The Magus is plagiarized. Theinformation is accurate, if stolen, but Barrett's book did not start an occultrevival because, for all its scholarly apparatus, it is a dull read. Levi isnever dull. His pages may be riddled with howlers, but you want to turn them,and the reader invariably gets value for money. It was Levi's vision of amagical \"doctrine which is everywhere the same and everywhere carefullyconcealed,\" which led Madame Blavatsky, among others, to speak of the existenceof Asiatic supermen, presiding over the fate of mankind from their remoteHimalayan temples: that, and Lytton's notion of a \"coming race.\" Whatever theanthropological and psychological truth about magic, Levi nailed down what theromantic in his readers want magic to be: a mysterious teaching about the otherworld, shared through the centuries by people like themselves, who have hadglimpses of that world and believe in it. Scholars like Gershom Scholem mayproduce books infinitely more reliable for the academic student of the Jewishmystical traditions. But Levi's The History of Magic will keep you up at night,something, at least for me, Scholem has never done.In 1853 Levi packed a bag and headed across the Channel to London. As we'veseen, there, among other English occultists, he met with Bulwer-Lytton. AsLevi's career as a mage had just begun, his reputation can hardly account forthis; it seems that he must have been `networking' with other eso- tericistsprior to his conversion, which implies that a formidable international occultcabal was well established in the mid-19th century. London was to be the sceneof Levi's first major ritual working, his initial attempt to `raise' the spiritof Apollonius of Tyana. The ceremony, commissioned by a mysterious woman inblack, took three weeks to accomplish and is described with great relish inLevi's Rituel de la Haute Magie (1856), later published together with the Dogmein a single volume. The account is like something out of Dennis Wheatley.Apparently, the giant figure that appeared was not quite the gentleman Levi hadbeen expecting; the mage fainted and his right arm was numb for days.After this success, Levi's reputation flourished and other volumes followed,like Le Clef de Grands Mysteres (1861). His renown as the Professor ofTranscendental Magic had spread, and his little flat in the Rue des Sevresbecame a site of pilgrimage. There, devotees of the occult sciences met a rotundman of red complexion, medium height, small piercing eyes, impressive baldcranium, full beard and moustache, invariably wrapped in a monk's robe. Hisrooms were jammed with occult bric-a-brac. An altar covered in sumptuous draperysupported gilt vessels and a Hebrew scroll of the Law; above this hung a goldentriangle with the ineffable Tetragrammaton ('YHVH' the Hebrew name of God)emblazoned on it. Talismans, skulls, magical apparatus and Wronski's `prog-nometre' jostled for space beside a life-size painting of a woman symbolizingthe holy Kabbalah.One visitor to Levi's den was the English occultist Kenneth MacKenzie, a memberof the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia, the group to which Lytton is erroneouslyclaimed to have belonged. During a conversation about the Tarot, MacKenzienoticed a figurine of the Egyptian goddess Isis and remarked on its workmanship.Levi replied that such items were commonplace in Paris, being a very largetobacco jar. Other, perhaps more perceptive students were the Polish noblemen,Alexander Braszynsky and Georges de Mniszech, and another Pole, Dr. Nowakowski,who lived in Berlin. With his Italian student, Baron Nicolas Joseph Spedalieri,Levi carried on an occult correspondence which was eventually published in ninevolumes.Levi's last days were sad. His hopes for France as the saviour of civilizationwere crushed with the Franco-Prussian War. The siege of Paris made lifedifficult, and the commune that followed was not to his liking. In his lastyears Levi had lost most of his revolutionary fervour; with his body wrackedwith headaches, dizzy spells, dropsy and gangrene, he had little time forutopias. At two o'clock in the afternoon of 31 May 1875, the Professor ofTranscendental Magic passed from this sphere into the next. He may not haveknown it, but his work would reach an audience much wider than he could everhave expected. Levi influenced a whole generation dissatisfied with orthodoxreligion and materialist science, eager to recover the lost secrets of agespast. Such mainstream cultural figures as the poets Charles Baudelaire, ArthurRimbaud and Andre Breton and the composers Claude Debussy and Erik Satie weresome of the beneficiaries of the Professor's magical accomplishments. And in the1970s, with his name linked to Aleister Crowley's - who claimed Levi as a pastincarnation - he would be rediscovered by a generation of head-banging heavymetallers who, like myself, read his books with excitement, pleasure and theoccasional grain of salt.CHARLES BAUDELAIRELike Hoffmann, Poe and Nerval, Baudelaire is one of the tragedies of literature.Dead at the age of 46, he produced only a small body of work, and his reputationrests effectively on a single collection of poems, the infamous Les Fleurs dumal (1857). Nevertheless, this seemingly meagre output was perhaps the singlemost influential work written by a poet in the 19th century. To the contemporaryreader, Baudelaire's friend Nerval remains pretty much unknown, and Gautier, towhom he dedicated Les Fleurs du mal, is mostly forgotten, even in his owncountry. Outside of thesis papers, others of the late Romantic milieu in whichBaudelaire moved languish in oblivion. Yet the author of these dark, sensuousand highly mystical poems remains - aptly, as we shall see - a symbol ofdecadence and Satanism and, in recent years, has acquired a second lease on lifeas the character of the `flaneur' or urban wanderer, made popular through thewritings of another tragic figure, the German Jewish literary critic WalterBenjamin. Hoffmann, Poe and Nerval all antedate Baudelaire as poets of the city,but it is Baudelaire who is associated with the aimless strolling and chanceencounters with `found beauty' that, since the surrealists, have informed anoften faddish and trendy taste for urban aesthetics.Charles Baudelaire was born in Paris in 1821. His mother, CarolineArchimbaut-Dufays was twenty-eight; his father, Joseph-Francois Baudelaire,sixty-one. Baudelaire's father was a scholar with a courtly manner; he was alsoa man of strong religious feeling. All three traits would pass to his son, alongwith a less desirable inheritance to which his mother contributed as well.Baudelaire's step-brother, Claude-Alphonse - from his father's previous marriage- died in 1862 from a cerebral haemorrhage that had first left him paralysed.Baudelaire's mother would end her days suffering from aphasia, as would her son.The story of Baudelaire's early death lays the blame on his dissipatedlifestyle, but it is clear fate was probably against him from the beginning.Baudelaire's early years were happy. He grew up in comfortable surroundings, andboth parents loved him deeply. His father instilled in the young boy an interestin Latin and painting. But then, around the age of six, young Charles was thrustout of Paradise. His father died and the following year, 1828, his motherremarried. For a normal family it was a good choice. Colonel Aupick - four yearsolder than Caroline - was handsome, responsible, and destined for success; hewould eventually become commander of the Paris garrison, an ambassador toConstantinople and Madrid, and a senator under the Second Empire. But tosensitive, solitary Charles, it was a misalliance. Although the colonel tried tobe friends with the boy, they had little in common, and early on, Baudelairecast him in the role of the ignorant, yet powerful philistine. Throughout hislife Colonel Aupick would remain an authoritarian figure, a stern Jehovahagainst whom the later Satanist and revolutionary would rail.Baudelaire was sent to college in Lyons, then later to the Lycee Louis-le-Gerardin Paris. Here he excelled in Greek and Latin. After receiving his baccalaureat,it was time for him to choose a career. Colonel Aupick suggested a position as asecretary in an embassy. Charles told him he wanted to be a poet. The flowers ofevil had started to sprout.Although both his mother and Colonel Aupick were against it, Baudelaire threwhimself into what he imagined was a proper environment in which to producepoetry. He read insatiably and he began to frequent prostitutes in the LatinQuarter, from one of whom he more than likely contracted the syphilis that wouldkill him. His appetite for experience understandably worried his family. Hopingto save him they packed him off on a voyage to India, the journey to the eastthat Nerval had just embarked on. Baudelaire jumped ship at Mauritius andreturned to Paris in 1842, more determined than ever to be a poet. He came intohis inheritance and threw himself with gusto into the life of the aesthete anddandy, living lavishly and renting an apartment in the Hotel Pimodan on the IleSaint-Louis, where he occasionally ate hashish with other members of thenotorious Club des Haschichins. It was around this time that Baudelaire met themulatto woman Jeanne Duval, with whom he became infatuated and with whom heenjoyed, if that is the -correct word, a masochistic relationship. Thoughbeautiful and exotic, Jeanne Duval was illiterate, unfaithful, malicious and,for a good part of the time, drunk. It is difficult to see what Baudelaire sawin her, except for the typical Romantic need for an impossible love affair.(Like Novalis and Nerval, Baudelaire became deeply obsessed with unattainablewomen, and remained devoted to his mother throughout his life; she too hadabsolutely no understanding of his genius.) It is also possible that, as onecritic suggests, Baudelaire's early sexual exploits left him impotent, andsomehow Duval could understand and minister to his more voyeuristic tastes.36Two years after receiving his inheritance Baudelaire had run through half of it,a considerable splurge, as the initial sum was 100,000 francs, more than twiceNerval's fortune. Against his protests, Colonel Aupick arranged for a conseiljudiciarie to administer his stepson's finances. Humiliated, henceforthBaudelaire was to live on a small allowance and whatever he could make fromwriting which, like Poe, Nerval and Hoffmann, would never be very much. For therest of his life he was poor. One result of Colonel Aupick's decision was thepoet's failed suicide attempt; another was having his first writings published,a collection of criticism, his Salon of 1845, followed by his second Salon of1846. These established Baudelaire as one of the most perceptive art critics ofthe time. The second Salon also presented an idea that would feature largely inhis later work and, indeed, as the central theme of the Symbolist Movement tocome.Baudelaire had first come across the notion of synesthesia in Hoffmann'sKreisleriana. There Hoffmann remarked that when listening to music he invariablyassociated the different tones and melodies with colours and scents. Likewise,certain perfumes had a strange effect on him: the scent of brown and redmarigolds sent him into a deep reverie, in which he heard a low oboe sound inthe distance. He suggested that all these things - colours, sounds, scents - areaspects of a single reality, a ray of pure light, diffracted by the senses.Baudelaire adopted Hoffmann's idea and applied it to the arts in general, thusinaugurating the age of Symbolism, and preparing the way for Walter Pater'sremark that all art aspires toward the condition of music. Later Baudelairewould also find a similar sensibility in the work of Richard Wagner.Hoffmann's notion also prepared Baudelaire for the two most important influenceson his work: Poe and Swedenborg. Baudelaire had come across Poe's work in 1847and soon became obsessed with it, pestering friends with incessant questionsabout the American poet whose sensibilities so resembled his own. There is astory of Baudelaire hearing about an American writer visiting Paris. He forcedhis way into the man's hotel room, and discovered him trying on a new suit ofclothes. Baudelaire nevertheless harangued him with questions about Poe whichthe writer kindly answered. What Baudelaire recognized in Poe was his mysticism;he saw him as a man obsessed with confronting the mysteries of existence, anotion that Poe himself would have appreciated. Since Poe's death Baudelaire sawhim as a kind of guardian angel, a poetic intercessor on behalf of strugglinghumanity. During his lifetime Baudelaire was best known as a translator of Poe -the first story he translated was \"Mesmeric Revelation\" - and the onlysubstantial amounts of money he made came from this work. Curiously, althoughBaudelaire had ample reason in his own life to adopt the notion, it is in\"Mesmeric Revelation\" that Poe offers suffering as the means of preparingoneself for the world to come.'Poe's search for an ideal beauty and his image as a suffering poet confrontingthe profound ambiguity of existence made Baudelaire receptive to Swedenborg'sideas. It's unclear when or how he first came across them. More than likely itwas through reading Balzac, possibly Seraphita, although it is probable that heread Swedenborg's Heaven and Hell and Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, both ofwhich were available in French translations. The idea of the poet as a visionarywas powerful in Baudelaire (he called Balzac la voyant) and it is after hisencounter with Swedenborg's ideas that a mystical, spiritual atmosphere pervadeshis work. That sensibility is most obvious in what is perhaps Baudelaire's mostfamous and influential poem, \"Correspondances.\"Much has been made of Baudelaire's Satanism, which is really a misnomer and willbe looked at in the next section. But if Baudelaire's supposed aesthetic of evilproduced an embarrassing number of second rate poets maudit, the mystical visionof \"Correspondances\" has been even more influential. Reams have been writtenabout it and it is no exaggeration to say that out of these fourteen lines theaesthetic philosophy of the next half century emerged. Taking Hoffmann's remarksabout synesthesia and Swedenborg's notion of a spiritual world, Baudelaire putsthe poet/artist in the position of a kind of decoder, an expert at decipheringsecret messages. Given Poe's penchant for ciphers and hidden clues, it allbegins to make a great deal of sense: the poet/artist for Baudelaire is likePoe's eccentric detective, C. Auguste Dupin, who, in \"The Purloined Letter\"recognizes what is obscure to the average person and is, quite literally,staring him in the face. Only in this case, what is hidden is not only a stolenletter, but the secret meaning of existence, encoded in the landscape of thenatural world. Everything in this world is a symbol of a corresponding realityin the spiritual world. In Swedenborg, this arrangement is often presented in adry, matter of fact manner, a fixed one-to-one relation between natural`signifier' and spiritual `signified'. But Baudelaire loosens this arrangement,and opens the interpretations to a degree of creative ambiguity. Symbolismemerges as an art of nuance, allusion, metaphor, mood. The direct statement iseschewed in favour of suggestion, the general sense that the artist and poet isalways gesturing to a world of wider, deeper significance, much like dreams. Butalso like dreams, the attempt to capture the meaning directly often destroys it.Hence the hazy, shifting, ambivalent, twilight atmosphere of Symbolist art: anatmosphere having much in common with the hypnagogic states that gave birth toit.Baudelaire argued that the poet must become receptive to the meanings passing tohim through the medium of the external world (which also means that he mustbecome a good critic). And as we can never know when or where the spirit willspeak, there must then be no restrictions on experience. This, as much as anyneed to shock the bourgeoisie, accounts for Baudelaire's capacity to find beautyin things that the average person would abhor. This opens the door to decadence,to a sensibility that will respond only to a beauty that carries the seed ofcorruption: a sensibility that clearly becomes dominant as the centuryprogresses. That Baudelaire knew about corruption goes without saying. Oneexample is his hideously beautiful poem \"A Carcass,\" in which the poetreminisces with his lover about a corpse they came across on a morning walk.\"Her legs,\" he writes, \"were spread out like a lecherous whore/Sweating outpoisonous fumes/Who opened in slick invitational style/her stinking andfestering womb.\"No wonder when the book was published in 1857 it was immediately taken from thebookstalls and its author tried for obscenity. Baudelaire never recovered fromthe public outrage, although he continued to write, producing minor classicslike his essay on drugs and poetry, Les Paradis Artiiciels (1860), which, in atranslation by Aleister Crowley, became something of an underground success inthe 1960s. But his own health was failing, and his reputation as a decadentpreceded him everywhere: it was not until 1949 that the obscenity conviction wasfinally overturned. A lecture tour of Belgium in 1864 proved a disaster, and in1866 he suffered a series of strokes which left him paralysed and aphasic. Acollection of prose poems later published as Paris Spleen were his finalefforts. The syphilis contracted as an aspirant poet had entered its finalphase, and after lingering in squalour in Belgium for a time, he was broughtback to Paris where on 31 August 1867 he died.VILLIERS DE I'ISLE-ADAMThe name jean Marie Mathias Philippe Auguste Villiers de 1'Isle-Adam is not, Isuspect, one on everybody's lips, and even for students of the occult and thebizarre it is still not encountered very much these days. Villiers del'Isle-Adam is perhaps the most poignant embodiment, if we can use so robust aterm for so ethereal a character, of the Symbolist ethic that came to dominatethe aesthetic and philosophical consciousness of Europe in the last years of the19th century. Barely known in his native France until the end of his life,Villiers is remembered today, if at all, for being the author of the archetypalSymbolist drama Axel in which, within a dense forest of occult verbiage andworld-renouncing metaphor, there emerges one of the great one-liners of alltime. When, just before downing the poison that will consummate for eternitytheir spiritual love, the beautiful Sara suggests to the ennui riddenRosicrucian aesthete Axel, that they share at least one night of passion, Axelrejects the idea with disdain. \"0 Sara,\" he cries. \"Tomorrow I would be prisonerof your splendid body. Its delights would have fettered the chaste energyimpelling me at this instant. But ... suppose our transports should die away,suppose some accursed hour would strike when our love, paling, would be consumedby its own flames ... Oh! let's not wait for that sad hour ...\" Sara, not yetentirely convinced that suicide is their best option, and symbol of the fertilebut futile vitality that Axel is determined to renounce, compresses her pleainto a single cry: \"Come, live!\"\"Life?\" asks Axel. \"No.- Our existence is already full and its cup runneth over!What hourglass could measure the hours of this night? The future? ... we haveexhausted it ... As for living? Our servants will do that for us.Expecting his servants to do his living for him is an apt sentiment for acharacter like Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. For one thing, it was something he wasdetermined not to do for himself, for another, Villiers came from anaristocratic family who could look back on at least eight centuries of unbrokennobility- which means, one imagines, quite a few servants. Among hisdistinguished ancestors was jean de Villiers de l'Isle-Adam (1384-1437), Marshalof France; PhillipeAuguste de Villiers de l'Isle-Adam (1464-1534), founder ofthe Order of the Knights of Malta; and Pierre de Villiers de l'Isle-Adam (?),Grand Standard-Bearer of France in the battle of Roosebeke in 1382. Villiersnever forgot the noble line of his descent, which was to him a source both ofgreat pride and considerable inconvenience. Pride in that he could fall back onit when facing a world that invariably proved unwieldy, if not hostile;inconvenient in that it was precisely this aristocratic inheritance thatprevented him from rolling up his sleeves and getting down to work when facedwith an obstacle. For Mallarme, along with Baudelaire and Wagner one ofVilliers' close friends, he was \"The man who never was, save in his dreams.\" ForArthur Symons, who introduced the English speaking world to Villiers in hisclassic book The Symbolist Movement in Literature (1899), he was \"The DonQuixote of Idealism.\" For the philosopher Nicolas Berdyaev, Villiers was one ofa group of late 19th century writers who \"hated the bourgeois world ... with aholy hatred. .. . adapted to nothing: their whole lives were spent in poverty,failure and lack of recognition. \"M Even more than Baudelaire or Nerval,Villiers was a man who, while having the unmanifest light of the Ideal in hissight, was constitutionally unable to come to grips with the world. And evenmore than Baudelaire and Nerval, he sank into an increasingly patheticdestitution, a life of such minimal physical comfort that, were he an orthodoxmember of the Catholic Church he so fervently accepted, he would by now havepossibly been canonized.Villiers de l'Isle-Adam was born in 1838 into a family whose noble ancestry madeit a target for the Revolution. Living in very reduced circumstances, theirfinancial destiny was made even more precarious by the impracticable andinvariably failed dreams of success entertained by Villiers' father, whosystematically threw away what little savings and property they retained in aseries of absurd get-rich-quick schemes. One fantasy, however, was shared by theentire family: the notion that young Mathias - as Villiers was known to thefamily - was destined to restore the family honour by becoming a famous writer,and its coffers, by marrying a rich heiress. Villiers did try to make good theseexpectations: the first by writing some of the most remarkable works of the late19th century; the second by proposing to a wealthy young English woman. Reportsare that the lady, introduced to Villiers by a friend with whom he had enteredinto a contract to provide him with a wife worth at least three million francs,was so terrified of the poet's passion and lengthy recitations that she escapedfrom their assignation in Covent Garden as quickly as possible. Disappointment,recriminations, and the return of the clothes Villiers had borrowed for theaffair followed. Some sense of lost riches from ages long ago is always in thebackground of Villiers work; the interest in actual riches is evident, but likethe hero of Potocki's Saragossa Manuscript, the allusion to alchemical gold(i.e., esoteric wisdom) is not to be discounted.The three million franc wife is just one of several incidents that put Villiers'eccentricities in the same rank as Nerval's lobster. Others were his candidacyto fill the vacant throne of Greece in 1863; his frequent disappearances andequally bizarre re-appearances in Paris after several weeks absence; the reportsof his occult retreats in the Abbey of Solesme; his penchant for adorning hisill-fitting and threadbare clothes with an assortment of ostentatious heraldicdecorations; his need to borrow suitable dress for the aristocratic evenings hewas invited to, while at the same time he was not far from starving; the duel henearly fought when a second rate writer vilified his name in a cheap melodrama.For the first thirty years of his life, Villiers lived in relative comfort,oscillating between the world of high society and the bohemian underground, anaristocrat among the poets, and vice versa. Landing in Paris in his earlytwenties, his aunt financed the publication of his Premieres Poesies in 1859.Published to hardly any notice, Villiers had at least introduced himself to theParisian literary scene, a milieu he was to occupy for the rest of his life. Hemade friends, Baudelaire as mentioned, and also Catulle Mendes and Jean Marras.By the 1860s, he was recognized by litterateurs like Gautier, Leconte de Lisle,Theodore Banville, Flaubert, Mallarme and others; by all he was considered anexceptional character and a writer of genius although for the public at large hewas a nonentity. In 1862 he published the first volume of his philosophicalromance Isis, also known as Wilhelm de Strally and Prolegomenes. Like so many ofhis other works, this was never completed; like Coleridge and De Quincey,Villiers had the raconteur's habit of talking a good book in cafes, and laterfeeling too bored with the idea to set it to paper. Others who listened oftendid, to their profit and Villiers loss. (He was, by all reports, a considerableshowman, his satiric recitations featuring the character of Tribulat Bonhometgenerally bringing the house down.)By this time Villiers had become obsessed with the melange of Catholicism,Hegelianism and the occult that would constitute his literary and philosophicalworld. He read Balzac's mystical novels, was a sometime disciple of EliphasLevi, and his friendship with Baudelaire introduced him to notions of Satanismand the hermetic theme of correspondences. Hegel, however, may seem an oddbedfellow for these mystic influences, until we recall that one of the mostpowerful, if little known inspirations for Hegel's dialectic were the writingsof Jacob Boehme. But more than any specific idea - and the breadth of Villiers'reading often exceeded his grasp - what Villiers drew from these sources was ageneral spirit of profound idealism, a rejection of bourgeois materialism, ofprogress, science and common sense: even of physical embodiment. As histranslator Robert Martin Adams remarks, Villiers could \"walk down a publicthoroughfare like a man from another planet.\"\" He was a creature from \"anothersphere,\" an angel fallen to earth. \"Go beyond,\" was the family motto, andVilliers took this to heart. As he wrote in Axel, he lived \"out of politeness\";it was only his good manners and aristocratic upbringing that forced him toremain in this realm at all.A look at Villiers' life suggests that such noblese oblige provided him with themost tenuous of footings. By the 1870s, the financial support of his aunt wasexhausted, and Villiers embarked on a journey to the underworld unprecedented,even by the standards of Baudelaire or Nerval. For the next twenty years he wasgenerally cold for lack of clothes, hungry for lack of food, and sleepless forlack of a room. He salvaged what he could from rubbish bins, and begged forsecond hand rags. He took whatever demeaning jobs he could find, but only as alast resort. For sixty francs a month he was a sparring partner at a gym,basically getting knocked around to earn his pittance. He worked with a snakeoil merchant, posing as a cripple until swallowing the quack remedy. One winterhe slept at a construction site, waking one morning to the watchman's bootgrinding in his face. It is said that he wrote his occult science fiction novelTomorrow's Eve (which features Thomas Edison as a kind of Rosicrucian inventorof an artificial woman) on the bare floor of a squalid room; whatever furniturehe had went to the pawnshop. His frequent disappearances were a sign that thingshad got even worse than this. The aristocrat in him refused to allow others tosee his most pitiful degradations. After his death from cancer and generalneglect in 1889, when his friend Mallarme was asked about Villiers' life, hereplied: \"His life - I search for anything that corresponds to that expression:truly and in the ordinary sense, did he live?\"It wasn't until 1883, with the publication of Contes cruels, that Villiers beganto receive anything like the recognition he deserved. He had been writing formore than twenty years, but his noble soul refused to have anything to do withambition and success, unless it was the ambition of genius and the success ofgreat art. Unlike others, he would not, or perhaps could not, adapt himself tothe requirements of a market. Like Poe, whose own bizarre stories were one ofVilliers' models, perfection and beauty were his standards. The contrast betweenhis goals and the milieu of their expression could not be greater: most ofVilliers' `cruel tales' were written on dirty scraps of paper stained with thewine or absinthe of the cafes he inhabited. The tales were Villiers' firstpublic success, and they consolidated his reputation as a high priest ofSymbolism, too late, however, to do him much good. Throughout the collection,Villiers attacked the reigning scientific positivism and bourgeois obsessionwith progress, declaring his belief in an assortment of magical ideas:reincarnation, spiritualism, precognition. As.his biographer A.W. Raitt remarks,Villiers was \"fascinated by the intervention in human affairs of mysterious,otherworldly forces, the existence of which in his work is a constant challengeto the assumptions of materialism ...\"4\"NOTESI J.L.

He andConstant were also briefly members of Blanqui's political organization, theSociete Repub- licaine Central. In 1845, a decade before becoming a magician,Constant published a book entitled Le Livre des Larmes, an essay on the value ofsuffering as a moral force which we can assume Baudelaire was aware of.Curiously, Constant had also written and published a poem entitledCorrespondances in the following year.38 Nicolas Berdyaev The Meaning of the Creative Act (New York: Collier Books,1962) p. 223.39 Robert Martin Adams Introduction to Tomorrow's Eve, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam(Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1982) p. x.40 A.W.

By definition Satanism anda Satanist require the existence of Satan, and although there are references toSatan in the Old Testament, most notably in the Book of job, it wasn't untilChristianity had established itself in late antiquity that the idea of a beingdedicated to evil, whose task it was to lead human beings to perdition, became afixture of western consciousness.There were earlier embodiments of a dark principle. Ahriman, in Zoroastrianismthe enemy of Ahura Mazda, is a kind of prototype Devil, and in the 20th century,the esotericist Rudolf Steiner was to call one of the \"supersensible\" beings whoimpede human spiritual evolution by that name. But Ahriman is more of a cosmicor ontological principle, the `yin' to Ahura Mazda's `yang', than what we wouldconsider a prince of darkness. In the early years of Christianity the Gnostics,whose teachings would be incorporated with the hermetic writings to form thebasic foundation of occult ideas, spoke of a \"demiurge,\" a kind of blind, idiotgod who created the earth and rules over it. Hence the need to escape frommaterial reality. For the Gnostics, as for William Blake, this demiurge wasassociated with the Jehovah of the Bible (Blake calls him Nobodaddy). This gaverise to a tradition of `reversal' in which some biblical villains, like theSerpent, Cain, and Simon Magus, are seen as Gnostic heroes, a tradition thatBlake himself participated in, as well as more recent writers like the novelistHermann Hesse, whose Demian is full of Gnostic re-readings of biblical tales.As mentioned, Satan is a central character in the Book of Job, but there he isnot depicted as the embodiment of all that is evil. He is, rather, a kind ofprosecuting attorney, sent by God to test his people. Satan in Hebrew means\"adversary,\" and in the Book of Job, Satan has God's mandate to try the beliefof his followers. Devil in the New Testament comes from diabolos, Greek for\"slanderer\" or \"accuser\". By Christian times, Satan's position has changed; heno longer ferrets out the weak of faith and has become something more like theDevil we know. Perhaps his most spectacular appearance is during Jesus' fortydays in the desert, where he tempts Christ by offering him dominion over theworld, or tries to trick him into proving his divinity by using his magicalpowers.In Christian mythology the story of the Devil's origin is that he was one ofGod's angels, Lucifer (light-bearer), who, through pride, fell from heaven andtook up residence in hell. After the Second Coming, he will be released onceagain for a brief time, only to be bound once more by Christ and thrown intodarkness for another millennia. Satan has, of course, other names: Beelzebub,\"Lord of the Flies\", for example, a title given him because of the buzzing soundmade by his demons. But Lucifer is the most enduring and it is the one thatembodies the satanic aspect that has got the most literary mileage. It wasMilton's Paradise Lost, which featured a Satan who would rather reign in hellthan serve in heaven, that gave rise to our notions of satanic hubris and`Luciferic pride'.' It is this element in the satanic character that wouldattract many devotees during the Romantic period.Satanism proper got its start in the 17th century, although Catholic apologistswould argue that earlier heretical sects like the Gnostics, Manichees, Bogomils,Albigensians and Cathars were in league with the Devil. The tales of depravityand demonic worship associated with these groups must, however, be taken withseveral grains of salt, as it is clear the Church fathers writing about themwere less than unbiased. The beliefs of the Cathars and Albigensians, ruthlesslyexterminated by the Church, had less to do with satanic worship than withrefusing to acknowledge the papal throne as the sole arbiter of spiritual truth.The first thing a conquering religion does is make devils of the gods it hasreplaced, and in the case of the Cathars and other radical Christian sects, thisis exactly what the Catholic Church did. Bogomil means \"God lover\" and Catharmeans \"pure;\" what was demonic about these groups is that they practised adualistic Christianity based more on actual Gospel teaching than the poweroriented ideology of the Church.According to the occult historian Francis King, Satanism as we know it has itsroots in the belief in the magical efficacy of the Catholic Mass.' The doctrineof the Real Presence of Christ in the sacramental offerings was widespread by700 AD; this led to the belief that any priest, whatever his character, simplyby virtue of his being a priest, could, through the ritual of the Mass,transform the communion bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. Thatthis is a variation on magical spells and incantations is clear: the Massitself, through its magical words, and the priest, through his initiation, hadpower, and it was only a matter of time before it was abused. Priests of weakvirtue were quite prepared to perform Masses for various purposes in return formaterial gifts. The `Black Mass', a mainstay of satanic occultism, wasoriginally another name for a Requiem Mass, given in aid of the souls inPurgatory. By the 7th century, the Council of Toledo had to ban their use as amagical means of murder. Masses could be said for other purposes as well, and itwas not long before a kind of underground magical literature grew up around thepractice. One such text was the Grimoire of Hono- rius, a handbook of magicalrituals, which included among its occult preparations the saying of Mass. TheProtestant Revolution, born of Luther's grievances against ecclesiastical abuse,was basically a rejection of the Church's position as an hierarchical initiatorysociety, possessing a magical, and frequently profitable, intimacy with God.From employing the Mass for magical purposes to petitioning and worshipping theDevil himself marks the transition from spiritual abuse to actual Satanism. Thefirst documented and most well known case of this took place in Paris in thelate 1670s. There were, of course, earlier incidences of what we would callsatanic evil: one thinks of Vlad the Impaler and Marshal Gilles de Rais, whoseexploits will form a central part of perhaps the most well known satanic novel,J.K. Huysmans' Ld Bas. But although both of these characters embodied a demonicsadism, and were what we would undoubtedly consider evil, in the late 17thcentury, all the elements of satanic worship came together in a powerful andinfluential mixture.In her book The Affair of the Poisons, Frances Mossiker tells the bizarre storyof a satanic ring responsible for murder, infanticide, weird sex and theattempted assassination of Louis XIV. In 1678, Nicolas de la Reynie, PoliceCommissioner of Paris, uncovered the existence of a widespread satanic cult,centred around a fortune-teller named Catherine Deshayes, also known as LaVoisin, whose circle included several priests and whose most notable devotee wasMadame de Montespan, mistress of Louis XIV. La Voisin admitted to concoctingnoxious potions for wives eager to be rid of their husbands, as well as to beingthe most industrious abortionist of her time: Francis King reports that theashes of some 2,000 infants were found buried in her garden. But this was notthe extent of her enormity. In order to remain in the king's favour and to spoilthe hopes of any rival, Madame de Montespan engaged La Voisin and heraccomplice, the Abbe Guibourg, known to have murdered dozens of children, toperform Black Masses. These were not merely Requiems used for evil purposes, butfull blown satanic affairs which included child sacrifice, a naked woman as analtar, and offerings to demons like Asmodeus and Ashtaroth. The child's entrailsand blood would be secretly mixed into Louis' dinner that evening. Masses likethese had been performed for several years, the first taking place in 1673, buteventually Louis lost interest in his satanic concubine and, one would hope, hisdiet. Love turned to hate, and Madame de Montespan plotted the king's death. Theplot failed, and when La Reynie made his swoop, some 360 people were arrested.It was this sort of thing that appealed to the fin de siecle taste for what wemight call satanic decadence. But by the late 19th century, the fascination withevil as a means of stimulating a flagging consciousness was widespread.Essential to the Black Mass is a meticulous \"revaluation of values,\" in whichthe sacramental elements are reversed: the most obvious emblem of this is thecross turned upside down.' Sex, urine, and ordure were included in the ritualsas well. Silly, but in their heyday they were the height, or depth, ofdepravity.Yet along with the idea of Satan as the archetypal rebel or fount of forbiddenpleasure, among some writers in the late 19th century, a different picture ofthe Devil arose. In The Brothers Karamazov Fyodor Dostoyevsky presented theDevil as a rather shabby, down at heel customer, a seedy petit bourgeois whowears checked trousers and has just had himself vaccinated for smallpox.Dostoyevsky knew that the image of the Devil as a kind of superman, beyond goodand evil, gave a dangerous carte blanche to a generation of anarchists andatheists convinced that \"nothing is true\" and \"everything permitted.\" Hisinfluence, however, has been minimal, and a new generation of satanic rebels -comprised today mainly of heavy metal headbangers - finds it all too easy tohave some sympathy for the Devil.CHARLES BAUDELAIRE IIBaudelaire's Satanism was touched on earlier. Like all young Romantics, early inhis career Baudelaire espoused what we could call a satanic, or certainly adecadent philosophy of life. Along with Gerard de Nerval and Villiers del'Isle-Adam, Baudelaire indulged in several eccentricities. Among other thingshe died his hair green more than a century before any punk thought of it. AsEnid Starkie recounts in her biography, as a young aspiring dandy, Baudelairethrew himself into the flamboyant lifestyle expected of fledgling poets. Hisfather's inheritance allowed him a considerable latitude. As mentioned, hefurnished his rooms lavishly and frequently changed the decor, selling furnitureand pictures he had tired of at a discount well before paying for them, thenpurchasing new ones, and thus acquiring some of the life-long debts that wouldcrush him. He papered his rooms in red and black and hung curtains of heavydamask. His library consisted of rare volumes of French, Renaissance and Latinpoets. Hidden cupboards contained an impressive collection of liqueurs.Delacroix adorned the walls, thick carpets muffled the urban cacophony, andvoluptuous perfumes filled the air. This atmosphere of sensuous and aestheticrefinement would be codified years later in Huysmans' influential novel ARebours.While he could afford it, Baudelaire's own appearance rivalled that of hisrooms. He was often seen in a black velvet tunic, gold belt, skin-tighttrousers, patent-leather shoes, white silk socks, a white linen blouse opened atthe neck to reveal a scarlet tie, the whole ensemble accentuated by his palepink gloves. On nights when the Club des Haschichins met, Baudelaire and hisfriends sat noisily around his elegant walnut table, waving daggers and swords,stoned out of their minds. His neighbours would sometimes complain, andBaudelaire would excuse himself for the noise and explain that he had only beendragging his mistress around the floor by her hair. In the cafes he would epaterle boheme by remarking that he was the son of an unfrocked priest, or regalethem with stories of how he murdered his father. On one occasion he complainedof an evening meal that the cheese had a faint odour of child's brains. ThatBaudelaire relished these antics is clear, and he made a point of ratcheting uphis demonic reputation by speaking of his erotic need for freaks, or bydemanding of one respectable madame that she allow him to hang her from hisceiling, bite her succulent white flesh and make love to her. To Baudelaire'sregret, the lady declined.'Baudelaire's behaviour wasn't anything new, the Bouzingos of an earliergeneration - Nerval, Petrus Borel, Theophile Dondey - had already dotted most ofthese i's and crossed nearly all the t's. But unlike many of the Romantic wildboys, Baudelaire's sensibilities matured, and through \"implacable life\" helearned to appreciate more man's satanic weakness and less his adolescentrebellion. Although he is considered a high priest of modernity, throughout hislater years Baudelaire maintained a belief that we consider positively medieval:the actual existence of the Devil. Baudelaire's choice of themes - corpses,prostitutes, drunkenness, disease: in general, evil - lead a superficial readerto believe he revelled in these things. The truth is that Baudelaire is an oldfashioned moralist, and he was reviled by his contemporaries less for hisembrace of the dark side than for his unflagging insistence that we face theseelements in ourselves. Although the reports of his deathbed conversion, likethose of Rimbaud, are unconvincing at best, Baudelaire clearly did believe inOriginal Sin. Man is a fallen creature, and it is the task of the poet to remindhim of his lost heritage. Yet it is clear that the Symbolist aesthetic, the ideathat the external world is a mere cipher, leads almost naturally to an embraceof the rejected and repressed, to that which the healthy, plodding, insensitivemind casts aside as worthless. Hence Baudelaire's discovery of beauty in thesick, decrepit and ugly which, clearly, is another form of reversal.ARTHUR RIMBAUDWhen Baudelaire died, it was as a critic and translator that he was known, if atall. Even his closest friends, like Theodore de Banville, remarked at hisfuneral on his importance as a man of letters: an appreciation of hissignificance as a poet was left to the future. That significance was uncoveredby a new generation of Symbolists, by Paul Verlaine and by a poet who is perhapsthe most well known and imitated embodiment of satanic revolt, Arthur Rimbaud.Baudelaire, it is true, showed the way, but where he picked a few flowers ofevil, Rimbaud spent an entire season in hell.The legends surrounding Rimbaud are, as is often the case, better known than hiswork, and the most well known of these is the fact that he abandoned poetry andFrance at the age of nineteen and embarked on his own journey to the East. Or,more accurately, Africa, where he spent a decade trading in coffee and guns (itis also rumoured hashish), and amassing a considerable fortune. In 1891, at theage of thirty-six, he developed a tumour on his knee, and on his return toFrance, in Marseilles his right leg had to be amputated. The next months werespent in agony, cancer was diagnosed (but it may have been syphilis) and on 10November 1891, Rimbaud, who had just turned thirty-seven, died. Not, however,before returning to the Church after a dramatic deathbed confession, or so hissister Isabelle claimed.Other legends involve his tumultuous relationship with Paul Verlaine. The twosodomized, took drugs, drank heavily, wrote poetry, scandalized their peers,and, like any couple, had some vicious, nasty fights. During one of theseVerlaine famously shot Rimbaud in the wrist, and spent some time in prison forit. These were the years of Rimbaud as the uncontrollable roaring boy,foul-mouthed, drunk on absinthe, dirty and dressed in rags, with his trademarkpipe perched upside-down in his sneering lips. If this hooliganism was allRimbaud accomplished, there would be little reason to remember him today. But heis responsible for taking the idea of the poet as a visionary, a seer, topreviously unscaled heights and, perhaps even more so, hitherto unplumbeddepths.It is true that Isidore Ducasse, who wrote under the name Comte de Lautreamont,anticipated some of Rimbaud's discoveries and that his writing also displays adecided satanic character. Lautreamont's main work, Chants de Maldoror, is fullof demonic energy, and reeks of sadism, perversity and dark, diabolical urges.Infanticide and cruel humiliating sex feature heavily, and although Ducasse diedunknown at 24, when his work was re-discovered it understandably became acentral inspiration for the Surrealists. But little is known of Lautreamont'slife and it is unclear how much, if at all, he dabbled in the occult. This isnot true of Rimbaud. Like Baudelaire and Nerval, with whom he has much incommon, Rimbaud was a reader of works on mysticism, magic and alchemy. Hailed asa founding father of modernism, Rimbaud's poetic theories, which were to have aprofound influence on 20th century literature, are rooted in his deep immersionin the popular occult writing of his time.Rimbaud was born in Charleville, in the Ardennes region of northeastern France,in 1854. His father, an army captain, abandoned his family when Rimbaud wasstill a boy, and Arthur was raised by his stern, bigoted mother, a womanseemingly bereft of any conception of poetry. For a brilliant, sensitive andstrong willed child, it was a classic formula for rebellion, but young Arthur, achild prodigy, was well behaved, a model pupil who astonished his teachers.Rimbaud read voraciously, and had a clear talent for Latin, winning first prizein a competition. Yet poetry became an early obsession, and at sixteen Rimbaudwas writing brilliant pastiches of the Parnassians. His facility quickly led tocriticism, and Rimbaud's poetry began to speak increasingly of a blasphemousrevolt against the suffocating world of Charleville and the repressive embraceof his mother. Rimbaud ran away from home on more than one occasion, once toParis to throw in his lot with the Commune of 1871. During this episode it'sbelieved he had some shattering homosexual experience - possibly raped bysoldiers - and it's after this that his rebellion became total. Along withdrunkenness, unruliness, filth, violence and a taste for scatologicalexpression, part of Rimbaud's revolt included a study of the occult.Rimbaud was introduced to the occult by Charles Bretagne, a drinking companionfrom the cafes and bars of Charleville, where Rimbaud spent most of his timecaging drinks and being more or less blasphemous. Bretagne was a customsofficial, amateur fiddler and draughtsman, who was also an habitual student ofthe Kabbalah.s Like Rimbaud, Bretagne was known for his outrageous opinions andbehaviour. As Enid Starkie remarks, in the Middle Ages, Bretagne would probablyhave been burnt at the stake as a sorcerer.6 He encouraged Rimbaud's rebellion,arguing that vice was a means to enlarge the spirit, a belief shared by theancient Gnostics. He also lent Rimbaud books on magic, alchemy and the Kabbalah.Given what was available in Charleville at the time, it's more than likely thatwhat Rimbaud read were many of the works discussed here. Rimbaud himself did notrecord what he read, but it is reasonable to assume that his list consisted ofwriters like Balzac, Baudelaire, Nerval, Saint-Martin, Cazotte, Hoene Wronskiand Eliphas Levi. From Baudelaire alone Rimbaud would have absorbed the basicSwedenborgian idea of a higher spiritual world with which the physical worldshares correspondences. That in itself would have been sufficient material forhis own magical theory of poetry as `vision'.Rimbaud's The'orie du Voyant was first set forth in two letters, written in May1871, not long after his return from his catastrophic visit to Paris. Writing tohis teacher George Izambard and a fellow poet, Paul Demeney, Rimbaud voiced hismuch repeated dictum that, \"One must, I say, be a visionary, make oneself avisionary.\" The path to this, Rimbaud argued, led \"through a long, prodigiousand rational disordering of all the senses.\" The poet must face \"ineffabletorture;\" he must possess \"superhuman strength,\" be \"the great criminal, thegreat sickman, the accursed and the supreme Savant!\" And the goal of all hissuffering is: \"the unknown.\" Rimbaud's `disordering of the senses' would becomestandard for practically all aspiring poets to come, from the Symbolists to thePunks.Rimbaud may have picked up the idea of the poet as visionary from Eliphas Levi.In Les Clefs des Grands Mysteres - a work later translated as The Keys of theMysteries by Aleister Crowley - Levi wrote that the poets of the future arecalled on to \"rewrite the divine comedy\" according to the mathematics of God.This is a reference to the Pythagorean ideas of Levi's mentor Wronksi. The poetwho accomplishes this, Levi claimed, would become co-creator with the deity.That poetry, language, was a means of achieving this is a fundamental belief ofmagic: according to the Kabbalah, if the secret name of God, the Tetragammaton,were spoken, the universe would be destroyed. Rimbaud believed such destructionwas necessary before the new creation could begin. Hence his \"rationaldisordering of all the senses.\"Rimbaud's link between poetry and occultism is clear from the title of thecollection of prose poems that embodies his Theorie du Voyant: Illuminations.Although there's a slight possibility the title is not Rimbaud's, his study ofvarious occult illuminati, as well as the clear occult source for his Theorie duVoyant suggest otherwise. In any event, it is clear that in these works, Rimbaudis taking language into new, unexplored regions, into what he called \"theunknown.\" Hence the difficulty many readers find on first encountering the work.Perhaps a less ambiguous expression of Rimbaud's occult poetics is in the poemVoyelles, \"Vowels.\" Here Rimbaud expanded on Baudelaire's synesthesia, linkingthe vowels to particular colours: A black, E white, I red, U green, 0 blue, thuscodifying the unity of sensation central to Symbolism. But as Enid Starkieargues, there is good reason to believe that Rimbaud based his alphabet on thesequence of colours associated with the alchemical process.'Although Rimbaud was never a Satanist in the proper sense, he did recognize inthe Devil the rebel par excellence. In the historian Jules Michel's writing onwitchcraft, he would have found good arguments for seeing in Satan a figure ofintelligence, creativity and will, whose worship the Church repressed in theMiddle Ages. In Michelet's view, Satan is more a Prometheus figure, with echoesof Hermes Trismegistus, than a prince of darkness. Rimbaud, eager to cast offall inhibitions, would have found much encouragement in Michelet's argument.Yet, after only two years of his \"rational disordering of the senses,\" Rimbaudfound himself at a dead end. The result was a merciless account taking,culminating in his harrowing A Season in Hell and the abandonment of poetry.In his letter to George Izambard, Rimbaud wrote: \"I is another.\" He repeated thephrase in his letter to Paul Demeny, adding that \"The first study for a man whowants to be a poet is the knowledge of himself, entire.\" \"He searches his soul,he inspects it, he tests it, he learns it.\" In order to do this, however, acertain distortion of the usual self must be accomplished. \". . . the soul hasto be made monstrous,\" he told Demeny. \"Imagine a man planting and cultivatingwarts on his face.\"This warts and all plunge into self-analysis left Rimbaud revolted by his ownrevolt, and full of revulsion for his rebellion. A Season in Hell is Rimbaud'sunflinching account of his alchemical descent into his own underworld, afragmentation of his psyche into its disparate elements, the dissolutio in thefirst stage of the Great Work. After this, Rimbaud abandoned poetry, hishomeland, and himself. \"I\" had become \"another\".8J.K. HUYSMANSIf one book can claim to be a bible of decadence it has to be Huysmans' ARebours. Translated as \"Against Nature\" or \"Against the Grain,\" neitherrendering really captures the essence of Huysmans title: as one literary criticsuggests, \"Up the Arsehole\" is a more accurate and graphic attempt.9 In thecharacter of des Esseintes, Huysmans took Baudelaire's brief fling as a dandyand combined it with the aesthetic predilections of other eccentrics - Ludwig IIof Bavaria, Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly, Edmond de Goncourt and, most famously,Robert, Comte de Montesquiou-Fezensac\"' - and created an archetype ofaristocratic world-rejection. In the \"refined Thebaid\" at Fontenay-aux-Roses,des Esseintes, a neurasthenic, oversensitive, weak and world-weary aesthete,shuts out the boring realities of everyday life and reconstructs his universeaccording to his over refined tastes. A jewelencrusted tortoise, voluptuousperfumes, exotic plants, an `organ of liqueurs' on which he performs oralconcertos, a library of Latin decadent writers bound in rare Moroccan leather -Huysmans' DIY book on extravagant selfexpression became the blueprint of the finde siecle. Arthur Symons famously called it \"the breviary of the Decadence,\" andmost readers know that it is the notorious \"yellow backed book\" that sent DorianGray on his exquisite road to perdition.Yet, if not entirely accurate, \"Against Nature\" certainly expresses the basicphilosophy of Huysmans and his Symbolist peers. From Swedenborg's belief thatthe external world is a symbol of a higher, spiritual one, we arrive at acomplete rejection of Nature and the natural, and an enervating search forsomething else. In A Rebours that possible something else takes many forms: aglass case displaying silk stockings, a dining room fitted out like a ship'scabin, even the taste of moldy food found in the gutter. As may be expected, desEsseintes' attempts prove unsuccessful, and his need to escape a crushing,paralysing ennui is unabated. Barbey d'Aurevilly, reviewing A Rebours, remarkedthat its author would have to choose \"between the muzzle of a pistol and thefoot of the cross.\" Huysmans did end his life as an oblate in the CatholicChurch. His road to salvation, however, led through some curious detours.Doris-Karl Huysmans was born in Paris in 1848, the only child of a French motherand Dutch father and his early years were saddened by the early death of hisfather and his mother's subsequent remarriage. After finishing his education, atthe age of eighteen, Huysmans entered government employment as a fonctionnaire,or civil servant, working with the Surete Generale. He remained there forthirty-two years. In 1874 Huysmans published his first book, a collection ofprose poems, Le Drageoir a epices, which showed the influence of Baudelaire.Coming under the influence of Zola and the Medan Group, Huysmans turned to novelwriting, and produced a series of competent, if unremarkable, works in thenaturalist style of his mentor. But by 1882, Huysmans had become bored withZola's sociological approach, and in a letter to his master complained that hefelt the need \"for a complete change.\"\" The result was A Rebours which markedHuysmans' rejection of Zola and the start of his fascination with the strange,bizarre and artificial.A Rebours, however, for all its rejection of Zola's methods, retains many of thenaturalist school's practices. There is, for example, the prodigious researchinto a variety of subjects: botany, Latin literature, the Middle Ages, as wellas the meticulous detail given to des Esseintes' diet, reading habits, style ofdress, the decor of his rooms. Not much happens, and one often feels Huysmansenjoys communicating to his readers the extent of his scholarship. A similarexperience greets the reader of La Bas. Like Zanoni, La Bas is full offascinating information on Satanism, alchemy, the Middle Ages, Christianmysticism, herbology, astrology, black magic, Illuminism, and a host of othersubjects. It's not unfair to see it as a kind of encyclopedia of fin de siecleoccultism masquerading as a novel.Exactly how Huysmans became interested in the occult is unclear, but it's likelythat he came across occult works early on; as in the case of Rimbaud, occultideas and references would be available in the popular writing of the time.Early signs of interest are apparent in his novel En Rade, where he speculateson incubi, succubi and the Kabbalah. Yet it was surely his dissatisfaction withcrude \"implacable life\" that prompted his explorations. With des Esseintes'failure, Huysmans too was left still searching for that something else.Communicating his despair at finding any satisfaction in life, Huysmans held outsome hope for himself: \"Perhaps there's still occultism,\" he offered. \"I don'tmean spiritualism, of course ... No, I mean genuine occultism ... there's amystery there which appeals to me. I might even say it haunts me ...s12 Throughthe occult, Huysmans hoped to find \"some compensation for the horror of dailylife, the squalour of existence, the excremental filthiness of the loathsome agewe live in.\"\"One portal to these mysteries was Edmond Bailly's bookshop in the rue de laChausee d'Antin, home to the cream of Parisian occultists. Huysmans wasintroduced to the place by his friend, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. Here Huymanswould encounter occultists like the morphine addicted Rosicrucian Stanislas deGuaita; Gerard Encausse, who wrote under the pseudonym of Papus, `Mysteriarch,Unknown Superior'; Paul Adam, member of the Supreme Council of the Rosy Cross;`Sar' Merodack Madan, an ex-bank clerk turned occult propagandist; and EdouardDubus, a young poet who shared with de Guaita a taste for narcotics.14 SoonHuysmans found himself involved with the Naundorffists, supporters of theenigmatic King Charles XI, who claimed the throne that his father, CharlesEdourad Naundorff, had made a bid for as Louis XVII. At first Huysmans gatheredmaterial on the Naundorff cause, thinking to write a novel around it. But soonhe dropped that idea for one more powerful: the history of Gilles de Rais, thedistinguished soldier and comrade of Joan of Arc who plunged into black magicand an orgy of sadism and cruelty. By the time he came to write Ld Bas,Huysmans' alter ego, Durtal, would split his time between researching Gilles deRais' enormities, and throwing himself into more contemporary darkness.Another occult influence on Huysmans, perhaps the most central, was BertheCourriere, mistress of the writer Remy de Gourmont. Gourmont once describedBerthe Courriere as \"a kabbalist and occultist, learned in the history ofasiatic religions and philosophies, fascinated by the veil of Isis, initiated bydangerous personal experiences into the most redoubtable mysteries of the BlackArt ...\"15 Berthe had made the rounds before becoming Gourmont's paramour,having been mistress and model for George Sand's nephew, the sculptor Clesinger.Yet others spoke less highly of her. Pierre Dufay described her as \"a madwomanwhose lucid intervals were not entirely free from the disordered notions whichhaunted her.\" According to Robert Baldick, Huysmans' biographer, her mind was\"certainly unbalanced.\" Twice certified as insane and committed to a mentalasylum, Berthe harboured an unwholesome passion for priests, and made a practiceof shocking, or seducing, young confessors with an account of her unusual sexualpractices. Along with distributing communion hosts to stray dogs, she decoratedher flat with a disturbing blend of Catholic and satanic bric-a-brac, mixingaltar-cloths, monstrances, and dalmatics with the work of Felicien Rops.Gourmont's portraits of Courriere in works like Le Fantome express herreligio-sadistic eroticism: \". . . Hyacinthe appeared before me completelynaked, begging me to flagellate her. She had in her hand the scourge of acanoness ... I obeyed her. Blood-red lines stigmatized the shoulders of my lover...\"16 Huysmans remained friends with Gourmont and Courriere for a few years,during which time he listened to Berthe's tales of occultism, and at least onone occasion, participated in a seance at their flat.Huysmans' other dark angel was Henriette Maillat. Maillat and Huysmans had beenlovers briefly - she had earlier been the paramour of the notorious `Sar' Madan,another Rosicrucian master - and in L i Bas, Huysmans used many of her loveletters to him verbatim. When the novel was published, Henriette made a clumsyattempt to blackmail him. Where Berthe Courriere targeted men of the cloth,Henriette had a thing for writers, and after Peladan, she had bagged Leon Bloybefore moving onto Huysmans. Between these two volatile and neurotic women,Huysmans created the figure of Mme. Chantelouve, Durtal's voluptuously wickedand diabolically desirable satanic seductress.It was through Berthe Courriere that Huysmans would meet the defrocked priestJoseph Antoine Boullan, upon whom he would model Dr. Johannes, the masterexorcist of the novel, enemy of all things diabolical. In actual fact, Boullanwas an irredeemably nasty character, who, if we are to believe Stanislas deGuaita, advocated practices of wild promiscuity, adultery, bestiality, onanism,incubism, and incest: small wonder that Berthe Courriere knew him. According toFrancis King, Boullan was guilty of even worse sins: with his mistress AdeleChevalier, a nun, Boullan is believed to have committed infanticide, possiblymurdering one of their own children, as well as others, in satanic rites. Thepair engaged in a particularly nauseating form of ritual, in which communionhosts mixed with excrement were employed. For all his encyclopedic research, inthe case of Boullan, even the most sympathetic reader must agree that Huysmanswas clearly hoodwinked.Canon Docre, the central villain of the novel, is thought to be based on aBelgian priest, the Abbe Van Haecke. According to Huysmans, at a Black Mass heattended, he noticed a priest dressed in a cassock and hood, observing theactivities with deep interest. Soon after, he saw a photograph of the samepriest in the window of a bookshop specializing in works on Satanism. It was VanHaecke. Huysmans gathered other evidence, including the reports of BertheCourriere and the poet Edouard Dubus. Yet both Courriere and Dubus were unstablecharacters; and it was during a visit to Bruges, where Van Haecke supposedlyheld his satanic affairs, that Courriere was placed in a mental asylum: she wasfound practically naked hiding in the bushes on the Rempart des Marechaux. Thepolice declined to accept her story that she had just barely escaped theclutches of the evil Van Haecke, who was known in his home town as a admirablydevout and devoted priest. Given Huysmans' accuracy on Boullan, we should, Ithink, suspend judgement on Van Haecke. One picturesque bit of evidence thatHuysmans uncovered, however, is worth mentioning: Van Haecke is supposed to havehad crucifixes tattooed on the soles of his feet, so he could have the pleasureof continually walking on the symbol of salvation.There is also some doubt if Huysmans ever attended a Black Mass, or if what hedid attend was the genuine article. Whatever the case, his account of one in LdBas is gripping, and if not based on the real thing, it certainly tells us howone should be done. That Huysmans believed he had stepped into the dark zone isundeniable; soon after La Bas appeared, Huysmans found himself involved in amagical feud between Boullan and his arch enemy, Stanislas de Guaita, includingevil spells, `fluidic fisticuffs' and more material dangers, like pistols attwenty paces. Even his cat was affected.\" It's understandable that after all hehad been through, Huysmans may have felt quite relieved that \"with his hookedpaw,\" the Devil was drawing him toward God. After Ld Bas all that was left wasthe cross.VALERY BRIUSOVIt's easy to get the impression that Paris was the only European capitalharbouring satanic devotees. It wasn't. While London had its own quota ofmagical societies - most notably the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, out ofwhose bosom the most notorious magician of the 20th century, Aleister Crowley,would emerge - more exotic cities produced their own occult progeny. Nowhere didthe occult craze reach wilder heights or more bizarre depths than in Russia'sSt. Petersburg. In the Silver Age of Russia (18901914), the city of WhiteNights, as well as its rival, Moscow, plunged into an apocalyptic orgy ofesoterica, magic and erotic madness. It was out of Mother Russia that MadameBlavatsky, the formidable founder of theosophy, would journey to the west.Russia also produced the `mad monk' Grigori Rasputin, the enigmatic G.I.Gurdjieff, and his preeminent disciple P.D. Ouspensky, who we will meet in thenext section.In the years leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution, an eschatological feverspread throughout the Russian intelligentsia, a sense of which was captured bythe novelist Hermann Hesse in a collection of essays, Glimpse into Chaos, whichhad a profound influence on T.S. Eliot, and which he refers to in the notes to\"The Waste Land.\" In the novels of Dostoyevsky, Hesse encountered a powerfullyantinomian soul, a dizzyingly paradoxical consciousness that could as easilyexpress itself in the rapture of the saint as in the violence of the criminal.\"Russian Man,\" Hesse argued, was the embodiment of an ancient, occult , asiaticideal, a primal, archetypal consciousness that threatened to overwhelm the Westas much as it held the promise of its vital renewal. \"Russian Man\" was a sinnerand holy man, a criminal and a saint, an ascetic and profligate, an angel and adevil: anything but the lukewarm middle ground occupied by the safe and mediocrebourgeoisie. \"Russian Man\" is bent on \"turning away from every fixed moralityand ethic in favour of a universal understanding ... a new, dangerous,terrifying sanctity.\" He seeks to \"perceive the divine, the necessary ... evenin what is most wicked and ugly.\" In him \"good and evil, outer and inner, Godand Satan are cheek and jowl.\"'RAs in Paris, one aspect of the Russian mystical debauch was a fascination withevil, and with the variety of gnostic mythologies that saw in the pursuit ofvice a short cut to heaven. One strain of this was the kind of eroticsaintliness associated with Rasputin. Another was an obsession with the figureof the Devil. Imported via French Symbolism, which reached the Russian steppesby the early 1890s, various forms of Satanism and satanic worship became thecentral obsession of a host of Russian poets, artists and musicians. Throughdrugs, wild dress, suicide clubs and other outre behaviour, a variety ofdiabolical themes fascinated the intelligentsia. Philosophers like VladimirSoloviev and Nicolas Berdyaev, writers like Dmitry Merzhkovsky and VasilyRozanov, poets like Zinaida Gippius and Aleksandr Blok, and artists like MikhailVrubel and Mstislav Dobuzhinsky all incorporated demonic and satanic themes intotheir work. The poet Konstantine Balmont published Evil Spell: A Book ofExorcisms, linking the darkness that followed the failed revolution of 1905 tothe occult. The poet Ellis (Lev Kobylinskii) asked if Satan \"was not better thana large part of the human race we try to save from him?\" Satanic erotica becamea familiar part of mainstream journalism, with images of passive, half nakedwomen preyed upon by demonic incubi. On stage, the actor Fedor Chaliapin made acareer portraying satanic figures, most famously Mephistopheles from Gounod'sFaust. Nicolai Riabushinsky, who hosted a suicide club called the Black Swan,published an advertisement in his journal The Golden Fleece, asking forcontributions for a special edition dedicated to the Devil: he receivedninety-two replies. Some individuals carried the demonic craze to gruesomelengths: Scriabin, whose diabolical compositions include a Poeme satanique, a`Black Mass' (9th Sonata) and the Gargantuan Prometheus: Poem of Fire, remarkedon the activities of the painter Nikolai Shperling, who, as part of an `occultexercise', ingested the flesh and blood of wounded or dead soldiers during WWI.What Shperling's digestion thought of this practice is unknown.19Central to the Russian diabolical milieu was the poet, novelist and criticValery Briusov. Briusov looked every inch the demonic genius, with his arching,Mongol eyebrows, perfect dress and black beard trimmed to a devilish point. Aconsummate literary careerist, Briusov was a cultural opportunist who startedout as a decadent and aesthete, and ended his career as the head of the LiteraryDivision of the Commissariat of Education. A true Symbolist, Briusov wasdetermined that his life should imitate art and he saw the people around himsolely as material for his work, a point we will return to shortly. Suicide,madness and drugs formed the backdrop to his rise. Along with producing some ofthe most finely chiselled Symbolist poetry, and at least one short masterpiece,the story \"The Republic of the Southern Cross,\" Briusov is responsible forperhaps the most erotically charged occult novel of the 20th century, The FieryAngel.20Born in Moscow in 1873 to a family of prosperous cork merchants, by 1894, at theage of twenty, Briusov was already heralding himself as the leader of a newliterary movement. In his diary for 4 March 1893 he wrote: \"Talent, even genius,by honest means earns only gradual success ... For me that's not enough ...Decadence. Yes! ... the future belongs to it, especially when it finds a worthyleader. And that leader will be I!i21 Driven to carve a literary name forhimself, Briusov fulfilled his dream rapidly. Influenced by Poe, Baudelaire andHuysmans, in 1894 and 1895 Briusov. published three slim volumes of RussianSymbolists. Although quickly ridiculed by Vladimir Soloviev, Briusov'stranslations of Verlaine, Maeterlinck, Mallarme, and Poe, as well as his owncontributions, established him as the central authority on the new Russianliterature. From then until 1912, the year that saw the beginning of hisdecline, Briusov reigned as the magus of Russian decadence. As well as hisMephistophelian appearance, Briusov's tactics included well-calculated socialeffects. Entrances and exits from literary fetes were carefully timed. With hisdomineering personality, Briusov quickly gathered a coterie of obsequiousfollowers. His relations with other poets were that of teacher and student, evenwhen the other poets were of equal, or greater stature. Friends who rejectedsuch arrangements were quickly branded enemies. With his strong position aseditor of the literary journal The Balance and association with the publishinghouse Scorpion, Briusov was 22 not an enemy many wanted to have.Acutely conscious, reserved, and highly disciplined, Briusov was attracted tomore ecstatic types, as well as to expedients like drugs, magic and eroticism,to stimulate his inspiration. One source was the precocious AleksandrDobroliubuv, a seventeen year old poet who was thrown out of high school forpreaching suicide. A devotee of Poe and Baudelaire, Dobroliubov wore only black,smoked opium, and lived in a small windowless room, whose black walls wereadorned with satanic bric-a-brac. Like Rimbaud, after plumbing the decadentdepths, Dobroliubov abandoned poetry and started a religious sect. He was knownto travel throughout Russia encased in iron hoops. According to NicolasBerdyaev, his followers had the peculiar habit of not responding to a questionuntil a year had passed. As Berdyaev points out, this made conversationinconvenient.23Konstantine Balmont was another source for Briusov, and with Andrei Bely, who wewill meet further on, Briusov carried on something of an occult feud. A followerof Rudolf Steiner, Bely came under Briusov's influence but soon asserted his owncreative identity. A greater writer, though a more labile personality, Bely felthimself the subject of an \"extremely suspicious psychological experiment\": hebelieved Briusov was trying to hypnotize him. A kind of magical war flared upbetween them, mostly in print, with Briusov happily accepting the persona of thedark sorcerer. Yet Bely was not without resources, and in a dream duel, Briusovfelt himself pierced by a sword in Bely's hand. He awoke with a pain in hisheart.This magical rivalry forms the basis of Briusov's medieval occult psychodrama,The Fiery Angel. Like Ld Bas and Zanoni, The Fiery Angel is encyclopedic;Briusov was nothing if not thorough and he studied the literature diligently.Faust, Mephistopheles, Cornelius Agrippa, the Inquisition, demonology and othermagical themes all make appearances. Briusov's recreation of the medieval occultmilieu is flawless. But the plot, centred around the sado-erotic obsession ofthe hysterical Renata with Madiel, the fiery angel, comes straight out ofBriusov's life, and is based on an erotic triangle between himself, Bely and ayoung poet named Nina Petrovskaya. Nina Petrovskaya was a nineteen year oldminor poet married to the publicist Sergei Sokolov. She had fallen in love withBely, but lost him to the wife of the poet Aleksandr Blok. She turned to Briusovfor help; it's said they practised magical rituals in order to renew Bely'saffections for her. This failed and out of revenge, Nina became Briusov's lover.Of Briusov, Nina wrote that he offered a \"chalice of dark, astringent wine ...and said, `Drink'.\" She did. For the next seven years, during which time Briusovmaintained a curious bourgeois double life with his wife Joanna, they engaged ina sadomasochistic affair fuelled by drugs, madness and suicide pacts. In hermemoirs Petrovskaya speaks of Briusov as a master of the \"dark sciences,\" and oftheir relationship as a \"pact with the Devil.\" Together they were \"children ofevil.\"In the novel Nina is Renata, possessed by demons, Briusov the knight Ruprecht,obsessed with Nina, and Bely the satanic Madiel, the fiery angel. In the novelRuprecht/Briusov agrees to attend a Black Mass in order to help Nina findMadiel. Though more of a witches' coven, it is as gripping a tour de force asHuysmans' Ld Bas. Life, however, imitates art, and having written the novel,Briusov lost interest in Nina and callously dropped her. Crushed, she leftMoscow and later committed suicide. She was not the only one. After Nina Briusovbecame involved with another unstable poet, Nadechda Lvova, whose lyrics show apreoccupation with death. The poet V.F. Khodasevich claims that Briusovencouraged her suicidal inclinations, even presenting her with a pistol thatNina Petrovskaya had once turned on Briusov himself. After he ended their affairshe shot herself with it. Another poet, the twenty-one year old Viktor Gofmanapparently took Briusov's advice on this matter as well.Death held an attraction for Briusov; several of his early poems deal withnecrophilia, and focus on the premature death of his first lover - she died attwenty-four of consumption - a theme that would continue to fascinate him. Hisinterest in the occult may have been, like so much else, a calculated pose. Butit attracted him early on; in the early 1890s he was already holding seances in,of all places, a notary's office. But it was the promise of power, more thananything else, that lured him to the dark side. At the end of his life,solitary, suffering and addicted to morphine - when Khodasevich heard of hisdeath in 1924, he was surprised he hadn't already committed suicide - Briusovmay have regretted typecasting himself so perfectly as the satanic master.NOTES1 As mentioned, Rudolf Steiner adopted Ahriman as one of the spiritual entitiesinterfering with human evolution; the other he named Lucifer. Ahriman is theembodiment of cold, factual, materialist thought. Following Milton, in LuciferSteiner sees the archetype of impulsive, rash, overweening arrogance.2 Francis King, article on Satanism in Encyclopedia of the Unexplained, editorRichard Cavendish (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974) p. 219.3 That a similar form of `reversal' was a common practice in earlier times iswell documented; one thinks of the ancient Saturnalia, when slaves were madekings and virgins prostitutes. One also thinks of the Greek practice of enduringsome selfinflicting suffering to offset a piece of good luck, as a kind ofinoculation against the jealousy of the gods. The basic mechanism is a kind ofregulatory process, whereby a desirable mean between good and evil, yang andyin, is maintained. In the 1960s, student radicals employed a strategy of`reversal' against the `establishment' that is strikingly similar to that usedin the Black Mass. See my Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the DarkSide of the Age of Aquarius (London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 2001).4 An altogether more satanic character, the notorious Aleister Crowley, engagedin very similar activities, filing his canines and subjecting femaleacquaintances to his `serpent's kiss' and, at least on one occasion, hanging hiscurrent Scarlet Woman upside down from a ceiling.5 He also knew Verlaine, and it was Bretagne who suggested to Rimbaud that hesend the older poet copies of his poems.6 Enid Starkie Arthur Rimbaud (London: Faber and Faber, 1961) p. 98.7 Ibid. pp. 165-167.8 The parallel's with Lautreamont are worth mentioning.

De Guaita died in 1897, atthe age of 36; in his last years his life sunk into unrelieved decadence, and heemerged from his scarlet and black apartments only to search for books onoccultism, and drugs. In 1895, Dubus was found dead in the urinal of arestaurant in the Place Maubert. He had been released from an insane asylum afew months earlier. A few days before his death, he had complained to Huysmansabout voices that pursued him, and confessed to having practised black magic.15 Quoted in Christopher McIntosh, Eliphas Levi and the French Occult Revival(London: Rider, 1972) p. 178.

McIntosh alsoprovides fascinating material on De Guaita's and Peladan's brief collaborationin the Cabalistic Order of the Rosy Cross, before splitting up into rivalRosicrucian groups. Neither Peladan nor de Guaita had any connection to the 17thCentury Rosicrucians, other than name. Peladan had a brief celebrity as the hostof a series of Rosicrucian salons, which aimed to unite mysticism and art. Someof the people involved were Erik Satie, Gustave Moreau, and Puvis de Chavannes.18 Hermann Hesse \"The Brothers Karamazov or The Decline of Europe\" in My Belief(London:Jonathan Cape, 1976) pp. 71-73.19 For a full account of the satanic world of the Russian fin de siecle seeKristi A Groberg's essay \"The Shade of Lucifer's Dark Wing: Satanism in SilverAge Russia,\" in The Occult in Russian and Soviet Culture, Bernice GlatzerRosenthal ed., (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1997) pp. 99-133.20 Prokofief based his 1919 opera of the same name on Briusov's novel, addinghis own contribution to a late flare of Russian occultism.21 The Diary of Valery Briusov edited and translated by Joan Delaney Grossman(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1980) p. 36.22 Both The Balance and Scorpion have clear astrological associations: Libra andScorpio, signs of the pervasive occult atmosphere of the time.23 Nicholas Berdyaev Dream and Reality (London: Geoffrey Bles, 1950) p. 200."},{"pageContent":"FIN DE SIECLE OCCULTISMThe twenty-four years between 1890 and the beginning of World War I saw aremarkable eruption of creative energy and speculation, a fantastic melange ofalternative and progressive ideas wedding ancient beliefs and modern science.Central to this ideological flood was the occult, the elements of which reachedfrom the dim, primeval past to the unimagined future. Notions of prehistoriclost civilizations and evolutionary supermen shared the same intellectual spaceas a profound rediscovery of magic and a dizzying preoccupation with higherdimensions. As in some aspects of current New Age philosophy, science andmysticism were seen to support each other, with Einstein's theory of relativityand ideas about `non-Euclidean space' bolstering accounts of astral travel andvisions of the Akashic Record. Philosophy, too, was conscripted, and Nietzsche'sprophecy of the Ubermensch blended with eastern ideas of karma andreincarnation. A deep dissatisfaction with the mechanical picture of theuniverse professed by rationalist science primed western consciousness for acultural journey to the east, and an influx of oriental philosophies invadedEurope, the results of which we still see today. In fact many of thepreoccupations that we associate with New Age thought have their roots in theturn of the 19th century. Yoga, meditation, vegetarianism; multiculturalism,homeopathy, and higher consciousness; visions of an alternative society,anticapitalism, and interest in primitive beliefs; a fascination with ancientstone monuments, religious cults, and communes; progressive education, freelove, feminism and openness to homosexuality and lesbianism; experimentationwith drugs, a rejection of cold reason in favour of feeling and intuition,paganism and nature worship; a turning away from modernity and progress as wellas a feverish millennialism: in the years leading up to World War I these andother ingredients com bined to produce an effervescent, highly chargedatmosphere in which anything seemed possible and in which the new century justdawning seemed a blank slate on which mankind could now write its own destiny.Like today, much of this optimism took place on the lunatic fringe, and bookslike James Webb's The Occult Underground, which charts the history of a varietyof occult, mystical and in some way alternative societies at the turn of the19th century, are an entertaining and sobering read. But a good deal of thisactivity had firmer foundations and found its way into some of the mostintelligent minds of the time, influencing the literature, art, and socialtheory of the era. In the concluding essay \"The Modernist Occultist\" I willtouch on some of the results of this influence.Probably the most immediate name to come to mind associated with the occultrevival of the late 19th century is W.B. Yeats. Yeats was drawn to the occultearly on and was a member of two of the most celebrated magical organizations ofmodern times: the Theosophical Society and the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, both of which we will hear more of shortly. But poets were not the onlyindividuals drawn to the dark side of the mind. The psychologist and philosopherWilliam James was deeply interested in the phenomenology of mystical experience,so much so that he sought some first hand evidence, experimenting with bothnitrous oxide and peyote. One result of this was his classic The Varieties ofReligious Experience, which argued for the validity and importance ofsupernatural experience, over the uniform strictures of dogma. James was alsoprofoundly drawn to a study of the paranormal, being at one time a president ofthe Society for Psychical Research, a position he shared with his friend andfellow philosopher Henri Bergson. Bergson, too, was a student of thenon-rational areas of consciousness, and along with studies of telepathy andother paranormal abilities he wrote on dreams, mysticism, and altered states ofconsciousness. Bergson was also one of the first philosophers to draw on the newadvances in biology and to argue against the mechanistic vision of positivistscience. In books like Time and Free Will (1889) and Matter and Memory (1896)Bergson advanced the idea that reason and the intellect were evolutionary toolsdeveloped by the mind in order to deal with the necessities of survival. To beeffective they must falsify reality and present as a static, solid world ofmaterial things what is really a ceaseless flow of experience. A truer, deeperrapport with reality, Bergson argued, can be achieved only through ourintuition, something the Romantics had claimed a century earlier. One writerprofoundly influenced by Bergson's ideas was Marcel Proust, whose Remembrance ofThings Past is an extended essay in Bergson's duration.In Creative Evolution (1907) Bergson developed these ideas and argued againstthe by-then triumphant Darwinian picture of a mechanistic evolution, propelledby chance mutation and the blind will to survive, offering instead an eloquentand persuasive vision of an elan vital, a transcendent `life force' whichpenetrates matter and moulds it to its end. That end, Bergson argued, was a kindof evolutionary spirituality. As he wrote in his last book, Two Sources ofMorality and Religion (1932) - written well after his celebrity had dimmed - theuniverse, it seemed, was \"a machine for making gods.\" One writer who agreed withBergson was the playwright George Bernard Shaw, who, in his philosophical comedyMan and Superman (1904) (which includes a satanic dream episode, the brilliantDon Juan in Hell), combined Bergson's elan vital with Nietzsche's Ubermensch.Later, Shaw drew on Bergson's ideas again for his futurist fantasy Back toMethuselah (1924), which introduces a race of supermen living in someunthinkable future, semi-divine human beings who have transcended the earthlylot and occupy themselves solely with the eternal. Critics like D.H. Lawrencethought Shaw's Ancients a dismal bore, having given up the flesh for a life ofpure mind, an accusation often made against Shaw himself. Most people agreed.But Shaw's vision of a coming super race had it roots in more than his ownsupposed lack of interest in the delights of corporality.Although Bergson became the most well-known opponent of strict Darwinianthought, he was not the first. That honour most go to the author of a bookpublished in 1877, decades before Creative Evolution. The author of the book,Isis Unveiled, a 1,300 page compendium of occult thought, mysticism, and weirdspeculation was an unusual critic of biological theory in more ways than one. Inthe first place, she was a woman; in the second, she was Russian. In the thirdplace Helena Petrovna Blavatsky had led an unconventional life, having, amongother things, founded what would quickly become a worldwide religious cult,theosophy. The stamp of theosophy falls across practically every aspect of finde siecle occultism. This is true whether or not the occultists in question wereever theosophists in a strict sense. Along with ideas of hidden masters,reincarnation and cosmic evolution, what theosophy brought to occultism was thebelief that it and science were not enemies, but complementary approaches touncovering the secrets of the universe. There had been earlier exponents of thisidea: Mesmer, for one, and later both Poe and BulwerLytton argued that occultphenomena were really the result of forces not yet understood by science. Goethebelieved that his own scientific work in botany, morphology and optics was asimportant as his poetry, an opinion not shared by many. One occultist who didagree with Goethe, however, was Rudolf Steiner, a Goethe scholar, philosopherand theosophist who broke away from theosophy and inaugurated his own form of\"spiritual science\", anthroposophy, arguably the most successful school ofalternative thought to emerge from the 20th century. Needless to say, for thealchemists of an earlier time, occultism itself was a branch of science, perhapsthe most important one.Yet, while a sense of optimism and expectation greeted the new century, darkervisions were also present. Along with intimations of a leap in human evolution,atavistic forces and primal ancient energies also rose to the surface. We haveseen some evidence for this in the previous section, in the rise of Satanism andwitchcraft. But the shadow took other forms as well. The chasm between the twoworlds widened, and the Symbolist rejection of the \"mundane shell\" (Blake'sphrase) reached its peaked. No longer content to ignore the modern world, thelate-Romantic consciousness now heaped contempt upon it, and sought refuge invisions of some glittering golden past, or found itself alone in an abyss ofcosmic isolation. A sense of apocalypse pervaded the psyche, appearing in someas the approach of madness, in others as the trumpet call of the last days. In afew cases, the two were synonymous. By the summer of 1914, darkness fell, andold Europe was no more.MADAME BLAVATSKYAs noted earlier, 1875 was an important year for occultism. It saw the death ofEliphas Levi and the birth of Aleister Crowley, two significant events by anystandard. But even more significant, it was in that year that three eccentricindividuals founded an organization that would profoundly influence not onlymodern occultism, but modern culture in general. In New York .City on 13September 1875, Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott andWilliam Quan Judge came together to form a successor to their previous occultorganization, `the Miracle Club', as one member had ironically referred to it.In its first stages the Theosophical Society was an outgrowth of the popularoccultism of the time, and included among its founding members a spirit medium,a kabbalist, and other characters familiar with the traditions of Europeanoccultism. The last few decades had seen an obsession with spiritualism on bothsides of the Atlantic. It began in upstate New York with the famous Fox sistersin 1848; by the early 1870s, Madame Blavatsky herself had acquired aconsiderable reputation as a medium. It was in this capacity that she met theearnest and soon-to-be devoted Colonel Olcott. A reporter with a deep interestin the supernatural, Olcott had heard of a pair of remarkable spirit mediums,the Eddys, who lived on a farm in Vermont. Arriving there he was immediatelycaptivated by the appearance of an even more remarkable figure, MadameBlavatsky. Although it was her red Garibaldi shirt, forthright manner, ampleproportions and powerful charisma that first caught his attention, Olcott soondiscovered that Blavatsky was endowed with psychic abilities that easilyoutstripped those of the mediums he intended to investigate. A lifetimeassociation began, and soon after the two became Platonic flat mates inManhattan.Soon after its inception, the vague interest in latent powers and occultphenomena that characterized the early Theosophical Society was complicated by ahost of eastern metaphysical ideas brought in by Olcott and Blavatsky. The term\"theosophy\" itself had been around for centuries, Jacob Boehme makes much use ofit, and literally means `God wisdom'. But since the founding of the TheosophicalSociety, the term has been synonymous with the kind of generic easternspirituality and occultism associated with the group. Yet if all theTheosophical Society had going for it was the hodgepodge of mystical ideasloosely knitted together into its philosophy, it would never have had the kindof influence on 20th century thought it undoubtedly did. At the centre of themass of doctrines about reincarnation, past lives, astral planes, higherconsciousness and spiritual evolution was the formidable, electric and roguishfigure of Madame Blavatsky. It is true that the world was waiting for somethinglike theosophy to arrive. Bereft of God through the rise of science, and floodedwith a triumphant materialist doctrine, thousands of individuals who soughtspiritual guidance found themselves adrift in an indifferent universe. With itsbroad message of universal brotherhood, spiritual truth and cosmic mysteries,theosophy appealed to both the devout ascetic and the late-Romantic. Yet it'sdifficult to see how its message would have got across without the captivatingpersonality of its spokeswoman.Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (or HPB, as her followers called her), was born Helenavon Hahn in 1831 in Ekaterinoslav in the Ukraine. Like her fellow Russian G.I.Gurdjieff, Blavatsky's early life is shrouded in mystery. She was married ateighteen to Nikifor Blavatsky, the Vice-Governor of the province of Erivan, butthe marriage was never consummated. Indeed, it is doubtful whether HPB ever hadsex, or if she had, that the experience was at all pleasant. All of her remarkson it are disparaging, and she constantly advised her followers to abstain fromthe beastly business, considering carnal activity a major impediment to thespiritual path. Leaving her husband, Blavatsky went to Constantinople, where sheworked as a bareback rider in a circus; here she is supposed to have sustainedan injury that made sex in any case impossible, prompting the thought that herabstemious virtue was founded on necessity. For a time she worked as theassistant of the medium Daniel Dunglas Home; later she directed the SerbianRoyal Choir. She owned an artificial flower factory, worked as a journalist,short story writer and piano teacher, and was one of the few survivors of thewreck of the Eumonia. Finding herself stranded in Cairo, she conducted bogusseances, aided by large helpings of hashish, a taste for which she maintainedthroughout her life.Before turning up in New York, HPB is alleged to have travelled extensively inTibet, a remarkable claim at the time, and doubly so for a woman, one matchedonly by the equally redoubtable Alexandra David Neel, author of the occultclassic Magic and Mystery in Tibet. Tibet and its remote fastness became inBlavatsky's mind a central symbol and source of spiritual truth and wisdom.Earlier in her career this position was occupied by Egypt. Perhaps Egypt was tooclose, or maybe there was little left of it that had not been explored; possiblythe hidden masters - with whom she claimed to be in constant communication -wanted a change of scenery. Whatever the reason, by the time the theosophicalball really got rolling, all roads, paths and ways led to the remote Himalayanpeaks. This journey to the east reached the popular mind in hundreds of ways,among others novels like James Hilton's Lost Horizon, made into a 1937 filmstarring Ronald Coleman, and W. Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge, which wasalso made into a film, in 1946, starring Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney.'Blavatsky and Olcott drew followers from the occult demimonde of late 19thcentury New York, but it wasn't long before the popularity of spiritualism beganto fade. The public mind had tired of it, and in any case Blavatsky herself wasbored with the business. Her calling lay elsewhere. It wasn't the message of thespirits that she was destined to proclaim, but the hidden wisdom of the ages.Lost for centuries, obscured by the false doctrines of materialism and anincomplete science, it was revealed to her in copious detail by anincontrovertible source. These were the hidden masters, adepts who guide theevolution of humankind from secret monasteries in the Himalayas. They had chosenher as their spokeswoman to bring their teachings to the masses, in order toprevent the modern world from sinking deeper into the spiritless doctrines ofmatter. Proof of this came in the form of the famous Mahatma letters, whichBlavatsky would materialize out of thin air, to the amazement of Colonel Olcott.Part of the message the masters delivered was that Olcott should abandon hiswife and children and devote himself completely to the cause, which he promptlydid.The Colonel was impressed by HPB's abilities, but the public at large requiredsomething more. Blavatsky obliged with Isis Unveiled, a massive tome whichcovered everything from magic and psychic powers to ancient races, secretteachings, and Hindu philosophy. Its basic premise was that the occult is nothocus-pocus but a true science, based on profound knowledge of the secrets ofnature, lost to modern humanity but known to the ancients and to a few highlyevolved human beings, the adepts. It also presented an outline of cosmic andhuman evolution vastly different than that offered by modern science. A firstprinting of 1,000 copies sold out in ten days and a review in the New YorkHerald called it \"one of the most remarkable productions of the century.\" Adecade later, Blavatsky followed up with an even larger tome, The SecretDoctrine, more or less the Old Testament of modern occultism. Along withransacking her library of occult works - and chain smoking hashish - Blavatsky'swriting habits included perusing the Akashic Record to verify her manycitations. Olcott describes how mid-paragraph HPB would stare into the middledistance for a few moments, then hurriedly put pen to paper. She was, he said,consulting the astral light for the correct page references.Astral light was one of Eliphas Levi's contributions, arguing that it was themedium of the magician's will and imagination, thus uniting Mesmer's ideas withthose of Romanticism. Another was the notion of an unbroken chain of occultinheritance, the handing down of dark secrets and forbidden knowledge from adeptto apprentice. Both ideas would profoundly influence Blavatsky. Anotherinfluence was the Frenchman Louis Jacolliot. In books like Occult Science inIndia (1875) Jacolliot argued that a society of unknown men actually did existin India whose influence on world events was paramount. In the 1920s the legendof the `Nine Unknown' turn up in the esoteric fiction of the novelist TalboltMundy, himself a member of Katharine Tingley's Point Loma Theosophical Society,and in the 1960s they formed part of Louis Pauwel's and Jacques Bergier's TheMorning of the Magicians (1960). But the occult writer who had the mostinfluence on Blavatsky was Bulwer-Lytton. From Zanoni, along with other occultnotions, Blavatsky appropriated the idea of a group of ageless occult masterswho stood apart from the mass of humanity. She also borrowed the idea of anancient, secret language, which she called Senzar, the original tongue of theBook of Dzyan, whose teachings form the basis of The Secret Doctrine. And fromLytton's early science fiction work The Coming Race, she took the notion of anew race of super beings, which would eventually supplant humanity. The ideathat man was evolving into a new kind of being would become popular in a varietyof ways in the new century - Nietzsche, Bergson, H.G. Wells and Bernard Shaw 2all produced versions of it. But Bulwer Lytton was first, and after himBlavatsky. Blavatsky's ideas of cosmic evolution involving unimaginably vastepochs would find their way into the weird fantasies of H.P. Lovecraft and thescience fiction epics of Olaf Stapledon3, but unfortunately for many they formedthe basis of a spiritually correct form of racism, most virulently in the handsof proto-Nazi Aryan supremacists.After New York, Blavatsky and Olcott moved to India and based themselves inAdyar. From there they proceeded to conquer the occult world with their invitingblend of spiritual phenomena and eastern teaching. In 1884 Blavatsky travelledto England, where interest in theosophy had been piqued by the publication ofA.P. Sinnett's books Esoteric Buddhism and The Occult World. Yet not long afterdisaster struck: an ex-employee published articles describing how HPB fakedspiritual phenomena, most significantly the appearance of the masters Koot Hoomiand Morya. An investigation by the Society for Psychical Research concurred, andthe integrity of theosophy was shaken. Yet both incidents had little longtermeffect on the growth of the movement, which continued to attract followers inEurope and America, claiming, among others, Thomas Edison, Wassily Kandinsky,Piet Mondrian, and Abner Doubleday, the inventor of baseball. Blavatsky spenther last days in Europe, writing the monumental Secret Doctrine, surrounded bydevoted followers. She died in 1891 of Bright's disease.VILLIERS DE L'ISLE-ADAM IIOn 26 February 1894, W B. Yeats attended a performance of Villiers de l'IsleAdam's philosophical drama Axel at the Theatre de la Gaite in Paris. Of theperformance Yeats wrote that \"Count Villiers de l'Isle-Adam swept together ...words behind which glimmered a spiritual and passionate mood ...\" and createdcharacters who exhibited \"a pride like that of the Magi following their star...\" That Yeats should be so enthusiastic about a play performed in a languagehe was less than fluent in might raise an eyebrow, were it not for the fact thatmystery and suggestion, not explicit meaning, were well in keeping with theessence of Villiers' Symbolist epic. Even before seeing the performance, Yeatshad laboured over Villiers' play, scrutinizing it \"as learned men readnewlydiscovered Babylonian cylinders\" and admitting that the work \"seemed allthe more profound, all the more beautiful, because I was never quite certainthat I had read a page correctly.\" It was not, he admitted, a great masterpiece,but to the hermetically minded Yeats, Axel \"seemed part of a religious rite, theceremony perhaps of some secret Order ...\"4Yeats himself knew of such secret orders. In his teens in Dublin he haddiscovered theosophy, and in 1885 he met the Indian theosophist MohiniChatterji, who introduced him to the Bhagavad Gita and Hindu philosophy andprompted his joining the society. In 1887, after moving to London, and visitingMadame Blavatsky, Yeats drifted from eastern wisdom to western esotericism,leaving the Theosophical Society in 1890 and joining the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, the most famous magical club of the fin de siecle. It's anunderstatement that a complete understanding of Yeats' poetry can be had only bygrasping the importance of the occult in his life, a significance too oftenignored by literary critics and academics. His host for his stay in Paris wasMacGregor Mathers, the magician, kabbalist and head of the Golden Dawn duringYeats involvement. He too was impressed by Axel, as was Villiers' fellow writerSar Peladan, the renegade Rosicrucian whose magical salon included figures likeErik Satie and Odilon Redon and who fought an occult duel with the darkmagician, Stanislas de Guaita (see Huysmans and Ld Bas). \"Villiers del'Isle-Adam,\" wrote Remy de Gourmont,\" has opened the doors of the unknown witha crash, and a generation has gone through them to the Infinite.\" Sadly,Villiers himself was not around to appreciate his success, but it's almostappropriate that he would have already passed into the very Unknown that hisdoomed alter ego, Axel, anticipates with such ardour. A measure of the accuracywith which Villiers portrayed the spirit of the age can be seen in the fact thatthe literary' critic Edmund Wilson entitled his influential study of the\"imaginative literature of 1870-1930\", taking in such heavyweights as Proust,Joyce, Eliot and Yeats himself, Axel's Castle. The shadow of that mystic towerfell upon the consciousness of two generations.The plot of Axel, insofar as it has one, centres around a buried treasure. Asmentioned earlier, this is a symbol of alchemical gold and esoteric wisdom, butit is also an emblem of the lost wealth of Villiers' family. Count Axel ofAuersburg, a young, handsome but world weary nobleman, has retired to hisancient family castle in the Black Forest. During the Napoleonic Wars, hisfather had hidden a fabulous horde of gold and jewels in the castle and wasmurdered by plotters planning to steal the treasure. Axel studies alchemy andhermetic philosophy, and is being prepared for initiation by a Rosicrucianadept, Master Janus. Axel's cousin, the vulgar Commander Kaspar, has got wind ofthe treasure and arrives at the castle. Axel's sedentary and contemplativeexistence disgusts him, and he tries to seduce Axel back into \"life\" withstories of battle and erotic conquest. Axel politely rejects theseblandishments, but when Kaspar suggests that Axel finds the treasure, the younginitiate challenges him to a duel and promptly kills him. While this is goingon, Sara, a beautiful young noblewoman who has been put into a convent, finds abook that once belonged to Axel's dead mother. In it the secret of the treasureis revealed. Sara quickly escapes from the sisters and heads for the BlackForest. Arriving at the castle, Axel nobly offers her a chaste bed for thenight. When everyone is asleep, Sara descends to the family crypt and finds thesecret button hidden within an heraldic death's-head. Gold and jewels gushforth. Axel, however, has discovered her as well, and Sara, a determined youngwoman, turns on him with two pistols. She wounds Axel, and in the ensuingstruggle, they discover they are in love. Sara, as it turns out, is aRosicrucian as well.The rest of the drama is a long, poetic and densely purple dialogue in which theworld-rejecting Axel convinces Sara that the only true union for them is indeath. Sara, more robust than Axel, suggests at least one night of passion. Butthe initiate is not swayed, and although young, rich, beautiful and wellpositioned socially - not to mentioned possessed of powerful magical support -they end it all by drinking a goblet of poison.Although Yeats and his mystic brethren were entranced by the play, the generalpublic and the critics would have nothing of it. Yeats remarks that as MasterJanus denounced the life of pleasure and advocated the pursuit of the virtuousand chaste, one \"fat old critic ... turned around with his back to the stage andlooked at the pretty girls through his opera glass.\" With all this talk ofspirit and the soul, the younger generation, it seemed, were becoming morbid.Understandably, Axel did not have a long run.Axel's renunciation of life is the logical fulfilment of the Romantic belief inthe supremacy of the imagination, the final severing of Hoffmann's `serapionticprinciple'. It is the end of the other path that Huysmans, Baudelaire and therest might have taken, the one leading to the barrel of a pistol. In his ownlife Villiers, an ardent Catholic, found his way to the foot of the cross, andlater tried to change the play's ending, to deflect Axel's nihilism into aChristian channel. Sadly, he did not have time: the stomach cancer diagnosed in1889 prevented him and the thought that he would die before perfecting his lifework ironically reinforced his original pessimism. It is said that on his deathbed he was arranging a law suit against God. The spiritual purity that Axelsought would eventually lead to a kind of aesthetic paralysis, bringing theSymbolist project to Mallarme's blank page and, later, to the white canvases ofKasimir Malevich. It would also lead to its opposite, the decadent plunge intodebilitating excess, and a helpless disgust with a world oblivious to Villiers'and others' attempts to transform it.H.G. WELLSH.G. Wells was not an occultist. The high-priest of science, Wells once took hisfellow Fabian Bernard Shaw to task for believing in Bergson's elan vital or`life force', calling it a juju' and relegating it to the heap of superstitionsthat modern man must jettison on his way to creating a rational world order. YetWells himself had his own version of a higher man, and throughout his career hefrequently wedded Nietzsche's vision of a sudden evolutionary leap to theVictorian belief in progress through science. In his novel The Food of the Gods(1904), two biologists discover a food that promotes steady and unlimitedgrowth. The people who eat it become giants, not only in size but in vision,leaving behind the \"littleness, bestiality and infirmity of men.\" Inevitably,the giants cause fear in the little people, who try to destroy them. \"We fightnot for ourselves,\" the leader of the giants declares, \"but for growth, growththat goes on forever ... To grow at last into the fellowship and understandingof God . Till the earth is no more than a footstool ... i5To point out the fascist and capitalist overtones of this declamation is onlytoo easy for us who have gone through the century that Wells was only entering,but to give Wells his due, neither of these ideologies was on his mind. Thisnotion of an evolutionary elite - not too distant from Blavatsky's vision of aninner circle of spiritual masters - never left Wells, and it's perhapsunderstandable that a person of his talent and energy would grow impatient withmuddling humanity. In perhaps the last of his great science fiction novels, InThe Days of the Comet (1908), a gas from a passing comet transforms theinhabitants of England into nobler, finer beings; and as late as 1937, in hislittle known novella Star Begotten, Wells has Martians firing cosmic rays atEarth in order to produce a super race. Yet this evolutionary optimism wascountered by a dark pessimism, rooted in 19th century science, with its visionof a mindless evolutionary process and coming \"heat death\" of the universe. TheTime Machine (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The Invisible Man(1897), The War of the Worlds (1898) all project a dark future for mankind. Andif we are to judge by his last works, the darkness finally won. In Mind at theEnd of Its Tether (1945), his last book, Wells declared gloomily that \"thisworld is at the end of its tether ... the end of everything we call life isclose at hand ...\" Entropy - in the form of the atom bomb - was hurling mankindtoward extinction; the very science that had promised humanity a glorious futurewas making certain its unavoidable end.Although Wells can't be called an occultist, in the early days of his career,when, following Poe, Bulwer-Lytton and Jules Verne, he was creating modernscience fiction, Wells wrote in a milieu swimming in occult ideas. One thatstruck him particularly was \"the fourth dimension.\" Along with The Time Machine,Wells used the idea of some other space parallel to our own frequently. In \"ThePlattner Story\" (1896), an inept chemistry teacher causes an explosion and istransported into another world which, in keeping with the times, turns out to bethe fourth dimension. After a nine-day sojourn in the spirit world, completewith the souls of the dead, Plattner returns. That Wells had been reading hisfourth dimensional literature is clear from the effect the journey has had onPlattner: his entire anatomical structure has been inverted, his heart beatingon his right side, and the'rest of his organs and extremities following suit: hehas become his own mirror-image. In \"Under the Knife\" (1896), an anaestheticadministered to the narrator during an operation produces an out-of-the-bodyexperience, followed by a journey through the cosmic emptiness of space,culminating in a transfiguring vision of the Creator. In \"The Door in the Wall\"(1906) a politician recalls that as a child he entered through a magical door,which opened onto an enchanted garden; he is haunted by the memory and spendshis life trying to find it again. In each of these tales, the narrator leavesbehind the normal, everyday world and enters a version of Hoffmann's Atlantis,that other world of the imagination. Unlike some of the other writers we'velooked at, in Wells' case, the desire to inhabit the other world permanentlydidn't express itself in addiction to alcohol or drugs or in a pathetic attemptto renounce this world. Wells evolved from imaginative dreamer into an utopiansocialist, and from WWI until his final disillusionment, wrote and rewrote hismanifesto for transforming this world into the other. His \"open conspiracy\"earned him world renown and the company of political leaders like FranklinDelano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Whether it did hiswriting much good is still a debatable question.\"The Remarkable Case of Davidson's Eyes\" (1895 is another fourth dimension tale,this time involving a few other occult or paranormal activities, likeclairvoyance, bi-location and `remote viewing'. During a thunderstorm, theunfortunate Davidson is caught between the poles of an electromagnet andreceives a terrific shock. When he awakes his consciousness has been transportedto a remote South Sea Island, while his body remains in the London laboratory.When he tries to walk along the beach, he smashes into equipment, and when he'smoved about in London, he finds himself flying over the island, or sinkingthrough solid rock. The fourth dimension and a kink in space are offered asanswers to the phenomenon, but Bellows, Wells' narrator, a mundane sort of chap,rejects this idea as nonsense, although he admits he is no mathematician. WhatWells himself thought of the fourth dimension is also debatable. He was a goodfriend of the aviator turned time theorist J.W. Dunne, author of the oncepopular An Experiment with Time (1927), which recounted Dunne's experiences withprecognitive dreams.' The aviators who appear in many of Wells' stories weremodelled on Dunne and in The Shape of Things to Come (1933), Wells uses Dunne'sideas about dreams and precognition to enable his narrator to read a historytextbook written a century and a half in the future. Yet, Wells at one pointchanged his mind about his friend's theories, more or less retracting afavourable review he had given of one of Dunne's books, wanting to avoid theimpression that he was giving it an endorsement.Like many creative artists, however, Wells was not adverse to indulging in anactivity we have associated with many occult thinkers: hypnagogia. In thepreface to The Country of the Blind and Other Stories (1911) Wells described howhe came to write his early stories.I found that taking almost anything as a starting point and letting my thoughtsplay about with it, there would presently come out of the darkness, in a mannerquite inexplicable, some absurd or vivid little nucleus. Little men in canoesupon sunlit oceans would come floating out of nothingness, incubating the eggsof prehistoric monsters unawares; violent conflicts would break out amidst theflower-beds of suburban gardens; I would discover I was peering into remote andmysterious worlds ruled by an order logical indeed but other than our commonsanity.The door in the wall, sought after in different ways by many of Wells'narrators, may not have been as hidden as he thought.ALGERNON BLACKWOODAlgernon Blackwood had the kind of life most other writers only write about.`Today he is remembered chiefly by devotees of weird fiction, but in his own timeBlackwood was an extremely popular writer, broadcaster and televisionpersonality, becoming a celebrity in the 1930s as radio's `Ghost Man', asobriquet he accepted but never really liked. On 2 November 1936 he took part inthe first television broadcast in Britain, filling a three minute slot inAlexandra Palace along with several other guests, including a Pearly King andthe Queen of Blackfriars, in a show called Picture Page; he later became aregular guest on the BBC's Saturday Night Story, a position he shared with hisfellow fantasist, Lord Dunsany. In 1949 Blackwood was awarded the TelevisionSociety Medal, a decoration he added to the CBE he received the same year. Bythe time of his death in 1951, Blackwood was a household name. He was famousuntil the early 1960s, and even reached a new audience via the weird fiction andfantasy revival of the late 60s and early 70s, a posthumous popularity enjoyedby Blackwood's fellow occultist and author, Arthur Machen.9 Machen's andBlackwood's names have often been linked, mostly because both were for a timemembers of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and both were mystics of asort. But the resemblance ends there. As we will see, Machen was an implacableenemy of the modern age; it's difficult picturing him as a television or radiocelebrity of any kind. Blackwood too thought little of civilization, preachingthroughout his many books a philosophy of cosmic unity and higher consciousness.But Blackwood had an adventurous, expansive spirit that Machen lacked, and thisaccounts for his fascinating life, and the curious power of his best writing.Algernon Blackwood was born in Shooter's Hill, Kent, on 4 March 1869, the son ofa clerk in the Treasury who later became Secretary of the Post Office. Blackwoodgrew up in a strict Evangelical household - his parents were converts to aCalvinist sect - but he rebelled early on, absorbing Patanjali's Yoga Aphorisms,the Bhagavad Gita and books on theosophy; he would later become a member of thesociety. Blackwood attended several private schools, and spent a year (18851886)at the School of the Moravian Brotherhood in Konigsfeld, Germany. Here he wasimpressed by the military discipline, but also by a spirit of \"gentleness andmerciful justice.\" The next summer was spent in Switzerland, before being sentto Canada on business by his father. In 1888 Blackwood went to EdinburghUniversity but left the next year. In 1890, at the age of 21, he returned toCanada to seek his fortune.These early travels set a pattern in Blackwood's life; for the rest of his dayshe remained a wanderer, eventually pruning his possessions down to a trunk, achange of clothes, his pyjamas and a typewriter. In Canada he failed as a dairyfarmer and hotelier, and decided to cross the border into America. In New YorkBlackwood worked as a journalist with the Evening Sun. Innocent and trusting,Blackwood's roommate stole most of his savings, but Blackwood eventually trackedhim down and had him arrested. Blackwood's days in New York were grim, and hetells the story in his autobiography Episodes Before Thirty (1923). Living indire poverty, barely relieved by getting a post with the New York Times in 1895,it was only after becoming the private secretary to a banker in 1897 thatBlackwood's circumstances improved.In 1899 Blackwood returned to England, and got involved with other businessschemes, one involving a powdered milk company. But business was not for him. Hetravelled to France, then to Germany. He went down the Danube, the setting forperhaps his most well known story, \"The Willows,\" and climbed in the Alps. Itwas around this time that he became interested in magic and when he returned toLondon he joined the Golden Dawn. A meeting with a friend led to Blackwoodsubmitting a collection of his stories to the publisher Eveleigh Nash. The EmptyHouse appeared in 1906, followed by The Listener and Other Stories the nextyear. Then in 1908 Blackwood published John Silence - Physician Extraordinary.His fortune was made. The book was an instant success, combining two of popularfiction's current crazes, the occult and the investigative detective. JohnSilence was not, of course, the first or last of his kind. After Blackwoodrefused to follow up the initial collection, his publisher turned to thenovelist William Hope Hodgson (The House on the Borderland (1908)), who promptlycreated Carnacki, the Ghost Finder. Other occultists created their own mysticalgumshoes, like Sax Rohmer's Morris Klaw, an Eastern European London emigre, whoknows the Kabbalah and dreams the solutions to crimes. Rohmer too was apparentlybriefly a member of the Golden Dawn.Blackwood, however, didn't need a Sherlock Holmes to perpetuate his success.Nash had launched the book with a massive advertising campaign, with some of thebiggest posters yet seen on hoardings and buses, and Blackwood had made enoughfrom the sales to concentrate full time on writing and developing his ideas.Several more collections appeared, as well as cosmic novels like The Human Chord(1910) and The Centaur (1911) - the latter based on Blackwood's travels in theCaucasus and perhaps the central expression of his mystical beliefs. A Prisonerof Fairyland (1913) was later transformed through the help of Sir Edgar Elgarinto the musical The Starlight Express, whose title Andrew Lloyd Webber took forhis own long-running musical. Later, in the 1920s, Blackwood turned his handsuccessfully to children's books. He was, by any account, a prolific writer aswell as a man who, in Henry Miller's phrase, lived life \"to the hilt\". In factBlackwood turns up in Miller's The Books in My Life (1952), where he callsBlackwood's novel The Bright Messenger (1921) \"the most extraordinary novel onpsychoanalysis ...\" Miller too was a vagabond who came to writing late, and inseveral of his books displays a fascination with mysticism and the occult.In the midst of all this travel and productivity - as well as a stint as asecret agent during WWI - Blackwood found time to devote himself to themysteries. In 1900 he was introduced to the Hermetic Order of the Golden dawnthrough Yeats. When he joined members included Florence Farr, Maud Gonne,Constance Wilde, A.E. Waite, and Arthur Machen. The infamous Aleister Crowleyand the order's dethroned despotic leader, MacGregor Mathers, had recently left:Mathers to set up a rival group in Paris, Crowley on a trip to Mexico. Blackwoodspent the next two years studying Kabbalah, the Hebrew alphabet, alchemy andastrology. But magic per se was not Blackwood's forte, and after achieving therank of Philosophus, he decided to stop. The Order itself suffered severalblows, one of which, `the Horos scandal' - in which Mathers had been duped by ahusband and wife team of sexual predators who used the society to gather prey -led to its reformation. A.E. Waite10 reformed the society again in 1903, andboth Blackwood and Machen followed. But both soon lost interest and the societyeventually faded. Later, both Machen and Blackwood would speak critically oftheir occult dabbling, but both would draw on it extensively as source materialfor their writing.It would be wrong, however, to think of Blackwood as an occultist proper; he ismuch more of a mystic, and his best writing conveys a sense of the `unknownmodes of being' that Wordsworth and his fellow Romantics saw in nature.Blackwood's real theme is the expansion of consciousness, and his eager mindfollowed up any possibility of achieving this. Like Wells, he was a friendofJ.W. Dunne, and Dunne had read him extracts of his book An Experiment WithTime before its publication. (A respected engineer, Dunne held off publishingfor fear of being thought a crank.) Through recording his dreams, Dunne becameaware that he often dreamt of future events. Dunne later developed his notion of`the serial universe', in which an infinite series of `me's' exist in paralleltimes. Blackwood met Dunne in 1925 and the friendship produced several storiesdealing with kinks in time, but along with Dunne, and aside from Blackwood's ownspeculations, a central influence on his `space and time' tales is P.D.Ouspensky.Through the courtesy of Lady Rothermere - estranged wife of Lord Rothermere, thenewspaper baron, and devoted reader of Ouspensky's bestselling book ofmetaphysics, Tertium Organum\" - Ouspensky escaped the refugee life of WhiteRussian Constantinople, and in 1921 arrived in London, the \"intellectual flavourof the month.\" Along with the other literary stars attending Ouspensky'slectures at Lady Rothermere's St. Johns Wood salon was Blackwood. But althoughBlackwood thought highly of Tertium Organum, he was less impressed withOuspensky himself, finding his lectures dull. When Blackwood remarked on this,Ouspensky suggested he go to France and work directly with Gurdjieff, the sourceof the ideas, then setting up his `Prieure' in Fontainebleau. Blackwood did, andfor the next two years Blackwood made frequent visits to Gurdjiefl's Institutefor the Harmonious Development of Man. He was not the only literary guest:others included Sinclair Lewis, A.R. Orage - who, after Ouspensky, becameGurdjieff's right-hand man - and, famously, Katharine Mansfield, who died therein 1922. Blackwood eventually had his fill of Gurdjieff as well, and on his lastvisit found a reading of Gurdjieff's enormous Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson(1950) an exercise in \"sheer megalomania,\" suggesting \"paranoia.\"Gurdjieff's and Ouspensky's ideas, however, came into his work, most notably ina late collection of stories, Shocks (1935). In the Gurdjieff \"work,\" `shocks'is a technical term, describing certain influences that help in `waking up'.'Waking up' is the central aim of Gurdjieff's teaching, and the idea that we arenot truly awake surfaces in many of Blackwood's tales. In \"The Pikestaffe Case\"(Tongues of Fire (1924)), a teacher of higher mathematics and his student travelinto the fourth dimension, encountering difficulties on the way. \"I woke at 4o'clock\" one writes to the other. \"About ten minutes later, as you said mighthappen, I woke a second time. The change into the second state was as great asthe change from sleeping to waking ... But I could not remain `awake' ...\" In\"Elsewhere and Otherwise\" - Blackwood's longest excursion into higher space - hespeaks of horror as a \"negative emo tion,\" another direct term from Gurdjieff.Mantravers, the central character, has spent a moment in the fourth dimension,amounting to four years in linear time. When he suddenly returns, he feels therestrictions of mundane life. \"The cage is about me, the stupid, futile cage,\"he cries. \"It's time that does it, it's your childish linear time, time in asingle line. In such a limited state it's not even being awake, just trivialdreaming, almost death ...\" Mantravers' colleague in the higher realms is acertain Dr. Vronski, known for his experiments with \"glands, hypnotism, yoga,\"all ofwhich Ouspensky wrote about. And later, when the narrator finds himself ina German prisoner of war camp, he meets a Russian professor who speaks to himabout the different dimensions of time ... In the title story, \"Shocks,\" a youngpoet receives a mysterious legacy of five thousand pounds a year. \". . .shocks,\" he remarks \"drive one explosively out of an accustomed rut. I'dwillingly give my last ten years of living in a rut - crystallized - for theblessed shocks of this single, brief little hour.\" Along with `shocks',`crystallized' is another Gurdjieff term, denoting a consciousness almostirredeemably sunk in `sleep', although Gurdjiefl's own shocks generally came ina less desirable form.LORD DUNSANYIn 1905 a strange little volume appeared on the London bookstalls. Published byElkin Mathews at the author's expense, its title was The Gods of Pegana, and inits pages, elegantly illustrated by the artist Sidney H. Sime, readers wereintroduced to a hitherto completely unknown pantheon. Mana-Yood-Sushai, Mung,Sish, Skarl, Roon, Slid and other weird, unfamiliar names rose out of theorotund, biblical sentences. Flush with archaic, lapidary prose their rolling,rhythmic flow had a curiously dreamlike effect. Halfforgotten memories ofancient lands and lost worlds, of mystical gods and timeless goddesses, driftedthrough the sonorous, perfumed language, the effect being something like that ofa dose of opium. Yet there was also something else, a sense of melancholy, aworld weariness, pessimism even. These tales were of gods who were no more.Voluptuous, regal, these jewelled prose poems spoke of the passing of beingswhose beauty and magnificence were more than superhuman, and yet they too cameat last to an end.The moral, if there was one, seemed to be that in this land of shadows, even theimmortals must decline. Life, existence, the entire universe was merely anentertaining pastime, a game set to occupy the idle minds of bored, indifferentdeities, who occasionally put away the pieces until sheer ennui brought them outagain. Schopenhauer had said it before, as did Wagner. It was a theme wellsuited to the sophisticated decadence of the late fin de siecle, and here it wasin a beautiful, slim package.The author of these tales, however, was no mystical dreamer or drug addictedoccultist labouring away in a freezing garret. Born in 1878 at his family estatein County Meath, Ireland, Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett - better known asLord Dunsany - was the 18th Baron Dunsany, the proud inheritor of one of themost ancient baronial titles in the British Isles. He was also a Conservativecandidate in his constituency, the owner of 1,400 acres, a big game hunter,sportsman, traveller and veteran of the Boer War. Educated at Eton andSandhurst, Dunsany in many ways had the kind of aristocratic life that Villiersde l'Isle-Adam had only dreamt of, and it is perhaps because of this that hiswriting, popular in his lifetime, is now, aside from weird fantasy enthusiasts,mostly forgotten. After publishing The Gods of Pegana Dunsany put aside anythoughts about politics - he was, after all, only drawn to it because he thoughthe had to do something - and became a full time writer. Yet, although hepublished stories, poems, plays, novels, essays and autobiographies well intothe 1950s - at one time five of Dunsany's plays were on Broadway simultaneously- writing for Dunsany seemed always an amateur activity. He had an intellect, hesaid, but he didn't care to use it, except when playing chess. He may have beentelling the truth: Dunsany once won the chess championship of Ireland, and in1929 even managed to hold the World Champion, Capablanca, to a draw. Yet thisseems to emphasize the point: his mind was only good for playing games, not foranything serious. In fact, one wonders if Dunsany ever took anything seriously.With everything handed to him, he may have had no reason to. As his friend Yeatsdeclared, \"Fifty pounds a year and a drunken mistress\" would have done him well.The picture book nihilism that infuses his stories and plays12 may at the timehave seemed deeply profound. It doesn't today, and for all Dunsany's activity,suggests a kind of laziness. Dunsany never really considered himself a literaryman, even after producing more than sixty titles, and was more at home as asoldier and a hunter. But he had, as the critic E.F. Bleiler remarked, a dubioustalent for turning almost anything into a saleable story: Dunsany once claimedthat he could write a story about the mud of the Thames, and did. But this knackfor `dashing things off' - he wrote quickly with little revision - useful forthe journalist, is deadly for the serious writer. Dunsany's exotic fatalism,reminiscent of Omar Khayyam, is not, as the scholar S.T. Joshi would have it,\"Nietzsche in a fairy tale,\" or if it is, it is a severely truncated Nietzsche,lacking the Ubermensch and Nietzsche's belief in the need to transcend nihilism.Dunsany, who never cared to use his intellect, clearly lacked any beliefs otherthan in the value of sport and fine living. As his biographer wrote of his work,it shows \"a complete lack of interest in any connection with the real world . ..\" Dunsany \"had a remarkable lack of curiosity about people\" and \"saw the worldalmost entirely in terms of himself and his reactions ... He had no interest ininjecting a message or indeed any thought ...s13 Dunsany once defined genius as\"an infinite capacity for not taking pains. i14 Clearly, by his own account, hepossessed it.Which is not, of course, to say his writing is without merit. The Gods ofPegana, Time and The Gods (1906), A Dreamer's Tales (1910), are beautiful, in acloisonne sort of way. Yet like sweets or caviar, a small amount satisfies; morethan this and one wants meatier stuff. What remains of Dunsany's enormous outputare these early fantastic tales, whose atmosphere is inimitable, and whoseinfluence on subsequent fantasists can hardly be exaggerated. Lovecraft,Tolkien, Eddison, and the other names making up the adult fantasy canon, wouldnot have had a genre to work in, if Dunsany hadn't created it.Like Wells, Dunsany wasn't an occultist, and his story, \"The Hashish Man\" (ADreamer's Tales), seems to me a possible spoof on the practice of using hashishas a means of stimulating `astral travel', indulged in by his friend Yeats.Another magician who appreciate Dunsany's work was Aleister Crowley. On reading\"The Hashish Man\" the Great Beast wrote its author a fan letter, a rareoccurrence indeed. Crowley's only criticism was that Dunsany had obviously nottried the drug himself. \"I see you only know it (hashish) by hearsay, not byexperience. You have not confused time and space as the true eater does.s15 Withhis letter Crowley enclosed some erotic magazines, perhaps hoping to open theyoung author's mind to other transgressive delights. Dunsany appreciated thepraise, and replied that he never took anything stronger than tea. What he didwith the magazines is unknown.R.M. BUCKEIn 1901 a book with the intriguing title Cosmic Consciousness appeared inPhiladelphia in a limited edition of five hundred copies. Its author was RichardMaurice Bucke, a doctor and former medical superintendent of the asylum for theinsane in London, Ontario. Although at first the book made little impression,interest in its remarkable claim - that humanity was slowly evolving into ahigher level of consciousness - attracted attention, and soon its readersincluded the psychologist William James and the esoteric philosopher P.D.Ouspensky. More than half a century later it had acquired even greaterpopularity. By 1966 Cosmic Consciousness had gone through twenty-six printingsand had become, along with Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha, Aldous Huxley's The Doorsof Perception, and J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of The Rings, part of the canon ofworks inspiring the burgeoning counterculture. Among others, Timothy Leary wasone of its most fervent readers.Bucke's background wasn't what you might expect for the head of an insaneasylum, nor, for that matter, the author of a book arguing that the human racewas moving into a higher state of consciousness. Born in 1837 to English parentswho soon after emigrated to Canada, Bucke left home at seventeen after the deathof his stepmother and spent the next four years involved in dozens ofadventures. Crossing the border into the United States, he travelled across thecountry, working at a variety of jobs. He was a gardener in Ohio, a railway manin Cincinnati, and a deckhand on a Mississippi steamboat, before finally signingon as a driver on a wagon train heading across the Great Plains to the edge ofthe Mormon territory, today part of Nevada. The journey to Salt Lake took fivemonths, and in the 1850s it was a dangerous business. For the last twelvehundred miles there were no white settlements and the Indians, resentful of thewhite man's incursion, were not particularly friendly. After this Bucke crossedthe Rockies, was attacked by Shoshone Indians, and nearly starved, living for atime on flour and hot water. He then settled down as a gold miner. During anattempt to cross a mountain chain in winter, his companion died, and Buckehimself was about to follow when he was discovered by a mining party. Both ofhis feet were frozen, and all of one foot and part of the other had to beamputated. Bucke was twenty-one, and for the rest of his life, he would onlyoccasionally be free from physical pain.An inheritance paid for his medical training in Europe, and in 1864 he settledin Canada. By 1876 he had been appointed superintendent of an asylum for theinsane in Hamilton, Ontario; the next year he moved to London. In 1888 he waselected president of the Psychological Section of the British MedicalAssociation, and in 1890 was given a similar honour by the AmericanMedico-Psychological Association. By the end of the century, Bucke wasconsidered one of North America's foremost `alienists' (an early term forpsychiatrist), and this standing among professionals helped his extraordinaryideas about human evolution gain a hearing they might otherwise have lacked.`Bucke's tenacity and application give the impression of a highly practical,down-to-earth man, suggesting that the picture of him as a philosopher of aradical shift in human consciousness is somewhat incongruous, although theportrait of him in Cosmic Consciousness, with his flowing white beard andlongish hair, does suggest the air of a prophet. Yet there was another side toBucke. Growing up on a backwoods Canadian farm, he developed a sensitivity tonature and experienced a powerful curiosity about the basic mysteries of life.At about the age of ten he felt a strange ecstasy and longing about the notionof death. A voracious reader of poetry, in later life Bucke was known to havememorized whole volumes of it. Bucke's father, a Cambridge graduate, had himselfmastered seven languages, and when he moved his young family from England to thewilds of Ontario he brought with him a library of some thousand volumes. Buckegrew up in an atmosphere of rugged hands-on experience softened by literarydiscussion; more than likely it was this that prepared him for his later work asa visionary and prophet.The first sign of that vocation appeared in 1867 when a visitor to Bucke's homequoted some of the poetry of Walt Whitman. The effect was immediate; Bucke wasbowled over and from that moment considered himself the poet's disciple. Tenyears later Bucke met Whitman and became a central figure in his circle, eventreating Whitman in his medical capacity, successfully, as the poet laterclaimed the doctor saved his life. One of the volumes of poetry Bucke wasreported to know by heart was Whitman's Leaves of Grass.Five years after his introduction to Whitman's poetry, Bucke had the experiencethat set him on his life's work and contributed to the language a phrase mostpeople use without the slightest idea of its origin. At thirty-five, during avisit to England, Bucke had his illumination. After an evening spent readingWordsworth, Shelly, Keats, Browning, and, of course, Whitman, Bucke left hisfriends and settled into his hansom cab for the drive to his hotel. The night ofpoetry had left him calm, his mind full of the ideas and feelings stimulated bythe evening's discussion. He felt himself in a state of \"quiet, almost passive,enjoyment.\"And then it happened:All at once, without warning of any kind, he [Bucke wrote his account in thethird person] found himself wrapped around, as it were, by a flame-colouredcloud. For an instant he thought of fire - some sudden conflagration in thegreat city. The next instant he knew that the light was within himself.Directly after there came upon him a sense of exaltation, of immense joyousness,accompanied or immediately followed by an intellectual illumination quiteimpossible to describe. Into his brain streamed one momentary lightning-flash ofthe Brahmic Splendour which ever since lightened his life. Upon his heart fellone drop of the Brahmic Bliss, leaving thenceforward for always an aftertaste ofHeaven. Among other things he did not come to believe, he saw and knew that theCosmos is not dead matter but a living Presence, that the soul of man isimmortal, that the universe is so built and ordered that without peradventureall things work together for the good of each and all, that the foundationprinciple of the world is what we call love and that the happiness of every oneis in the long run absolutely certain.\"The supreme occurrence of that night,\" Bucke said, was his \"initiation in thenew and higher order of ideas.\" Within a few seconds Bucke learned more than \"inprevious months or years of study,\" as well as \"much that no study could everhave taught.\"\"Nowadays Bucke's experience would be chalked up to the brain's reported \"Godspot\" or, less generously, to temporal lobe epilepsy.'H For Bucke it was thefirst glimpse of the future of humanity.Having experienced the reality of this new consciousness, Bucke looked for otherexamples of it. There were, he believed, at least fourteen cases of it, rangingfrom ancient times to the present. Buddha, Jesus, St. Paul, Plotinus, JacobBoehme, William Blake, and, of course, Walt Whitman are all clear examples offull and complete cosmic consciousness. Others on this list include Balzac,while Emanuel Swedenborg is classed with the \"Lesser, Imperfect and DoubtfulInstances\", which may strike some of us as odd. Some of Bucke's other choicesalso seem questionable, as do some of his remarks about primitive and backwardraces, and his assumption that the Aryans form a recognized higher type. Oneexample of cosmic consciousness that Bucke was certain of was the Edwardianwriter, traveller and vegetarian, Edward Carpenter. Influential in his own timebut little read today, Carpenter is a perfect example of the blend ofprogressive ideas, evolutionary vision, mystical doctrines, and radicallifestyle that characterized the pre-World War I New Age. The author ofWhitmanesque verse - Bucke points to his long poem Towards Democracy as a workin which \"the Cosmic Sense speaks\" - Carpenter was homosexual and an outspokenadvocate of what we would call gay rights (Carpenter's own term was \"homogeniclove\"). It's unclear how much Bucke knew or understood of this side ofCarpenter's life. Carpenter himself is alleged to have had sexual relations withWhitman and, toward the end of his life, with the astrologer Gavin Arthur, laterwell known in the 1960s as the popularizer of the Age of Aquarius.'9 In FromAdam's Peak to Elephanta, an account of his travels in India, Carpenter gives anextended description of \"consciousness without thought,\" and relates it toseveral themes that will be picked up later by Ouspensky, such as the fourthdimension. Unusual states of consciousness weren't the only things Carpenter wasknown for: he also has the distinction of being the first man in England topopularize sandals.Bucke's optimism about the evolution of consciousness was parallelled by anequal assurance in our material perfection. The 20th century would, he believed,see human life transformed by the conquest of the air - just getting off theground at Kitty Hawk - and the triumph of socialism. \"The immediate future ofour race,\" he wrote, \"is indescribably hopeful. ,211 It may have been a blessingfor Bucke that he was not around to see the Old World collapse less than twodecades later. In February 1902, after an evening discussing the theory thatFrancis Bacon was the real author of the Shakespeare plays - Bucke firmlybelieved he was - he slipped on some ice while gazing at the night sky from hisveranda. He fell, hitting his head violently against a pillar, and died almostimmediately.PD. OUSPENSKYAlthough to most readers Peter Demian Ouspensky is known, if at all, as the mostarticulate disciple of the enigmatic G.I. Gurdjieff, he was in his own right athinker of considerable merit, and it is possible that his meeting with thatremarkable man was perhaps the worst thing that ever happened to him21. Afterbreaking with Gurdjieff in 1924, Ouspensky set himself up in London as a teacherof Gurdjieff's ideas, disseminating them in a dry, professorial manner to thelikes of Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, Christopher Isherwood, T.S. Eliot andAlgernon Blackwood.22 The situation may seem strange; but as Ouspensky himselfpoints out in his posthumously published In Search of the Miraculous (1949), anaccount of his early years with Gurdjieff, by 1917 - two years after theirinitial meeting in a seedy Moscow cafe - he had begun to separate the manGurdjieff from his teaching, finding fault with the former, but maintaining theimportance of the later. Yet, in 1947, just months before his death, brought onby heavy drinking, Ouspensky held a series of talks that have gone down aslegendary in the history of \"the work,\" the name given to Gurdjiefl's peculiarsystem of \"harmonious development.\" Returning to a post-war London after sittingout the Blitz in the US, Ouspensky shocked his audience by repudiating thesystem he had devoted more than twenty-five years to propagating. All of theretinue of \"work\" ideas: \"selfremembering,\" \"sleep,\" our different \"I's,\" thefact that we are all \"machines,\" were denied by the aged and ailing master.Ouspensky rejected the teaching he had given his life to, and advised hislisteners to think for themselves. The effect was electrifying. After his death,around which hovered strange circumstances and paranormal events, many of hisstudents, rudderless, eventually found their way to Gurdjieff, the very man thatOuspensky had warned them against and over whom, no doubt, he had lost muchsleep. To this day the relationship between the two is the stuff of myth andpsychodrama, with Ouspensky cast as a treacherous Judas, stealing his guru'steaching, and Gurdjieff playing the black magician, power mad and insatiable,intent on dominating all around him.That Ouspensky made such a profound volte face was not unusual for him. He is,if not unique, certainly one of the most self-critical and painfully honest, aswell as readable, writers on esotericism. Having once adopted Gurdjiefl'saustere and unromantic ideas, Ouspensky looked back on his earlier self withsome disparagement, calling his Tertium Organum, the book that made hisreputation, a weakness. Yet it is this book, more than any other, thatcommunicates the best in Ouspensky: his vital, questing mind and fieryenthusiasm. All of his other works share a certain pessimism, perhaps mostobvious in the theme of his single novel Strange Life of Ivan Osokin(1915-1949), which is a working of Nietzsche's doctrine of eternal recurrence,the idea that we live our lives over and over again. As a child in Moscow, wherehe was born in 1878, Ouspensky early on had powerful experiences of dejd vu,that strange feeling that \"I have been here before.\" Today, most clinicalpsychologists root this in crossed wires in the brain, but Ouspensky wouldreject such an explanation. To him there was clearly something wrong with ourideas about time.Like Nietzsche, Ouspensky's thought swung between the grim vision of an infiniteseries of himself, eternally making the same mistakes, and the profoundlyoptimistic counterweight of the superman which, in Ouspensky's case, meant abeing endowed with a large helping of Bucke's cosmic consciousness. ThatOuspensky had at least a taste of this is clear from his remarkable essay\"Experimental Mysticism.\" Following William James, Ouspensky engaged in a seriesof experiments with nitrous oxide. In his little room in St. Petersburg, heinhaled the gas, and more than likely experimented with hashish as well, findinghimself thrown into a strange world of living hieroglyphs and weird,inexplicable phenomena. It was his inability to bring back anything concretefrom these experiences that led Ouspensky on his quest to find a teaching thatcould somehow show him the way.There is good reason to believe that when Ouspensky met Gurdjieff, that \"slyman's\" dour doctrine - that man is a machine with only the slimmest possibilityof gaining freedom - combined with Ouspensky's own Romantic worldrejection topush him into an attitude of Stoic resignation. At any rate, he wrote littleafter working with Gurdjieff, and the last book published in his lifetime, A NewModel of the Universe (1931) (which includes \"Experimental Mysticism\"), is acollection of essays originally written in his pre-Gurdjieff days, re-worked andbrought up to date. Many of the chapters deal with themes similar to TertiumOrganum: the fourth dimension, the superman, eternal recurrence, and Ouspensky'sown version of the new physics. But through it all runs the idea of esotericism,the notion that behind the everyday world, we can find traces of a hidden hand,the influence of esoteric schools, whose teaching offer the only hope ofescaping the wheel of life. Ouspensky believed in this idea fiercely, and in hislast days, seeing in Gurdjieff a tainted source, he made plans for journeys intoCentral Asia, the area of the world most likely, he believed, to harbour tracesof the secret schools.These would not be his first journeys to the east. Before meeting Gurdjieff,Ouspensky had acquired a reputation in pre-Revolutionary Moscow and St.Petersburg as a journalist, mostly for his accounts of his search for themiraculous in India, Egypt, Ceylon and Central Asia. Indeed, it is preciselybecause of his reputation that Gurdjieff had him ensnared. Returning to Moscowafter his fruitless search for schools, Ouspensky was astounded to discover asource of the secret teaching right in his own backyard. Yet, while downingglasses of Montrachet in his last, lonely days, Ouspensky often thoughtnostalgically of his early years in Russia, before he met Gurdjieff, when hislectures on the superman or the fourth dimension would draw thousands oflisteners. He would also remember his late night sessions at St. Petersburg'sStray Dog Cafe, a meeting place for Symbolist poets and other members of theavant garde, and the place where Ouspensky rubbed shoulders with the likes ofAnna Akmahtova. It was the same milieu as that of Briusov and, another writer wewill meet shortly, Andrei Bely. Had Ouspensky not cast in his lot withGurdjieff, there is good reason to believe that he would be spoken of today inthe same breath as Berdyaev, Merzhkovsky and Soloviev. As it is, the influenceof Tertium Organum on the Russian avant garde has, in recent years, receivedmore attention. Among other painters, Kasimir Malevich was influenced byOuspensky's writing on higher space, and even Berdyaev, who was very critical ofthe occult influence of Rudolf Steiner on the Russian intelligentsia, spoke ofOuspensky as the only theosophical writer worth reading.The youthful Ouspensky had a poetic soul, a romantic, vulnerable side that comesout in his early writings, like the collection of stories translated as TalksWith The Devil (1916-1973). It also appears in one of his earliest books, TheSymbolism of the Tarot originally published in Russia in 1911. Combining hisideas on time, consciousness and secret knowledge, this series of poetic prosesketches was later reworked and included as a chapter in A New Model of theUniverse. Yet, as some commentators have remarked, it is in striking contrast tohis more rigorous, stern dicta on recurrence, sex and the laws of Manu. Perhapsthe strict taskmaster of \"the work\" could not let go of his earlier, more humanself.Like many drawn to the occult tradition, Ouspensky thought little of socialismand other egalitarian movements. Disagreeing with Bucke's democratic view ofcosmic consciousness, he argued that the superman would be a product of highculture, not an inevitable advance of the race. Crossing Russia during theRevolution, Ouspensky had an opportunity to consider these ideas. Separated fromGurdjieff by the warring White and Red armies, stranded in the backwater ofEkaterinodar, Ouspensky wrote a series of Letters from Russia, published in A.R.Orage's journal The New Age. His account of looting, murder and other atrocitiesperpetrated by the Bolsheviks was sobering reading for many sympathetic to theSoviet experiment. Reaching Constantinople in 1920, Ouspensky never set foot inRussia again. Throughout his years as an exile he maintained a fierce,implacable hatred of bolshevism, seeing in it the most vile example of the\"history of crime,\" a virulent barbarism intent on overthrowing what was left ofwestern culture. Ouspensky however had no love for the czarist regime; in 1905his beloved sister was arrested as a dissident and locked up in the BoutirskyPrison in Moscow, where she died. It was grim realities like these that drovehim to reading works on occultism while working as a journalist on a Moscownewspaper, and led him, eventually, on his long search for the miraculous.ALEISTER CROWLEYThe most notorious magician of the 20th century was born Edward AlexanderCrowley on 12 October 1875 in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire; he later transformedhimself to Aleister to avoid sharing a name with his father,23 one of manytransformations throughout a long and turbulent career. Between his coming ofage and his death in 1947, Crowley adopted a whole series of other selves. Therewas, for example, Brother Perdurabo. There were also the Laird of Boleskine,Prince Chioa Khan, Count Svareff, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu, and Simon Iff. If we counthis identity with his `higher self', there was also Aiwass, a supernatural beingfrom another dimension, approachable through sex, drugs and magical ritual.Bringing in the many individuals Crowley claimed to have been in past lives -like Cagliostro and Eliphas Levi - swells the ranks even further. But it was thenickname given him by his puritanical Plymouth Brethren mother that set thecourse of Crowley's life. Rebelling against an arid fundamentalism, Edward soangered his mother that she called him the Great Beast 666 from the Book ofRevelations. Crowley agreed and acted accordingly. This petulant spitefulnessremained throughout his life. Along with an ability to justify all of hisactions, it created an ego impervious to criticism. Crowley believed in himselfand in his mission, which often enough were identical. His mother didn't knowwhat she unleashed upon the world.Crowley's history has been told several times24. Since his revival in the late1960s (both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were impressed by him) andadoption by the devotees of heavy metal, he's achieved a posthumous notorietythat far exceeds the infamy of his day. Today, \"Do what thou wilt,\" the catchphrase of Crowley's religion of thelema, is teenage lingo. As his own plungeinto sex and sadism was prompted by his intolerable upbringing, Crowley'sphilosophy of indulgence appeals to the young, hemmed in by parentalrestrictions. Most people, however, get through this phase and adjust to life.Crowley made a religion of it, with himself, the Master Therion (the Great Beastin Greek), as high priest and deity.Crowley absorbed an enormous amount of experience. He climbed the Himalayas,walked across China, learned several languages, squandered a fortune, andbelonged to several occult orders. He took a startling amount of drugs, and haderotic relations with members of both sex in a variety of ways and places, was achess champion, wrote German propaganda during WWI and enjoyed the raredistinction of having his own magical abbey shut down by Mussolini. He was alsoin and out of the tabloids during the 1920s and 30s, and earned the tag of \"thewickedest man in the world.\" Though technically not a black magician, there waslittle of the light about him, and as most accounts of his life relate, he lefta trail of madness and shattered lives. Few close to him emerged unharmed.As mentioned earlier, Crowley became interested in magic (or `magick', as hewould spell it) through a book of A.E. Waite's. Later, after readingEckharthausen's The Cloud upon the Sanctuary, he became obsessed with the ideaof a secret magical order. In 1898, while on a skiing trip in Switzerland, hemet the chemist Julian L. Baker who introduced him to George Cecil Jones. It wasthrough Jones that Crowley became a member of the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, initiated into the society as Brother Perdurabo, \"one who will endure tothe finish.\"For the rest of his life, Crowley devoted himself to rehabilitating thereputation of magick. First, through study and mastery of a variety of occultarts, mostly Kabbalah and cere monial magic; then through the propagation of hisreligion. Initially called Crowleyanity - an obvious dig at Christianity - thenthelema, the teaching came to him in the revelation of The Book of the Law inCairo in 1904. Leaving the Golden Dawn in 1900, Crowley avoided magic for sometime and turned his mind to Buddhism and meditation. Inheriting a considerablefortune, he threw himself into his other loves, travel and mountaineering.Crowley was a good, if unorthodox mountaineer; his ascent of Chogo-Ri in theHimalayas, the world's second highest mountain, though a failure, is impressive.But his later attempt on Kanchenjunga ended in ignominy, when he refused to helpmembers of his party who had met with an accident. Crowley left them to theirfate and several men died. He then excused himself in a spate of self-justifyingnewspaper articles, after withdrawing all of the expedition's funds from thebank.In 1904, as mentioned, Crowley received a communication from the Secret Chiefs,his version of Blavatsky's hidden masters. Through the medium of his first wifeRose - who later died a dipsomaniac - Crowley received the sacred text of hisreligion, the aforementioned Book of the Law. On 8 April a voice spoke out ofthe air in his hotel room in Cairo, revealing the new Word of the Aeon. He wroteat a feverish pace, capturing the doctrine he spent the rest of his lifeadvocating. It was a heady blend of Nietzsche and de Slide, served up in fin desiecle prose, and assorted Egyptian motifs. Crowley convinced himself, and latermany others, that it prophesised the dawning of a new age, and that he was itsreluctant avatar.Crowley claimed that the Book of the Law was unlike any of his previous writingsand clearly showed an alien hand. Any reader of Crowley's poetry will find thisdifficult to accept. By the time he received the Book of the Law, Crowley hadalready distinguished himself as a poet - at least to his own satisfaction -with several elegant, if self-published volumes. His first, Alcedema, A Place toBury Strangers In, by \"a gentleman of the University of Cambridge,\" wasprivately printed in 1898 in an edition of one hundred copies. The poem is along exercise in blasphemy, degradation and masochism; the title refers to thefield bought with Judas' thirty pieces of silver. With this first effort Crowleybelieved he had \"attained, at a bound, the summit of Parnassus.\" The book,however, was not well received. A few other gentlemen of the University ofCambridge read it, and remarked that it should not be shown to the young.Undeterred (more likely encouraged) Crowley went on to produce poetry for therest of his life. He wrote Swinburnian odes well into the heyday of modernismand seems not to have paid much attention to any poetry written after Wilde.Crowley's choice of nom de plume for his first published work was an homage toShelley's The Necessity of Atheism, whose author was \"a gentleman of theUniversity of Oxford.\" Crowley had a habit of associating himself with thegreats of English literature; of his birthplace he famously said that it was \"astrange coincidence that one small county should have given England her twogreatest poets - for one must not forget Shakespeare. \"25 The humour is typical,as is the inordinate self-esteem, suggesting in fact a sense of inferiority, oneso great that even becoming a god did not quite compensate for it. (Crowleybelieved he had become a god in 1921, when he reached the magical rank ofIpsissimus). Every writer is touchy about his work, but Crowley was positivelyparanoid. When he brought the proofs of his verse play Jephthah (1898) (anotherprivately printed work) to show his magical brother Yeats, he was crestfallen atthe poet's unenthusiastic response. \"He forced himself to utter a few politeconventionalities,\" Crowley recalled, but Frater Perdurabo could see through thesham. It was obvious that \"black, bilious rage shook him to the soul.\" Thereason? Yeats had obviously recognized in Crowley's work the hand of a poet muchgreater than himself...Jephthah, like much of Crowley's poetry, is fairly tough reading. It is not, ashis biographer Martin Booth remarks, \"true poetry, which, at its best, has thatindefinable substance in it, that certain untouchable quality of the soul ...X26 Except for a few pieces, Crowley's poetry is mostly derivative and secondrate, when it is not downright pornographic and nasty, as is his highlycollectable collection White Stains (1898). Crowley, however, thought so well ofhis verse that in 1907 he published (privately again) his Collected Works. Tostimulate notice, he offered a £100 prize for the best critical essay on hisoeuvre. The announcement for the competition is typical:The Chance of the Year!The Chance of the Century!!The Chance of the Geological Period!!!Two years passed before anyone responded. Captain J.F.C. Fuller's effusive TheStar of the West, which proclaimed that \"Crowley is more than a new-bornDionysus, he is more than a Blake, a Rabelais, or a Heine ...\" won hands down.Being the only entry, that was not difficult. Fuller became one of the earlythelemites and Crowley, notorious for his meanness, neglected to pay him hisprize. Later a noted military historian, Fuller had a thing for charismatic men,and was the only Englishman to attend Adolf Hitler's fiftieth birthday party.Crowley, however, can be readable, especially when he is talking about himself,a good trait in a raconteur, but deadly in a poet. His massive Confessions(complete edition 1969) exhibits the same megalomania (Crowley called it an\"autohagiography\"), yet it is entertaining and in places displays insight. Histwo occult novels, Diary of a Drug Fiend (1922), a fictionalized account of hisAbbey of Thelema, and Moonchild (1929), a spiteful dig at the Golden Dawn, areenjoyable. Even some of the strictly magical texts, like the early Book Four(1911) and the later Eight Lectures on Yoga (1939) present no problems to theinterested student, unlike his impenetrable magnum opus, Magick in Theory andPractice (1929), which fails in its attempt to bring his message to the averagereader, who hasn't the slightest idea what he's talking about. It's in thiswork, however, that perhaps his best poem makes an importance appearance.Crowley's Hymn to Pan was first published in his magical magazine The Equinox,original issues of which are now highly collectable and fetch considerable sums.To have included it in his message to the world attests to the importance it hadfor its author. It is a highly effective piece of incantatory writing. Best readaloud, its succeeds admirably in evoking a sense of an impending crisis: theappearance of the ancient god of madness. Today it is often used by Crowley'sdevotees in their rituals, and it was read, much to the consternation of thecity council, by Crowley's friend Louis Wilkinson, in Brighton on 5 December1947, when Crowley was cremated. Wilkinson, a friend of another magical writer,John Cowper Powys (and as Louis Marlow, author of the Ouspenskyean novel TheDevil in Crystal (1944)), was originally supposed to read the whole of The Bookof the Law over Crowley's coffin. At the last minute, he quite rightly choseinstead this moving, memorable paean to his departed friend's favourite deity.Crowley's relationship with other poets is curious. We've seen his reaction toYeats. His most well known literary association was with the poet VictorNeuberg, with whom Crowley engaged in homosexual magic in North Africa and otherplaces, evoking the demon Choronzon. Neuberg was understandably shaken by theaffair and, like many involved with Crowley, came away from their associationdamaged.27 Outside of magical circles, Neuberg is practically unknown today,although he has a small niche in literary history as the man who discoveredDylan Thomas. Crowley seemed to have had a negative effect on Neuberg's protegeas well, chasing Thomas out of a London pub with a feat of clairvoyance.Strangely, although no friend of modernism, Crowley's work had a powerful effecton the eccentric Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, today recognized as one of thecentral figures in European modernism, and who, like Crowley, had a penchant forother identities. The two corresponded on magical matters, but Pessoa is mostknown to Crowleyites as the man who helped the Great Beast fake a suicide inLisbon. Pessoa himself was a highly hermetic writer, and his contribution to theoccult will be looked at in the book's concluding essay.ARTHUR MACHENThe career of Arthur Machen is enough to make any wouldbe writer think twiceabout the prospects of making a living with his pen. With the exception of HenryMiller, I can think of no one who so self-consciously set himself the task ofbecoming a writer and who wrote so much about the process. Yet, unlike hisbrother in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Machen never achieved the kindof popularity enjoyed by Algernon Blackwood. The brief spurt of literary famethat did come his way in the 1920s, though appreciative of his genius, did nothelp him financially. Throughout his life Machen never quite escaped the povertyof his childhood. All accounts of him depict a robust, life-affirming character- Chestertonian in outlook and girth - full of contempt for the modern age, butthankful for life's small pleasures. Yet there is a grim, stoic atmospherearound Machen; with Blake he shares the poet's ability to maintain a much neededself-belief in the face of almost universal ignorance. Today he is known only toaficionados of the Golden Dawn and connoisseurs of gaslight and horror, thoughhe is perhaps, more than any other, the writer for whom London was the mostmystical arcana of all.Arthur Machen21 was born Arthur Llewelyn Jones on 3 March 1863 inCaerleon-on-Usk, Gwent, and died in St. Joseph's Nursing Home, Beaconsfield, on15 December 1947. He was eighty-four. Like many writers Arthur was a dreamy,solitary child, and he spent his early years reading and wandering in hisbeloved Welsh countryside. Literature, ancient ruins, the beauties of nature andthe sense that behind them lay some vast secret - the basic occult sensibility -were the strongest influences on him. A good student, in 1880 at seventeenArthur had to leave school because his impoverished clergyman father could notafford the fees. That same year he. made his first visit to London, where hefailed the preliminary examination for the Royal College of Surgeons. It wasalso at this time that he adopted Machen, his mother's maiden name, and decidedthat he wanted to become a writer. One hundred copies of a first attempt,Eleusinia, a long poem about the ancient Greek mystery tradition, was publishedthe next year, and on the strength of this Machen's parents believed his fortunelay in journalism. He was sent to London again to Iearn the trade.He failed then too, and found work as a publisher's clerk and then a tutor, butoddly enough, for most of his life Machen did earn his living as a journalist,working on a number of London papers. It's difficult to see the Celtic mysticMachen in the cutthroat world of Fleet Street, but from 1909 until the '20s,Machen was a regular figure there, in his Inverness cape, felt hat and nearlyshoulder-length white hair.29 Machen later said that having to write under adeadline eventually helped him to a mastery of style. A look at his later workshows less of a love for fine writing, the hurdle most modern readers hit inapproaching him. However, it's the early decadent Machen that is the focus of afiercely devoted cult.Machen's early years in London were an exercise in patience, endurance and want.Living alone in a tiny room on tea, bread and tobacco, Machen found himself in asprawling, impersonal metropolis, his only escape his long, rambling walksthrough the city's interminable streets, recounted in books like Things Near andFar (1923) and The London Adventure (1924). Other would-be writers who launchedthemselves on the capital seemed to have their way made easy through friends,acquaintances, and family. Machen had none of this; what was worse, he felt adeadening inability to transfer the insights of his imagination onto the page.He was gripped by a \"stuttering awkwardness\" whenever he thought of \"attemptingthe great speech of literature . . . \" This excruciating pressure crushes mostaspiring artists, as it does the hero of Machen's novel The Hill of Dreams(1907). To Machen's credit, he stuck to his dream and eventually made it cometrue.From 1883 to 1890 Machen worked at becoming a man of letters, producing severalbooks and translations, including the twelve volume Memoirs of]acques Casanova,now the standard edition. In 1884 he was hired to catalogue a collection ofoccult texts, and it was this, as well as his meeting with A.E. Waite a fewyears later, that turned his thoughts to magic. Then, in 1890, Machen had hisbreakthrough. The first chapter of his macabre tale The Great God Pan waspublished in a literary journal, The Whirlwind; two years later it appeared inbook form, along with- another weird story, \"The Inmost Light.\" It was more asuccess d'estime than a financial one, but even here Machen found himselfrunning up against difficulties. Machen's story recounts a gruesome tale of ascientist's attempts to dissolve the veil of the external world, and reveal thesecret of reality. In order to do this he performs a brain operation on a younggirl. Predictably, the results are shattering: she has a vision of the great godPan, goes mad and is put in an asylum, where she eventually dies. Not, however,before giving birth to a beautiful daughter, the product of her union with theobject of her mind-blowing vision. In later years the girl becomes an evil femmefatale, triggering a rash of suicides in Victorian London.The story made Machen's name, but his notoriety was not always welcome. WhileThe Great God Pan found friends among the decadents it outraged moreconservative critics and readers. Oscar Wilde, Machen's occasional diningcompanion and his only real link to the decadent movement, called it un grandsucces.30 But not everyone agreed. The Westminster Gazette called it \"anincoherent nightmare of sex.\" For the Manchester Guardian it was \". . . the mostacutely and intentionally disagreeable (book) we have yet seen in English.\"Other mainstream papers offered a similar response. A literary agent Machen metat the time remarked that while having tea with \"some ladies in Hampstead\" hementioned his story \"and their opinion seemed to be that ... The Great God Panshould never have been written.\" They were not alone. Although its shockingeffects seem dated today, in the Yellow Nineties, Machen's tale entereddangerous territory. He had `arrived', but the philistinism he would bash hishead against for the rest of his life was undeterred.Machen continued to write, and it's in this period - 1890-1900 - that his mostcharacteristic work appears. Other strange stories, like \"The White People\" and\"The Shining Pyramid,\" as well as his Stevensonian novel The Three Impostors(1895), earned Machen an enduring place in the history of weird fiction. It'snow that his basic theme emerges: that beneath the veneer of modern civilizationlie ancient, atavistic forces that man encounters at his peril. It was a themethat H.P. Lovecraft, a great fan of Machen, would later adopt in the stories inhis `Cthulhu Mythos'. Although they were quite different characters - Machen areligious man and Lovecraft an atheist - Machen and Lovecraft shared a profounddisgust with the modern world, and in their tales there is a feeling that theyare, at least in part, getting back at a civilization they find revolting.(Blackwood, however, who Lovecraft also thought highly of, and who also believedin a lost, primal world, never gives quite the same impression; the strangeforces his protagonists encounter, even when destructive, produce a sense ofwonder, not horror.) Much of Machen's early writing seems prompted more by hisrejection of the visible world than by his belief in a hidden mystical reality,a theme, we know, shared by many Romantics.In 1899 Machen's first wife died of cancer. Understandably he was crushed. Thedepression led to a creative block, and Machen gave up writing. He joined theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, took an extreme dislike to Aleister Crowley,and soon left to take up a new career as an actor. For the next eight yearsMachen played minor Shakespearian roles in Frank Benson's stage company. Then,in 1909, he turned to journalism and later, in the 1920s, autobiography. In the1930s, prompted by financial need, he turned his hand to fiction again,producing a few minor works, but the earlier spark had fled. Ironically, whilehe felt creatively drained, his early stories were enjoying a vogue in the US.In 1918 Vincent Starret published Arthur Machen: A Novelist of Ecstasy and Sin.Decadence had reached the States and a Machen craze ensued. New editions of hisworks appeared and he was celebrated by writers like Carl Van Vechten and JamesBranch Cabell. Machen was dubbed \"the flower-tunicked priest of nightmare\" andseen as the equal of his beloved Poe and De Quincey. One work in particular wassingled out for praise as the \"most decadent book in all of English literature.\"It was Machen's early novel The Hill of Dreams.Although written in 1897, during Machen's most creative decade, The Hill ofDreams would not find a publisher until 1907. The reason is simple: if not themost decadent book in all of English literature, it's certainly a goodcandidate; the scenes of self-flagellation alone suggest that. Its ironic thatit took a decade to find a publisher: in writing the book, Machen wasconsciously attempting to fashion a new style. The Three Impostors, afascinating, if erratic occult adventure, met with even more criticism than TheGreat God Pan. The book was a commercial failure, and Machen, seen as merely asecond-rate. Stevenson, was determined to recreate himself as a writer. Drawingon his own harrowing early days in London, Machen set out to write a \"RobinsonCrusoe of the soul,\" a book that would embody the aesthetic philosophy that hewould later spell out in his work of literary criticism, Hieroglyphics (1906):the belief that ecstasy, not fidelity to life, was the touchstone of realliterature.Though a slim novel the work took Machen two years to finish, and it's possiblethat in depicting his own descent into hell through the figure of Lucian Taylor,Machen worked off some of his hatred of modernity. At any rate, the frisson ofhorror and decadence is less apparent in his later writings, the mystical lightless tinted by the demonic. He had, I think, got through some of his worldrejection, and in his imagination worked out the fate of an individual whoadopts Axel's attitude toward life, yet lacks the spiritual stamina to putsomething in its place. Like Brother Serapion, Lucian lifts anchor on reality,and embarks on a dream voyage. Unlike Brother Serapion, he found no safe harbourin a monastery and slowly goes under. Increasingly, the qualities that setLucian apart from other people, his genius and sensitivity, draw him into anunderworld of his own dreams, visions and fantasies, until eventually his linkwith the world is severed. The Hill of Dreams has its roots in The Golden FlowerPot, and depicts a third choice along with the foot of the cross and the barrelof a gun: madness.GUY DE MAUPASSANTAlthough known for the most part as a laconic and cynical chronicler oflate-19th century French manners, Guy De Maupassant had a lifelong obsessionwith madness and death. This later emerged in a series of gruesome anddisturbing supernatural tales, whose mood is quite unlike that of his morefamous stories, like \"La Parure\" and \"Soule-de-suif.\" Some commentators suggestMaupassant's morbidity started with the mummified hand of a parricide given tohim at fourteen by the poet Swinburne. If Swinburne thought it an appropriategift, however, he must have known Maupassant already had a taste for such items.Maupassant grew up in a household familiar with mental abnormality. His mothersuffered from a variety of neurotic and hysterical complaints, and his youngerbrother Herve had an unstable personality and would eventually die insane. ThatMaupassant himself would succumb to the same fate suggests that in some way hisfascination with madness and premature death was an intuition of what lay ahead.Guy De Maupassant was born in Chateau de Miromesnil, near Dieppe in Normandy on5 August 1850. His father, the son of a successful business man, was a handsomeamateur painter who had a reputation as a dandy. His mother, a brilliant andstrong willed neurotic, was equally well off but more cultivated than herhusband. She had an interest in philosophy and literature and was a friend ofthe novelist Gustave Flaubert, later the young writer's mentor. At Guy's birththe doctor gave his head a vigorous massage, rounding it off like a pot with atwirl of his thumb. This, he said, would ensure an active brain and a firstrate-intelligence. Whether it was the doctor's handiwork or not, Guy grew up avery bright little boy. His parent's relationship, however, was crumbling, andat the age of six, Guy's father left him and his younger brother to be broughtup by his mother. Extremely territorial, she would prove to be the strongestinfluence on his life. In later life Maupassant saw women as things to beenjoyed - he was an obsessive seducer - and his stories have a strong misogyniststreak, and often depict the weakness of a negligent father.At thirteen Maupassant was sent to a seminary near Rouen; here he spent threeunhappy years before being expelled. In his teens he came under the influence ofthe poet Louis Bouillet who introduced him to Flaubert's circle. After finishingat the lycee Maupassant saw service in the FrancoPrussian war and many of hisstories depict the cruelty and stupidity he experienced during this time; it wasprobably then that he developed his lifelong pessimism, corroborated by areading of Schopenhauer. (He would later write to a friend \"On certain days Iexperience the horror of everything that is . . .\") Although writing constantly,under Flaubert's advice Maupassant took a position with the government, workingas a clerk in Paris, and refrained from publishing. He earned a precariousliving and hated the job, but at same time under the master's tutelage helearned his craft. For the next ten years, Maupassant worked diligently andpatiently at his task. Then, in 1880, only a few weeks before Flaubert's death,his first book appeared.Maupassant's story, \"Soule de suif,\" appeared in the collection Les Soirees deMedan, published under the auspices of Emile Zola. (J.K.Huysmans was also acontributor.) The book was a success and Maupassant's story was singled out as amasterpiece. His introduction to the literary world couldn't have been moredifferent than Arthur Machen's, and almost immediately Maupassant was abestselling author, with newspapers clamouring for his articles. Maupassantquickly made enough money to build a villa in Rouen; he also bought a house forhis mother, and for himself a yacht, on which he spent a good deal of his timesailing.31 A great lover of the physical world - Maupassant in many ways remindsus of Hemingway or Albert Camus - he enjoyed sport, travel and sex. For the nextdecade he worked at a highly lucrative and well publicized career. Callinghimself an industriel des lettres (literature manufacture) he wrote mainly formoney, and produced close to three hundred stories, along with six novels, someplays, travel writings, and hundreds of articles. Yet the beginning of his risealso saw the first signs of the malady that would kill him. During a sailingexcursion on the Seine, Maupassant contracted syphilis. His doctors, however,didn't recognize this and it went untreated; now the first symptoms began toshow. Maupassant's eyes became extremely sensitive, and he took to wearing darkglasses. He complained of \"head pains,\" and took a variety of drugs for relief.For one in particular, ether, he developed a taste, and used it regularly,enjoying its stimulating effects; in a short story, \"Reves\" (\"Dreams\"), hedescribes how under its influence he felt that ,,all mysteries were solved;\" hisbrain \"became a battlefield of ideas\" and he saw himself \"a superior being,armed with an invincible intelligence\" and experienced a \"fierce joy in thediscovery of my power.\" This sense of a powerful superior being would hover inthe background of Maupassant's mind, eventually coalescing into a threateningpresence.Many of Maupassant's horror stories centre on the uncertain borderline betweensanity and madness and question our everyday assumptions about reality. Thetitles themselves suggest this: \"Mad?\", \"Was it a Dream?\", \"Am I Insane?\",\"He?\", \"Who Knows?\". Like many occultists, Maupassant was fascinated with theidea that our senses reveal only a fraction of reality; and like R.M. Bucke,Maupassant believed in a superior `coming race', an evolutionary advance thatwould eventually supplant us. Yet unlike Bucke, Maupassant did not believe thatthis super race was a future development that would arise out of presenthumanity, but that it already exists in a dimension or sphere unperceived andhence unknown to us. Superior beings already share the planet, and are preparingour downfall. Where many saw higher space as a region of wonder and insight,Maupassant recognized it as the source of a threat.The idea that beings exist in a kind of matter or dimension too fine or subtlefor our senses to detect is a familiar one in occultism. Bulwer-Lytton discussesit in Zanoni, as does Poe in his `magnetic tales'. Eliphas Levi talked about itin his reflections on astral light and the notion of a fourth dimension found ahome in the doctrines of spiritualists. Maupassant was a great reader of Poe aswell as of Hoffmann, and he was fascinated by abnormal mental states. In the1880s he attended the psychiatrist J.M. Charcot's famous lectures at theSalpetriere Hospital (as did Sigmund Freud). Journalists, writers and famousactresses would sit enthralled during Charcot's exhibitions of hypnotism andgrande hysterie.32 Maupassant was also fascinated by Mesmer and mesmerism andmesmerists and magnetism appear in several tales. In \"Was He Mad?\" the magnetistJacques Parent is cursed with a kind of telekinetic power, the ability to moveobjects at a distance, and is forced to conceal his hands lest the strange forceoperate against his will. In \"Magnetism\" Maupassant combines his interest instrange forces with his central entertainment, seduction. Here a scepticexplains an apparent precognitive vision leading to a spontaneous eroticencounter as sheer coincidence. For Maupassant, as for Balzac and other earlierRomantics, `magnetism' was a catch-all term for paranormal phenomena, and hereMaupassant links it to the more common animal kind. In \"Who Knows?,\" inanimateobjects move of their own accord, and the phenomena so shatters the narratorthat he puts himself in an asylum, a remarkable intimation of Maupassant's ownfate.Another obsession of Maupassant's was the `double', an `other self who appearsin several of his stories. In \"He?\" a man marries solely in order to avoidsolitude; when alone he is plagued by a vision of his doppelganger. Maupassanthimself told a friend that, \"Every other time I come home, I see my double. Iopen my door, and I see him sitting in my armchair.\" Maupassant was known forhis practical jokes, and this may have been one of them. But it is also possiblethat he suffered from external autoscopy, the phenomena of seeing one's body infront of oneself, and that his abuse of ether and other drugs may have been thesource of this. In any case, the fear of some other who will take over his lifeappears in many of Maupassant's weird tales. With the remaining writers in thissection - August Strindberg, Gustav Meyrink, and Andrei Bely - we can seeMaupassant as a devotee of what we might call psychotic occultism.Like Strindberg (and many others we've seen), Maupassant believed that madnessmight not be a pathological condition, but merely an ultrasensitivity tounperceived phenomena. This, in effect, is a standard Romantic and decadentassumption. In an early version of Maupassant's classic story, \"The Horla,\" thenarrator of \"Letter From a Madman\" explains to his doctor that he \"was on theverge of discovering a secret of the universe.\" He has, he tells him \"seen aninvisible being.\" The experience was frightening and he \"almost died of terror.\"The being, he is sure, is intent on dominating him, and now he waits for itsreturn ... In the final version of \"The Horla,\" Maupassant uses the device of adiary to depict the slow deterioration of the narrator's will and his eventualpath to suicide as the result of his awareness of an invisible creature\". Thetitle itself is suggestive: hors means `outside', but is also the first syllableof horrible. \"Horla\", Maupassant's coinage, may be translated as \"the horror -or horrible thing - from outside.\"34 This tells us that at least forMaupassant's narrator, if not for himself or his readers, the Horla is not acreature of the imagination, but an objective entity, a being that exists in anature or reality that lies beyond our feeble senses. This \"latent world\" is thehome of the Horla, who is now intent on colonizing our dimension .. .How much Maupassant's incipient madness can account for these ideas isdebatable. After \"The Horla\" (1887), Maupassant went on to write many otherworks with no connection to horror or the supernatural. We might also wonder ifa diseased mind could be the source of the story: madness is usually notresponsible for artistic excellence, and \"The Horla\" is Maupassant at his best:subtle, controlled, economical. Yet if Maupassant and others in the fin desiecle were correct in their belief that at least part of what we call madnessis a sensitivity to the inexplicable, then madness in a way played its part. Atany rate, by 1891, Maupassant's mind was deteriorating rapidly. He began tosuffer from delusions. He saw his own ghost, fired a pistol at an imaginaryassailant, and believed his body had been turned to salt. \"I have a softening ofthe brain,\" he wrote his friend Dr. Henry Cazalis, \". . . the result of washingout my nasal passages with salt water. A saline fermentation has taken place inmy brain, and every night my brain runs out through my noise and mouth in asticky paste. This is imminent death and I am mad ...\" Remembering the fate ofhis insane brother, Maupassant tried to kill himself, but botched the job andwas saved by his servant. He was driven to a sanatorium in Paris in astraitjacket, and nineteen months later he died, raving, a month short of hisforty-third birthday.AUGUST STRINDBERGThe career of the Swedish playwright August Strindberg (1849-1912) shows manyparallels with his contemporary Maupassant.35 Both men developed a vivid,economical style and both considered themselves realists, shunning sentimentalidealism in favour of the truth. Both were fascinated by abnormal mental statesand, for a period at least, Strindberg, like Maupassant, went insane. UnlikeMaupassant, however, Strindberg survived his insanity and may be unique in thehistory of literature as the only writer to write his way out of madness.In 1894, after years of painful struggle and almost universal rejection,Strindberg suffered an emotional breakdown that left him incapable of creativework. That Strindberg had reached a dead end isn't surprising. Vilified in hishomeland for naturalistic works like Miss Julie and The Father, Strindberg hadsuffered through two divorces - a third was yet to come - as well as poverty andthe loss of his three children from his first marriage. His second marriage, tothe Austrian journalist Frida Uhl, had just ended bitterly. This meantestrangement from yet another child and the loss of Frida's considerable dowry.At 45, penniless and alone, that Strindberg might question the point of going onis understandable. But Strindberg had demonic persistence, and after his failurein Sweden and a stint in Berlin, he looked to Paris for a last assault on fame.By 1893, some of Strindberg's works had already been performed in Paris, but itwas more than literary glory that attracted him. Although a founder ofnaturalism, Strindberg had a deep interest in magic and mysticism and in the1890s, Paris, as we've seen, was the occult capital of the world. Strindberg wasalso fascinated with science, and like Goethe before him, Strindberg thoughtthat he too was a scientist. In 1893 he published his first work of speculativenatural history, Antibarbarus, \"Anti-barbarian,\" the man of genius against theacademic plodders. Goethe set his own theory of colour against Isaac Newton's,and Strindberg too believed that his poet's eye saw more deeply than that of theprofessors. Also like Goethe, when it came to the occult, Strindberg's centralinterest was alchemy.By 1894, there were an estimated 50,000 alchemists in Paris. Undoubtedly,between 1894 and 1896, Strindberg experienced a schizophrenic episode, but it'sjust possible that the weird phenomena he recounts in his obsessive recordInferno - based, in part, on his even more bizarre Occult Diary - didn'toriginate solely in a mental breakdown. Without doubt, all the ingredients ofparanoid schizophrenia are there, abetted in part by Strindberg's taste forabsinthe. But the strange events that make up Strindberg's Inferno are preciselythe sort that fuelled one of the burning questions of the age: the thin linebetween genius and madness.Throughout his career, Strindberg had periodic bouts of revulsion againstliterature. His artistic credo practically ensured this. \"I regard it as mydreadful duty to be truthful,\" he wrote, \"and life is indescribably ugly,\" astatement echoing Maupassant's grim pessimism. Such sentiments prompted hisdevotion to alchemy. It may seem strange that, considering himself a scientist,Strindberg chose alchemy as his path to immortality. But Strindberg's approachto science was anything but orthodox. His aim in Antibarbarus was to explain thenature of sulphur, the transmutation of carbon and other elements, and thecomposition of water and air. Claiming to be a \"transformist\" like Darwin and amonist like the German naturalist Ernst Haskell, Strindberg declared \"I havecommitted myself to the assumption that all elements and all forces are related.And if they derive from one source, then they sprang into existence by means ofcondensation and attenuation, of copulation and crossbreeding, of heredity andtransformation ... and whatever else one cares to suggest.\"When the book appeared, Strindberg's pretensions were dismissed as a sign ofmonomania, its author lambasted for his lack of logic and incapacity forexperiment. But for the alchemist, transformation is the key, and Strindberg'sspeculative approach is in the great magical tradition. Writing to his youngbotanist friend Bengt Lidforss, Strindberg said \"I doubt all experiments ... Ibelieve rather in the depth of my conscious thought, or more correctly, myunconscious thought ...\" His method was to put himself \"into a state ofunconsciousness, not with drink, but by distractions, games, cards, sleep,novels ... without bothering about results, or acceptability, and somethingemerges that I can believe in...Strindberg's science was right in line with the latest developments in art.36Earlier Strindberg had published an essay on \"The New Arts, or the Role ofChance in Artistic Creation.\" This, along with another article on \"DerangedSense Impressions,\" deals with the curious power of the mind to alter itsperceptions, to re-create reality. Like many other artists, Strindberg rebelledagainst the neat objective universe revealed by an increasingly triumphantrationalist science. He argued instead for a world open to strange forces, andthe influence of consciousness itself, a position made commonplace decades laterwith the rise of quantum physics. In \"The New Arts\" he describes the\"oscillations of his sense impressions,\" and recounts how, seen from a certainangle, a cow becomes two peasants embracing each other, then a tree trunk, andthen something else, and how the figures at a picnic are really a ploughman'scoat and knapsack thrown over his cart ... Strindberg would later describe hisown method of writing as something like a trance state. His considerableabsinthe intake surely had a hand in this. Nevertheless, by the next century,with Dada and surrealism, the notion that reality is plastic, and thatconsciousness and chance affect what we experience, would become commonplace inaesthetic theory.But Strindberg was interested in more than a new approach to art. He took hisalchemy seriously and soon after his arrival in Paris, he turned his back on theliterary world and got to work on the archetypal alchemical project: makinggold. From what we can gather from Inferno, we can see that, at least to his ownsatisfaction, he succeeded.A pharmacist who took an interest in his pursuits allowed Strindberg to work inhis laboratory. He sent the results to a firm of chemists to be analyzed. Theirtests proved positive. Other encouragement followed. A summary of Strindberg'sscientific work appeared in Le Petit Temps, followed by long articles on`Strindberg the scientist' in La Science Francaise and the widely read LeFigaro. Strindberg petitioned to conduct further experiments using thelaboratory at the Sorbonne. The faculty thought little of his work, but grantedhim permission. An engineer at a chemical factory who read of his experimentswrote to him saying that they threw light on \"hitherto unexplained phenomena inthe manufacture of sulphuric acid and sulphides.\" At the same time, acorrespondence with the distinguished chemist Marcellin Berthelot suggested toStrindberg he was on the right track.It was around this time that Strindberg came into contact with the Parisianalchemical underground. Francois Jollivet- Castelot, whose book Strindberg hadread with enthusiasm, had heard of Strindberg's work, and approachedhim.Jollivet- Castelot later became editor of an alchemical journal,L'Hyperchimie, and published Strindberg's account of his alchemical work, \"TheSynthesis of Gold.\" Strindberg's alchemical celebrity was assured when GerardEncausse - better known under his occult pseudonym Papus - published an accountof his work in his periodical L'Initiation. \"August Strindberg,\" Papus wrote,\"who combines vast knowledge with his great talent as a writer, has justachieved a synthesis of gold from iron.\" His work, Papus continued, \"confirmsall the assertions of the alchemists.\"\"This was high praise. The author of several influential works, as the leader ofthe Groupe Independant d'Etudes Eso- terique and Grand Master of the MartinistOrder, Papus was a powerful figure in the Parisian occult underground. He wasalso indirectly involved in the magical feud that had Huysmans, Sar Peladan andDe Guaita casting spells at each other. When Papus elected Strindberg anhonorary Master of La Societe Alchimique de France, it's understandable theaccolade went to his head. After years of obscurity, rejection and accusationsof madness, to be accepted as a genius by men whose intelligence he respected,must have given Strindberg some satisfaction.Yet his alchemical adventure wasn't purely benign. Nurtured by his occultobsessions, Strindberg's deranged sense impressions began to get out of hand.More and more he recognized in them the sign of an occult intelligence which hecalled \"the Powers\" and \"the Unseen,\" a somewhat more benign, though stilldisturbing version of Maupassant's invisible superior being.He began to feel that he was being tested. He talked to the Powers, thankedthem, asked them for advice. He saw their work everywhere. Money appearedmiraculously, allowing him to buy scientific instruments. Observing the embryoof a walnut under a microscope, Strindberg was convinced he could see two tinyhands, clasped in prayer, emerging from the seed. On a chance trip to thecountry, his deranged sense impressions transformed a stone into a statue of aRoman knight. Pleased with this effect, he looked in the direction the statuewas pointing. On a wall he saw the initials F and S. He first thought of hissecond wife, Frida Strindberg. But then he realized that it was really thechemical symbols for iron and sulphur (Fe and S), the ingredients, he believed,for alchemical gold. A crumpled pillow became a Michelangelo bust, then alikeness of the Devil. A shadow in his room became a statue of Zeus. He hadprecognitive dreams. A dead friend appeared, offering a large American coin.When Strindberg reached for it, the friend disappeared. The next morning hereceived a letter from America. Arriving months late, it informed him of anoffer of 12,000 francs to write a piece for the Chicago Exhibition. But thedeadline had passed, and the money, a fortune for Strindberg, was now lost.A host of strange simulacra followed. In the zinc bath he used for making goldby the wet method, he saw a remarkable landscape. Formed by the evaporation ofsalts of iron, Strindberg saw \"small hills covered with conifers ... plains,with orchards and cornfields ... a river ... the ruins of a castle.\" It was onlymonths later, during a visit to his daughter, who he hadn't seen for two years,that he recognized his vision as the landscape around his mother-in-law's house.Making gold by the dry method produced its own terrors. After melting borax interrific heat, he found a skull with two glistening eyes. On another occasion achunk of charred coal revealed a bizarre formation: a body with a cock's head, ahuman trunk, and distorted limbs. It looked, he remarked, \"like one of thedemons that used to perform in the witches' sabbaths of the Middle Ages.\"A reading of Balzac's Seraphita convinced Strindberg that his alchemicalexperiments were unholy, and that for his salvation, the Powers had consignedhim to Hell. Strindberg was high-strung and thin-skinned; some of his torturesseem more like inconveniences than anything else. But some are more in line withthe magical adventures familiar to the time. Strindberg began to feel there wasan occult conspiracy against him, and he was convinced someone was spying on hisalchemical activities. The sound of pianos playing eerie, disturbing musicfollowed him everywhere. He believed the Polish decadent writer StanislavPrzybyszewski had come from Berlin to kill him. A persecution complex developed.His supersensitive nerves detected strange subterranean vibrations. The ideathat he was the target of evil emanations obsessed him. Baffling coincidencesappeared everywhere. Mysterious noises from the rooms next door tormented him,and he was convinced that someone was trying to kill him using an electricalmachine. He walked around Paris in a state of tense expectancy, awaiting \"aneruption, an earthquake, or a thunderbolt.\" Friends and acquaintances now becamedemons, sent by the Powers to show him the error of his ways, and each night hesuffered anxiety attacks. Because he had rejected the teachings of MadameBlavatsky, for some time he was convinced his assailants were a group oftheosophists .. .Eventually Strindberg passed through his ordeal, convinced the Powers had testedhim to aid his spiritual evolution. By 1897, his interest in alchemy abated, andthe urge to write had returned, one product of which was Inferno. In 1898 hebegan work on To Damascus, perhaps his greatest play. His belief in the Powers,however, remained for the rest of his life, and he went on to write several moremasterpieces, including the expressionistic A Dream Play (1902). In 1912 he wasdiagnosed with a stomach cancer and died a few months later, a Bible on hischest.GUSTAV MEYRINKIn 1891, at the age of 23, Gustav Meyer (he later adopted Meyrink as a nom deplume then took it as his legal name) was a successful, if unorthodox banker. Adandy, man-about-town and owner of the first automobile in Prague, Meyer had areputation as a fin de siecle decadent, a sophisticated pleasure seeker, as wellas an astute financier. The bank he started with a nephew of the poet ChristianMorgenstern - a devotee of Rudolf Steiner - was a success and Meyer was livingthe high life. Yet although Meyer presented an extraverted personality to theworld, he was by nature a sensitive introvert, poetic and contemplative. Thetension between his two selves grew too great and the young aesthete suffered anervous collapse, a complete breakdown that had him on the brink of suicide.Just as he was about to kill himself, a leaflet was pushed under the door of hisflat. Meyer stopped and picked it up. It was an advertisement for a book onoccultism. Meyer concluded that fate had intervened and he quickly plunged intoa study of the arcane arts, becoming soon after a founding member of theTheosophical Lodge of the Blue Star, the first theosophical organization inPrague.Ten years later Meyer met another fateful crossroads. While convalescing in atuberculosis sanatorium, he wrote his first story, \"The Ardent Soldier.\" Legendhas it that, like many other unsolicited submissions, it quickly found a placein the waste basket of the editorial offices of Simplicissimus, the satiricalmagazine Meyer had sent it to. Meyer might never have become Meyrink if LudwigThoma, the editor, did not idly poke around with his umbrella in the trash, andpuncture Meyer's manuscript. Drawing out his catch, Thoma allegedly recognizedit as a work of genius and published it. Soon after Meyrink became a regularcontributor, his satirical wit infuriating various members of the establishment.Two years later his first collection of stories was published, and Meyrink hadestablished himself as a writer. Meyrink's taste for the occult gave his tales apeculiar atmosphere, a strange, visionary quality that would fully emerge in hisfirst novel, The Golem. Originally published in 1913 in Die Weissen Blatter,when it appeared in book form two years later it quickly sold 200,000 copies\".The book made Meyrink famous and rich. Like Rainer Maria Rilke and Franz Kafka,two of Meyrink's contemporaries, Meyrink is one of the poets of Prague. If todayKafka's name prompts visions of a dark, ambiguous and threatening CentralEuropean city, it should be remembered that in his own day, it was Meyrink whowas most associated with this literary effect. Prague had a history of occultismand alchemy going back to the early 1600s, and in his first novel Meyrinkmanaged to condense this into an atmosphere thick with tension, chills and highmelodrama, producing a work that is at once a thriller and a metaphysicalexploration.A great deal happened to Meyrink while he was on his way to becoming abestselling. novelist. It's a cliche to say about some writers that their liveswere stranger than their fiction. In Meyrink's case it's true. Gustav was bornin 1868, the illegitimate son of a Jewish actress, Maria Meyer, and anaristocrat, Baron Karl Varnbiiler von and zu Hemmingen, minister of state forWurttemburg. Marriage was out of the question, but the Baron proved generous andpaid for Gustav's education, first in Munich, then Hamburg, and, finally,Prague; he later established a trust fund for his son, which allowed Gustav toset himself up as a banker. At some point in childhood his mother left him, anda sense of abandonment and loss of identity often figure in his novels. This istrue of The Golem, as well as later works like The Green Face (1916),Walpurgisnacht (1917), The White Dominican (1921) and his last novel, The Angelof the West Window (1927), which features the Elizabethan magician John Dee. Thefeeling of being an `outsider' remained with Meyrink throughout his life.In 1892 Meyrink married; the marriage, however, was not a success and in 1895 hemet Philomena Bernt, who later became his second wife. The scandal surroundingtheir affair added to the stress of his unhappy marriage; at the same time,Meyrink's occult investigations had begun, and he busied himself with yoga,freemasonry, alchemy, as well as experiments with hashish and mescaline. It wasduring this time that Meyrink became a member of several occult organizations.Along with the Lodge of the Blue Star, Meyer also became an Arch Censor in theMandala of the Lord of the Perfect Circle. Other societies included The Order ofIllumination, and the Brotherhood of the Old Rite of the Holy Grail in the GreatOrient of Patmos. In his short story \"What's the Use of White Dog Shit?\" Meyrinkeven satirized himself and has his narrator remark that \"the next thing I didwas to immerse myself in the study of the history of secret societies. Therecan't be a single fraternity left that I haven't joined ...\" Later Meyrink wouldbe associated with the German guru Bo Yin Ra, correspond at length with AnnieBesant, and receive praise from Rudolf Steiner 39, as well as be seen by many asan esoteric master in his own right. A sceptical occultist, Meyrink's wit andcritical acumen are welcome in a field too littered with credulity andself-deception.The stress of Meyrink's life took its toll and he suffered the collapse that ledto the sanatorium. When he recovered he faced yet another challenge. Talk of hisaffair with Philomena Bernt led to insults, and Meyrink was obliged to challengetwo army officers to a duel. Fearing his skill with a blade, they refused,claiming his illegitimacy prevented him from getting satisfaction. Meyrink thenchallenged the entire officers' corp. In the same year Meyrink was accused ofusing occult powers to influence his business clients, particularly the femaleones, and criminal charges were brought against him. Although the charges wereeventually dropped, he spent three months in jail, during which time he becametemporarily paralysed, possibly through rough treatment by the guards. He laterclaimed his yogic practices cured him. When he was finally let out his bank wasruined, and Meyrink was penniless. Obliged to make his living by his pen,Meyrink supplemented his income by working for a time as a representative of achampagne distributor, a position he more than likely enjoyed.In 1904 scandal and social ostracism led Meyrink to leave Prague and move toVienna. His stay there was short and in 1906 he moved to Bavaria, after finallydivorcing his first wife and marrying Philomena. But it wasn't until 1911 thathe finally settled by Lake Starnberg in a place he called the House of the LastLamps. Here he would write The Golem and his other novels, and live until hisdeath in 1932. By this time his celebrity had passed and in his last years illhealth forced him to stop writing. Although The Golem has a large cast of weirdand eccentric characters - the trademark of all Meyrink's novels - the centralstar is Prague itself, especially the old Jewish ghetto. Meyrink's portrayal ofits sunless, narrow streets and eerie, jutting architecture lent itself to theExpressionist cinema then in its infancy. Evidence for this can be found in PaulWegner's two film versions of The Golem as well as in the classic Cabinet of Dr.Caligari.Meyrink discovered the legend of the Golem in his reading of Hebrew mysticism.There are variations of the story but in its basics, the Golem is an inanimateman-like creature, usually made of clay, that is brought to life by a rabbi orkabbalist. By placing the word EMETH - life - on its forehead, the Golem isawakened, ready to do the bidding of its master. Generally, some variation ofthe Sorcerer's Apprentice happens, and the Golem, like any good Frankenstein'smonster, gets out of control. He can be stopped only by rubbing out the initialE, leaving the word METH, death, on its brow.That a novelist would find a magical creature susceptible to the power of wordsinteresting is not surprising. In Meyrink's novel, however, the Golem as suchmakes no appearance. Rather Meyrink uses the name to refer to something muchmore like a mobile state of consciousness, a kind of psychic fog, that issomehow linked to the book's protagonist. Like Meyrink, Athanasius Pernath comesfrom an ambiguous background, and throughout the book the reader is unsure ifthe Golem is an actual entity, or a figment of Pernath's imagination. Tocomplicate matters further, Pernath himself is unsure as well. And by the end ofthe novel, just exactly who, or what, Pernath is, becomes a disturbing question.. .In Old Testament Hebrew Golem means an unformed embryo, and in medieval Jewishphilosophy it was linked to the word hyle, which means matter without form - amicrocosmic version of the chaos and dark night before creation. Until he findshimself Pernath, too, is a kind of Golem, and the dark corners and doorlessrooms he traverses may be seen as the crooked path of his 'individuation'. Yetthe same may be said for the work of the artist, whose idea remains in merepotentia until given shape through the creative act. Like many others in theearly modern period, Meyrink was fascinated by the act of writing, and againsthis weird, melodramatic backdrop he has in many ways fashioned a tale of how a'dark, dim intuition finds a vivid, effective expression.When Meyrink began writing The Golem, the idea of a World War was, if notunthinkable, at least not often thought. By 1915 when the novel appeared on thebookstalls, Europe was suffering a murderous collapse that would continue foranother three years. Meyrink was not the only artist to have glimpsed the shadowthat the coming First World War threw before it; like many others, he believedthat European bourgeois civilization was so rotten that only an apocalypse couldredeem it, could raze its hypocrisy-ridden landscape and make way for a newworld. The same theme appears in his second novel, The Green Face, as well asWalpurgisnacht, his third. In The Golem it is the Jewish Ghetto that isdestroyed, but Meyrink knew that was only the beginning. Through his occultexplorations, he had seen an ideal world, a realm of the spirit of which thisphysical shell was but a shadow. Now it was time for that shell to crack. TheGolem, Meyrink believed, was one of the means to perform this deed, and it isperhaps not an exaggeration to say that by 1918 it had once again got out ofhand.ANDREI BELYOf all the esoteric transplants to take root in fin de siecle Russia, none wasas successful as anthroposophy, the unwieldy name Rudolf Steiner gave to hisChristianized revision of Madame Blavatsky's theosophy.41' Along with steeringaway from Blavatsky's Tibetan masters and toward a more western form ofesotericism, Steiner introduced a strong element of German philosophical rigourinto Blavatsky's occult speculations. Born in 1861 in Kraljevec - then part ofthe Austro- Hungarian empire - Steiner first made his name as a Goethe scholar:as a young man he edited the great poet's scientific writings. He was laterbriefly involved in the Nietzsche archive started by the philosopher's sister,Elizabeth ForsterNietzsche, in Weimar. Elizabeth, widow of a pan-Germanicanti-semite - and later an acquaintance of Adolf Hitler - hired Steiner to helporganize her brother's notes, as well as to tutor her in the more abstruseelements of his philosophy: perhaps not surprisingly, Elizabeth was notoriouslyignorant of her brother's, or anyone else's, ideas. During his brief tenure,Steiner had an opportunity to meet Nietzsche - if occupying the same room as theinsane philosopher counts as meeting him - and had a paranormal vision of hisastral form. Elizabeth at that time was dressing her defenceless brother in atoga, and positioning him by the window, where his blank immobile stare, massivemoustache and unkempt hair provided the impression of a great prophet, peeringinto the beyond. He was riddled with syphilis and by 1900 was dead.In 1897 Steiner moved to Berlin where he briefly edited a literary magazine. Hethen taught at the Berlin Worker's School, where he managed to transmit to hisMarxist audience a fair amount of German Idealism. This erratic pattern took aneven more eccentric turn when Steiner was asked by the Berlin TheosophicalSociety to lecture on Goethe's Mdrehen, \"The Green Snake and the BeautifulLily.\" The lecture was so successful that he was invited back, and it wasSteiner's lecture on \"Christianity as Mystical Fact\" in the winter of 1900 thatmore or less set him on his future career: previously kept from view, he nowdisplayed his esoteric interests openly. In the audience that evening was thewoman who would become Steiner's second wife, Marie von Sivers, a BalticRussian, frustrated actress, and devout theosophist.41 Forceful and ambitious,von Sivers had already made a place for herself by translating the playwrightand Wagnerian Eduorad Schure's esoteric bestseller The Great Initiates (1889).In 1902 she accompanied Steiner (who was still married to his first wife) to theLondon Conference of the Theosophical Society. Reports have. it that during thistrip she suggested that Europe was in need of a new religious movement and thathe, Rudolf Steiner, should lead it. Steiner agreed and soon after became theSecretary General of the German Branch of the Theosophical Society, second onlyto Annie Besant in authority and thought by many to be the most brilliantesoteric thinker of the time.Steiner's break with theosophy was prompted by Besant's and C.W. Leadbeater'sattempt to launch the twelve year old Krishnamurti as the new Jesus Christ.Before this, Marie von Sivers had arranged for Steiner to give a series oflectures in Russia, knowing that his highly Christianized theosophy would godown well with the growing number of \"Godseekers\" turning up among theintelligentsia. The 1905 Revolution, however, spoiled these plans, and sent manyof the seekers into exile. It was then arranged for Steiner to give his lecturesin the exile capital of Europe, Paris, in 1906. Among the audience were many ofthe most influential figures in the Russian cultural Renaissance: DimitriMerzhkovsky, Zinaida Hippius, Konstantin Balmont (friend of Briusov) and NicolaiMinsky. By 1913, when Steiner gave a series of lectures at Helsingforsspecifically for his Russian followers, there were already severalanthroposophical discussion groups and workshops in St. Petersburg and Moscow.In Steiner's esoteric system, the Slavic folk-soul has an important and timelyrole to play. Russia, he believed, was the country most suited to embody a newcultural epoch, something that many of the new mystically inclinedintelligentsia believed as well. The Russian soul, Steiner told them, wouldtranscend both the rational-materialist west and the mystical-spiritual east,inaugurating a new, holistic consciousness, that would synthesize theseopposites. Oddly, many of Steiner's pronouncements on the Slavic soul echoHermann Hesse's remarks on `Russian Man'. The Russian, Steiner said, was a\"child.\" \"In the Russian way of thinking, two opposing concepts can hold swaysimultaneously.\" \"The Russian does not have the slightest understanding of whatWesterners call `reasonableness'.\" Madame Blavatsky, Steiner said, was a typicalRussian: she went to extremes, did not think logically, and was childlike. Yetit was precisely these qualities that allowed her to intuit deep, spiritualtruths ... sometimes.Steiner's message hit home, although not all among the intelligentsia thoughtwell of him. For the philosopher Nicolas Berdyaev, anthroposophy had a\"distinctly corrupting and disintegrating effect.\" Berdyaev, who attendedSteiner's Helsingfors lectures, was not impressed, and saw in Steiner a kind ofblack magician, casting a spell upon his audience. His followers seemed \"maniacspossessed by some power beyond their control.\" \"Whenever they uttered the magicwords `the Doctor (i.e. Steiner) said', they seemed to be seized by some demon...\" Berdyaev was also very wary of a certain Anna Mintslova, whom he calledSteiner's emissary, \"an ugly, fat woman with protruding eyes\" who bore alikeness to Madame Blavatsky. Mintslova \"was skilled in her approach to humansouls,\" and her influence was \"absolutely negative and demonic.\" It is evenpossible that she performed some kind of magic spell or remote hypnosis onBerdyaev. He recounts how one night, half asleep, he saw her face hovering in acorner of his room, \"its expression was quite horrifying - a face seeminglypossessed of all the powers of darkness.\" Berdyaev also remarks on her strangedisappearance, fading into thin air one afternoon on the Kuznetsky Bridge inMoscow. Rumours said she had gone into hiding in a Rosicrucian monastery, or,conversely, had committed suicide because the Doctor had condemned her forfailing in her mission to convert the Slavs ...\"One writer to fall under Steiner's spell was the novelist, poet, and essayistAndrei Bely. Born Boris Nikolaevich Bugaev in Moscow in 1880 (Andrei Bely was apseudonym, meaning `Andrew White'), Bely was the son of a worldfamousmathematician and a St. Petersburg society lady. Prompted by his father, Belyentered the mathematics faculty at Moscow University, and graduated in 1903. Bythat time, Bely's feeling for mathematics had changed; through music, which hecalled \"audible mathematics,\" he became fascinated with art and aestheticexpression. Already at 17 Boris had been writing poems in the manner of Heine,Verlaine and Maeterlinck; now he became Andrei Bely, adopting the pseudonym toavoid embarrassing his renowned father.Bely was a voracious reader and his favourite pastime seems to have beenabsorbing philosophical systems and turning them into writing. He was infatuatedwith Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Kant, theosophy, eastern religions and was afollower of the Russian religious philosopher Vladimir Soloviev.43 FromSoloviev, whose philosophy influenced the Russian Renaissance, Bely absorbed theidea, common to his generation, of a transcendental reality, intuited throughsymbols. He also absorbed the belief that the current age was at an end and thatRussia was about to become the backdrop for a cataclysmic upheaval.44 Bely firstcame to literary notice with his eccentric prose work Second Symphony (1902),which applied the principles of musical composition to writing. Neither a novel,essay nor poem, Bely composed three further Symphonies, before embarking on hisfirst novel, The Silver Dove (1909). Like Arthur Machen, Bely was obsessed withthe clash between western European consciousness and primitive beliefs; in thenovel the Moscow poet Daryalsky is tired of the intelligentsia and leaves thecity for the countryside, where he joins a mystical sect, the White Doves. Here,under the dominance of their ruthless leader, who, Bely claims, anticipates thereal life Rasputin, he is drawn into a disastrous union with the \"Mother ofGod,\" in an attempt to produce a magical offspring. The novel was well received- in his review Berdyaev wrote that \"Modern Russia has produced nothing greater\"- and with Valery Briusov, Bely had established himself as a leader of the newSymbolist movement.In 1910-1911 Bely and his first wife, Asya Turgenev (niece of the writer)travelled in Italy, North Africa and the Holy Land. Then, in the spring of 1912,Bely met Steiner and became part of his entourage, eventually leaving Russia forDornach, Switzerland, where he helped build Steiner's Goetheanum, a strangelybeautiful work of Expressionist and Art Nouveau architecture.45 Althoughcritical of some Stein- erites, Bely found striking parallels between his ownideas and those of anthroposophy. In a letter to the poet Aleksander Blok - withwhose wife Bely had been infatuated - Bely remarked that \"Since the autumn of1911, Steiner has begun to speak of ... Russia, her future, the soul of herpeople and Soloviev ... He considers Soloviev to be the most remarkable man ofthe second half of the nineteenth century, knows the Mongol peril, asserts thatsince 1900 an enormous change has taken place in the world and that the sunsetshave changed since that year ..Mention of the \"Mongol peril\" brings us to one of Bely's obsessions: the beliefthat Russia was threatened on two fronts, by an incursion of Asiatic hordes fromthe east and by the success of western rationalism and technology, which wasabsorbing the authentic Slav soul. This concern, often amounting to hysteria,saturates Bely's most well known work, the novel Petersburg (1916). Along with alater novel, the autobiographical Kotik Letayev (1922), begun during his time inDornach, it is the most anthroposophical of Bely's creative writing.Taking place in the days leading up to the 1905 Revolution, the plot centresaround the radical student Nikolai Ableukhov and his father, a senator condemnedto death by the revolutionary tribunal. Nikolai is given the task of carryingout the sentence, and he does this by the means of a bomb hidden in a sardinetin. This almost comical situation takes place amidst a feverish landscape ofsecret agents, premonitions, strange dreams and astral journeys, made even moreambiguous through Bely's eccentric syntax. Through it all the initiated readercan find Bely's absorption of Steiner's teaching. Nikolai undergoes an astralvoyage during sleep, in which he sees his father as the pagan god Saturn. InSteiner's system, Saturn was the first stage in the evolution of human andcosmic consciousness. The dreaded Mongol appears as well, along with the \"oldTuranian.\" Turanians were non-Semitic, non-Aryan nomads who supposedly came toEurope well before the Aryans. In Steiner's system, they are linked with theMongols, and are responsible for inventing logical reasoning.Bely was particularly impressed with a series of secret lectures that Steinergave in 1912-1913, centred around the `activation of the etheric body'. The`etheric body' is a term Steiner took from theosophy; it refers to a kind of`life field' that animates our physical form; living things rot after deathbecause their etheric body has disengaged from the merely physical form and nolonger supports it. Steiner taught that when one begins to sense the ethericbody, the feeling is like a sudden expansion into space. \"He experiences terror;here no one is spared anxiety; it oppresses the soul; as though one had beenhurled into space ...\"47 In a chapter called \"The Senator's Second Space\" Belydescribes the weird hypnagogic visions Nikolai's father has on the point ofsleep. \"This universe always appeared before he fell asleep; and appeared insuch a way that Apollon Apollonovich, going to sleep, remembered all the earlierinarticulacies, rustlings, crystallographic figures, the golden,chrysanthemum-shaped stars racing through the darkness . . .s48 And in thesection entitled \"The Last Judgement,\" Nikolai also finds himself thrown outinto strange cosmic depths.There is an hallucinatory flavour to the book, and reading it in long sittingscertainly gives the impression of entering another reality. How much Belyhimself experienced of similar states, and how much he assimilated from hisenormous reading, is unclear. That he was an unstable character is suggested byreports about him. Berdyaev, who knew him well for a time, believed that Belylived \"by a passionate desire to lose his identity altogether,\" and spoke of his\"monstrous disloyalty and treachery.\" Although undoubtedly brilliant, it was, hesaid \"impossible to rely on Bely in any way whatsoever.\" He was also somethingof a \"maniac\", obsessed by fears, apprehensions, horrors and premonitions, andhad a peculiar terror of meeting a Japanese or Chinese.49 Yevgeny Zamyatin,author of the classic dystopian novel We (1924) remarked of Bely that \"He alwaysleft one with the impression of impetuosity, flight, feverish excitement\" andsummed up his character as \"Mathematics, poetry, anthroposophy, fox trot . . .\"Bely's own relationship with Steiner went through radical fluctuations. In 1916he left Dornach and returned to Russia, but Asya Turgenev refused to follow him,choosing to remain with the Doctor.50 A period of disillusionment followed, andBely publicly repudiated Steiner's work. Then, after enduring severe hardshipduring the revolution, he returned to Dornach, but was rejected by both Aysa andSteiner. He then spent two depressing years in Berlin, returning to Russia in1923, where he-married another anthroposophist, Klavdia Vasilyeva, and wrote aseries of autobiographical works, one of which, Recollections of Steiner (notpublished until 1982), paints an idealized portrait of Steiner. Although atfirst enthusiastic about the Bolsheviks, Bely soon realized that any dreams of aspiritual revolution had been quickly jettisoned, and. unlike his one-timementor Briusov, he never found a place within the new Soviet machine. He died, asomewhat forgotten figure, in 1934. Petersburg, however, remains a classic, arecognized masterpiece, and one of the great works of high modernism thoroughlydrenched in esoteric thought.NOTES1 Maugham's hero, Larry Darrel, is said to be based on Christopher Isherwood,who became a student of the yogi Prabha- vananda in California in the 1930s.2 There's reason to suspect that the Ana, Bulwer Lytton's name for hissubterranean super-race, influenced Bernard Shaw's late Lamarckian`metabiological Pentateuch', Back to Methuselah. Both works present a superiorcivilization of mental supermen, who have given up the delights of the flesh infavour of a life devoted solely to the mind. The fact that in his novels BulwerLytton often associates the `superior type' with the social out cast - areflection of his own experience - also has resonances with Shaw, who thought ofhimself as the complete outsider and who agreed with Nietzsche that the higherevolutionary type would find him or herself beyond good and evil.3 See Stapledon's First and Last Man and Starmaker, and the stories making upLovecraft's `Cthulhu Mythos'.4 W.B. Yeats, Preface to H.P.R Finberg's 1924 translation of Axel (London:Jarrods,1925).5 H.G. Wells The Food of the Gods (New York: Airmont Publishing Company, 1965)pp. 189-190.6 The superman theme would spawn hundreds, maybe thousands of offspring in thefields of sci-fi. Olaf Stapledon's Odd John, A.E. Van Vogt's Slan, TheodoreSturgeon's More Than Human, Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End, and RobertHeinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land are only some of the most well knownefforts in this area.7 The novelist and playwright J.B. Priestley, who read the memorial addressfollowing Wells' cremation at Golders Green on 16 August 1946, was another, moreunequivocal advocate of Dunne's ideas, as he was of the ideas of P.D. Ouspensky.8 To date there is only one full scale book on Blackwood, Mike Ashley'sStarlight Man: The Extraordinary Life of Algernon Blackwood (London: Constable,2001). S.T. Joshi's The Weird Tale (Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press)has a long and exhaustive study of Blackwood's work. I have relied on both forthe present section.9 As late as 1962, Gerald Gough, librarian of the Society of Inner Light, aGolden Dawn offshoot started by the occult psychologist Dion Fortune (VioletFirth), tried to contact Blackwood in a seance. Among others present was thelate poet and Blake scholar Kathleen Raine. Although Blackwood himself was afirm believer in reincarnation, he didn't think that the soul remained intactafter death and was disparaging about spiritualism. His own belief was that theindividual soul merged back into a kind of collective cosmic mind, from whichnew souls emerged. These may inherit qualities from the souls that have passed -i.e., reincarnation.10 Strangely, Machen and Blackwood were linked by more than magic. Along withgaining mastery of the Golden Dawn, A.E. Waite spent his time as the Londonmanager for Horlick's malted milk company. (Blackwood, we remember, tried hishand at a career in powdered milk.) In 1903, persuaded by Waite, the companyissued a popular magazine, The Horlick's Magazine and Home Journal, which ranfor eighteen issues. Along with Waite's own contributions were those of EvelynUnderhill (writer on mysticism and member of the Golden Dawn), Edgar Jepson, andMachen, most notably his story \"The White People.\"11 Along with other thinkers, like William James and Nietzsche, Ouspensky's bookowes a considerable debt to the mathematician Charles H. Hinton. At the turn ofthe nineteenth century, in a series of successful books and magazine articles,Hinton popularized the notion of a `fourth dimension,' running parallel to ourusual three. His work also influenced H.G. Wells, who borrowed the idea for hisfirst novel, The Time Machine. For more on Hinton and Ouspensky, see my A SecretHistory of Consciousness (Massachusetts: Lindisfarne 2003).12 In The Glittering Gate (1914), Dunsany has two burglars breaking into Heaven.After picking the lock on the entrance, they discover nothing but an abyss.\"Stars. Blooming great stars. There ain't no heaven ... \" one declares.13 Mark Amory Biography of Lord Dunsany (London: Collins, 1972) p. 46.14 Ibid p. 47.15 Ibid. p.72.16 Disquietingly, Bucke's psychiatric practice included procedures we wouldtoday find unacceptable. Early in his career, endorsing the Victorian beliefthat masturbation promotes mental disability, Bucke briefly instituted theprecedent of `wiring' the penis to prevent his male patients from abusingthemselves. The results were equivocal and the practice soon abandoned. Later,he practiced gynaecological surgery as a treatment for insanity in women, againwith debatable results. His notions, savage to us, were in keeping with theinterest in endocrinology popular at the time, and were prompted by a recognizedneed for more active methods of treating mental illness. Bucke later abandonedsurgery and in his last years developed plans for a self-sufficient therapeuticcommunity, an idea years ahead of its time. For Bucke's contribution topsychiatry see Peter A. Rechnitzer, R.M. Bucke (Cambridge: Cambridge UniversityPress, 1986).17 R.M. Bucke Cosmic Consciousness (New York: Dutton, 1966) pp. 9-10.18 Sharon Begley, \"Religion and the Brain,\" Newsweek, May 14, 2001.19 For more on Gavin Arthur, see my Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties andthe Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius. (London: Macmillan, 2001) pp. 337-340.20 Bucke p. 4.21 Outside of occult circles, Ouspensky's name occasionally turns up in books onpopular mathematical science, which often perpetuate the error that he was amathematician himself. Although he had an interest in mathematics, as did hisfather, Ouspensky himself was not a professional mathematician; indeed he neverheld a university position of any kind, and was what we would call a drop out.His speculations on higher space, however, have earned him an infrequentmention, sometimes with unintentionally humorous results. Thus, in Hyperspace(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 65-67) the physicist Michio Kakuremarks on Ouspensky's profound interest in multidimensional space, and theinfluence his ideas had on writers like Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Given thatDostoyevsky died in 1881, when Ouspensky was six years old, his influence musthave been great indeed. Yet, as Ouspensky himself had some unusual theoriesabout time, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that Dostoyevsky wasinfluenced by Ouspensky. Part of Ouspensky's strange ideas about `eternalrecurrence' included an unusual variant on reincarnation, in which upon death, aperson incarnates again, but in the past, not the future. So, grantingOuspensky's peculiar views, he may, upon his death in 1947, have reincarnatedinto Dostoyevsky's time, and thus had upon the novelist the influence MichioKaku so generously ascribes to him. Eternal recurrence was a central theme ofNietzsche, whose ideas influenced Ouspensky greatly.22 Although J.B. Priestley would have like to, he was never able to arrange ameeting with Ouspensky, for the basic reason that Ouspensky rejected the idea.Nevertheless, in his plays Time and the Conways and I Have Been Here Before, aswell as in books like Man and Time and his last, Over the Long, High Wall,Priestley made use of and popularized Ouspensky's ideas - always, as Ouspenskyhad done with Gurdjieff, acknowledging their originator and source. It isunfortunate, in my view at least, that post-Gurdjieff Ouspensky seemed to havedeveloped a powerful anti-social attitude, sometimes bordering on paranoia. Hadhe made the gesture and met with Priestley, his last days may not have been sotragic; indeed, they might not have been his last days at all.23 He also believed that the name most suited to becoming famous with was onewith a dactyl followed by a trochee, such as Benjamin Franklin.24 Books about Crowley are numerous.

Reported dead, Machen's obituary used the word\"degenerate;\" Bosie, however, was very much alive and sued. The Evening News hadto pay £1,000 in damages and Machen was fired.30 Machen, however, did not think much of Wilde, referring to him as \"an obeseFrench washerwoman.\"31 Maupassant was also generous to less successful writers, and for a timesupported Villiers de l'Isle-Adam.32 Charcot was also apparently a great collector of what we might call demonicerotica, and spent his leisure time perusing the works of Felicien Rops andother less well known outre artists.33 An English translation of \"The Horla\" appeared in a collection called ModernGhosts in 1890, predating Wells' The Invisible Man by seven years. There had, ofcourse, been fairy and folk tales involving invisibility for generations, butMaupassant's might be the first to offer a scientific account of the condition.34 The name became so associated with Maupassant that he gave it to the balloonin which he travelled from Paris to Holland in July 1887, christening it `LeHorla'. An astute careerist, the stunt helped to publicize the collection ofstories containing the tale.35 Yet of the two Strindberg is clearly the more profound. For all his technicalbrilliance, Maupassant, like his contemporaries the Impressionists, lived on thesurface, and his vision of life is shallow. Colin Wilson's remark that he is\"the most brainless of all the great writers\" is perhaps not an overstatement.36 He was, of course, a considerable painter and water colourist.37 It was around this time that Yeats met Strindberg and later remarked in hismemoirs that when he met the playwright he was \"searching for the Philosopher'sStone.\"38 Characteristically, the story of how Meyrink pitched the novel to Kurt Wolff,its publisher, is, as we might expect, the stuff of legend. \"I rememberMeyrink's visit well,\" Wolff recalled, \"a gentleman of aristocratic appearanceand impeccable manners, with a slight limp. He had the honour, he said ofproposing that the firm accept his first novel, although no typescript of it wasavailable yet. He had recorded it on a dictating machine ... (but) he hadbrought along a handwritten copy of the first chapter. He wished to reach anagreement on the novel at once, before returning to Munich the following day. Hewould not demand the usual royalties, but instead desired immediate payment often thousand marks as a lump sum, in return for all rights and editions ...Would I be so kind, he asked, as to read the pages ... and to make a decision?\"Taken aback and embarrassed, I read the folio pages ... and was then expected... to say yes or no I found the situation absurd, wanted to show I was equal toit - and said yes.\" (Kurt Wolff A Portrait in Essays and Letters ed. MichaelErmarth (Chicago & London: The University of Chicago Press) ), pp. 12-13.39 Meyrink was a friend of Friedrich Eckstein, the Viennese esotericist who,legend has it, first introduced Rudolf Steiner to the doctrines of theosophy,passing on to Steiner a copy of A. Sinnet's Esoteric Buddhism.40 Anthroposophy means the \"wisdom of man\" as opposed to theosophy's \"wisdom ofthe gods\".41 For an interesting perspective on Steiner's first marriage to the widow AnnaEunicke, see James Webb's The Occult Establishment (La Salle, Illinois: OpenCourt, 1976), p. 64.42 Nicolas Berdyaev Dream and Reality (London: Geoffrey Bles,1950) pp. 192-194.Berdyaev's autobiography is a key document on the Russian fin de siecle, andSteiner was not the only occultist or mystic to receive his animus. As aneccentric Marxist, Nietzschean, and Russian Orthodox existentialist, it isn'tsurprising he would find fault with much of what went on in the \"highly chargedand intense atmosphere of the early 20th century Russian cultural renascence.\"Berdyaev was highly critical, for example, of the sway Dirmtri Merzhkovsky andhis wife, the poet Zinaida Hippius, had on the sensibility of the time.Merzhkovsky, who blended speculations on sex and a coming God-Man with Atlantis\"lived in an atmosphere of unhealthy, self-assertive sectarian mysticism.\" Hiswife, with whom Berdyaev enjoyed a brief friendship, had \"a profoundunderstanding of others, blended with a capacity for inflicting pain on them.There was something snake-like about her. She was fragile, subtle, brilliant andentirely devoid of human warmth.\" Pp. 144-145.43 Vladimir Soloviev (1853-1900), the son of an eminent historian who was also apriest, abandoned his early materialist philosophy after he underwent the firstin a series of mystical experiences involving a vision of the Divine Sophia. In1872 in the second-class carriage of the Moscow-Kharkov train Soloviev saw theyoung girl who sat across from him become a living embodiment of the divineWoman. Prompted by this, Soloviev abandoned his scientific studies at MoscowUniversity and enrolled at the Ecclesiastical Academy. In 1874 he published abook entitled The Crisis of Western Philosophy which argued that westernphilosophy arrived through rational knowledge at the same truths affirmed byspiritual contemplation. He then embarked on a study of Swedenborg. In 1874,during a sabbatical year, he studied Hindu, Gnostic and medieval texts at theBritish Museum, where he had the second vision of Sophia. Inspired by hisexperience, Soloviev promptly set off on a journey to Egypt, where he attractedsome attention by wearing his long black overcoat and top hat in the summerheat. During a visit to Bedouins in the Suez desert - he believed they possessedcertain secret kabbalistic teachings - he was abandoned and spent the nightalone. The smell of roses awoke him in the morning, and he had the thirdvisitation of Sophia. Returning to Russia he preached a doctrine of `integrallife' and received some support from Dostoyevsky. In the last years of his lifehe was obsessed with apocalyptic visions and wrote a book War, Progress and theEnd of History and a short story \"The Antichrist.\"44 \"... he had had occasion to develop a paradoxical theory about the necessityof destroying culture, because the period of obsolete humanism was over andcultural history now stood before us like weathered marl; a period of healthybrutishness was beginning, pushing forth out of the depths of the people (thehooliganism, the violence of the Apaches ...) All the phenomena of contemporaryreality were divided by him into two categories; the symptoms of an alreadyobsolete culture and the signs of a healthy barbarism ... Christianity isobsolete: in Satanism there is a crude fetish worship, that is, a healthybarbarism ...\" Andrei Bely Petersburg (London: Penguin Books, 1995) translatedby David McDuff, p. 399.45 Work began on the Goetheanum in 1913 and was completed in 1920. On New Year'sEve 1922 the building, made entirely of wood and featuring immense twin cupolas,burnt to the ground; the cause of the blaze is still unknown, but there havebeen persistent rumors that it was begun by proto-Nazi groups in an act ofoccult warfare. In 1928, three years after Steiner's death, the secondGoetheanum, made of reinforced concrete, was opened. Also designed by Steiner,it still stands today and remains the centre of the anthroposophical movement.46 Quoted in David McDuff's introduction to his translation of Petersburg p.xix.47 Petersburg p. xix.48 Ibid. p.179.49 Berdyaev pp. 195-196.50 Asya Turgenev, a talented artist, remained devoted to Steiner, and her workon the glass engravings for the windows of the second Goetheanum can be seen inDornach today."},{"pageContent":"THE MODERNIST OCCULTIST\"In all the poets of the modern tradition, poetry is a system of symbols andanalogies parallel to that of the hermetic sciences.\"' Without doubt true ofpoetry, this remark by Octavio Paz could easily be said of many other art formsin the modern tradition as well. Among novelists, painters and musicians, in avariety of ways, art in the modern period took on an arcane and esotericcharacter leading to a profound chasm between an increasingly difficult avantgarde and an increasingly baffled general public.' The reasons for this arediverse. For literature, the growth in literacy and the audience for popularentertainment it created certainly played a part. With fiction and otherliterary forms falling prey to commercial interests and the need to appeal tothe lowest common denominator, serious writers sought out new and unavoidablydifficult means of communicating their insights. With the inflation of theircurrency - language - this led to a search for a means of expression not yetappropriated by the burgeoning print medium. Newspapers, popular fiction andmagazines churned out words by the million, and the worn coins of everydayspeech were less and less able to communicate anything more than the mostcommonplace meanings. The reaction to this among writers and poets ranged fromthe protracted syntax of Proust or Hermann Broch, to the brusque onomatopoeia ofMarinetti or Hugo Ball, to zaum, the meaningless \"language of the future\" spokenby Velimir Khlebnikov and other members of the Russian avant garde. Theparallels in painting and music are likewise clear. To give two examples,Wassily Kandinsky's abstract canvases moved away from an art that represented anexternal world no longer able to reflect a spiritual reality, and toward theimmediate communication of an inner one; while at the same time his friendArnold Schoenberg's atonal music dismantled the structure of a played outwestern harmony and, like Kandinsky's paintings, presented a new and startlingavenue to the artist's own troubled psyche.This dichotomy between an increasingly difficult art and a growing middle-browdemand for product is an outcome of the cul-de-sac reached via the route ofSymbolism. As the external world became little more than a symbol of a higher,spiritual plane, and the artist the interpreter and high priest of this hiddenreality, the means of communication required a greater and greater purity, amedium uncluttered with the gross manifestations of the physical world. Thiseventually led, as mentioned earlier, to Mallarme's blank page and Malevich'swhite canvases. It also led to artists seeking out new mythologies to house themeaning and significance no longer contained by the overused emblems of thepast. In his Lectures on Aesthetics the philosopher Hegel argued that art wouldeventually dwindle to something like decoration and entertainment. Hegel arguedthat as Geist, the world-spirit, continued to evolve, the brief but gloriousmarriage between the inner and outer worlds exemplified by the art works ofclassical Greece would necessarily split asunder. Gothic art, with the soaringcathedral spire as its most paradigmatic symbol, led in Hegel's own time toRomanticism and the aesthetics of the strange and bizarre. By the 20th century,Romanticism had been played out and when artists did not retreat into silence,they adopted other methods of holding together the chaos of the modern era.'Novelists like James Joyce took the framework of classical mythology andsuperimposed it on the banal experiences of a modern day everyman. The ironicdouble-exposure of Ulysses, however, proved a dead end and in Finnegan's WakeJoyce produced an extended full-stop to the experimental novel. Starting with anattempt to perceive four-dimensionally, cubism later turned, in the work of KurtSchwitters, to no longer painting cigarette packs, but fixing them directly tothe canvas. This eventually led to Andy Warhol and the notorious Brillo box byway of Duchamp's urinal. Yet other mythologies were also available, and one inparticular found many adherents: the occult. As a case in point, two of theartists mentioned above, Kandinsky and Schoenberg, were both deep readers indifferent schools of occultism. Kandinsky's theories on colour and formpresented in his essay On the Spiritual in Art were profoundly influenced by theideas of theosophy and Rudolf Steiner. And in his unfinished oratorio Jacob'sLadder, Schoenberg, a reader of Swedenborg by way of Balzac's Seraphita, depictsHeaven as seen by Swedenborgian angels who, no matter which way they turn,always face God.' \"Whether right, left, forward or backward, up or down - onehas to go on without asking what lies before or behind us,\" Schoenberg's angelGabriel remarks.To do justice to all the artists and writers in the 20th century who adoptedvarious forms of occultism as either a framework for their creativity or, inmany cases, an actual world-view, would require a separate book. In painting avery brief run through would give us, along with Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian,JosephBeuys, and Nicholas Roerich; and in music, along with Schoenberg, AlexandreScriabin, Gustav Holst, Olivier Messiaen, John Cage 5 and Karlheinz Stockhausen.In literature, with which we are principally concerned, the list would includeYeats, Thomas Mann, Henry Miller, T.S. Eliot, Hermann Hesse, Ezra Pound, JohnCowper Powys, William Burroughs, Aldous Huxley, Hart Crane, Lawrence Durrell,Jorge Louis Borges, David Lindsay \", Stefan George, Georges Bataille, ErnstJiinger, Andre Breton, J.B. Priestley, Walter Benjamin, Christian Morgenstern,John Fowles, Saul Bellow, lain Sinclair, Robert Irwin, Colin Wilson and severalothers!What I propose to do in the remaining section is present a selection of modernauthors who either practised a form of occult or esoteric discipline, possessedto some degree what we would call occult powers, or developed an occult ormystical philosophy or world-view to offset the increasingly reductivescientific orthodoxy of the modern era. Personal preference and space has, ofcourse, had a hand in my selection, but I've also tried to choose writers whoare not as well known as some others associated with the occult: Yeats, forexample, or, in more recent times, Eliot and Pound.' That The Waste Landincludes references to Madame Blavatsky (\"Madame Sosostris\"), the Tarot, theGrail legend, Hesse's essay on \"Russian Man\" and elements of Hinduism is wellknown. What is not as well known is that Eliot attended P.D. Ouspensky's earlyLondon talks and that later poems, like the Four Quartets, contain references totime that could well have served as basic themes in Ouspensky's lectures. \"In myend is my beginning,\" captures Ouspensky's ideas on eternal recurrence in asingle sentence. Although Eliot later spurned his early fascination with theoccult, finding a haven in tradition and the Church of England, his exampleshows that, far from an outmoded form of superstition, the occult was verymodern indeed.All of the writers I've chosen wrote poetry as well as fiction, though some werebetter known for one form rather than another.FERNANDO PESSOAUntil relatively recently, the work of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa waslittle known, but in the last few years he's been rediscovered by severalcritics, mostly on the strength of various translations of his Livro doDesassossego or Book of Disquiet, a collection of unfinished angst-ridden textsfound in a trunk after Pessoa's death. The fragmentary nature of these writings- jotted on scraps of paper, the backs of envelopes, the reverse side of othermanuscripts and other odd places - makes Pessoa a prime postmodern figure, andthe trunk, whose contents are still being catalogued (it contained some 25,000items) has taken on the same mythical character as the valise Walter Benjamincarried on his fateful escape from Vichy France.`' Like Benjamin, in many waysPessoa's posthumous celebrity is founded as much upon his life as upon his work.In Benjamin's case, his life embodies the myth of the Jewish intellectual on therun from the Nazis. In Pessoa's the story is less political; not only does heembody the disjointed, fractured postmodern ethos in his work, but in his verypsyche.Fernando Pessoa was born in Lisbon in 1888 and aside from his childhood andadolescence spent in Durban, South Africa, upon his return to Lisbon in 1905, henever left the city again. After his father died from tuberculosis when Fernandowas five his mother soon remarried, and her husband received a post at Durban asthe Portuguese consul. Educated at an English high school, Pessoa proved aprecocious child and brilliant student, and his early schooling instilled alifelong love for England and English literature. In later years he took tobehaving and dressing with \"British restraint\", and The Pickwick Papers was, hesaid, his constant companion. His command of English (also French) wasimpeccable, if eccentric, and his first published book was a collection of hisEnglish poems. As his translator John Griffin remarks, these are of littleinterest poetically and they received courteous but unenthusiastic reviews fromThe Times and Glasgow Herald. Although he published articles and poems inseveral literary magazines, aside from his English efforts, the only other bookof Pessoa's to be published in his lifetime would appear in 1934, the yearbefore he died. Mensagem (Message) is an extended esoteric poem arguing for thereturn of Dom Sebastiao, Portugal's King Arthur, and for Portugal's pre-eminencein a coming Fifth Empire of the spirit. Espousing Pessoa's peculiarly mysticalpatriotism, the book received a consolation prize in a national competition.This was a late and slightly backhanded recognition of Pessoa's genius,something that, as often happens, would only become common knowledge after thepoet's death. Supporting himself as a freelance translator of English and Frenchcorrespondence for several commercial firms, after a lonely, solitary life,spent in relatives' houses or in rented rooms, Pessoa, who more than likelyremained a virgin, died in 1935 from acute hepatitis brought on by heavydrinking.Pessoa's poetry is aptly described as the central work of Portuguese modernism,and for this alone he deserves his belated recognition. But Pessoa wrote morethan poems. His legendary trunk contained a wealth of miscellaneous writings onphilosophy, sociology, history, literary criticism, as well as short stories,plays, treatises on astrology and a variety of auto biographical reflections.But in addition to the usual material produced by a writer, Pessoa is unique inthat he also wrote as other writers and poets. These he called heteronyms,coining the term to distinguish it from the common pseudonym. Pessoa was notsimply writing poems and prose under a different name: the various heteronyms hecreated were individuals with their own history, biography, personalcharacteristics and unmistakable literary style.For a solitary individual, living alone in small rooms, to occasionally talk tohimself seems not unusual. In Pessoa's case, what began as a childhood game ofhaving conversations with imaginary characters1' - \"nonexistent acquaintances,\"he called them - became in later years an obsession with depersonalization andthe fracturing of the self. Indeed, Pessoa's grip on his own self was so tenuousthat at one point he took to writing his old teachers and schoolmates in Durban,posing as the psychiatrist Faustino Antunes, asking for their opinion on themental state of his patient, Fernando Pessoa who, depending on the letter, hadeither committed suicide or was under restraint at an asylum. Having no idea whohe was, Pessoa hoped to gain some insight from those who knew him.Pessoa lived with a constant fear of madness. At the age of twenty he wrotethat, \"One of my mental complications - horrible beyond words - is a fear ofinsanity, which itself is insanity.\"' This fear was complicated by an equallydistressing inability to act. \"I suffer - on the very limit of madness, I swearit - as if I could do all and was unable to do it, by deficiency of Will.,, 12Pessoa was one of the most costive of writers: his inexhaustible trunk, filledwith the plans of hundreds of uncompleted projects, is testament to this. This\"purely negative\" characteristic, as he called it, was complemented by aninterior world seemingly without ballast. In a \"Personal Note\" for 1910, Pessoaannounced that, \"I am now in possession of the fundamental laws of literaryart.\" Neither Shakespeare nor Milton had anything left to teach him. Inconsequence of this, \"My intellect has attained a pliancy and a reach thatenable me to assume any emotion I desire and enter at will into any state ofmind.\" Yet this easy command of interior states came at a price. \"For that whichit is ever an anguish and an effort to strive for, completeness, no book at allcan be an aid.\"\"Given this imbalance between an inability to do and a fluctuating sense of self,it's small wonder that Pessoa would compensate for this by inventing - if that'sthe correct word - an altogether straightforward, absolutely uncomplicated andunselfconscious alter ego. In a letter to the editor A. Casais Monteiro, Pessoaexplained how his heteronyms came about. In 1912, after an unsuccessful attemptat writing \"pagan poems\" Pessoa was nevertheless left with a vague idea of theirauthor. This was not himself, but Ricardo Reis, an Epicurean classicist who wasthe urbane, sophisticated disciple of yet another invented poet, AlbertoCaeiro.14 Caeiro arrived after Pessoa tried, again unsuccessfully, to invent akind of nature poet. As Pessoa writes:On the day when I finally desisted - it was the 8th of March, 1914 - I went overto a high desk and, taking a sheet of paper, began to write, standing, as Ialways write when I can. And I wrote thirty-odd poems straight off, in a kind ofecstasy whose nature I cannot define. It was the triumphal day of my life, and Ishall never have another like it. I started with a title - `The Keeper ofSheep'. And what followed was the apparition of somebody in me, to whom I atonce gave the name Alberto Caeiro. Forgive me the absurdity of the phrase: mymaster had appeared in me. This was the immediate sensation I had.15Other heteronyms and poems followed soon after: the aforementioned Ricardo Reis;the futurist Alvaro de Campos (both, like Pessoa himself, disciples of Caeiro);Alexander Search, Thomas Crosse and Charles Robert Anon, all Englishmen; JeanSeul, a Frenchman; the astrologer Raphael Baldaya; the Baron of Teive (likePessoa, unable to finish anything, except his own life when he committedsuicide); the pagan Antonio Mora; Bernardo Soares, ostensible author of theinterminable Book of Disquiet, and many more. Although new heteronyms continueto emerge, the central cast is made up of Caeiro, Reis, de Campos and Soares,with occasional appearances by Pessoa himself. Caeiro, who as a bucolic poet ofsheer immediacy was the polar opposite of Pessoa, espoused a philosophy ofcomplete unreflectiveness, a Portuguese variant of Zen satori.'6 \"My mysticismis not to try to know/It is to live and not think about it,\" Pessoa's masterwrote, something Pessoa himself found impossible to do. This Zen quality led theCatholic monk Thomas Merton to translate some of Caeiro/Pessoa's verse and showthem to the Buddhist scholar D.T. Suzuki.Even without Pessoa's occult interests, which we will examine shortly, hisaccount of the appearance of Alberto Caeiro is enough to suggest somethingparanormal. `Ecstasy', `apparition', `master': all three suggest something alongthe lines of possession, mediumship and Madame Blavatsky's spiritual guides,although Pessoa himself was critical of theosophy and was even advised during asession of automatic writing to, \"Read no more theosophical books.\" (Hisheteronym Raphael Baldaya attacked Blavatsky savagely in a predictablyunfinished essay.) Although in the next decade surrealists like Andre Breton,Philippe Soupault, and Robert Desnos all practised automatic writing and Bretonhimself was a reader of Eliphas Levi and other occult writers - their interestin it was in a sense more political than occult, or even poetic, seeking, as itwere, an open avenue to the `repressed' unconscious. Pessoa, however, for a timeat least took the practice seriously, influenced in this by his Aunt Anica, adevoted student of the occult, with whom he lived between 1912 and 1914. Between1916 and 1917, Pessoa engaged in a series of automatic writing sessions, makingcontact with several intelligences: Henry More, the Cambridge Platonist, acharacter named Wardour and a dark figure called the Voodooist. Whileinteresting biographically, Pessoa's automatic writings - accomplished sometimeswith a planchette - lack the inspiration of his heteronymic efforts; most ofthem are encouragements to lose his virginity (sadly ineffective) andadmonitions about his habit of masturbation. \"Very soon you will know what youhave courage for - namely, for mating with a girl,\" Henry More informed him.\"You masturbator! You masochist! You man without manhood! ... You man without aman's prick!\" another astral interlocutor opined.\" On other occasions thesesessions produced a variety of occult signs and symbols, Masonic and kabbalisticinsignia whose meaning troubled Pessoa.Along with automatic writing, Pessoa developed other occult skills. Writing tohis Aunt Anica in June 1916, Pessoa informed her that, along with becoming amedium, he had developed other paranormal powers. One of these was a kind oftelepathy. When his great friend Mario De Si-Carneiro was in Paris, goingthrough the emotional crisis that led to his suicide at 26 - downing severalvials of strychnine - Pessoa, he told his aunt, felt Si-Carneiro's anguishthere, in Lisbon, being overwhelmed by a sudden depression. But his greatachievement was the development of `etheric vision.' \"There are moments,\" ... hetold his aunt:when I have sudden flashes of `etheric vision' and can see certain people's`magnetic auras' and especially my own, reflected in the mirror, and radiatingfrom my hands in the dark. In one of my best moments of etheric vision ... I sawsomeone's ribs through his coat and skin ... My `astral vision' is still verybasic, but sometimes, at night, I close my eyes and see a swift succession ofsmall and sharply defined pictures ... I see strange shapes, designs, symbolicsigns, numbers ...\"Like Gerard de Nerval, Pessoa had an interest in occult history and wasfascinated by secret societies and organizations. One form this took was anattack on the Salazar government's proposed ban on freemasonry; in the Didrio deLisboa for 4 February 1935, Pessoa published an article on \"SecretAssociations,\" defending freemasonry and, by association, other occultsocieties. In Pessoa's occult history of the world, freemasonry was thecontemporary embodiment of a mystical dissension that began in ancient timeswith the Gnostics. A lifelong opponent of Christianity, Pessoa saw the \"Gnosticheresy\" surface at different periods in history, appearing as the kabbalists of12th century Spain, the Knights of Malta, the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians,the alchemists, and, in most recent times, freemasonry. Rosicrucianism, however,was perhaps his favourite branch of this esoteric tree. In \"At the Tomb ofChristian Rosenkreuz\" Pessoa wrote that:[img/page0419_0000.svg]Although there is no traceable connection between the Gnostics and theRosicrucians - several centuries separate them in time - Pessoa associated theGnostic idea of the fallen world and the den-ii-urge responsible for it, withthe 17th century followers of Christian Rosenkreuz.Although Pessoa did know a few people who shared his occult interests, most ofhis contact with other occultists was via correspondence. Of these, the mostcelebrated was Aleister Crowley. In recent times, the extent to which Pessoaread Crowley and actually modelled his own ideas about secret societies onaccounts of Crowley's own groups, has become the subject of historicalresearch.20 Pessoa first made contact with Crowley when he wrote to the GreatBeast, pointing out an error in the natal horoscope published in Crowley'snotorious Confessions (Pessoa was a keen astrologer and at one point consideredpursuing the craft professionally). Crowley replied and the two poets exchangedletters and writings; Pessoa even translated Crowley's \"Hymn to Pan\" intoPortuguese. In September 1930, Crowley arrived in Lisbon, with his currentScarlet Woman. The couple quarrelled and Crowley's girlfriend left the country,leaving a deflated Great Beast behind. Crowley then enlisted Pessoa's aid infaking a suicide. Leaving a forlorn lover's note at the Boca do Inferno (Mouthof Hell) - a treacherous rock formation on the coast west of Lisbon - Crowleyimplied that he had taken his own life by leaping into the sea. Pessoa explainedto the Lisbon papers the meaning of the various magical signs and symbols thatadorned Crowley's suicide note, and added the fact that he had actually seenCrowley's ghost the following day. Crowley had in fact left Portugal via Spain,and enjoyed the reports of his death in the newspapers; he finally appearedweeks later at an exhibition of his paintings in Berlin. Given Pessoa's frailego, it was more than likely a blessing that his association with the GreatBeast was brief.What Pessoa actually believed is a difficult question. In the letter describingthe birth of his heteronyms, he also enlarged on his occult ideas. \"I believe inthe existence of worlds higher than our own and in the existence of beings thatinhabit these worlds,\" he wrote, and went on to say that he believed that, \"wecan, according to the degree of our spiritual attunement, communicate with everhigh beings. i21 But for Bernardo Soares, things are not so clear. \"I spentfrightful nights hunched over tomes by mystics and kabbalists which I never hadthe patience to read except intermittently ... The rites and mysteries of theRosicrucians, the symbolism of the Kabbalah and the Templars ... all of thisoppressed me for a long time.\" This led to an \"almost physical loathing forsecret things ... secret societies, occult sciences ... the pretension certainmen have that, through their understandings with Gods or Masters or Demiurges,they and they alone know the great secrets on which the world is founded.\" Butwhat really troubled the author of The Book of Disquiet is that all these mysticmasters were such atrocious stylists. \"When they write to communicate ... theirmysteries,\" he said, \"[they] all write abominably. It offends my intelligencethat a man can master the Devil without being able to master the Portugueselanguage.\" Yet Satanists alone are not at fault. \"To have touched the feet ofChrist,\" Soares tells us, \"is no excuse for mistakes in punctuation. ,12RENE DAUMALSometime in the year 1924 the precocious French poet Rene Daumal soaked ahandkerchief in carbon tetrachloride - a powerful anaesthetic he used for hisbeetle collection - and held it to his nostrils. Instantly the sixteen-year-oldfelt himself \"thrown brutally into another world,\" a strange dimension ofgeometric forms and incomprehensible sounds, in which his mind \"travelled toofast to drag words along with it.\"zsIt was his first encounter with what he would later call \"absurd evidence\":proof that another existence lies beyond the conscious mind. Obsessed with themystery of death, Rene was determined to peek at \"the great beyond.\" When theanaesthetizing effects of the fumes proved too great, Rene's hand would dropfrom his face and he would regain consciousness, his mind reeling - and his headaching - from his recent plunge into somewhere else.Daumal took these trips hundreds of times, sometimes alone, sometimes withfriends, always with the same result: the conviction that he had briefly entered\"another world.\" It is almost certain that the repeated use of carbontetrachloride started the weakening of his lungs with led to his death fromtuberculosis in 1944 at the age of 36.Born in 1908 in the forests of the Ardennes, not far from the Belgian border,like his hero, the equally precocious Arthur Rimbaud (with whom he shared anearly death, a fascination with drugs, and an interest in the occult), Daumalwas educated at Charleville. Early on he displayed two lifelong characteristics:a brilliant intellect and an obsession with the \"beyond'. This last manifesteditself at a young age in a fascination with death. At the age of 6, Rene kepthimself awake, caught in the stranglehold of `nothingness'. This earlyconfrontation with the void led to exhausting experiments with entering dreamswhile still awake and strenuous attempts at `lucid dreaming'.24 They also led tohis teenage attempts at suicide as well as the basic themes of his firstcollection of poetry, Counter Heaven, for which he won a literary prize in 1935.In his early years, Rene found scant opportunity to discuss these matters.Although his paternal grandfather was a Mason who started his own esotericlodge, most adults gave Rene's existential concerns little thought. But duringhis teens, Rene was not alone. When his family moved to Reims and entered theboy in the lycee, Rene met three other young mental voyagers who shared histaste for metaphysical speculation. In 1922, with Roger Vailland, Robert Meyrat,and Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, Rene started a kind of secret society.The Simplists, as they called themselves, became inseparable, and along withreading decadent poets like Baudelaire and Rimbaud, they also studied works onoccultism and theosophy and carried out experiments in parapsychology and magic,some of which included the use of hashish and opium. In one experiment, Daumalwalked alone for hours with his eyes closed, strangely avoiding obstacles in hispath. Other experiments included astral travelling, shared dreams, precognition,attempts to open the third eye, and a form of second sight called \"paropticvision.\"In these experiments, Daumal revealed an uncanny ability to determine theidentity of objects with his eyes closed in a darkened room while wearingtight-fitting, blackened goggles. During these sessions Daumal would behypnotized; he would then hold his hands near the objects, or place them on aspecially covered box containing some item. Daumal could see the images on bookcovers and even sense colours by the temperature they gave off.In 1925 Daumal entered the prestigious Lycee Henri IV in Paris, to prepare forexaminations to enter the Ecole Normale Superieure. One of his professors wasthe philosopher Emile Chartier, better known under his pen-name Alain. Alongwith his work in mathematics, philosophy, science and medicine, Daumal studiedSanskrit, mastering the language in three years, composing a grammar andbeginning several translations. He also read the works of the traditionalistRene Guenon and wrote a series of essays on Indian aesthetics, posthumouslypublished as Rasa (1982).At the time of Daumal's studies in ancient traditions, however, Paris was ahotbed of modernism, and ho group was more vociferous than the surrealists, whoshared with him a fascination with the occult and paranormal. In 1927, Daumalsuffered a fall which led to a period of amnesia; this prevented him from takinghis entrance examinations, so he began a course of free studies in philosophy atthe Sorbonne. There he met the Czech painter Joseph Sima and the Siberian-born,naturalized American Vera Milanova, who later became his wife. With the poetAndre Rolland de Reneville and the other Simplists, the nineteen-year-old Daumalembarked on the short-lived literary review for which he is most remembered inFrance today, Le Grand Jeu (The Big Game).The wild blend of Guenon, Alfred Jarry's Pataphysics, occultism and arcanescholarship in Le Grand Jeu posed a threat to surrealism. When the first issueappeared in 1928, surrealism had been around for a decade, but had lost momentumin endless squabbles over politics and egos. The Simplists, scarcely out oftheir teens, calling for a \"Revolution of Reality returning to its source\" andclaiming to speak the same word as \"uttered by the Vedic Rishis, the kabbalistRabbis, the prophets, the mystics and the great heretics of all time and thetrue Poets,\" were bound to attract the older group's attention.25 Overtures weremade to bring them into the fold, but Daumal firmly declined. Andre Breton, deepinto Marxism, retaliated by openly criticizing Le Grand Jeu for its ideologicalfailings. Daumal, unfazed, answered that Breton should beware of \"eventuallyfiguring in the study guides to literary history.\"Daumal emerged from the skirmish intact, but both he and Le Grand Jeu were notin good shape. By 1929, his childhood friend Roger Gilbert-Lecomte had succumbedto the drug addiction that would eventually kill him. Daumal himself was barelyscratching out an existence, living in poverty, losing his teeth, and feelingthe ravages of his various experiments. If Daumal rejected Breton'ssolicitations, it was not from lack of need for a father figure. He was merelywaiting to meet a more remarkable man.On 30 November at the Cafe Figon on the Boulevard St. Germain- a man whom JosephSima recognized from a previous collaboration sat at a table drinking calvadosand beer, and drawing odd Arabic and Oriental designs. Sima approached hisacquaintance and introduced the famous artist Alexandre de Salzmann to his youngfriend Rene. De Salzmann, a world-renowned authority of theatre lighting and setdesign, engaged Daumal and the others in conversation. Then, after a fewminutes, he proposed a test: he asked the group to hold their arms straight outat the side for as long as they could. Several minutes later only Daumal'sremained in the air. De Salzmann smiled and said, \"You interest me.\" Daumal hadmet his remarkable man.Since 1918, Alexandre de Salzmann and his wife Jeanne had been students of theenigmatic Russian guru Gurdjieff. Born into an aristocratic family in Tiflis,Georgia, like Gurdjieff, de Salzmann had a colourful past, part of whichincluded being kidnapped by brigands as a teenager. He claimed to have lost histeeth when falling from a mountain while in the service of a Russian Grand Duke.However, like Gurdjieff, de Salzmann enjoyed frequent leg-pulling and his manyclaims should be taken with a grain of salt. Yet he certainly shared onecharacter trait with his master. de Salzmann was a remarkably versatile man,enthusiastic about everything. When Daumal first encountered him, he describedde Salzmann as a \"former dervish, former Benedictine, former professor ofjiujitsu, healer and stage designer. ,2After studies in Moscow, de Salzmann headed for Munich, where he became involvedin the Art Nouveau movement, becoming friends with Rilke and Kandinsky andcontribut= ing illustrations to important journals like Jugend and Sim-plicissimus. It was here that he met the composer Thomas de Hartmann, who wouldlater introduce him to Gurdjieff. In 1911 he went to Hellerau, where hedeveloped a new system of stage lighting; among others, the poet Paul Claudelwas captivated by his work. It was also there that he met his wife Jeanne, ateacher of eurhythmics; after Gurdjieff s death in 1949, she became the centralliving exponent of \"the work.\"de Salzmann's relationship with Gurdjieff was ambiguous. At the time of deSalzmann's death from tuberculosis in 1933, Gurdjieff had apparently cut off hisstudent of fifteen years, refusing to visit him as he lay dying in a hotel room.When the weak sickly man finally summoned the strength to confront Gurdjieff,his master all but ignored him. Whatever the esoteric meaning behind Gurdjiefl'sbehaviour, this incident must remain one of the darkest in the history of \"thework.\"When the twenty-one-year-old Daumal met de Salzmann, he had no doubt his momentof destiny had arrived. Gurdjieff had been in France since 1922, directing theactivities at his famous prieure in Fontainebleau, where, ironically, anotheryoung writer, Katharine Mansfield, also died of tuberculosis. But by 1924,Gurdjieff had suffered a mysterious car accident and had lost interest in hisInstitute for the Harmonious Development of Man. Instead he laboured at themonumental Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson, gaining inspiration from copiousamounts of black coffee and armagnac.When Daumal met de Salzmann, the artist was making a living as an interiordecorator and antique dealer. Still thirsting for the absolute, Daumal now drankgreedily from one of its living wells. Rene and Vera spent endless nightstalking with de Salzmann about Gurdjieff, and eventually de Salzmann appeared infictional form in Daumal's two allegorical novels. La Grande Beuverie (1938),translated as A Night of Serious Drinking, was started during Daumal's briefstay in New York while working as a press agent for the Indian dan= cer UdayShankar, and was a send up of the various artistic movements at large in Parisin the years between the wars. Although the novel, like Daumal's earlyexperiments with carbon tetrachloride, is concerned with intoxicated states,Daumal's preface states his aesthetic and philosophical credo with admirableconcision: \"I refuse to accept,\" he writes, \"that a clear thought can ever beinexpressible.\" Unlike most of the surrealist texts, Daumal's work ischaracterized by clarity and directness. While much of the automatic writingproduced by Breton, Desnos and others is almost unreadable, Daumal's deceptivelysimple prose remains immediately accessible. This is especially true of hislater, unfinished novel Mount Analogue (1952), in which de Salzmann appears asProfessor Pierre Sogol.After de Salzmann's death, Rene and Vera threw themselves into \"the work\" with adedication that troubled their friends. In a house in Seves, a suburb of Paris,Jeanne de Salzmann set up a kind of mini-prieure, a communal home dedicated toGurdjiefl's teachings. There, with the orientalist Philippe Lavastine and a fewothers, Rene and Vera pursued the difficult task of `waking up'. They struggledthrough Gurdjiefl's \"movements,\" incredibly difficult physical exercisesdesigned to tap unused energies and overcome \"sleep,\" and investigated theeffect of music on the human organism. Yet during this time Daumal's healthdeteriorated; his rotting teeth were pulled and he became deaf in his left ear.He kept his failing body and growing soul together by contributing toL'Encyclopedie Franfaise and through translations of Hemingway and D.T. Suzuki'sEssays on Zen Buddhism.In 1938 Daumal began to work with Gurdjieff directly, attending the famousdinners in Gurdjieffs tiny flat on the rue de Colonel Renards. This was aturning point in his life sadly parallelled by another: in the same year he wasdiagnosed with tuberculosis. Daumal rejected treatment and refused to enter asanatorium.27In 1940 Germany invaded France. Vera was Jewish, and for his remaining years,Daumal eked out an increasingly precarious existence, constantly on the run fromthe Gestapo and the Vichy government. In 1941 tubercular arthritis developed inhis left foot; two years later a synovial tumour erupted and the resultinginfection caused him excruciating pain. Like his hero Rimbaud, for the last sixmonths of his life Daumal was unable to walk. In the end malnourishment and apunishing habit of chain-smoking Gauloises killed him. In April 1944 Daumaldied. An uncompleted sentence in the manuscript of Mount Analogue marks thepoint at which his quest for the absolute ended.Subtitled A Novel of Symbolically Authentic Non-Euclidean Adventures in MountainClimbing, Mount Analogue resists final interpretation. A riveting marvel tale,it is also a modern day Pilgrim's Progress. Led by Professor Sogol, eightadventurers board the yacht Impossible to discover the invisible but \"absolutelyreal\" Mount Analogue, a symbol of spiritual pursuit. Though it is hidden fromordinary eyes, Sogol pinpoints its location through a series of supra-logicaldeductions involving the curvature of space.Convinced of the necessity of Mount Analogue's existence, the crew eventuallyarrive. And although \"long expectation of the unknown lessens the final effectof surprise,\" the group's first encounter with their destination wasnevertheless extraordinary:... while we waited tense in the bows with the sun behind us, a wind rosewithout any warning, or rather a powerful suction suddenly pulled us forward,space opened ahead of us, a bottomless emptiness, a horizontal abyss of air andwater impossibly entwined. The boat creaked in all its timbers and was hurledforward unerringly along a rising slope as far as the centre of the abyss andwas suddenly set adrift in a wide calm bay, in sight of land.\"\"A flotilla of boats manned by Europeans came out to meet them, and the leaderled them to a white house where, in a bare room with a red tile floor, a man inmountain dress received them. He asked them some obvious questions which,unexpectedly, the group found very difficult to answer:Each one of his questions - all of them very simple: Who were we? Why had wecome? - caught us completely off our guard and seemed to probe our very insides.Who are you? Who am I? We could not answer him as we would a police official ora customs inspector. Give one's name and profession? What does that mean? Butwho are you? And what are you? The words we uttered - we had none better - wereworthless, repugnant and grotesque as dead things.Z\"They soon discovered that all authority on Mount Analogue is in the hand of themountain guides, and, by what seemed a miracle of coincidence, that they hadlanded on a spot, Port o' Monkeys, peopled by Frenchmen, like themselves. Therewere no natives on Mount Analogue; everyone there came from somewhere else. Andalthough there wasn't \"a single quadrumanous species in the region,\" theirharbour nevertheless had its odd name. \"I find it hard to describe my reaction,\"the narrator remarks, \"but that name summoned up in my mind, ratherdisagreeably, all my heritage as a twentieth-century Occidental - somethingcurious, imitative, shameless, agitated. Our port of arrival could not have beenany other than Port o' Monkeys.\"s0But perhaps the strangest discovery was the material the inhabitants used formoney. Before arriving, the crew had been troubled about what they might use tobarter with the natives. They knew that for bartering with \"primitive\" people,travellers bring along a supply of trinkets: penknives, mirrors, combs, pipes,souvenirs, and other assorted junk. But in trying to trade with \"the superiorbeings of Mount Analogue\" such items would be useless. What did they possess ofreal value? With what could they pay for the new knowledge they would receive?For some time before arriving, each member of the crew made a \"personalinventory\" and as the days passed, each felt himself poorer, for \"no one sawanything around him or in him which really belonged to him.\"\"This problem was solved when the group was told of the peradam, strange, nearlyinvisible crystals that symbolize the rare and difficult truths found on thespiritual path, and which can also serve as an emblem of Daumal's equally lucidprose:There is found here, rarely on the lower slopes and more frequently as oneascends, a clear and extremely hard stone, spherical and of variable size. It isa true crystal and - an extraordinary instance entirely unknown elsewhere on theplanet - a curved crystal ... this stone is called peradam. It may mean . . .`harder than diamond', as is very much the case or else `father of diamond'. Andsome say that diamond is in reality the product of the disintegration of peradamby a sort of squaring of the circle or ... cubing of the sphere. Or else theword may mean `Adam's stone' and have had some secret and profound complicitywith the original nature of man.32One of the peradam's most remarkable characteristics is that its \"index ofrefraction\" is \"so close to that of air.\" Only the trained eye can discoverthem, but \"to any person who seeks it with sincerity and out of true need itreveals itself by a brilliant sparkle like that of a dewdrop.\"33 These nearlyinvisible stones - reminiscent of the lapis sought by the alchemists - are theonly material things of any value on Mount Analogue.Although the novel's fragmentary character is in keeping with Gurdjieff's \"work\"- Ouspensky's own masterpiece In Search of the Miraculous was originally titledFragments of an Unknown Teaching - the fact that Daumal didn't live to finish itis a tragedy. But before his death he left an outline of the remaining chapters.\"At the end,\" he said, \"I want to speak of one of the basic laws of MountAnalogue. To reach the summit, one must proceed from encampment to encampment.But before setting out for the next refuge, one must prepare those coming afterto occupy the place one is leaving. Only after having prepared them, can one goon up.''34 The title of the last chapter was to be \"And You, What Do You Seek?\"Like Daumal's narrator faced with the questions of the mountain guide, hisreaders may have found this simple request difficult to fulfil.O. V. DE L. MILOSZThe name Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz, like that of Villiers d'Isle-Adam, isnot one frequently heard these days, although the efforts of his nephew, theNobel Prize winning Czeslaw Milosz, to remedy this fact have been considerable.Milosz, like Villiers, although Polish and Lithuanian by ancestry, wrote some ofthe most eloquent French prose, and he also shared with Villiers two othercharacteristics. His writing is suffused with an hermetic and mystical doctrinereaching back to previous ages; and his family line began with the Serbianaristocracy of medieval times. Milosz set much store by this noble ancestry, ashis adoption of the heraldic title de Lubicz attests; yet, unlike Villiers, thisaristocratic lineage did not prevent him from coming to grips with the world, ashis long and honoured diplomatic service to the Lithuanian government makesclear.35 Yet, like Villiers, one could say of Milosz that he existed in theflesh only out of sheer politeness. \"One,\" he wrote, \"can get used toeverything: the important thing is to live as little as possible in what iscalled the world of reality. ,36 Milosz took this suggestion to heart, and formuch of his life he spent his time in the imaginative realms of Goethe, Plato,Swedenborg and Dante, his masters on the road to illumination. He learned hislessons well, and on a cold winter night on 14 December, 1914, Milosz had amystical experience which transfigured himself and his work. His close friend,Carlos Larronde, the theatrical producer, recalled speaking to Milosz soon afterhis enlightenment. Emerging from a week's long seclusion, Milosz opened the doorto his small apartment and, greeting Larronde in the hallway said, \"I have seenthe spiritual sun.\"37 For some, Milosz's mystical writings are simply obscure,but sympathetic readers of his arcane and difficult esoteric works are prone toagree with this brief account of his experience.O.V. de L. Milosz was born on 28 May 1877 on the vast family estate of Czereia,Lithuania. His father was a PolishLithuanian nobleman, his mother was Jewish,and his paternal grandmother Italian: along with his noble blood, Milosz hadfrom the start the mix of races and ancestry that would lead his translator andeditor Christopher Bamford to speak of him as \"that almost impossible creature... a fully realized Occidental, a true son and heir of the West ...s3s Thiscrossroads of nationalities would emerge later in Milosz's fluency in severallanguages; by the age of twelve he spoke Polish, German and French perfectly,and to these was soon added English. (In later years he learned Hebrew and aBible in that language was for a long time his bedside reading.) Along withfitting him for his future diplomatic service, this polyglot background preparedMilosz for the many translations he would make throughout his career, renderingGoethe, Byron, Shelley, Schiller, Mickiewicz, Pushkin, Lermontov and others intohis adopted tongue. It also foreshadowed Milosz's fate as a national andspiritual wanderer, a destiny that, as the critic George Steiner remarked, isthe defining characteristic of modern poets. Although at home in severaltongues, finding a dwelling in a geographic place always proved a challenge toMilosz. This is one reason why, in later years, he adopted the calling of theNoble Traveller, an honorific given to Cagliostro, St.Germain, and otherspiritual wanderers of the occult enlightenment whose \"itineraries, thoughapparently haphazard, rigorously coincided with the adept's most secretaspirations and gifts ... 39Milosz's childhood was unhappy; his father, wilful, anarchistic and atheist,suffered from a serious nervous disorder, and his mother's \"materialistic anduncomprehending solicitude\" sent the boy wandering alone through the vast parksof the family estate. Milosz later remarked that the affection he would havenaturally had for his parents was siphoned off to others around him. He wasparticularly fond of his paternal grandparents, as well as his nurse Marie andhis tutor Stanislas Doboszynski, who introduced him to Polish literature.At the age of twelve, Milosz accompanied his parents to Paris, where his fatherwas treated by the famous Dr. Charcot. A few months later, his parents returnedto Warsaw, leaving Milosz behind as a student at the Lycee Janson de Sailly.Under the direction of Edouard Petit Milosz proved a brilliant student, but hiseducation as a poet came from other hands. At thirteen Milosz was immersed inLamartine, Baudelaire, Poe, as well as Goethe, Novalis, Holderlin, Byron,Shelley, Mickie- wicz and Slowacki. At eighteen Milosz was a regular at theKalissaya, the first American bar in Paris, where he often shared a table withOscar Wilde. On one occasion, Wilde is reported to have introduced Milosz to anacquaintance. Sitting at a table with George Moore, Ernest Lajeunesse, and thepoet Moreas, Wilde saw Milosz come in and, turning to his friend said, \"This isMoreas, the poet. And that is Milosz - poetry- itselfMilosz joined in the discussions about \"pure poetry\" at the Kalissaya andanother literary haunt, the Napolitaine. But for all his neo-Romanticism, Miloszwas dissatisfied with talk of art for art's sake. In a letter to his greatfriend Christian Gauss, Milosz spoke of being \"horribly sad ... with a sadnessthat nothing can vanquish.\" \"This life,\" he. wrote, \"is horribly empty with itsanxious loneliness surrounded by the idiots of the Napolitaine and the Kalissaya...\"41A few months later, on 1 January 1901, Milosz made a suicide attempt. \"On thefirst of January ... towards eleven o'clock in the evening - with perfect calm,a cigarette at my lips - the human soul is, after all, a strange thing - I shotmyself in the region of the heart with a revolver,\" he later wrote Gauss.41 Hebungled the job, but his doctors didn't believe he'd recover. Miraculously hedid. The next year he was recalled to Lithuania, to take up his responsibilitiesupon his father's death. By this time he had written and published his firstcollection of poetry, The Poem of Decadences, a timely title that does littlejustice to the poems themselves. It was also by then that articles recognizingMilosz's genius began to appear.Between 1904 and 1914 an independently wealthy Milosz wrote, published andtravelled. In 1905, he witnessed the aborted Russian Revolution; that same yearhe sold off his family estate to a government company engaged in parcelling outland to the peasants. (He invested the profits in Tsarist bonds; although hewould live on their interest for some years, with the Bolshevik revolution, themove would prove disastrous.) In 1906 The Seven Solitudes as well as the fantasyprose poem \"The Very Simple Story of Mr. Trix-Trix, Clown,\" was published.Between that year and 1910, Milosz wandered through Germany, Russia, Poland,England (which, like Pessoa, he loved immensely), Italy, Spain and North Africa.Although this life of the Noble Traveller had its joys - spiritual as well ascarnal - Milosz felt this time was sterile. A sense of this emerges in hiserotic mystical novel Amorous Initiation, which depicts in lush, poetic prosethe ascent of its narrator from a demeaning obsession with a Venetian cour-.tesan to the pure love of the absolute, a theme Milosz would return to over theyears.42 Although Milosz is known to have had several affairs, some inspirationfor the novel certainly came from the unrequited love he felt for EmmyHeine-Gelder, a distant relative of the poet Heinrich Heine. Thirteen years hisjunior, Emmy, \"the only woman I loved,\" rejected Milosz and married instead ayounger man. The experience affected Milosz profoundly, and for the rest of hislife, the idea and nature of love, \"the hard labour of the dream,\" would be hiscentral poetic concern.Another novel, The Zborowskis, was started in 1910, as well as the poems makingup The Elements. In the next year Milosz wrote the first of his mystery plays,Miguel Manara, inspired by an article he read in Le Temps while sitting in thebar, Le Fouquet, in the Champs Elysees. After writing the first four acts,Milosz wrote to his friend, the sculptor Leon Vogt, that the work is of an\"extraordinary beauty\" and that now he could \"die without regrets.\" Moretranslations appeared, as well as another mystery play, Mephiboseth. 1913 saw atrip to Rome, as well as Milosz's introduction to the esoteric circlesurrounding the journal L'Affranchi (\"The Liberated\"). Les Veilleurs (\"TheWatchers\") included the alchemist and eccentric Egyptologist Rene Schwaller; afew years later, Milosz would bestow upon Schwaller his heraldic title of deLubicz.43 It was also at this time that Milosz contracted xanthoma, a skincondition that made him speak of himself as \"a leper.\"1914 saw more translations and poems appear, but it was in December of that yearthat Milosz underwent the profound experience that would change both his lifeand his work. Exactly what took place on the night of 14 December 1914 isunclear. In writing of his relative's illumination, Czeslaw Milosz compares itto the more famous transfiguration of Blaise Pascal, who, \"from half past ten inthe evening until about half past twelve\" on 23 November 1654, experienced\"FIRE/God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God ofJacob\" and felt \"Certitude. Certitude.Feeling. Joy. Peace.\"To remind himself of what he experienced that night, Pascal wrote a note on apiece of paper which, after his death, was found sewn into his jacket. A decadeafter his experience, in 1924 Milosz published his first metaphysical work, thelong hermetic prose poem Ars Magna, followed three years later in 1927 by TheArcana. At that point, Milosz abandoned writing poetry for a decade, returningto it only once, in 1936, to write his last poem, \"Psalm of the Morning Star.\"For many of Milosz's admirers, this transition from poet to metaphysician was adisaster. Milosz himself believed that everything he had written up till thenwas a mere preparation for the mystical vision it was his destiny tocommunicate. Although there is a distinct shift in voice from the moremelancholy, slightly cynical late-Romanticism of his early work, and his later,hermetic tone, Czeslaw Milosz is correct in seeing in this development acontinual growth, rather than a radical change of direction. In many ways, whatMilosz in his hermetic works did is to bring the concern of the early Romanticsin line with the latest discoveries of science. In Ars Magna and The Arcana wefind a wedding of Einstein and Swedenborg.The metaphysics of Ars Magna and The Arcana is difficult to explain, even toreaders familiar with the mystical tradition to which it belongs; after readingthe poems several times, I'm not sure I even understand it myself. Perhaps thesimplest approach is to see Milosz as the inheritor of the Romantic struggleagainst the by-now triumphant materialist account of the universe. With Blake,Milosz saw in Newton's idea of an abstract, absolute space and time the sourceof the satanic mills that blackened the early 19th century skies. For Newton,space is simply infinite empty extension, with planets, stars and galaxies mereclumps of matter, floating in the void. The same is also true of time, which isanother kind of extension. For Milosz, this vision of an infinite empty spaceand an eternal, neutral time, is the very vision of Hell; it is, as in Blake,the fallen world humanity entered having been jettisoned from Paradise. Such avoid, in which humanity appears the merest speck, if at all, makes meaninglessany sense of value, any notion of the good, true and beautiful; or, at best, itlimits these to purely utilitarian terms. What Milosz found important inEinstein - and what led him to believe that through his work there emerged thepossibility of healing the split between the inner human world and the outermechanical one (again, another characteristic of Hell) - was his discovery thatspace and time were relative to the observer. This did away with Newton'sabstract space, and, at least to Milosz, returned humanity to the centre of theuniverse, a theme common to the hermetic tradition. Milosz claimed that untilhis illumination, he had only a superficial acquaintance with hermeticliterature. What is known is that after his experience, Milosz began a deep andthorough study of the entire corpus of esoteric writings, looking forconfirmation of his vision.He found it in many places, but most of all in Swedenborg. For Swedenborg, asfor Blake, Goethe, Paracelsus and other hermetic thinkers, man is the centralmystery of the world, and is not, as in the rationalist view, one chancecreature among others in an accidental universe. For Swedenborg, the universe infact is man, cosmic man, the Anthropos, Adam Kadmon of the kabbalists. ForMilosz, Einstein, in his way - and of whose works at the time of his experiencehe had not the slightest idea - was only putting into contemporary mathematicallanguage the insights known to hermeticists for centuries.Yet all of this sounds fairly abstract when compared to Milosz's calm yet almosthallucinatory prose:On the fourteenth of December, nineteen hundred and fourteen, at about eleveno'clock in the evening, in a state of perfect wakefulness, having said my prayerand meditated my daily verse from the Bible, I suddenly felt, without theslightest amazement, a completely unexpected change occurring in my whole body.At first I noticed that I was granted a power, until that day unknown, ofsoaring freely through space; and a moment later I found myself near the summitof a mighty mountain shrouded with bluish mists of indescribable fineness andsweetness. From this moment on, I was spared the effort of rising with my ownmovement. For the mountain, tearing its roots out of the earth, carried merapidly towards unimaginable heights, towards nebulous regions silent andstreaked by immense flashes of lightning.Milosz's ascent, however, did not last long. And when the movement stopped, hecould see:... a very dense cloud, which, despite its coppery tinge, I compared to thefreshly discharged seed of man. Above the top of my skull, a little to the rear,a glow then appeared like that of a torch reflected by still water or an oldmirror.During these visions, Milosz was in complete command of his senses, and feltneither dread, nor curiosity nor amazement. Yet:an instant later, from regions which I knew were far behind me, a sort ofgigantic and reddish egg shot forth, hurled with extraordinary force into space,it reached the line of my forehead in an instant; and there, suddenly changingits movement and colour, it became round and small, turned into a golden lamp,lowered itself until it brushed my face, climbed again, grew in size, recoveredits oval shape of an angelic sun, stopped not far above my forehead and lookeddeeply into my eyes.'This was the \"spiritual sun\" he told Carlos Larronde he had seen.It is impossible to do more than touch on Milosz's 20th century contribution tothe hermetic tradition. Ars Magna and The Arcana are extremely difficult works;the \"Exegetic Notes\" to The Arcana alone run some hundred pages. He was in manyways a man out of time; his spiritual milieu was that of Saint-Martin,Cagliostro, Goethe, the Enlightenment Illuminati discussed in the first sectionof this book. Like Swedenborg, he combined a mystical sensibility with apractical capability rarely exhibited in poets.In his last days, Milosz wrote an eccentric interpretation of the Book ofRevelations, after having read the work some 50 times over a fortnight. Hebelieved that the year 1944 would see a universal conflagration, and althoughWorld War II fell short of this, he had also predicted its arrival several yearsin advance. He spent his last years at Fontainebleau, where he loved to walk inthe gardens and where he displayed an uncommon intimacy with the birds. On oneoccasion, after an absence of some months, upon his return he was greeted with achorus of song, \"paths, woods and bushes resounded with calls,\" presenting a\"light-headed joy by all kinds of species.\" His love of his aerial friends wasdemanding, and on one occasion, after carrying a case of seeds, he collapsed ina faint, falling into the December snow, almost dying. He did die on 2 March1939. One particular bird he let free in a room reserved for it, and it was onlyput into its cage at night. On that evening the bird refused to go into itscage, and, Milosz, desperate, attempted to catch it. Finally getting his handson it after several attempts, but frantic and exhausted after the chase, Miloszcollapsed. He was dead. The symbolism will not escape the attentive reader.MALCOLM LOWRYAt the summer solstice of 1916, Frater Achad - otherwise known as CharlesStansfeld Jones, a London accountant and devoted student of the occult - stoodbefore his altar in his temple in Vancouver, Canada, and acknowledged aremarkable fact. He had, he realized, undergone a significant transformation.From humble Neophyte in the order of the Argentinum Astrum, or Silver Star, hehad metamorphosed into a Master of the Temple. Confirmation of this exaltedchange came in the form of visitation by the Secret Chiefs who, Achad realized,had called upon him to accept the obligations of his new status. Taking thesolemn oath of his new office, Frater Achad swore to fulfil his duties and towork diligently to execute all the responsibilities that were attendant upon himnow.Soon after his experience, Jones telegrammed his mentor in London, with whom hehad been carrying on a magical correspondence course, and announced what hadhappened. Aleister Crowley, the Great Beast and Jones' master, was delighted atthe news, but more importantly, he was struck by the remarkable coincidence itseemed to portend. Just nine months previously, with two of his Scarlet Women,Crowley had performed a series of magical operations, the aim of which was toproduce a \"magical child,\" an heir to the mysteries inherent in his sacred text,The Book of the Law. Jones' telegram seemed to confirm that Crowley's efforts -which included for the most part having sex in a variety of ways - had beensuccessful. Frater Achad, he felt certain, was the one predicted by the Book,who would come and elucidate its many secrets. Achad, encouraged by his master'sdelight, embarked on a long and complicated kabbalistic analysis of Crowley'sinspired work, which eventually took shape in 1919 as the revelation that Godcombines within himself both being and non-being.45 This discovery heartenedCrowley and, at least for him, cleared up some of the more obscure points in TheBook of the Law. Yet, as happened with practically everyone who got involvedwith him, the Great Beast eventually turned on Frater Achad. The fact, however,that in 1926, Jones went mad could not have helped their relations. During abrief stay in England, Crowley's magical child joined the Roman Catholic Churchwith the intention of converting it to Crowley's religion of thelema. He thenreturned to Vancouver where, on a particularly auspicious day, wearing only arain coat, he flung it open, revealed his nakedness, and announced that he hadabandoned the Veil of Illusion.Frater Achad soon recovered from his mania, and jettisoning Crowley's yolk,declared that Aiwass, the Great Beast's Holy Guardian Angel, was a malignantintelligence. He did not abandon his magical studies though, and hereafterannounced that a New Aeon was indeed upon the world, but not the one thatCrowley had in mind. Crowley, hearing of Jones's apostasy, realized his journeyacross the abyss - the necessary prerequisite to becoming a Master of the Temple- had been precipitous, and expelled him from his order. And to make sure thathis ex-student learned his lesson, he evoked a handful of demons to destroy him.Frater Achad's magical career, however, was not over, and his influence wouldinform two significant occult streams in the 20th century. One would originatein Pasadena, California, and include important figures like Jack Parsons, RobertHeinlein, and L. Ron Hubbard.46 The other would begin closer to home, inVancouver, and would have a profound effect on Jones' fellow Englishman, MalcolmLowry, and his important modernist novel, Under the Volcano. Lowry seems an aptinheritor ofJones' wisdom: if anyone had ever entered an abyss, Lowry, with hishaunted, demonridden life, full of minor and major tragedies, surely had.47Malcolm Lowry was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire in 1909 and died in Ripe, Sussexin 1957; much of his life, however, was spent in foreign lands. On the coroner'sreport the cause of death was given as \"misadventure\" - he had apparently chokedon his own vomit - but the exact details are unknown. After a night of heavydrinking and a violent quarrel with his second wife, Margerie Bonner, Lowry wasfound dead the next morning, lying in a pool of gin and broken glass. He was notquite forty-eight, and the possibility of suicide cannot be ruled out: a bottlethat had contained twenty sodium amytal sleeping pills was found empty. At thetime of his death, aside from a few friends and aficionados of his work, Lowrywas unknown. Under the Volcano, his major work, is now considered one of themost important novels of the 20th century. It is, by most accounts, a masterworkof modernist technique. It is also a book given over to Lowry's obsessions withoccult ideas of initiation, trial, rebirth and the tragic fate of a blackmagician. The central framework of the book is the Kabbalah, the esotericmeaning of which he learned first hand from his teacher, Charles StansfeldJones.Lowry's first meeting with Jones has all the romantic qualities we would expectfrom a magical encounter, although, as is clear from Gordon Bowker's exhaustivebiography, Lowry, like many drawn to the occult, had a penchant formythologizing his life.\" In a letter to his German translator, Clemens tenHolder, Lowry describes how he first came across Crowley's disinherited son. Heand his wife Margerie had been living not far from Vancouver in a shack inDollarton, British Columbia. Here Lowry worked obsessively on several revisionsof his novel, which, by this time, had been rejected by twelve publishers.Walking in the forest, and contemplating the growing similarities between theintoxicated Geoffrey Firmin, the ex-British Consul, drinking himself to death inMexico - Lowry's fictional alter ego - and Faust, Lowry reflected that histragic hero was \"in the position, as it were, of a black magician.\" If this wereso, he thought, \"had I not better learn something about what really haunted him?Fatal supposition! Indeed no sooner had I thought that than I actuallyencountered a strange personage in the forest here, who, ostensibly a canvasserfor votes, was in reality just such a magician ... \"49Lowry hastened to add thathe -Jones - was a white magician and that Lowry himself did not practice thecraft. Synchronicities of this sort - to use C.G.Jung's term for `meaningfulcoincidences' - seem to crowd Lowry's life, as well as his fiction: Under theVolcano can be read as an extended stream of consciousness exercise in thehermetic theme of correspondences.After that meeting, which more than likely took place in June 1941 - although inthe extant correspondence, the first mention of Jones is in a postcard toLowry's friend Gerald Noxon nearly two years later - Jones returned to Lowry'sshack, bringing with him copies of two books he had written: Q.B.L. or theBride's Reception and The Anatomy of the Body of God. Both dealt with Kabbalah,although Frater Achad's other main interest was the Parsifal legend, his studiesin which produced The Chalice of Ecstasy, being the Inmost Secret of PAR- ZIVALby a Companion of the Holy Grail, a Magical and Qabalistic Interpretation of theDrama of Parzival, published in 1923 by the same small Chicago firm thatproduced his other works. Jones also brought along a diagram of the Tree ofLife, the graphic representation of the ten sephiroth or levels of existenceemanating from the unmanifest godhead. Lowry was so taken with this that heasked Jones to teach him everything he knew about Kabbalah. Stan, as Lowry cameto call him, agreed, and lent him a book about the \"sacred magic\" of Abra-Melinthe mage. This was more than likely The Book of the Sacred Magic ofAbra-Melinthe Mage, a translation of a manuscript that Samuel Liddell Mathers (laterMacGregor), the head of the Golden Dawn when Crowley first joined, haddiscovered in the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal in Paris. The text was written byAbraham the Jew in 1458, and recounts Abraham's years as a student of a seerknown as Abramelin. Years later, he committed the knowledge he had gained towriting, and this was translated into French sometime in 1700; it was thisFrench translation that Mathers came across. Mathers was not the only one tohave known of the book: both Eliphas Levi and Bulwer-Lytton were conversant withit.The aim of the rituals included in the text is to bring the practitioner to the\"knowledge and conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel.\" To achieve this, themagician must learn how to master the lower demonic forces; legend has it thatwhen Crowley himself attempted the operation - in his magical lodge inBoleskine, near Loch Ness - he failed to do this: hence the shadows thatsurrounded his later career. In Lowry's case, the demonic voices the mescalinspired Consul hears come straight out ofMathers' text.'°Lowry and Margerie visited Jones often. Stan lived with his wife Rubina in DeepCove, a hamlet not far from Dollarton, where they were more or less the residenteccentrics. Aside from his magical pursuits, Jones had a degree in philosophy,was a painter as well as the head of the College Ad Spiritum Sanctum, whose basewas located in Chicago. Rubina shared Charles' interest in the occult, and wasalso a great reader, although she had less enthusiasm for Lowry than her husbandhad. The two couples became good friends nevertheless, and soon the Lowrys werespending a few evenings a week at Jones's house. There he introduced them to avariety of mystical practices: yoga, the I Ching, astral travel and meditation.Jones believed that the myth of the Holy Grail was the archetype of the questfor hidden knowledge, and more and more Lowry came to agree. Since his childhoodhe had believed that he was in some way different from others, had been setapart for some special fate, and that, like his predecessors Poe and Baudelaire,he was destined for a life of suffering, through which he would acquire deepspiritual understanding. It was another of those odd coincidences that among thewriters Jones introduced to Lowry was Eliphas Levi who, as we've seen, alsobelieved that the true magus must pass through the fires of suffering.Jones made his impressive occult library available to Lowry, and we get an ideaof the kind of world Malcolm was entering by the checklist of occult titles thatappears in Under the Volcano. When Hugh, Geoffrey's brother, arrives inCuernavaca,\" Mexico, where the novel takes place, and inspects his brother'slibrary, he finds an odd collection:... on high shelves around the walls: Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, Serpentand Siva Worship in Central America, there were two long shelves of this,together with the rusty leather bindings and frayed edges of the numerouskabbalistic and alchemical books, though, some looked fairly new, like theGoetia of the Lemegaton of Solomon the King ...52There were other books as well: the Mahabharata, William Blake, the Upanishads,the Rig Veda, but also Peter Rabbit. \" `Everything is to be found in PeterRabbit,' the Consul liked to say,\" Hugh recalls: a touch of humour added forleavening, perhaps; but perhaps also a nod to the kabbalistic notion that deep,profound secrets can be found in the simplest text.By the time Lowry met Jones, he was ready for the initiation. Occult, or atleast metaphysical literature was not foreign to him. He was a great reader ofOuspensky and in a letter to his mother-in-law, who shared his esotericinterests, he suggested she read A New Model of the Universe and TertiumOrganum; in the same letter he praised J.W. Dunne's An Experiment With Time andspoke highly of Charles Fort's books. He even plagiarized Ouspensky, saying thathe has \"always believed that, that which impedes the motion of thought isfalse,\" a slight paraphrase of Ouspensky's coda to Tertium Organum itself. (Inlater years he would also repeat Ouspensky's dictum that \"If we could putquestions rightly, we should know the answers,\" an insight that finds an oddecho in some of Wittgenstein's aphorisms.53) Ouspensky's speculations on timeand eternal recurrence find their way into Lowry's magnum opus, most clearly inthe symbolism of the wheel that turns up in several places, most powerfully inthe Ferris wheel, which, significantly, at the close of the opening chapter,revolves backwards over the setting for the Consul's trials, a subtle yetstriking image of return.54 Lowry also identified strongly with Ouspensky'sdescription of the Hanged Man from the Tarot, another image of suffering.In later years, Lowry would visit Haiti and stumble - literally - into the darkworld of voodoo. On one occasion he attended a voodoo ceremony that lasted twodays and two nights, and returned befuddled with drugs. \"The voodoo priest,\" hewrote to his friend Alfred Erskine, \"perhaps recognizing a kindred spirit, haspromised to initiate me by fire when I return ... I really would like to be avoodoo priest.\"ss Although, as is common knowledge, Lowry had frequent andexcessive experience of other spirits - alcohol in a variety of forms - he wasalways keen on making contact with more transcendental kinds. This is something,to his ultimate regret, his fictional counterpart seems to achieve.A detailed, chapter-by-chapter account of the kabbalistic symbolism that fillsUnder the Volcano can be found in Perle Epstein's exhaustive study, The PrivateLabyrinth of Malcolm Lowry; Lowry himself offers an apology for it in his longletter to Jonathan Cape, his publisher, defending his use of occult symbols. Ican only touch on a few examples of it here.56 The novel depicts the last day inthe life of Geoffrey Firmin, an alcoholic ex-British Consul, with an interest inmysticism, especially Kabbalah.57 The day in question is 2 November, the Day ofthe Dead, the Mexican equivalent of All Soul's Day, when the dead are believedto come back and visit the living. In Geoffrey's case, two of his dead haverecently arrived: his brother Hugh, and his ex-wife Yvonne, whose affair withHugh, compounded by Geoffrey's incurable drinking, precipitated their divorce.Number symbolism saturates the book, as do dozens of other references: like manymodernist works, the book is highly allusive, and along with Kabbalah andOuspensky, into his strange brew Lowry puts German expressionist films (TheHands of Orlac and The Student of Prague, both occult films), Faust, Swedenborg,the Rosicrucians, astrology, alchemy and much more. The action takes place inexactly twelve hours depicted over twelve chapters: along with other references,twelve is an important kabbalistic number. The Tree of Life is used, Lowry tellsus, \"for poetical purposes because it symbolizes man's spiritual aspiration.\"SsThe Consul's domain is the Qliphoth, the world of shells and demons, a kind ofinverse tree, growing downwards into hell. And while the Consul's alcoholism,manifest in his insatiable thirst for mescal, is clearly Lowry's own (he isthroughout the book perfectamente borracho, perfectly drunk) his magicalpreoccupations raise the novel beyond the realism of Charles Jackson's The LostWeekend, published while Lowry was engaged in one of his obsessive revisions.\"William James,\" he told Jonathan Cape, \"would certainly agree with me when Isay that the agonies of the drunkard find their most accurate poetic analogue inthe agonies of the mystic who has abused his powers.\"5\" Although Lowry wasbriefly on the wagon when they met, Charles Stansfeld Jones was sure to havecautioned him that in Kabbalah, the misuse of magical powers is compared todrunkenness. At any rate, one thing he did tell him was that \"a black magicianwho fell into the abyss was in the unenviable position of having all theelements in the universe against him.\"\" Throughout his life, Lowry had anintimation of this, and perhaps in the end he, like the Consul, recognized thatthe only way to escape this fate was to leave the universe itself.At the beginning of the novel, Geoffrey's friend M. Laruelle, with whom Yvonne(modelled on Lowry's first wife) has had an affair as well, reads a letterGeoffrey wrote to Yvonne but never sent. \". . . do you see me as still workingon the book,\" the Consul asks his lost Shekinah, the female spiritual principleof the Kabbalah:still trying to answer such questions as: Is there an ultimate reality,external, conscious, and ever-present, etc ... Or do you find me between Mercyand Understanding, between Chesed and Binah, ... my equilibrium, and equilibriumis all, precarious - balancing, teetering over the awful unbridgeable void, theall-but-unretraceable path of God's lightning back to God? As if I were inChesed! More like the Qliphoth.b'Earlier in the letter, Geoffrey tells Yvonne that, \"this is how I sometimesthink of myself, as a great explorer who has discovered some extraordinary landfrom which he can never return to give his knowledge to the world: but the nameof this land is hell. \"12 Like Rimbaud, another believer in the spiritual valueof suffering, Lowry did spend his season in the underworld. In Under the Volcanohe passed on to those more fortunate than himself a moving account of itsterrifying terrain.NOTES1 A Centenary Pessoa, Eugenio Lisboa and L.C. Taylor, editors (Manchester:Carcanet, 1997) p. 17.2 \"The modern period\" is admittedly a vague term and, given our own placement ina \"post-postmodern\" era, doubly doubtful. Exactly when and where modernism beganis debatable and, in the sense of providing a starting date for a well-definedliterary and artistic movement, it's more than likely an impossible question toanswer. The first non-representational painting is said to be Kandinsky's \"FirstAbstract Watercolour\" (1910), although some art historians give the credit tothe Czech Frantisek Kupka. Literary modernism is said to begin with Apollonaire,and its debatable whether Mahler's Ninth Symphony is the last work oflate-romanticism or an early atonal effort; indeed, for critics like CharlesRosen, Beethoven's late string quartets embody practically all the elements tobe found in Schoenberg's less accessible works. For my purposes I'm consideringmodern the period beginning slightly before World War I, and continuing onuntil, say, the 1950s and the rise of Beat poetry, although all of the works Iwill here examine were written before then.3 The `crisis of the word' experienced in the early 20th century took on manyforms, perhaps none more emblematic than the philosopher Wittgenstein's dictumthat, \"Of that which we cannot speak we must remain silent.\" Wittgenstein'ssilence was felt by many others: Karl Kraus, Hugo von Hoffmanstahl, Ernst Bloch,Robert Musil, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Maeterlink, Hermann Broch, Franz Kafkaand, in a later form, Samuel Beckett. For a good account of this `retreat fromthe word' see George Steiner's Language and Silence (1967) and Extraterritorial(1972).4 Schoenberg also believed in a kind of number mysticism on which he based asystem of angelology. It took on a troubling form, however, in his fear of thenumber thirteen. Schoenberg was born on 13 September 1874 and died on 13 July1951.5 Cage's particular occult interest was the I Ching or Book of Changes, aChinese form of divination employing yarrow sticks or, in a more simple form,coins. For one composition, Cage is reported to have throw his I Ching coins16,000 times.6 Had space allowed, I would have liked to have included separate sections onboth David Lindsay and John Cowper Powys, two of the most important novelistsworking in the gnostic tradition, although neither of them could be consideredmodernists. Powys, most famous for his Dorset Quartet, including the mammoth AGlastonbury Romance, not only professed a profound magical philosophy of life -espoused in his many nonfiction works - but apparently possessed some occultpowers himself. In his magnificent Autobiography, Powys writes of his evil eye,which caused him no small measure of concern, as well as his experiences ofbi-location, one of which involved the novelist Theodore Dreiser. Lindsay, bestknow for his masterpiece A Voyage to Arcturus, though not an occultist per se,nevertheless wrote perhaps the most metaphysical novel in the English language,his late, unfinished The Witch. In Devil's Tor, Lindsay took the theme of thereincarnated avatar and wed it to notions of pre-civilization goddess culture(decades before this became popular in the 1980s and 90s) and created a powerfulphilosophical drama, as well as a gripping occult thriller.7 This is not inclusive of writers who took occultism or the supernatural astheir central theme, a criterion I have tried to maintain, with a fewexceptions, throughout this study.8 For more on Eliot and Pound see Leon Surrette's highly dismissive study TheBirth of Modernism (Montreal & Kingston: Mcgill - Queens University Press,1993).9 Pessoa and Benjamin have much in common. Besides their mutual penchant for thefragment - Benjamin's Arcades Project and Pessoa's Book of Disquiet are bothworks that refused completion - Pessoa and Benjamin shared an equal ineptitudewith dealing with reality or the necessities of life. Both lived more in booksthan in the world, and both had great difficulties maintaining relationshipswith women. Both shared an interest in forms of occultism (Kabbalah andgraphology for Benjamin) and both died at a tragically young age, Pessoa at 47,Benjamin 48. The valise Benjamin hauled across the Pyrenees in his attempt toreach Spain held the contents of his monumentally unfinished magnum opus. A veryreadable fictional account of this disastrous venture can be found in JayParini's Benjamin's Crossing (1996).10 Although a commonplace childhood experience, the vividness of Pessoa'sinvented friends bears comparison to the similar early pastime of thepsychologist C.G. Jung. In his childhood, Jung became convinced of the realityof a separate self, whom he called Personality No. 2, an old gentleman of the18th century, who dressed in buckles and frock coat, and who was possessed of anuncommon wisdom and insight. Jung became so immersed in the world of No. 2 thathe came to believe he had been the gentleman in a past life. For detractors ofJung, this is early evidence of his later psychosis; for his followers, it was amanifestation of the autonomous contents of the psyche. Following his break withFreud, Jung underwent a shattering mental breakdown in which he had visions and,most importantly for his later ideas, held conversations with autonomouspersonalities resident in his own mind.11 Fernando Pessoa Selected Poems (London: Penguin Books, 2000) p. 11.12 A Centenary Pessoa p. 262.13 Selected Poems p. 12.14 Ricardo Reis is the subject of a novel by the contemporary Portuguese writerJose Saramago, The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis (1991).15 The Selected Prose of Fernando Pessoa translated by Richard Zenith (New York:Grove Press, 2001) p. 256.16 Alvaro de Campos was another compensatory figure. A world traveller, hesmoked opium, studied naval engineering at Glasgow, voyaged to the Orient, drankabsinthe and wore a monocle. On occasions, de Campos would appear in Pessoa'sstead at social gatherings, and in 1929 he broke off Pessoa's single romanticliason, writing to the girl and telling her to flush any idea of their union\"down the toilet.\"17 Selected Prose pp. 103 and 110.18 Ibid. pp. 101-102.

In recent years Schwaller de Lubicz's ideas have receivedrenewed interest through the work of Graham Hancock, who based his bestsellingseries of books about the precursors of Egyptian civilization on de Lubicz'sremark that the Sphinx was much older than orthodox Egyptologists suggest.44 From \"Epistle to Storge\" in Ars Magna, translated by Czeslaw Milosz in TheNoble Traveller pp. 244-245.45 In Hebrew, AL means God, LA, not. For Jones, this meant that the reflectionof God is Not. Kabbalistically this maybe interesting, but the idea is not new.The Gnostics spoke of the Pleroma, a kind of negative world existing (ornot-existing) outside the manifest world; the kabbalists themselves speak of theEn Sof, a similarly non-manifest source of being. Later proponents of the notionincluded the alchemist and theosophist Jacob Boehme, and the philosopher Hegel,whose dialectic begins with the initial opposition of being and non-being. Asmentioned earlier, Hegel was a reader of Boehme.46 In the 1930s, Frater Achad started a magical organization of his own, and onemember, Wilfred T. Smith, carried his teaching to California, where he started agroup called the Agape Lodge. This would later include John (Jack) WhitesidesParson, a scientist at Pasadena's famous jet Propulsion Laboratory. Agape Lodgewas ultimately under Crowley's guidance, and after Smith abused his position (ina very Crowleyesque way, by seducing Parsons's wife) he was expelled and Parsonsgiven control. Parson's Pasadena home became the site of magical rituals,including sex and drugs. L. Ron Hubbard claimed to have been sent to investigatethe black magic ring by Naval Intelligence. He seduced Parsons' wife as well,and also absorbed enough about Crowley's ideas to use them as a foundation forhis Church of Scientology. Hubbard was also a pulp science fiction writer at thetime, and knew Heinlein, who visited Parsons' home on a few occasions. Many ofCrowley's ideas inform his influential novel, Stranger in a Strange Land. Formore on Parsons and Hubbard, see my Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties andthe Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius.47 Lowry would have another indirect link with Crowley. As mentioned earlier,his friend and drinking partner, Dylan Thomas, was discovered by the poet VictorNeuberg, with whom Crowley performed a series of homosexual magical acts inParis and North Africa.48 Gordon Bowker Pursued by Furies: A Life of Malcolm Lowry (London: HarperCollins, 1993).49 Malcolm Lowry Sursum Corda!

Grace (London: Jonathan Cape, 1996) p. 356.50 Oddly Crowley himself was introduced to the work by another Jones, GeorgeCecil Jones, the chemist and magician who brought him into the Golden Dawn.51 Called Quauhnahuac in the novel, Cuernavaca, \"the horn of the cow,\" has acurious occult history. Known traditionally as an area familiar to magicians andsorcerers, in the early 1960s it was the setting for Timothy Leary's initialpsilocybin mushroom experiments, his first taste of the \"food of the gods\" beingsupplied by a local curandero, or medicine man. Later, it became the centre forJohn Star Cooke's `Psychedelic Rangers', a group of dedicated LSD enthusiastswho attempted to dose a variety of influential people with the drug. Cooke wasknown for his psychedelic seances, many of which were attended by prominentfigures in the 60s counterculture. He had also become a kind of celebrity on thepop occultism circuit, through the popularity of a Tarot deck he designed. Formore on him and Leary, who modelled his career on Aleister Crowley, see my TurnOff Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius.52 Malcolm Lowry Under The Volcano (London: Penguin Books, 1985) p. 218.53 See Sursum Corda! pp. 293, 304.54 And also of time, in the form of a clock. The opening chapter takes place ayear after the events of the novel, with one of the supporting charactersthinking back over the Consul's sad fate. He is, then, returning to the past.Lowry more than likely didn't know of Ouspensky's novel of recurrence StrangeLife of Ivan Osokin, in which the central character is sent back in time torelive his life again, but his imagery here suits it perfectly.55 Selected Letters of Malcolm Lowry edited by Harvey Breit and Margerie BonnerLowry (London; Penguin Books, 1985) pp. 139-140.56 This letter can be found in the Penguin edition of the novel.57 The novel also has a strong political element, which space has not allowed meto explore, and through the Consul's irrevocable descent, depicts the collapseof humanism and the rise of fascism. Firmin, a 20th century Faust, is modern manplaying with dangerous forces he does not understand. Lowry believed that inChapter Ten, with its long list of all the elements that were \"against\"Geoffrey, he had in some way anticipated the atomic bomb.58 Under the Volcano p. 16.59 Ibid. p. 2360 Sursum Corda! pp. 356-357.61 Under the Volcano p. 84.62 Ibid. pp. 81-82."},{"pageContent":"PART 2"},{"pageContent":"SELECTED TEXTSFROM THE CLOUD UPON THE SANCTUARYKARL VON ECKARTHAUSENThere is no age more remarkable to the quiet observer than our own. Everywherethere is a fermentation in the mind, as in the heart of man; everywhere there isa battle between light and darkness, between exploded thoughts and living ideas,between powerless wills and living active force; in fine, everywhere there iswar between animal man and growing spiritual man.It is said that we live in the age of light, but it would be truer to say thatwe are living in that of twilight; here and there a luminous ray pierces themist of darkness, but does not light to full clearness either our reason or ourheart. Men are not of one mind, scientists dispute, and where there is discord,truth is not yet apprehended.The most important objects for humanity are still undetermined. No one is agreedeither on the principle of reason, on the principle of morality, or on the causeof will. This proves that though we are dwelling in a reputed age of light, wedo not well understand what emanates from our hearts and what from our heads.Probably we should reach this knowledge much sooner if we did not imagine thatwe have the torch of science already in our hands, or if we would cast a look onour weakness and recognise that we need a higher illumination. We live in thetimes of idolatry of the intellect; we place a common light upon the altar andwe loudly proclaim that here and now is the aurora, that everywhere daylight isreally about to appear, and that the world is emerging more and more fromobscurity into the full day of perfection, through the arts, sciences, culturedtastes, and even by a purer understanding of religion.Poor mankind! To what eminence have you raised the happiness of man? Has thereever been an age which has counted so many victims to humanity as the present?Has there ever been an age in which immorality and egotism have been greater ormore dominant than in this one? The tree is known by its fruits. Insensatebeings! With your imaginary natural reason, from whence have you the light bywhich you are so willing to enlighten others? Are not all your ideas borrowedfrom your senses, which do not give you the reality but merely its phenomena? Isit not true that in time and space all knowledge is but relative? Is it not truethat all which we call reality is also relative, for absolute truth is not to befound in the phenomenal world. Thus your natural reason does not possess thetrue essence, but only an appearance of truth and light; and the more thissemblance increases and spreads, the more the essence of light fades inwardly;the man is lost in the apparent and gropes vainly after dazzling phantasmalimages devoid of actuality.The philosophy of our age raises the natural intellect into independentobjectivity, gives it judicial power, exempts it from any superior authority,makes it autonomous, converting it into divinity by closing all harmony andcommunication with God; and deified Reason, which has no other law but its own,is to govern Man and make him happy! Can darkness spread the light? ... Canpoverty dispense wealth? Is death capable of giving life?It is truth which leads man to happiness. Can you confer truth?That which you call truth is a form of conception empty of real matter; itsknowledge is acquired from without, through the senses, and the understandingco-ordinates these by observed synthetic relationship into science or opinion.You abstract from the Scriptures and Tradition their moral, theoretical andpractical truth; but as individuality is the principle of your intelligence, andas egotism is the incentive to your will, you do not see, by your light, themoral law which dominates, or you repel it with your will. It is to this lengththat the light of today has penetrated. Individuality under the cloak of falsephilosophy is a child of corruption.Who can pretend that the sun is full zenith if no bright rays illuminate theearth, and no warmth vitalises vegetation? If the wisdom does not benefit man,if love does not make him happy, but very little has been done for him on thewhole.Oh! If only natural man, that is, sensuous man, would learn that the principleof his reason and the incentive of his will are only his individuality, and thaton this account he is miserable, he would then seek within himself for a higherprinciple, and he would thereby approach that source which alone can communicatethis principle to all, because it is wisdom in its essential substance ...But the eye of the man of sensuous perception only is closed firmly to thefundamental basis of all that is true and all that is transcendental.Even the reason which many would fain raise to the throne of legislativeauthority is only reason of the senses, whose light differs from that oftranscendental reason, as does the phosphorescent glimmer of decayed wood fromthe glories of sunshine.Absolute truth does not exist for sensuous man; it exists only for interior andspiritual man who possesses a suitable sensorium; or, to speak more correctly,who possesses an interior organ to receive the absolute truth of thetranscendental world, a spiritual faculty which cognises spiritual objects asobjectively and naturally as the exterior senses perceive external phenomena.This interior faculty of the man spiritual, this sensorium for the metaphysicalworld, is unfortunately not yet known to those who cognise only on the external,for it is a mystery of the kingdom of God.The current incredulity towards everything which is not cognised objectively byour senses explains the present misconception of truths which are, of all, mostimportant to man.But how can this be otherwise? In order to see one must have eyes, to hear onemust have ears. Every apparent object requires its appropriate sensorium and itis this sensorium which is closed in most men. Hence they judge the metaphysicalworld through the intelligence of their senses, even as the blind imaginecolours and the deaf judge tones without the suitable instruments ...We must therefore have a sensorium fitted for such communication, an organisedand spiritual sensorium, a spiritual and interior faculty able to receive thislight; but it is close as I have said to most men by the incrustation of theirsenses.Such an interior organ is the intuitive sense of the transcendental world, anduntil this intuitive sense is effective in us we can have no certainly of morelofty truths. This organism has been naturally inactive since the Fall, whichrelegated man to the world of physical sense. The gross matter which envelopsthe interior sensorium is a film which veils the internal eye, and prevents theexterior eye from seeing into spiritual realms. This same matter muffles ourinternal hearing, so that we are deaf to the sounds of the metaphysical world;it so paralyses our spiritual speech that we can scarcely stammer words ofsacred import, words which we pronounced formerly, and by virtue of which weheld authority over the elements and external nature.The opening of this spiritual sensorium is the mystery of the New Man themystery of Regeneration, and of the vital union between God and man it is thenoblest object of religion on earth, of that religion whose sublime goal is noneother than to unite men with God in Spirit and in Truth...It is quite true that with new senses we can acquire the perception of furtherreality. This reality exists already, but it is not known to us, because we lackthe organ by which to cognise it. One must not lay blame on the percept, but onthe receptive organ.With, however, the development of the new organ we have a new perception, asense of new reality. In its absence the spiritual world cannot exist for us,because the organ rendering it objective to us is not developed. In itsunfolding, the curtain is all at once raised, the impenetrable veil is tornaway, the cloud before the Sanctuary lifts, a new world suddenly exists for us,scales fall from the eyes, and we are transported from the phenomenal world tothe regions of truth .. .A great many men have no more idea of the development of the inner sensoriumthan they have of the true and objective life of the spirit, which they neitherperceive nor forecast in any manner. Hence it is impossible for them to knowthat one can comprehend the spiritual and transcendental, and can thus be raisedto the supernatural, even to the vision thereof.The great and true work of building the Temple consists solely in destroying themiserable Adamic hut and in erecting a divine temple; this means, in otherwords, to develop in us the interior sensorium, or the organ to receive God.After this process, the metaphysical and incorruptible principle rules over theterrestrial, and man begins to live, not any longer in the principle ofself-love, but in the Spirit and in the Truth, of which he is the Temple ...Therein are those great mysteries of which our human philosophy does not dream,the key to which is not to be found in scholastic science.Meanwhile, a more advanced school has always existed to which the deposition ofall science has been confided ... the society of the Elect, which has continuedfrom the first day of creation to the present time; its members, it is true, arescattered all over the world, but they have always been united by one spirit andone truth; they have had but one knowledge, a single source of truth, one lord,one doctor and one master, in whom resides substantially the whole plentitude ofGod, who also alone initiates them into the high mysteries of Nature and theSpiritual World.This community of light has been called from all time the invisible and interiorChurch, or the most ancient of all communities, of which we will speak morefully in the next letter.This community of light has existed since the first day of the world's creation,and its duration will be to the end of time. It is the society of those electwho know the Light in the Darkness and separate what is pure therein.This community possesses a School, in which all who thirst for knowledge areinstructed by the Spirit of Wisdom itself; and all the mysteries of God and ofnature are preserved therein for the children of light. Perfect knowledge ofGod, of nature and of humanity are the objects of instruction in this school. Itis thence that all truths penetrate into the world; herein is the School ofProphets and of all who search for wisdom; it is in this community alone thattruth and the explanation of all mystery is to be found. It is the most hiddenof communities, yet it possesses members gathered from many orders; of such isthis school. From all time there has been an exterior school based on theinterior one, of which it is but the outer expression. From all time, therefore,there has been a hidden assembly, a society of the Elect, of those who soughtfor and had the capacity for light, and this interior society was called theinterior Sanctuary or Church. All that the external Church possesses in symbol,ceremony or rite is the letter which expresses externally the spirit and thetruth residing in the interior Sanctuary..The interior Church was formed immediately after the fall of man, and receivedfrom God at first-hand the revelation of those means by which fallen humanitycould be raised again to its rights and delivered from its misery. It receivedthe primitive charge of all revelation and mystery; it received the key of truescience, both divine and natural.But, when men multiplied, the frailty of man and his weakness necessitated anexterior society which veiled the interior one, and concealed the spirit and thetruth in the letter. The people at large were not capable of comprehending highinterior truth, and the danger would have been too great in confiding that whichwas of all most holy to incapable people. Therefore, inward truths were wrappedin external and visible ceremonies, so that men, by the perception of the outer,which is the symbol of the interior, might by degrees be enabled to safelyapproach the interior spiritual truths ...This Sanctuary remained changeless, though external religion received in thecourse of time and circumstances varied modifications, and became divorced fromthe interior truths which can alone preserve the letter. The profane idea ofwishing to \"secularize\" all that is Christian, and to Christianise all that ispolitical, changed the exterior edifice, and covered with the shadow of deathall that reposed within it of light and life. Hence rose divisions and heresies,and the spirit of Sophistry ready to expound the letter when it had already lostthe essence of truth ...In the midst of all this, truth reposed inviolable in the inner Sanctuary.Faithful to the spirit of truth ... the members of the interior Church lived insilence, but in real activity, and united the science of the temple of theancient alliance with the spirit of the great Saviour of man ... waiting humblythe great moment when the Lord will assemble His community in order to giveevery dead letter external force and life.This illuminated community has been through time the true school of God'sspirit, and considered as a school, it has ... its degrees for successivedevelopment to higher altitudes.The first and lowest degree consists in the moral good ... The means by whichthe spirit of this school acts are called inspirations.The second degree consists in that rational intellectuality by which theunderstanding of the man of virtue ... is crowned with wisdom and the light ofknowledge, and the means by which the spirit uses to produce this are calledinterior illumination.The third and highest degree is the entire opening of the our inner sensorium,by which the inner man attains the objective vision of real and metaphysicalverities ... the means which the spirit uses to this end are real visions . . .This school of wisdom has been for ever most secretly hidden from the world,because it is invisible and submissive solely to Divine Governance.It has never been exposed to the accidents of time and to the weakness of man...By this school were developed the germs of all the sublime sciences, which werenext received by external schools, were then clothed in other forms, andsometimes degenerated therein.This society of sages communicated, according to time and circumstances, untothe exterior societies their symbolic hieroglyphs, in order to attract externalman to the great truths of the interior ...In this interior society man finds wisdom and therewith the All - not the wisdomof this world ... but true wisdom, and men obedient thereto ...We must not, however, imagine that this society resembles any secret order,meeting at certain times, choosing its leaders and members, united by specialobjects. All associations, be these what they may, can but come after thisinterior illuminated circle, which society knows none of the formalitiesbelonging to the outer rings, the work of man. In this kingdom of power theoutward forms cease ...... the chief himself, does not invariably know all the members, but the momentwhen it is the will of God that they should be brought into communication hefinds them unfailingly in the world and ready to work for the end in view.This community has no outside barriers ... If it be necessary that true membersshould meet together, they find and recognise each other with perfect certainty.No disguise can be used, neither hypocrisy nor dissimulation could hide thecharacteristic qualities of this society, because they are too genuine. Allillusion is gone, and things appear in their true form.No one member can choose another, unanimous choice is required. All men arecalled, the called may be chosen, if they become ripe for entrance.Any one can look for the entrance, and any man who is within can teach anotherto seek for it; but only he who is ripe can arrive inside ...Worldly intelligence seeks this Sanctuary in vain; in vain also do the effortsof malice strive to penetrate these great mysteries; all is undecipherable tohim who is not prepared; he can see nothing, read nothing in the interior.He who is ripe is joined to the chain, perhaps often where he thought leastlikely, and at a point of which he knew nothing himself.Seeking to become ripe should be the effort of him who loves wisdom.But there are methods by which ripeness is attained, for in this holy communionis the primitive storehouse of the most ancient and original science of thehuman race, with the primitive mysteries also of all science. It is the uniqueand really illuminated community which is in possession of the key to allmystery, which knows the centre and source of nature and creation. It is asociety which unites superior power to its own, and includes members from morethan one world. It is the society whose members form a theocratic republic,which one day will be the Regent Mother of the whole World.FROM THE SECRET DOCTRINEH.P. BLAVATSKYIn Seven Stanzas translated from the Book of Dzyan.STANZA I1. The eternal parent wrapped in her ever invisible robes had slumbered againfor seven eternities.2. Time was not, for it lay asleep in the infinite bosom of duration.3. Universal mind was not, for there were no Ah-Hi to contain it.4. The seven ways to bliss were not. The great causes of misery were not, forthere was no one to produce and get ensnared by them.5. Darkness alone filled the boundless all, for father, mother and son were oncemore one, and the son had not awakened yet for the new wheel, and his pilgrimagethereon.6. The seven sublime lords and the seven truths had ceased to be, and theuniverse, the son of necessity, was immersed in Paranishpana, to be outbreathedby that which is and yet is not. Naught was.7. The causes of existence had been done away with; the visible that was and theinvisible that is rested in eternal non-being - the one being.8. Alone, the one form of existence stretched boundless, infinite, causeless indreamless sleep; and life pulsated unconscious in universal space, throughoutthat all-presence which is sensed by the opened eye of the Dangma.9. But where was the Dangma when the Alaya of the universe was in Paramartha andthe Great Wheel was Anupadaka?STANZA II1. Where were the builders, the luminous sons of Manvantaric dawn?In the unknown darkness in their Ah-Hi Paranishpana. The producers of form fromno-form - the root of the world - the Devimatri Svabhavat, rested in the blissof non-being.2. Where was silence? Where the ears to sense it? No, there was neither silencenor sound; naught save ceaseless eternal breath, which knows itself not.3. The hour had not yet struck; the ray had not yet flashed into the germ; theMatripadma had not yet swollen.4. Her heart had not yet opened for the one ray to enter, thence to fall, asthree into four, into the lap of Maya.5. The seven sons were not yet born from the web of light. Darkness alone wasfather-mother, Svabhavat; and Svabhavat was in darkness.6. These two are the germ, and the germ is one. The universe was still concealedin the divine thought and the divine bosom.STANZA III1. The last vibration of the seventh eternity thrills through infinitude. Themother swells, expanding from within without, like the bud of the lotus.2. The vibration sweeps along, touching with its swift wing the whole universeand the germ that dwelleth in darkness: the darkness that breathes over theslumbering waters of life.3. Darkness radiates light, and light drops one solitary ray into themother-deep.The ray shoots through the virgin egg, the ray causes the eternal egg to thrill,and drop the non-eternal germ, which condenses into the world-egg.4. Then the three fall into the four. The radiant essence becomes seven inside,seven outside. The luminous egg, which in itself is three, curdles and spreadsin milk-white curds throughout the depths of the mother, the root that grows inthe depths of the ocean of life.5. The root remans, the light remains, the curds remain, and still Oeaohoo isone.6. The root of life was in every drop of the ocean of immortality, and the oceanwas radiant light, which was fire, and heat and motion. Darkness vanished andwas no more; it disappeared in its own essense, the body of fire and water orfather and mother.7. Behold, 0 Lanoo! The radiant child of the two, the unparallelled refulgentglory: bright space son of dark space, which emerges from the depths of thegreat dark waters. It is Oeaohoo the younger. He shines forth as the son, he isthe blazing divine dragon wisdom; the one is four, and four takes to itselfthree, and the union produces the Sapta, in who are the seven which become theTridasa (or the hosts and the multitudes). Behold him lifting the veil andunfurling it from east to west. He shuts out the above, and leaves the below tobe seen as the great illusion. He marks the places for the shining ones, andturns the upper into a shoreless sea of fire, and the one manifested into thegreat waters.8. Where was the germ and where was now darkness? Where is the spirit of theflame that burns in thy lamp, oh Lanoo? The germ is that, and that is light, thewhite brilliant son of the dark hidden father.9. Light is cold flame, and flame is fire, and fire produces heat, which yieldswater: the water of life in the great mother.10. Father-mother spin in a web whose upper end is fastened to spirit. The lightof the one darkness.And the lower one to its shadowy end, matter; and this web is the universe spunof the two substances made in one, which is Svabhavat.11. It expands when the breath of fire is upon it; it contracts when the breathof the mother touches it. Then the sons dissociate and scatter, to return intotheir mother's bosom and the end of the great day, and re-become one with her;when it is cooling it becomes radiant, and the sons expand and contract throughtheir own selves and hearts; they embrace infinitude.12. Then Svabhavat sends Fohat to harden the atoms. Each is a part of the web.Reflecting the self-existent lord like a mirror, each becomes in turn a world.STANZA IV1. Listen, ye sons of the earth, to your instructors, the sons of the fire.Learn there is neither first nor last, for all is one: number issued from nonumber.2. Learn what we who descended from the primordial seven, we who are born fromthe primordial flame, I have learnt from our fathers.3. From the effulgency of light, the ray of the ever-darkness, sprung in spacethe reawakened energies; the one from the egg, the six and the five. Then thethree, the one, the four, the one, the five. The twice seven the sum total. Andthese are the essences, the flames, the elements, the builders, the numbers, thearupa, the rupa and the force of divine man, the sun total. And from the divineman emanated the forms, the sparks, the scared animals and the messengers of thesacred fathers withing the holy four. .4. This was the army of the voice, the divine mother of the seven. The sparks ofthe seven are subject to, and the servants of the first, the second, the third,the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh of the seven. These sparks arecalled spheres, triangles, cubes, lines and modellers; for this stands theeternal Nidana, the Oeaohoo, which is:5. \"Darkness,\" the boundless or the no-number Adi-nidana Svabhavat:1. The Adi-Sanat, the number, for he is one.II. The voice of the Lord Svabhavat, the numbers, for he is one and nine.III. The \"Formless Square.\" And these three enclosed within the 0 are the sacredfour; and the ten are the Arupa universe. Then come the \"sons,\" the sevenfighters, the one, the eighth left out, and his breathe which is the lightmaker.6. Then the second seven who are the Lipika, produced by the three. The rejectedson is one; the \"sun-sons\" are countless.STANZA V1. The primordial seven, the first seven breaths of the dragon of wisdom,produce in their turn from their holy circumgyrating breaths the fierywhirlwind.2. They make of him the messenger of their will; the Dzyu becomes Fohat, theswift son of the divine sons whose sons are the Lipika, runs circular errands.Fohat is the steed and the thought is the rider. He passes like lightningthrough the fiery clouds; takes three and five and seven strides through theseven regions above, and the seven below he lifts his voice and calls theinnumerable sparks, and joins them.3. He is their guiding spirt and leader; when he commences work he separates thesparks of the lower kingdom that float and thrill with joy in their radiantdwellings, and forms therewith the germs of wheels. He paces them in the sixdirections of space, and one in the middle: the central wheel.4. Fohat traces spiral lines to unite the sixth to the seventh, the crown; andarmy of the sons of light stands at each angle, and the Lipika in the middlewheel, they say: this is good, the first divine world is ready, the first is nowthe second. Then the divine Arupa reflects itself in Chhaya Loka, the firstgarment of the Andupadaka.5. Fohat takes five strides and builds a winged wheel at each corner of thesquare, for the four holy ones and their armies.6. The Lipika circumscribe the triangle, the first one, the cube, and the secondone, and the pentacle within the egg. Iris the ring called \"Pass Not\" for thosewho ascend and descend. Also for those who during the kalpa are progressingtowards the great day \"Be with us.\" Thus were formed the Rupa and the Arupa:from one light, seven lights; from each of the seven, seven times seven lights:the wheels watch the ring.STANZA VI1. By the power of the mother of mercy and knowledge, Kwan-Yin, the \"triple\" ofKwan-Shai-Yin, residing in Kwan-Yin-Tien, Fohat, the breath of the progeny, theson of the sons, having called forth, from the lower abyss, the elusive form ofSien-Tchnag and the seven elements:2. The swift and radiant one produces the seven Laya centres, against which nonewill prevail to the great day \"Be with us,\" and seats the universe on theseeternal foundations surrounding Tsien-Tchan with the elementary germs.3. Of the seven: first one manifested, six concealed, two manifested, fiveconcealed, three manifested, four concealed; four produced, three hidden, fourand one Tsan revealed; two and one half concealed, six to be manifested, onelaid aside. Lastly, seven smalls wheels revolving, one giving birth to theother.4. He builds them in the likness of older wheels, placing them on imperishablecentres. How does Fohat build them? He collects fiery dust. He makes balls offire, runs through them and round them, infusing life therein, then sets theminto motion; some one way, some the other way. They are cold, he makes them hot.They are dry, he makes them moist. They shine: he fans and cools them. Thus actsFohat from one twilight to the other, during seven eternities.5. At the fourth the sons are told to create their images. One third refuses,Two obey. The curse is pronounced: they will be born on the fourth, suffer andcause suffering: this is the first war.6. The older wheels rotated downwards and upwards. The mother's spawn filled thewhole. There were battles fought between the creators and the destroyers, andthe battles fought for space; the seed appearing and re-appearing continuously.7. Make they calculations, Lanoo, if thou wouldst learn the correct age of thysmall wheel. Is fourth spoke our mother; reach the fourth fruit of the fourthpath of knowledge that leads to Nirvanna, and thou shalt comprehend, for thoushalt see.STANZA VII1. Behold the beginning of sentient formless life. First the divine, the onefrom the mother-spirit; then the -spiral, the three from the one, the four fromthe one, and the five from which the three, the five, and the seven. These arethe three-fold, the four-fold downward; the \"mind born\" sons of the first lord,the shining seven. It is they who are thou, me, him oh Lanoo. They who watchover thee, and thy mother earth.2. The one ray multiplies the other rays; life precedes form, and life survivesthe last atom of form. Through the countless rays proceeds the life-ray, theone, like a thread through many jewels.3. When the one becomes two, then the threefold appears and the three are one;and it is our thread, oh Lanoo, the heart of the man-plant called Saptasarma.4. It is the root that never dies; the three-tongued flame of the four wicks.The wicks are the sparks, that draw from the three-tongued flame shot out by theseven: their flame, the beams and sparks of one moon reflected in the runningwaves of all the rivers of earth.5. The spark hangs from the flame by the finest thread of Fohat. It journeysthrough the seven worlds of Maya.It stops in the first and is a metal, and a stone; it passes into the second andbehold: a plant; the plant whirls through seven changes and becomes a sacredanimal. From the combined attributes of these, Manu, the thinker, is formed. Whoforms him? The seven lives and the one life. Who completes him? The five-foldLha. And who perfects the last body, Fish, sin and soma ...6. From the first-born, the thread between the silent watcher and the shadowbecomes more strong and radiant with every change. The morning sunlight haschanged into noonday glory.7. This is they present wheel, said the flame to the spark, thou art myself, myimage and my shadow. I have clothed myself in thee and thou art my Vahan to theday \"be with us,\" when thou shalt re-become myself and others, thyself and me.Then the builders, having donned their first clothing, descend on radiant earthand reign over men who are themselves.FROM THE WRITINGS OF LOUIS CLAUDE DE SAINT-MARTINTHE COUNSEL OF THE EXILEMan has been set amidst the darkness of created things only to demonstrate byhis individual light the existence of their Supreme Agent, to convince all whomisconstrue it.All things should speak, since the spirit and the voice of God should fill all,and yet is all mute about us.It is a sign of the glory of our humanity, as it is an instance of the signalwisdom of Providence, that all such proofs adduced from the external order arethus deceptive in their last analysis ... The entire universe, notwithstandingall the splendours which it displays before our eyes, can never of itselfmanifest the truly divine treasures.There is not a man in possession of his true self for whom the temporal universeis not a great allegory or fable which must give place to a grand morality.At the first glance which man directs upon himself, he will perceive withoutdifficulty that there must be a science or an evident law for his own nature,since there is one for all beings, though it is not universally in all, andsince even in the midst of our weakness, our ignorance, and humiliation we areemployed only in the search after truth and light. Albeit, therefore, theefforts which man makes daily to attain the end of his researches are so rarelysuccessful, it must not be considered on this account that the end is imaginary,but only that man is deceived as to the road which leads thereto, and is hencein the greatest of privations, since he does not even know the way in which heshould walk. The overwhelming misfortune of man is not that he is ignorant ofthe existence of truth, but that he misconstrues its nature. What errors andwhat sufferings would have been spared us if, far from seeking truth in thephenomena of material nature, we had resolved to descend into ourselves, and hadsought to explain material things by man, and not man by material things; if,fortified by courage and patience, we had preserved in the calm of ourimagination the discovery of the light which we desire all of us with so muchardour.Man is the sole being in the natural order who is not compelled to pursue thesame road invariably.The function of man differs from that of other physical beings, for it is thereparation of the disorders in the universe. Man possesses innumerable vestigesof the faculties residentin that Agent which produced him; he is the sign or visible expression of theDivinity.The saintly race of man, engendered from the fount of wonder and the fount ofdesire and intelligence, was established in the region of temporal immensitylike a brilliant star for the diffusion of heavenly light.I must not conceal that this crass envelope is the actual penalty to which thecrime of man has made him subject in the temporal region. Thereby begin andthereby are perpetuated the trials without which he cannot recover his formercorrespondence with the light.When God has recourse to such visible signs as the universe to communicate histhought, it is to employ them in favour of beings separated from him. Had allbeings remained in his unity, they would not have needed this means to drawtowards him. The universe is therefore a sign of God's love for corruptedcreatures separated voluntarily from the First Cause and submitted to the lawsof justice in the womb of the visible universe. God operates unceasingly toremove the separation so contrary to their felicity.The wisdom and bounty of the Divine Being are manifested by the birth of maninto terrestrial life. He is thus placed in a position to soothe by his labourand striving a part of the evils which the first crime has caused on the earth.It is perhaps this wrong connection of ideas (that the earth is a mere point inthe universe) which has led men to the still falser notion that they are notworthy of the Creator's regard. They have believed themselves to be obeying thedictates of humility when they have denied that the earth and all that theuniverse contains exists only on man's account, on the ground that the admissionof such an idea would be only conceit. But they have not been afraid of thelaziness and cowardice which are the inevitable results of this affectedmodesty. The present day avoidance of the belief that we are the highest in theuniverse is the reason that we have not the courage to work in order to justifythat title, that the duties springing from it seem too laborious, and that wewould rather abdicate our position and our rights than realise them in all theirconsequences. Where is the pilot that will guide us between these hidden reefsof conceit and false humility?If there be anything deplorable in our existence, it is to know that weourselves bar the approach of Divinity; it is to be physically aware that theDivinity is ever moving around us, striving to enter our hearts and thus raiseus from the dead, to enliven us by the fire of the Spirit. The least ray of theDivine Word suffices to operate this prodigy within us, substituting virtues andcharacterised faculties in place of the tenebrous state which is peculiar to theregion we inhabit. Yet it is the ray of this Word which we drive zealously awayas though. it were death.The learned describe nature; the wise explain it.Had we the courage to make voluntarily the sincere and continual sacrifice ofour entire being, the ordeals, oppositions and evils which we undergo duringlife would not be sent us; hence we should always be superior to our sacrifices,like the Repairer, instead of being almost invariably inferior to them.Man's head is raised toward heaven, and for this reason he finds nowhere torepose it on earth.All the impressions which are made on us by Nature are designed to exercise oursoul during its term of penitence, to prompt us towards the eternal truths shownbeneath a veil, and to lead us to recover what we have lost.We are all in a widowed state, and our task is to remarry.As a proof that we are regenerated we must regenerate everything around us.FROM INFERNOAUGUST STRINDBERGITHE HAND OF THE UNSEENIt was with feelings of savage glee that I returned homewards from the Gare duNord where I had parted from my little wife. She was going to our child, who hadfallen ill in a distant land. So now I had accomplished the sacrifice of myheart. Her last words, `When shall we meet again?' and my answer, `Soon,' stillechoed in my ears as an untruth, a deception that I was unwilling to admit, evento myself, though something in me whispered that we had now parted for ever.Those farewell words that we exchanged in November 1894 were in fact our last,for up to the present time, May 1897, I have never seen my dear wife again.When I got as far as the Cafe de la Regence I sat down at a table at which I hadoften sat with my wife, my beautiful wardress, who had spied upon my soul dayand night, had guessed my secret thoughts, kept watch over the development of myideas, observed with jealous resentment the striving of my spirit towards theunknown.Restored to the world of the free, I became aware of a sudden expansion of myself that elevated me above the petty cares of life in the great city, thatscene of intellectual strife, where I had just won a victory - no great thing initself, but to me of enormous significance, representing as it did thefulfilment of a youthful dream. A play of mine had been performed at a Paristheatre, the dream of all contemporary authors in my country, but one which Ialone had realized. But now the theatre was repellent, as is everything that onehas attained, and science attracted me: Compelled to choose between love andknowledge, I had made up my mind that I would try to reach the summits ofintellectual achievement, but in my willingness to make a sacrifice of my love Iforgot the innocent victim of my ambition or my vocation.Back once more in my miserable student's room in the Latin Quarter, I delvedinto my trunk and drew forth from their hiding place six crucibles of fineporcelain which I had robbed myself to buy. A pair of tongs and a packet of puresulphur completed the apparatus of my laboratory. All that remained to be donewas to make a fire of furnace heat in the stove, secure the door, and draw downthe blinds, for since the execution of Caserio, only three months earlier, ithad become dangerous to handle chemical apparatus in Paris.Night fell, the flames of hell rose from the burning sulphur, but towardsmorning I had ascertained the presence of carbon in sulphur, previously regardedas an elementary substance. By doing this I believed I had solved the greatproblem, overthrown the prevailing chemical theories, and won the onlyimmortality accorded to mortals.But from my hands, roasted by the intense heat, the skin was peeling off inscales, and the pain caused by the mere effort of undressing reminded me of whatmy victory had cost. Yet, alone in my bed, where the odour of woman stilllingered, I was blissful. A feeling of spiritual purity, of masculine virginity,made me regard my past married life as something unclean, and I regretted thatthere was no one to whom I could render thanks for my deliverance from thosedegrading fetters, now broken without much fuss. The fact is, that in the courseof years, as I came to notice that the unseen Powers left the world to its fateand showed no interest in it, I had become an atheist.Someone to thank? There was no one, and the ingratitude thus forced upon meweighed me down.Being jealously anxious about my discovery, I took no steps to make it known. Myshyness prevented me from approaching authorities on the subject or theacademies. All the same, I continued my experiments, but meanwhile my chappedhands became poisoned, the cracks widened, were filled with coke dust, bloodoozed from them, and the agony became intolerable. Everything I touched causedme pain and I was in mind to ascribe my torment to those unknown Powers which,for so many years, had persecuted me and frustrated all my endeavours. Almostmad with pain, I avoided and neglected my fellow men, refused invitations, drovemy friends from me. Silence and solitude encompassed me, the stillness of adesert, solemn, terrifying, in which I defiantly challenged the unseen Power toa wrestling match, body against body, soul against soul.I had proved the presence of carbon in sulphur; I now had to show that itcontained hydrogen and oxygen, for they also must be there. My apparatus wasinadequate; I had no money, my hands were black and bleeding, black as was myneed, bleeding as was my heart. For during all this time I had been carrying ona correspondence with my wife. I had told her of the success of my chemicalexperiments and she had replied with bulletins about our daughter, interspersedwith warning hints about the futility of my scientific work and the imbecilityof throwing away money on such things.In an attack of righteous indignation, and overwhelmed by a furious desire to domyself an injury, I committed suicide by despatching an infamous, unpardonableletter, casting off wife and child for ever, and giving her to understand that Iwas 'involved in a new love affair.My bullet hit the mark and my wife replied by demanding a divorce.Solitary, guilty of suicide and assassination, my sorrow and anxiety made meforget my crime. No one came to see me, and I could seek out no one, as I hadgiven offence to all. This gave me a feeling of exaltation, of drifting over thesurface of a sea, with my anchor weighed but without a sail.Meanwhile, necessity, in the form of my unpaid rent, made her appearance,interrupted my scientific work and metaphysical speculations, and brought medown to earth once more.Such was my state as Christmas drew near. I had rather curtly refused aninvitation to visit a Scandinavian family, as certain painful irregularitiesmade the atmosphere of their house offensive to me. But in the evening, sittingalone, I regretted what I had done and went there all the same. No sooner werewe seated at table than the midnight revels began, with a great deal of noiseand unrestrained hilarity among the young artists, who were very much at home inthat house. An intimacy that was repulsive to me, gestures and looks, in a wordbehaviour that was quite out of place in a family circle and caused meindescribable discomfort and depression. In the midst of these saturnalianrevels my sadness conjured up before my inward eye my wife's peaceful dwelling.I had a sudden vision of the room, the Christmas tree, the mistletoe, my littledaughter, her deserted mother. Pangs of remorse seized me, I stood up, allegedthat I was feeling unwell, and departed.I walked along the horrible Rue de la Gaiete, but the artificial merriment ofthe crowds there wounded me. Then I went along the silent, gloomy Rue Delambre,a street which, more than any other in that quarter, can make one feeldesperate. I turned off into the Boulevard Montparnasse and sank on to a chairoutside the Brasserie des Lilas.For a few moments a glass of good absinthe gave me comfort, but then I wasattacked by a party of cocottes and students who flicked me in the face withswitches. As if pursued by the furies, I left my absinthe to its fate andhurried off to get myself another at the Cafe Francois Premier in the BoulevardSaint-Michel.I had only jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire. Another lot of peoplecame hallooing at me, `Hi, hermit,' and I fled back to my house, whipped byEumenides and escorted and unnerved by the triumphant strains of their mockingsong. The idea of a punishment, the consequence of a crime, never occurred tome. The part I was playing to myself was that of the innocent victim of unjustpersecution. The unknown Powers were hindering me from carrying on my great workand it was essential to break through this hindrance if the crown of victorywere to be won.I had done wrong, and yet I was right and should be acknowledged right.I slept ill that Christmas Eve. A cold blast swept over my face repeatedly andfrom time to time I was awakened by the strains of a Jew's harp.A growing weakness of body and mind was gradually getting the better of me. Myblack and bleeding hands made it impossible for me to dress myself neatly. Myanxiety on account of the rent I owed never gave me a moment's peace, and Ipaced up and down the room like a wild animal in a cage. I had given up eatingregular meals and my landlord advised me to go to hospital; but this was nosolution, as such places are expensive and demand payment in advance.Then the veins in my arms began to swell, a sure sign of blood-poisoning. Thiswas the final blow, and news of it spread to my fellow countrymen. One eveningthe kind woman from whose Christmas party I had so rudely and abruptly withdrawn- the very person for whom I had felt such antipathy, whom I had almost despised- sought me out, questioned me, learned of the deep distress in which I foundmyself, and, with tears in her eyes, tried to make me see that to go to hospitalwas my only hope.Judge how forlorn and contrite I felt when my eloquent silence made it plain toher that I was without means. She was filled with compassion at seeing mereduced to such a state of misery. She herself was poor and oppressed bydomestic cares and anxieties, but she announced that she would collect money forme among the members of the Scandinavian community and that she would go to seetheir chaplain.The woman who had sinned had been merciful to the man who had just abandoned histruly wedded wife.Once more reduced to beggary and appealing for charity through the agency of awoman, I began to suspect the existence of an unseen hand which was responsiblefor the irresistible logic of events. I bent before the storm, but wasdetermined to rise again at the first possible moment.A cab took me to the Hopital de Saint-Louis. On the way there I got out in theRue de Rennes and bought two shirts, shrouds for my last hour!The idea that my death was imminent obsessed me. I cannot explain why.I was accepted as a patient and I was forbidden to go out unless I had obtainedpermission. My hands were swathed in bandages so that any sort of occupation wasout of the question. I felt as if I were locked up in a prison.My room was impersonal, bare, furnished only with absolute necessities, withouta trace of beauty, and situated close to the patients' common-room, where peoplesmoked and played cards from morning till night.The bell sounded for lunch, and at the table I found myself among a company ofspectres. Faces like death's-heads, faces of the dying. A nose missing here, aneye there a third with a dangling lip, another with a crumbling cheek Two of theindividuals at the table did not look ill at all, but their expression wassullen and despairing. They were master thieves of a good family who, thanks totheir powerful relatives, had been let out of prison on the grounds of illness.A nauseating smell of iodine took away my appetite; my bandaged hands obliged meto seek the assistance of my neighbours when I wanted to cut bread or pourmyself out a drink. In the midst of this delightful company of criminals andthose doomed to die there moved our kind mother, the matron, in her austerehabit of black and white, dealing out to each of us his poisonous draught. Itoasted a death's-head in a mug of arsenic; he toasted me in digitalis. It waslugubrious and yet one had to be grateful. Grateful, for anything so ordinaryand at the same time so offensive!People dressed and undressed me, tended me like a child. The nun took a specialfancy to me, treated me like a baby and called me `my child', while I, like allthe others, called her `mother'.How wonderful it was to use that word `mother', a word that had not crossed mylips for thirty years. This elderly woman, who belonged to the AugustinianOrder, wore the garb of the dead because she had never really lived her life.She was gentle as resignation itself, and she taught us to smile at oursufferings as if they had been so many joys, for she knew how salutary pain canbe. She never uttered a word of reproach, she never admonished us, she neverpreached to us. She knew the rule she must obey, that applied in secularizedhospitals, and she knew too how to grant small liberties to her patients, thoughnever to herself. For this reason she used to allow me to smoke in my room, evenoffered to roll the cigarettes for me, an offer I declined. She got mepermission to go out at other times than the usual hours and, when shediscovered that I busied myself with chemistry, she arranged that I should beintroduced to the learned pharmacist in charge of the hospital's dispensary. Helent me books and, after I had acquainted him with my theories on the nature ofthe elements, he invited me to work in his laboratory. That nun did indeed playa part in my life. I began to be reconciled to my fate and praised the fortunatemisfortune that had brought me under that blessed roof.The first book I borrowed from the pharmacist's library opened of itself and myeye lighted like a falcon on a line in the chapter on phosphorus. In a few wordsits author described how the chemist Lockyer had shown by spectral analysis thatphosphorus was not an elementary substance, adding that an account of theexperiment had been handed in to the Acad- emie des Sciences in Paris, which hadnot rejected his findings.Feeling encouraged by this unexpected support for my theories, I set off intothe city, taking with me my crucibles and what remained of the incompletelyburnt sulphur. I handed these over to a firm of analytical chemists, whopromised to give me, on the morning of the following day, a certificate of theiranalysis.It was my birthday. When I got back to the hospital found awaiting me a letterfrom my wife in which she mourned my calamities and declared that she wanted tocome to me in order to tend me and to love me.The joy of knowing myself loved in spite of everything made me feel I wanted toexpress my gratitude, but to whom?To the Unknown, who for so many years had hidden from me?My heart melted; I confessed to the base lie about my infidelity, I begged forher forgiveness, and in a trice I was involved in an exchange of love-letterswith my own wife though I nevertheless postponed our reunion until a moresuitable time.The next morning I hurried off to my chemist in the Boulevard de Magenta. Icarried back with me to the hospital the certificate in its sealed envelope. AsI passed the statue of St Louis in the inner courtyard I recalled to mind theSaint's three achievements, the great Asylum for the Blind. L'Hospice desQuinze-Vingts, the Sorbonne, and the Sainte Chapelle, which I interpreted thus:from suffering, through knowledge, to penitence.In my room, behind the closed door, I opened the envelope that was to decide myfuture, and I read as follows:This powder, which has been handed in to us for investigation, has the followingcharacteristics:Colour: greyish black. Leaves a trace on paper.Density: considerable, greater than the medium density of graphite; thesubstance appears to be hard graphite.Chemical analysis:This powder burns easily and in burning gives off carbon monoxide and carbondioxide. That is to say, it contains carbon.So pure sulphur contains carbon!I was saved. From this moment I should be able to prove to my friends andrelations that I was not mad. This would confirm the theories I had advanced inmy work Antibarbarus, published a year before, which had been treated by thenewspapers as the work of a charlatan or a madman, with the result that I hadbeen cast off by my family as a good-for-nothing, a sort of Cagliostro.Ha ha, thought I, now you are crushed, my worthy opponents! My whole- selfswelled with righteous pride. I wanted to go into the city to cry aloud in thestreets, roar in front of the Institut, tear down the Sorbonne, but my handswere still bandaged, and when I got out into the courtyard its tall railingscounselled me to have patience.The hospital's pharmacist, to whom I had communicated the results of theanalysis, proposed that he should call together a committee before whom I mightdemonstrate my thesis by an experiment on the spot.In the meantime, rather than do nothing, and aware too of my timidity whencompelled to make a public appearance, I put together an article on the subjectand sent it to Le Temps, where it was published within two days.The password had been given. I had answers from various quarters, but no onedenied the validity of my claims. I gained adherents. I was urged to send thearticle to a chemical periodical and became involved in a correspondence thatstimulated .me to press on with the investigations I was pursuing.One Sunday, the last that I spent in Saint-Louis, that place of purgatory, I wassitting at the window watching what was going on in the courtyard below. The twothieves were walking about with their wives and children, kissing them from timeto time, and looking so happy as they warmed themselves at the flame of lovethat their misfortunes had only served to fan.My own loneliness weighed heavily upon me, I cursed my fate. I thought it unjustbecause I had forgotten that my crime far exceeded theirs in baseness.The postman arrived with a letter from my wife. It was cold and frigid. Mysuccess had wounded her and she pretended to base her scepticism on the opinionof a professional chemist. She added her advice on the perils of illusions thatmight lead to a mental breakdown. For that matter, what did I expect to gain byall this? Could I support a family by my chemistry?The same alternatives again - love or knowledge. I did not hesitate, I struckher down with a final letter of farewell and felt as pleased with myself as amurderer who has dealt his blow successfully.In the evening I took a walk in that gloomy part of the city I crossed the CanalSt Martin, black as a grave, a most suitable place for drowning oneself in. Istopped at the corner of the Rue Alibert. Why Alibert? Who was he? Wasn't thegraphite that the analytical chemist had found in my sample of sulphur calledAlibert graphite? What did that imply? It was odd, but I could not rid my mindof the impression that there was something inexplicable about this. Next the RueDieu. Why God, when the Republic has abolished him and is devoting the Pantheonto a new purpose? Rue Beaurepaire. The delightful retreat of malefactors! Rue deBondy. Was I being led by the devil? I gave up reading the names of the streets,got lost, retraced my steps, but still could not find my way, and finallyrecoiled before an enormous shed that stank of raw meat and mouldy vegetables,especially sauerkraut. Suspicious-looking persons brushed past me, shouting outcoarse words as they did so. Fear of the unknown gripped me. I turned first tothe right, then to the left, and stumbled into a sordid blind alley that seemedto be the abode of human trash, vice, and crime. Prostitutes barred my way,street arabs jeered at me. The scene from the night of the Christmas party wasrepeated, Vae soli! Who was it who was setting these ambushes for me the instantI detached myself from the world and from people? There was someone who hadcaused me to fall into this trap. Where was he to be found, that I might wrestlewith him?As I started to run, rain and slushy snow fell. In the background, at the end ofa short street, I saw outlined against the sky a dark archway, an enormous,cyclopean structure. There was no place behind, only a sea of light. I asked apoliceman where I was.`At the Porte Saint-Martin, monsieur.'A few steps more and I was out in the great boulevards and walking along them.It was a quarter past six by the theatre clock. Absinthe time, and my friendswould be waiting as usual at the Cafe Napolitain. Quickening my pace, I pressedon, forgetting the hospital, my grief, and my poverty. But outside the Cafe duCardinal I happened to bump against a table at which a gentleman was sitting. Iknew him only by name, but he recognized me and in an instant his eyes had toldme what he was thinking: `You here? So you are not in hospital after all! Finehumbug, that appeal for help!'I was sure that this man must be one of my unknown benefactors, one of those whohad given me alms, and I realized that to him I was a beggar who had no right togo to cafes. A beggar! Just the right word. It kept ringing in my ears, anddrove a burning flush to my cheeks, a flush of shame, mortification, and rage.To think that only six weeks before I had sat at this same table with thedirector of the theatre where my play was being performed. I had been his hostand he had addressed me as `dear master'. Reporters had tumbled over one anotherto interview me; photographers had begged for the honour of selling my portrait.And now, a beggar, a branded man, an outcast from society.Whipped, played out, hunted to death, I slunk along the boulevards like anight-bird and crept back to my hole among the pest-ridden. There I shut myselfinto my room. This was now my home.When I reflect upon my fate I can see the hand of the Unseen at work,disciplining me, driving me on towards a goal that I myself was still unable todiscern. He had granted me glory and at the same time He had denied me worldlyhonours. He had humbled me and simultaneously He had raised me up. He had mademe grovel in the dust in order to exalt me.The idea again occurred to me that Providence must have some mission which itintended me to carry out in this world, and that this was the beginning of myeducation for it.I left the hospital in February, not cured of my illness, but proof against thetemptations of the world. At our parting I had wanted to kiss the hand of ourkind mother who, without preaching at me, had taught me the way to the Cross,but I had been held back by a feeling of veneration for something that must notbe defiled.May her spirit receive this tribute of gratitude from a stranger who had goneastray and who now dwells concealed in a distant land!2SAINT LOUIS INTRODUCES ME TO THE CHEMIST ORFILAI pursued my chemical investigations throughout the winter in a modestlyfurnished house I had rented. I stopped at home all day, but in the evening Iwent out to eat my dinner at a cremerie, where artists of various nationalitieshad formed a club. After my dinner I usually visited the family whose house Ihad once quitted in a fit of puritanism. Their home was a meeting place for thewhole circle of artistanarchists, and I felt that I was doomed to endure thereall the things I should have preferred not to see or hear: free and easymanners, loose morals, deliberate godlessness. There was much talent among themand infinite wit. Only one of them was a genius, a wild fellow, who has sincemade a great name for himself.Nevertheless, it was a family circle. They loved me there and I was indebted tothem, so I shut my eyes and closed my ears to their little private affairs,which were no concern of mine.If it had really been unjustified pride that had made me shun these people mypunishment would have been logical, but as my aloofness had arisen from myefforts to purify my individuality and refine my spirit by contemplation insolitude, I find it difficult to understand the workings of Providence in thismatter. I am by nature flexible and very willing to adapt myself to mysurroundings, out of pure affability and the fear of appearing ungrateful; so,as I was excluded from society by my pitiable and scandalous poverty, I wasthankful to find some place of refuge in the long winter evenings, even thoughthe very free tone of the conversation there cut me to the quick.After it had been revealed to me that an unseen hand was guiding my steps alongthis rough path I no longer felt alone. I kept strict watch over my actions andmy words, though in this I sometimes failed. But as soon as I sinned I wasinstantly caught, and the punishment administered was so punctual and so exactlysuited to the crime that it left no room for doubts about the intervention of apower who chastised in order to reform.I felt that I was personally acquainted with this unknown power, I talked tohim, I thanked him, I asked his advice. Sometimes I imagined him to be myservant, the counter-part of Socrates' daimon, and consciousness that I couldcount on his assistance restored to me an energy and a feeling of confidencethat spurred me on to exertions of which I had not thought myself capable.Looked upon by society as a bankrupt, I was born again in another world where noone could follow me. Things that would previously have lacked significance nowattracted my attention. The dreams I had at night assumed the guise ofprophecies. I thought of myself as one of the dead, passing my life in anothersphere.I had already demonstrated the presence of carbon in sulphur. Analogy wouldsuggest that hydrogen and oxygen were there too, but this I had still to prove.I spent two months making calculations and studying problems, but I lacked theapparatus for carrying out experiments. A friend advised me to go to theresearch laboratory at the Sorbonne to which even foreigners have access. But Iwas too timid and too frightened of crowds to dare to take such a step, so mywork came to a standstill and a brief period of rest ensued. One beautifulspring morning I got up in a good mood, walked down the Rue de la GrandeChaumiere and reached the Rue de Fleurus, which leads to the Luxembourg Gardens.The lovely little street lay before me perfectly quiet, its wide avenue ofchestnuts a brilliant green and straight as a racecourse, with David's columnlike a winning post at the far end. In the distance the dome of the Pantheontowered above everything else, while the golden cross that crowned it was almostlost in the clouds,I stood still, entranced by this symbolic sight, but when I at last lowered mygaze I became aware of a dye-house sign on my right, in the Rue Fleurus. Ha!here I saw something undeniably real. Painted on the window of the shop were myown initials, A.S., poised on a silvery-white cloud and surmounted by a rainbow.Omen accipio. The words of Genesis came into my mind:`I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant betweenme and the earth.'I no longer trod upon the ground, I floated through the air, and it was withwinged footsteps that I entered the gardens, where there was not a soul about.At this early hour of the morning the place was mine. The rose-garden was mine.I recognized all my friends in the borders, the daisies, the verbenas, and thebegonias.After making my way along the course I reached the winning post and passed outthrough the iron gateway into the Rue Soufflot, turned towards the BoulevardSaint-Michel, and stopped beside the stall of second-hand books outsideBlanchard's shop. Without thinking what I was doing, I picked up an oldchemistry book by Orfila, opened it at random and read: `Sulphur has beenincluded among the elements. Nevertheless, the ingenious experiments made by H.Davy and the younger Bertholet seem to prove that it contains hydrogen, oxygenand some special base which no one has so far succeeded in isolating.'You may imagine the feeling of almost religious ecstasy that gripped me whenconfronted by this seemingly miraculous revelation. Davy and Bertholet haddemonstrated the presence of oxygen and hydrogen, I of carbon. It had fallen tome therefore to provide the formula for sulphur.A few weeks later I was enrolled as a student in the Faculty of Natural Sciencesat the Sorbonne (St Louis's Sorbonne!) with the right to work in the researchlaboratory there.The morning on which I betook myself to the Sorbonne was for me a holy day.Although I had no illusions about the possibility of convincing the professorsthere, who had received me with the chilly politeness accorded to foreigners whopush themselves in, I yet experienced a calm joy, from which I derived the sortof courage a martyr must possess when he takes up the struggle against amultitude of enemies - because, of course, for me at my age, the young were mynatural enemies.When I arrived at the open space in front of the little church that is part ofthe Sorbonne I found the door open and went in, without really knowing why I didso. The Holy Mother and Child greeted me with a gentle smile. The figure on thecross, incomprehensible as always, left me cold.My new acquaintance, St Louis, friend of all those smitten by poverty anddisease, caused some young theological students to introduce themselves to me.Was it possible that St Louis was my patron saint, my good angel, and that hehad driven me to the hospital, there to pass through the fire of agony before Icould attain the glory that leads to dishonour and scorn? Was it he who had sentme to Blanchard's bookstall, who had drawn me here?It was remarkable that, from being an atheist, I had sunk into a state of almostcomplete credulity.The sight of the votive offerings, presented by candidates who had beensuccessful in their examinations, made me swear a solemn oath that, supposing Ishould succeed, I would under no circumstances accept worldly recognition of mymerits.The hour had struck. I had to run the gauntlet between lines of merciless youngpeople who, already informed of my chimerical task, were waiting to mock andinsult me.After about two weeks I had obtained incontrovertible evidence that sulphur is aternary compound, composed of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.I proffered my thanks to the Director of the laboratory, who pretended to takeno interest in what I had been doing, and I left this new purgatory feeling atheart the most inexpressible delight.Whenever I did not visit the Luxembourg Gardens I took my morning walk in theCemetery of Montparnasse. A few days after I had concluded my investigation atthe Sorbonne I happened to catch sight of a monument of classical lovelinessnear the circular open space in the cemetery. On a medallion of white marble Ibeheld the noble features of a wise old man. The inscription on the soclerevealed to me who he was: Orfila, Chemist and Toxicologist. None other than myfriend and protector, who has many times since then been my guide through thelabyrinth of chemical operations.A week later, as I was walking down the Rue d'Assas, I came to a halt in frontof a house that looked like a monastery. A large signboard told me what mannerof building it was: Hotel Orfila.Again and yet again Orfila!In the following chapters I shall relate all that occurred in this old house, towhich the unseen hand drove me that I might be chastised, instructed, and - whynot? - enlightened.FROM THE OCCULT DIARIES1901JANUARY 3RDHave been plagued for a couple of months by a smell of celery.

It made me happy.Coming closer I saw it was the `clean' Norwegian flag, at half-mast, with awreath of laurel round a coat of arms, and something in the centre. What couldit mean? But, of course! They were flying the English flag in honour of QueenVictoria who died recently!(Aversion to B)It is evening now, I am sitting alone at home while they perform The Saga of theFolkungs. The excitement of it all with me, though from time to time it relaxes,probably when the curtain falls.Going over in my mind what my life has been I wonder whether all the horriblethings I have experienced have been staged for me to enable me to become adramatist, and depict all mental states and all possible situations.FROM THE SYMBOLISM OF THE TAROTP. D. OUSPENSKYCARD ITHE MAGICIANI Saw the Man.His figure reached from earth to heaven and was clad in a purple mantle. Hestood deep in foliage and flowers and his head, on which was the head-band of aninitiate, seemed to disappear mysteriously in infinity.Before him on a cube-shaped altar were four symbols of magic - the sceptre, thecup, the sword and the pentacle.His right hand pointed to heaven, his left to earth. Under his mantle he wore awhite tunic girded with a serpent swallowing its tail.His face was luminous and serene, and, when his eyes met mine, I felt that hesaw the most intimate recesses of my soul. I saw myself reflected in him as in amirror and in his eyes I seemed to look upon myself.And I heard a voice saying:<Look, this is the Great Magician!With his hands he unites heaven and earth, and the four elements that form theworld are controlled by him.The four symbols before him are the four letters of the name of God, the signsof the four elements, fire, water, air, earth.»I trembled before the depth of the mysteries I touched ... The words I heardseemed to be uttered by the Great Magician himself, and it was as though hespoke in me.I was in deep trepidation and at moments I felt there was nothing before meexcept the blue sky; but within me a window opened through which I could seeunearthly things and hear unearthly words.[img/page0542_0000.svg]CARD XXITHE WORLDAn unexpected vision appeared to me. A circle not unlike a wreath woven fromrainbow and lightnings, whirled from heaven to earth with a stupendous velocity,blinding me by its brilliance. And amidst this light and fire I heard music andsoft singing, thunderclaps and the roar of a tempest, the rumble of fallingmountains and earthquakes.The circle whirled with a terrifying noise, touching the sun and the earth, and,in the centre of it I saw the naked, dancing figure of a beautiful young woman,enveloped by a light, transparent scarf, in her hand she held a magic wand.Presently the four apocalyptical beasts began to appear on the edges of thecircle; one with the face of a lion, another with the face of a man, the third,of an eagle and the fourth, of a bull.The vision disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. A weird silence fell on me.((What does it mean?» I asked in wonder.((It is the image of the world,)) the voice said, ((but it can be understoodonly after the Temple has been entered. This is a vision of the world in thecircle of Time, amidst the four principles. But thou seest differently becausethou seest the world outside thyself. Learn to see it in thyself and thou wiltunderstand the infinite essence, hidden in all illusory forms. Understand thatthe world which thou knowest is only one of the aspects of the infinite world,and things and phenomena are merely hierolgyphics of deeper ideas.))CARD IIITHE EMPRESSI felt the breath of the spring, and accompanying the fragrance of violets andlilies-of-the-valley I heard the tender singing of elves. Rivulets murmured, thetree-tops rustled, the grasses whispered, innumerable birds sang in choruses andbees hummed; everywhere I felt the breathing of joyful, living Nature.The sun shone tenderly and softly and a little white cloud hung over the woods.In the midst of a green meadow where primroses bloomed, I saw the Empress seatedon a throne covered with ivy and lilacs. A green wreath adorned her golden hairand, above her head, shone twelve stars. Behind her rose two snowy wings and inher hands she held a sceptre. All around, beneath the sweet smile of theEmpress, flowers and buds opened their dewy, green leaves. Her whole dress wascovered with them as though each newly opened flower were reflected in it or hadengraved itself thereon and thus become part of her garment.The sign of Venus, the goddess of love, was chiselled on her marble throne.<Queen of life,* I said, <why is it so bright and joyful all about you? Do younot know of the grey, weary autumn, of the cold, white winter? Do you not knowof death and graveyards with black graves, damp and cold? How can you smile sojoyfully on the opening flowers, when everything is destined for death, eventhat which has not yet been born?»For answer the Empress looked on me still smiling and, under the influence ofthat smile, I suddenly felt a flower of some clear understanding open in myheart.CARD XXJUDGMENTI saw an ice plain, and on the horizon, a chain of snowy mountains. A cloudappeared and began to grow until it covered a quarter of the sky. Two fierywings suddenly expanded in the cloud, and I knew that I beheld the messenger ofthe Empress.He raised a trumpet and blew through it vibrant, powerful tones. The plainquivered in response to him and the mountains loudly rolled their echoes. Oneafter another, graves opened in the plain and out of them came men and women,old and young, and children. They stretched out their arms toward the Messengerof the Empress and to catch the sounds of his trumpet.And in its tones I felt the smile of the Empress and in the opening graves I sawthe opening flowers whose fragrance seemed to be wafted by the outstretchedarms.Then I understood the mystery of birth in death.CARD XVIIITHE MOONA desolate plain stretched before me. A full moon looked down as if incontemplative hesitation. Under her wavering light the shadows lived their ownpeculiar life. On the horizon I saw blue hills, and over them wound a path whichstretched between two grey towers far away into the distance. On either side thepath a wolf and dog sat and howled at the moon. I remembered that dogs believein thieves and ghosts. A large black crab crawled out of the rivulet into thesands. A heavy, cold dew was falling.Dread fell upon me. I sensed the presence of a mysterious world, a world ofhostile spirits, of corpses rising from graves, of wailing ghosts. In this palemoonlight I seemed to feel the presence of apparitions; someone watched me frombehind the towers, - and I knew it was dangerous to look back.CARD VITHE LOVERSI saw a blooming garden in a green valley, surrounded by soft blue hills.In the garden I saw a Man and a Woman naked and beautiful. They loved each otherand their Love was their service to the Great Conception, a prayer and asacrifice; through It they communed with God, through It they received thehighest revelations; in Its light the deepest truths came to them; the magicworld opened its gate; elves, undines, sylphs and gnomes came openly to them;the three kingdoms of nature, the mineral, plant and animal, and the fourelements - fire, water, air and earth - served them.Through their Love they saw the mystery of the world's equilibrium, and thatthey themselves were a symbol and expression of this balance. Two trianglesunited in them into a six-pointed star. Two magnets melted into an ellipsis.They were two. The third was the Unknown Future. The three made One.I saw the woman looking out upon the world as though enraptured with its beauty.And from the tree on which ripened golden fruit I saw a serpent creep. Itwhispered in the woman's ear, and I saw her listening, smiling at firstsuspiciously, then with curiosity which merged into joy. Then I saw her speak tothe man. I noticed that he seemed to admire only her and smiled with anexpression of joy and sympathy at all she told him.[img/img0002.jpg]<(This picture you see, is a picture of temptation and fall», said the voice.<What constitutes the Fall? Do you understand its nature»?((Life is so good», I said, ((and the world so beautiful, and this man and womanwanted to believe in the reality of the world and of themselves. They wanted toforget service and take from the world what it can give. So they made adistinction between themselves and the world. They said, We are here, the worldis there». And the world separated from them and became hostile».<Yes*, said the Voice, this is true. <The everlasting mistake with men is thatthey see the fall in love. But Love is not a fall, it is a soaring above anabyss. And the higher the flight, the more beautiful and alluring appears theearth. But that wisdom, which crawls on earth, advises belief in the earth andin the present. This is the Temptation. And the man and woman yielded to it.They dropped from the eternal realms and submitted to time and death. Thebalance was disturbed. The fairyland was closed upon them. The elves, undines,sylphs and gnomes became invisible. The Face of God ceased to reveal Itself tothem, and all things appeared upside down.<This Fall, this first <sin of man», repeats itself perpetually, because mancontinues to believe in his separateness and in the Present. And only by meansof great suffering can he liberate himself from the control of time and returnto Eternity - leave darkness and return to Light».CARD XVIITHE STARA strange emotion siezed me. A fiery trembling ran in waves through all my body.My heart quickened its beating, tumult agitated my mind.I felt that I was surrounded by portentous mysteries. And presently shafts ofLight penetrated my being and illuminated many things before in darkness, whoseexistence even I had never suspected. Veils vanished of which I had been beforeunaware. Voices spoke to me. And suddenly all my former knowledge took a new anddifferent meaning.I discovered unexpected correlations in things which hitherto I had thoughtforeign to each other. Objects distant and different from one another appearednear and similar. The facts of the world arranged themselves before my eyesaccording to a new pattern.In the sky there appeared an enormous star surrounded by seven smaller stars.Their rays intermingled, filling space with immeasurable radiance and splendour.Then I knew I saw that Heaven of which Plotinus speaks:((Where ... all things are diaphanous; and nothing is dark and resisting, buteverything is apparent to every one internally and throughout. For lighteverywhere meets with light, since everything contains all things in itself, andagain sees all things in another. So that all things are everywhere, and all isall. Each thing likewise is everything. And the splendour there is infinite. Foreverything there is great, since even that which is small is great.<<The sun too, which is there, is all the stars; and again each star is the sunand all the stars. In each however, a different property predominates, but atthe same time all things are visible in each. Motion likewise there is pure; formotion is not confouned by a mover different from it. Permanency also suffers nochange of its nature, because it is not mingled with the unstable. And thebeautiful there is beautiful, because it does not subsist in beauty. Each thing,too, is there established, not as in a foreign land, but the seat of each thingis that which each thing is.... Nor is the thing itself different from the placein which it subsists. For the subject of it is intellect, and it is itselfintellect. . . . In this sensible region, therefore, one part is not produced byanother, but each part is alone a part. But there each part always proceeds fromthe whole, and is at the same each time part and the whole. For it appearsindeed as a part; but by him whose sight is acute, it will be seen as a whole.((Where ... is likewise no weariness of the vision which is there, not anyplenitude of perception which can bring intution to an end.<<For neither was there any vacuity which when filled might cause the visibleenergy to cease; nor is this one thing, but that another, so as to occasion apart of one thing not to be amicable with that of another.«Where ... the life is wisdom; a wisdom not obtained by a reasoning process,because the whole of it always was, and is not in any respect deficient, so asto be in want of investigation. But it is the first wisdom, and is not derivedfrom another.[img/img0003.jpg]I understood that all the radiance here is thought; and the changing colours areemotions. And each ray, if we look into it, turns into images, symbols, voicesand moods. And I saw that there is nothing inanimate, but all is soul, all islife, all is emotion and imagination.And beneath the radiant stars beside the blue river I saw a naked maiden, youngand beautiful. She stooped on one knee and poured water from two vessels, one ofgold and one of silver. A little bird in a near by bush lifted its wings and waspoised ready to fly away.For a moment I understood that I beheld the Soul of Nature.<<This is Nature's Imagination,» said the voice gently. <<Nature dreams,improvises, creates worlds. Learn to unite your imagination with Her Imaginationand nothing will ever be impossible for you. Lose the external world and seek itin yourself. Then you will find Light. <<But remember, unless you have lost theEarth, you will not find Heaven. It is impossible to see both wrongly andrightly at the same time.»CARD VIIIPOWERIn the midst of a green plain, surrounded by blue hills, I saw a woman with alion. Girdled with wreaths of roses, a symbol of infinity over her head, thewoman calmly and confidently covered the lion's mouth and the lion obedientlylicked her hand.((This is a picture of power)), said the voice. ((It has different meanings.First it shows the power of love. Love alone can conquer wrath. Hatred feedshatred. Remember what Zarathustra said: ((Let man be freed from vengeance; thisis a bridge for me which leads to higher hope and a rainbow in heaven after longstorms)).((Then it shows power of unity. These wreaths of roses suggest a magic chain.Unity of desires, unity of aspirations creates such power that every wild,uncontrolled, unconscious force is subdued. Even two desires, if united, areable to conquer almost the whole world.((The picture also shows the power of infinity, that sphere of mysteries. For aconsciousness that perceives the symbol of infinity above it, knows no obstaclesand cannot be withstood)).CARD XVTHE DEVILBlack, awful night enveloped the earth. An ominous, red flame burned in thedistance. I was approaching a fantastic figure which outlined itself before meas I came nearer to it. High above the earth appeared the repulsive red face ofthe Devil, with large, hairy ears, pointed beard and curved goats' horns. Apentagram, pointing downwards, shone in phosphoric light between the horns onhis forehead. Two large, grey, bat-like wings were spread behind him. He held upone arm, spreading out his bare, fat hand. In the palm I saw the sign of blackmagic. A burning torch held down-end in his other hand emitted black, stiflingsmoke. He sat on a large, black cube, gripping it with the claws of hisbeast-like, shaggy legs.A man and woman were chained to the cube - the same Man and Woman I saw in thegarden, but now they had horns and tails tipped with flame. And they wereevidently dissatisfied in spirit, and were filled with protest and repulsion.<This is a picture of weakness>>, said the voice, ((a picture of falsehood andevil. They are the same man and woman you saw in the garden, but their loveceasing to be a sacrifice, became an illusion. This man and woman forgot thattheir love is a link in the chain that unites them with eternity, that theirlove is a symbol of equilibrium and a road to Infinity.«They forgot that It is a key to the gate of the magic world, the torch whichlights the higher Path. They forgot that Love is real and immortal and theysubjugated it to the unreal and temporary. And they each made love a tool forsubmitting the other to himself.((Then love became dissension and fettered them with iron chains to the blackcube of matter, on which sits deceit*.And I heard the voice of the Devil: «I am Evil>, he said, <<at least so far asEvil can exist in this best of worlds. In order to see me, one must be able tosee unfairly, incorrectly and narrowly. I close the triangle, the other twosides of which are Death and Time. In order to quit this triangle it isnecessary to see that it does not exist.((But how to do this is not for me to tell. For I am the Evil which men say isthe cause of all evil and which they invented as an excuse for all the evil thatthey do.«They call me the Prince of Falsehood, and truly I am the prince of lies,because I am the most monstrous production of human lies >.CARD IXTHE HERMITAfter long wanderings over a sandy, waterless desert where only serpents lived,-I met the Hermit.He was wrapped in a long cloak, a hood thrown over his head. He held a longstaff in one hand and in the other a lighted lantern, though it was broaddaylight and the sun was shining.<<The lantern of Hermes Trismegistus)), said the voice, <<this is higherknowledge, that inner knowledge which illuminates in a new way even what appearsto be already clearly known. This lantern <lights up the past, the present andthe future for the Hermit, and opens the souls of people and the most intimaterecesses of their hearts.))((The cloak of Apollonius is the faculty of the wise man by which he isolateshimself, even amidst a noisy crowd; it is his skill in hiding his mysteries,even while expressing them, his capacity for silence and his power to act instillness.<<The staff of the patriarchs is his inner authority, his power, hisself-confidence.))The lantern, the cloak and the staff are the three symbols of initiation. Theyare needed to guide souls past the temptation of illusory fires by the roadside,so that they may go straight to the higher goal. He who receives these threesymbols or aspires to obtain them, ((strives to enrich himself with all he canacquire, not for himself, but, like God, to delight in the joy of giving)).<<The giving virtue is the basis of an initiate's life.((His soul is transformed into «a spoiler of all treasures* so said Zarathustra.<dnitiation unites the human mind with the higher mind by a chain of analogies.This chain is the ladder leading to heaven, dreamed of by the patriarch)).CARD XIITHE HANGED MANAnd then I saw a man in terrible suffering, hung by one leg, head downward, to ahigh tree. And I heard the voice:((Look! This is a man who saw Truth. Suffering awaits the man on earth, whofinds the way to eternity and to the understanding of the Endless.#He is still a man, but he already knows much of what is inaccessible even toGods. And the incommensurableness of the small and the great in his soulconstitutes his pain and his golgotha.<<In his own soul appears the gallows on which he hangs in suffering, feelingthat he is indeed inverted.<He chose this way himself.<<For this he went over a long road from trial to trial, from initiation toinitiation, through failures and falls.«And now he has found Truth and knows himself.<<He knows that it is he who stands before an altar with magic symbols, andreaches from earth to heaven; that he also walks on a dusty road under ascorching sun to a precipice where a crocodile awaits him; that he dwells withhis mate in paradise under the shadow of a blessing genius; that he is chainedto a black cube under the shadow of deceit; that he stands as a victor for amoment in an illusionary chariot drawn by sphinxes; and that with a lantern inbright sunshine, he seeks for Truth in a desert.<Now he has found Her.FROM FLIGHTS AND FANTASIESEDGAR ALLAN POEMESMERIC REVELATIONWhatever doubt may still envelop the rationale of mesmerism, its startling factsare now almost universally admitted. Of these latter, those who doubt, are yourmere doubters by profession - an unprofitable and disreputable tribe. There canbe no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove, at the present day,that man, by mere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast himinto an abnormal condition, in which the phenomena resemble very closely thoseof death, or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena ofany other normal condition within our cognizance; that, while in this state, theperson so impressed employs only with effort, and then feebly, the externalorgans of sense, yet perceives, with ,keenly refined perception, and throughchannels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the physical organs;that, moreover, his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted andinvigorated; that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound;and, finally, that his susceptibility to the impression increases with itsfrequency, while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited aremore extended and more pronounced.I say that these - which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features - itwould be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I inflict upon my readers soneedless a demonstration to-day. My purpose at present is a very different oneindeed. I am impelled, even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail,without comment, the very remarkable substance of a colloquy occurring between asleep-waker and myself.I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in question (Mr.Vankirk), and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmericperception had supervened. For many months he had been labouring under confirmedphthisis, the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by mymanipulations; and on the night of Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I wassummoned to his bedside.The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart, andbreathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary symptoms of asthma. Inspasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustardto the nervous centres, but to-night this had been attempted in vain.As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and althoughevidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally, quite at ease.\"I sent for you to-night,\" he said, \"not so much to administer to my bodilyailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal impressions which, of late,have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise. I need not tell you how scepticalI have hitherto been on the topic of the soul's immortality. I cannot deny thatthere has always existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, avague half-sentiment of its own existence. But this halfsentiment at no timeamounted to conviction. With it my reason had nothing to do. All attempts atlogical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me more sceptical than before. Ihad been advised to study Cousin. I studied him in his own works as well as inthose of his European and American echoes. The `Charles Elwood' of Mr. Brownson,for example, was placed in my hands. I read it with profound attention.Throughout I found it logical, but the portions which were not merely logicalwere unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero of the book. Inhis summing up it seemed evident to me that the reasoner had not even succeededin convincing himself. His end had plainly forgotten his beginning, like thegovernment of Trinculo. In short, I was not long in perceiving that if man is tobe intellectually convinced of his own immortality, he will never be soconvinced by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of themoralists of England, of France, and of Germany. Abstractions may amuse andexercise, but take no hold on the mind. Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, Iam persuaded, will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things.The will may assent - the soul - the intellect, never.\"I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually believed. Butlatterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling, until it has come sonearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason, that I find it difficult todistinguish between the two. I am enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect tothe mesmeric influence. I cannot better explain my meaning than by thehypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train ofratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but which, in fullaccordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not extend, except through itseffect, into my normal condition: In sleep-waking, the reasoning and itsconclusion - the cause and its effect - are present together. In my naturalstate, the cause vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only partially,remains.\"These considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensuefrom a series of well-directed questions propounded to me while mesmerized. Youhave often observed the profound self-cognizance evinced by the sleepwaker - theextensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmericcondition itself; and from this selfcognizance may be deduced hints for theproper conduct of a catechism.\"I consented of course to make this experiment. A few passes threw Mr. Vankirkinto the mesmeric sleep. His breathing became immediately more easy, and heseemed to suffer no physical uneasiness. The following conversation then ensued:- V. in the dialogue representing the patient, and P. myself.P. Are you asleep?V. Yes - no; I would rather sleep more soundly.P. [After a few more passes.] Do you sleep now?V. Yes.P How do you think your present illness will result?V. [After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort.] I must die.P Does the idea of death afflict you?V. [Very quickly.] No - no!P Are you pleased with the prospect?V. If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter. The mesmericcondition is so near death as to content me.P I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.V. I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel able to make.You do not question me properly.P What then shall I ask?V. You must begin at the beginning.P. The beginning! But where is the beginning?V. You know that the beginning is Gov. [This was said in a low, fluctuatingtone, and with every sign of the most profound veneration.]P. What, then, is God?V. [Hesitating for many minutes.] I cannot tell.P Is not God spirit?V. While I was awake I knew what you meant by \"spirit,\" but now it seems only aword - such, for instance, as truth, beauty - a quality, I mean.P Is not God immaterial?V. There is no immateriality; it is a mere word. That which is not matter, isnot at all -unless qualities are things.P Is God, then, material?V. No. [This reply startled me very much.]P What, then, is he?V. [After a long pause, and mutteringly.] I see - but it is a thing difficult totell. [Another long pause.] He is not spirit, for he exists. Nor is he matter,as you understand it. But there are gradations of matter of which man knowsnothing; the grosser impelling the finer, the finer pervading the grosser. Theatmosphere, for example, impels the electric principle, while the electricprinciple permeates the atmosphere. These gradations of matter increase inrarity or fineness, until we arrive at a matter unparticled-without particles -indivisible - one; and here the law of impulsion and permeation is modified. Theultimate or unparticled matter not only permeates all things, but impels allthings; and thus is all things within itself. This matter is God. What menattempt to embody in the word \"thought,\" is this matter in motion.P The metaphysicians maintain that all action is reducible to motion andthinking, and that the latter is the origin of the former.V. Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea. Motion is the action of mind, notof thinking. The unparticled matter, or God, in quiescence, is (as nearly as wecan conceive it) what men call mind. And the power of self-movement (equivalentin effect to human volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of itsunity and omni-prevalence; how, I know not, and now clearly see that I shallnever know. But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law or qualityexisting within itself, is thinking.P. Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the unparticled matter?V. The matters of which man is cognizant escape the senses in gradation. Wehave, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of water, the atmosphere, agas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous ether. Now, we call all these thingsmatter, and embrace all matter in one general definition; but in spite of this,there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach toa metal, and that which we attach to the luminiferous ether. When we reach thelatter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit, orwith nihility. The only consideration which restrains us is our conception ofits atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to seek aid from our notion ofan atom, as something possessing in infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability,weight. Destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer beable to regard the ether as an entity, or, at least, as matter. For want of abetter word we might term it spirit. Take, now, a'step beyond the luminiferousether; conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether, as this ether is morerare than the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all the school dogmas)at a unique mass - an unparticled matter. For although we may admit infinitelittleness in the atoms themselves, the infinitude of littleness in the spacesbetween them is an absurdity. There will be a point - there will be a degree ofrarity at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces mustvanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce. But the consideration of the atomicconstitution being now taken away, the nature of the mass inevitably glides intowhat we conceive of spirit. It is clear, however, that it is as fully matter asbefore. The truth is, it is impossible to conceive spirit, since it isimpossible to imagine what is not. When we flatter ourselves that we have formedits conception, we have merely deceived our understanding by the considerationof infinitely rarefied matter.P. There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolutecoalescence; - and that in the very slight resistance experienced by theheavenly bodies in their revolutions through space - a resistance nowascertained, it is true, to exist in some degree, but which is, nevertheless, soslight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton. We knowthat the resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their density.Absolute coalescence is absolute density. Where there are no interspaces, therecan be no yielding. An ether, absolutely dense, would put an infinitely moreeffectual stop to the progress of a star than would an ether of adamant or ofiron.V. Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of itsapparent unanswerability. - As regards the progress of the star, it can make nodifference whether the star passes through the ether or the ether through it.There is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which reconciles theknown retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether;for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop to all siderealrevolution in a very far briefer period than has been admitted by thoseastronomers who have endeavoured to slur over a point which they found itimpossible to comprehend. The retardation actually experienced is, on the otherhand, about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in theinstantaneous passage through the orb. In the one case, the retarding force ismomentary and complete within itself - in the other it is endlesslyaccumulative.P. But in all this - in this identification of mere matter with God - is therenothing of irreverence? [I was forced to repeat this question before thesleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning.]V. Can you say why matter should be less reverenced than mind? But you forgetthat the matter of which I speak is, in all respects, the very \"mind\" or\"spirit\" of the schools, so far as regards its high capacities, and is,moreover, the \"matter\" of these schools at the same time. God, with all thepowers attributed to spirit, is but the perfection of matter.P. You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is thought.V. In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind. Thisthought creates. All created things are but the thoughts of God.P You say, \"in general.\"V. Yes. The universal mind is God. For new individualities, matter is necessary.P. But you now speak of \"mind\" and \"matter\" as do the metaphysicians.V. Yes - to avoid confusion. When I say \"mind,\" I mean the unparticled orultimate matter; by \"matter,\" I intend all else.P. You were saying that \"for new individualities matter is necessary.\"V. Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God. To create individual,thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions of the divine mind. Thusman is individualized. Divested of corporate investiture, he were God. Now theparticular motion of the incarnated portions of the unparticled matter is thethought of man; as the motion of the whole is that of God.P. You say that divested of the body man will be God?V. [After much hesitation.] I could not have said this; it is an absurdity.P. [Referring to my notes.] You did say that \"divested of corporate investitureman were God.\"V. And this is true. Man thus divested would be God - would be unindividualized.But he can never be thus divested - at least never will be - else we mustimagine an action of God returning upon itself- a purposeless and futile action.Man is a creature. Creatures are thoughts of God. It is the nature of thought tobe irrevocable.P. I do not comprehend. You say that man will never put off the body?V. I say that he will never be bodiless.P. Explain.V. There are two bodies - the rudimental and the complete, corresponding withthe two conditions of the worm and the butterfly. What we call \"death,\" is butthe painful metamorphosis. Our present incarnation is progressive, preparatory,temporary. Our future is perfected, ultimate, immortal. The ultimate life is thefull design.P. But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.V. We, certainly - but not the worm. The matter of which our rudimental body iscomposed, is within the ken of the organs of that body; or, more distinctly, ourrudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimentalbody; but not to that of which the ultimate is composed. The ultimate body thusescapes our rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, indecaying, from the inner form; not that inner form itself, but this inner form,as well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have already acquired theultimate life.P. You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death. Howis this?V. When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles the ultimatelife; for when I am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance,and I perceive external things directly, without organs, through a medium whichI shall employ in the ultimate, unorganized life.P. Unorganized?V. Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensiblerelation with particular classes and forms of matter, to the exclusion of otherclasses and forms. The organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition,and to that only; his ultimate condition, being unorganized, is of unlimitedcomprehension in all points but one - the nature of the volition of God - thatis to say, the motion of the unparticled matter. You will have a distinct ideaof the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain. This it is not; but aconception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension of what it is. Aluminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous ether. The vibrationsgenerate similar ones within the retina; these again communicate similar ones tothe optic nerve. The nerve conveys similar ones to the brain; the brain, also,similar ones to the unparticled matter which permeates it. The motion of thislatter is thought, of which perception is the first undulation. This is the modeby which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world;and this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through theidiosyncrasy of its organs. But in the ultimate, unorganized life, the externalworld reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance having affinity to brain,as I have said,) with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarerether than even the luminiferous; and to this ether - in unison with it - thewhole body vibrates, setting in motion the unparticled matter which permeatesit. It is to the absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we mustattribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life. To rudimentalbeings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.P. You speak of rudimental \"beings.\" Are there other rudimental thinking beingsthan man?V. The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulae, planets, suns,and other bodies which are neither nebula, suns, nor planets, is for the solepurpose of supplying pabulum for the idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinityof rudimental beings. But for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to theultimate life, there would have been no bodies such as these. Each of these istenanted by a distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures. Inall, the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted. At death, ormetamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate life - immortality - andcognizant of all secrets but the one, act all things and pass every where bymere volition: - indwelling, not the stars, which to us seem the solepalpabilities, and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created- but that SPACE itself - that infinity of which the truly substantive vastnessswallows up the star-shadows - blotting them out as non-entities from theperception of the angels.P. You say that \"but for the necessity of the rudimental life, there would havebeen no stars.\" But why this necessity?V. In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter generally, there isnothing to impede the action of one simple unique law - the Divine Volition.With the view of producing impediment, the organic life and matter (complex,substantial, and law-encumbered) were contrived.P. But again - why need this impediment have been produced?V. The result of law inviolate is perfection - right - negative happiness. Theresult of law violate is imperfection, wrong, positive pain. Through theimpediments afforded by the number, complexity, and substantiality of the lawsof organic life and matter, the violation of law is rendered, to a certainextent, practicable. Thus pain, which in the inorganic life is impossible, ispossible in the organic.P. But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?V. All things are either good or bad by comparison. A sufficient analysis willshow that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of pain. Positive pleasureis a mere idea. To be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same.Never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed. But it has beenshown that, in the inorganic life, pain cannot be; thus the necessity for theorganic. The pain of the primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the blissof the ultimate life of Heaven.P. Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible tocomprehend - \"the truly substantive vastness of infinity.\"V. This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic conception of theterm \"substance\" itself. We must not regard it as a quality, but as a sentiment:- it is the perception, in thinking beings, of the adaptation of matter to theirorganization. There are many things on the Earth, which would be nihility to theinhabitants of Venus - many things visible and tangible in Venus, which we couldnot be brought to appreciate as existing at all. But to the inorganic beings -to the angels - the whole of the unparticled matter is substance; that is tosay, the whole of what we term \"space,\" is to them the truest substantiality; -the stars, meantime, through what we consider their materiality, escaping theangelic sense, just in proportion as the unparticled matter, through what weconsider its immateriality, eludes the organic.As the sleep-waker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble tone, I observedon his countenance a singular expression, which somewhat alarmed me, and inducedme to awake him at once. No sooner had I done this, than, with a bright smileirradiating all his features, he fell back upon his pillow and expired. Inoticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the sternrigidity of stone. His brow was of the coldness of ice. Thus, ordinarily, shouldit have appeared, only after long pressure from Azrael's hand. Had thesleep-waker, indeed, during the latter portion of his discourse, been addressingme from out the region of the shadows?FROM MAGICK IN THEORY AND PRACTICEALEISTER CROWLEYHYMN TO PAN[img/page0577_0000.svg]SOPH. AJ.[img/page0577_0001.svg] [img/page0578_0000.svg] [img/page0579_0000.svg]FROM HEAVEN AND HELLEMANUELSWEDENBORGTHERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN EVERYTHING IN HEAVEN AND EVERYTHING IN MANThe nature of correspondence is unknown nowadays; this for several reasons. Theforemost reason is that man has moved himself away from heaven through love ofself and love of the world. For a person who loves himself and the worldprimarily focuses on worldly things only, since these appeal to his outwardsenses and gratify his inclinations. He does not focus on spiritual thingsbecause these appeal to the inner senses and gratify the mind. As a result,people of this kind reject spiritual things, calling them too lofty to thinkabout.The ancient people behaved differently. As far as they were concerned, aknowledge of correspondences was the finest of all knowledges. They drewdiscernment and wisdom through it; through it, church people were in touch withheaven. For this knowledge of correspondences is an angelic knowledge.Using correspondence itself, the most ancient people (who were celestial people)thought like angels and actually talked with angels as a result. For the samereason, the Lord often appeared to them and taught them. Nowadays, though, thisknowledge has so vanished that even the nature of correspondence is unknown.Now, without insight into the nature of correspondence, nothing can be known inclear light about the spiritual world, nothing about its inflow into the naturalworld, or even about what the spiritual is relative to the natural; nothing canbe known in clear light about man's spirit, called his soul, and how it acts onthe body, nothing about man's state after death. Because of this, the nature andcharacter of= correspondence needs to be presented. This will pave the way forfurther matters.Let us then first state the nature of correspondence. The whole natural worldcorresponds to the spiritual world - not just the natural world in general, butactually in details. So anything in the natural world that occurs from thespiritual world is called a correspondent. It is vital to understand that thenatural world emerges and endures from the spiritual world, just like an effectfrom the cause that produces it.The natural world means all the expanse under the sun, receiving warmth andlight from it. All the entities that are maintained from this source belong tothat world. The spiritual world, in contrast, is heaven. All the things that arein the heavens belong to that world.Since man is both a heaven and an earth in smallest form, on the model of thegreatest, he has a spiritual world and a natural world within him. His spiritualworld comprises his more inward elements, belonging to his mind and having to dowith discernment and intention. His natural world comprises his more outwardelements, belonging to his body and having to do with its senses and behaviour.So anything that occurs in his natural world (his body, its senses, and itsactions) from his spiritual world (his mind, its discernment, and its intention)is called a correspondent.The nature of correspondence is visible in man in his face. In a face which hasnot been trained to pretend, all the mind's affections stand out visibly, in aphysical form as in their imprint. This is why the face is called the index ofthe mind, a person's spiritual world contained within his natural world.In much the same way, the elements of discernment are represented in speech andthe elements of intention in bodily attitudes. So these things that happen inthe body - face, speech, or attitudes alike - are called correspondences.This may also serve to clarify what the inner person is and what the outerperson is. The inner is what is called the spiritual person; the outer, thenatural. Further, the two are quite distinct, as are heaven and earth, in such away that, further still, everything that happens or emerges in the outer ornatural person happens and emerges from the inner or spiritual.All this has to do with the correspondence of the inner or spiritual realm ofman with his outer or natural realm. Now we must deal with the correspondence ofthe totality of heaven with the details of man.It has been pointed out that the whole heaven reflects a single person, that itis a person in all appearance, and that it is therefore called the Greatest Man.It has also been pointed out that the angelic communities that constitute heavenare therefore arranged like the members, organs, and viscera in a person. Sothere are some which are in the head, some in the chest, some in the arms, andsome in specific parts of them.So communities that are in a particular member there correspond to the likemember in man - those in the head, for example, correspond to the head in aperson, those in the chest to the person's chest, those in the arms to his arms,and so on. Man has being from this correspondence, for man has being only fromheaven.The division of heaven into two kingdoms, one called celestial and one calledspiritual, has been pointed out above in the appropriate section. In general,the celestial kingdom corresponds to the heart and to everything dependent onthe heart throughout the body. The spiritual kingdom corresponds to the lungsand to everything dependent on them throughout the body. Heart and lungsconstitute two kingdoms in man, with the heart's domain extending through thearteries and veins, and the lungs' dominion through the nerve and motor tissues.Both are involved in whatever effort or activity occurs.There are also two kingdoms in every individual's spiritual world, which iscalled his spiritual person. One of these belongs to his intention and the otherto his discernment. Intention's dominion extends through affections for what isgood, and discernment's through affections for what is true. These kingdomscorrespond to the kingdoms of the heart and the lungs in the body.The situation in the heavens is similar. The celestial kingdom is the seat ofheaven's intention, where the \"good\" of love reigns. The spiritual kingdom isthe seat of heaven's discernment, where what is true reigns. These are whatcorrespond to the functions of the heart and lungs in man.This correspondence is why \"the heart\" in the Word indicates intention, also thegood of love; while \"the breath\" of the lungs indicates discernment and what istrue of faith. This is also why affections are attributed to the heart, eventhough they are not in or from the heart.The correspondence of heaven's two kingdoms with the heart and lungs is thegeneral correspondence of heaven with man. Less general is the correspondencewith his particular members, organs, and viscera, whose nature will now benoted.In the Greatest Man, or heaven, people in the head are those who are involved ineverything good more than others are. They are in fact involved in love, peace,innocence, wisdom, discernment, and in joy and happiness as a result. They flowinto the head, and into things dependent on the head, in man; and theycorrespond to such things.In the Greatest Man, or heaven, the people who are in the chest are involved inthe good of charity and faith. They flow into man's chest, and correspond to it.In the Greatest Man, or heaven, people in the loins or organs for generation areinvolved in marriage love. People in the feet are in the outmost good of heaven,which is called natural-spiritual good. People in the arms and hands areinvolved in the power of what is true from what is good. People in the eyes areinvolved in discernment; people in the ears, in hearkening and obedience; peoplein the nostrils, in perception; people in the mouth and tongue, in discussing onthe basis of discernment and perception. People in the kidneys are involved intruth as examining, distinguishing, and correcting. People in the liver,pancreas, and spleen are involved in various kinds of cleansing of what is goodand true. Other functions are performed elsewhere.These flow into parallel elements in man, and correspond to them. The inflowingof heaven is into the functions and uses of the members of the body. The uses,being from the spiritual world, take form by means of such materials as occur inthe natural world. So they present themselves in their effect, which is thesource of correspondence.This is why these same members, organs, and viscera are used in the Word todenote parallel things; for everything in the Word has meaning according tocorrespondence. \"Head\" is therefore used to denote discernment and wisdom,\"chest,\" charity; \"loins,\" marriage love; \"arms\" and \"hands\" the power of whatis true; \"feet,\" what is natural; \"eyes,\" discernment; \"nostrils,\" perception;\"ears,\" obedience; \"kidneys,\" examination of what is true; and so on.This is also why it is natural for people talking about intelligence and wisdomto speak of \"a good head,\" to speak of someone involved in charity as \"a bosomfriend,\" to refer to someone perceptive as \"having a sharp nose,\" someonediscerning as \"sharp-sighted,\" someone powerful as \"having a long arm,\" someonewho wills something from his love as \"willing from his heart.\"These expressions, and many others in people's language, stem fromcorrespondence. They actually stem from the spiritual world, though people donot realize it.The existence of this correspondence between everything heavenly and everythinghuman has been demonstrated to me by an abundance of experience - such anabundance that I am so thoroughly convinced about these matters as to find themquite obvious, beyond any doubt. But listing all this experience is not our taskat this point, and the very abundance precludes it. You may find it assembled inArcana Coelestia in the treatment of correspondences, representations, theinflow of the spiritual world into the natural, and interaction between soul andbody.In spite of the fact that everything physical about man corresponds toeverything heavenly, still a person is not a picture of heaven as far as hisoutward form is concerned, only as far as his inner form is concerned. It is themore inward elements of a person, after all, that receive heaven; his outerelements receive the world. So an individual is inwardly a heaven in least form,a reflection of the greatest heaven, so far as his more inward elements doreceive heaven. To the degree that his more inward elements are unreceptive, heis not a heaven or a reflection of the greatest.Be that as it may, his more outward elements, which receive the world, may be ina form that follows some pattern of this world - with different degrees ofbeauty, therefore. Outward or physical beauty, that is, goes back to parents andto formation in the womb. Thereafter it is maintained by means of a generalinflow from the world. As a result, the form of an individual's natural personmay differ radically from the form of his spiritual person.A number of times, I have been shown what the form of an individual's spirit waslike, and with some people who looked lovely and charming, the spirit lookedmisshapen, black, and monstrous - something you would call a reflection of hellrather than of heaven. With others who were not beautiful, the spirit lookedgraceful, radiant, and angelic. After death, a person's spirit looks the way itactually was within his body while it dwelt there in the world.But correspondence includes even more than just man. There is anintercorrespondence of the heavens, the second or middle heaven corresponding tothe third or inmost, and the first or outmost heaven corresponding to the secondor middle. This first heaven corresponds to physical forms in man, calledmembers, organs, and viscera.So man's body is where heaven finally leaves off; it is what heaven stands onlike a base. But this arcanum will be explained more fully elsewhere.But the following fact must certainly be known: all the correspondence thatexists with heaven is with the Lord's Divine Human, since heaven is from Him andHe is heaven, as has been pointed out in the preceding chapters. For unless theDivine Human did flow into all the elements of heaven - and, followingcorrespondences, into all the elements of earth - neither angel nor man wouldexist.This clarifies again why the Lord became Man, why He covered His Divine with aHuman from beginning to end. This happened because the Divine Human which hassustained heaven- before the Lord's coming was no longer adequate to keepeverything going, since man, the \"base\" of the heavens, hadundermined-and-destroyed the pattern.Angels are baffled when they hear that there actually are people who ascribeeverything to nature and nothing to the Divine, people who believe that theirbodies, where so many heavenly marvels are assembled, are just put together outof natural elements -- who believe nature to be the source even of man'srationality.Yet if only they could raise their minds a bit, they would see that things likethis are from the Divine, not from nature, that nature was created simply toclothe the spiritual, to act as its correspondent and to give it presence in thelowest realm of the overall design. Angels compare people like this to owls, whosee in the dark but not in the light.FROM TRANSCENDENTAL MAGICELIPHAS LEVIBehind the veil of all the hieratic and mystical allegories of ancientdoctrines, behind the darkness and strange ordeals of all initiations, under theseal of all sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the crumblingstones of old temples and on the blackened visage of the Assyrian or Egyptiansphinx, in the monstrous or marvellous paintings which interpret to the faithfulof India the inspired pages of the Vedas, in the cryptic emblems of our oldbooks on alchemy, in the ceremonies practised at reception by all secretsocieties, there are found indications of a doctrine which is everywhere thesame and everywhere carefully concealed. Occult philosophy seems to have beenthe nurse or god-mother of all intellectual forces, the key of all divineobscurities and the absolute queen of society in those ages when it was reservedexclusively for the education of priests and of kings. It reigned in Persia withthe Magi, who perished in the end, as perish all masters of the world, becausethey abused their power; it endowed India with the most wonderful traditions andwith an incredible wealth of poesy, grace and terror in its emblems; itcivilised Greece to the music of the lyre of Orpheus; it concealed theprinciples of all sciences, all progress of the human mind, in the daringcalculations of Pythagoras; fable abounded in its miracles, and history,attempting to estimate this unknown power, became confused with fable; itundermined or consolidated empires by its oracles, caused tyrants to tremble ontheir thrones and governed all minds, either by curiosity or by fear. For thisscience, said the crowd, there is nothing impossible; it commands the elements,knows the language of the stars and directs the planetary courses; when itspeaks, the moon falls blood-red from heaven; the dead rise in their graves andmutter ominous words, as the night wind blows through their skulls. Mistress oflove or of hate, occult science can dispense paradise or hell at its pleasure tohuman hearts; it disposes of all forms and confers beauty or ugliness; with thewand of Circe it changes men into brutes and animals alternatively into men; itdisposes even of life and death, can confer wealth on its adepts by thetransmutation of metals and immortality by its quintessence or elixir,compounded of gold and light.Such was Magic from Zoraster to Manes, from Orpheus to Apollonius of Tyana ...I testify that in fine there is one sole, universal and imperishable dogma,strong as supreme reason; simple, like all that is great, intelligible, like allthat is universally and absolutely true; and this dogma is the parent of allothers. There is also a science which confers on man powers apparentlysuperhuman ...To attain the SANCTUM REGNUM, in other words, the knowledge and power of theMagi, there are four indispensable conditions - an intelligence illuminated bystudy, an intrepidity which nothing can check, a will which cannot be broke, anda prudence which nothing can corrupt and nothing intoxicate. TO KNOW, TO DARE,TO WILL, TO KEEP SILENCE - such are the four words of Magus, inscribed upon thefour symbolical forms of the sphinx. These maxims can be combined after fourmanners and explained four times by one another ...There is no invisible world; there are, however, many degrees of perfection inorgans. The body is the coarse and, as it were, the perishable cortex of thesoul. The soul can perceive of itself, and independently of the mediation of thephysical organs ... the things, both spiritual and corporeal, which are existentin the universe ... What is called the imagination within us is only the soul'sinherent faculty of assimilating the images and reflections contained in theliving light, being the Great Magnetic Agent ... The man of genius differs fromthe dreamer and the fool in this only, that his creations are analogous totruth, while those of the fool and the dreamer are lost reflections and betrayedimages. Hence, for the wise man, to imagine is to see, as, for the magician, tospeak is to create ... but the imagination of the adept is diaphanous, whilstthat of the crowd is opaque ...... the Astral Light, or terrestrial fluid, which we call the Great MagneticAgent, is saturated with all kinds of images or reflections ... Such images arealways present before us, and are effaced only by the more powerful impressionsof reality during waking hours, or by preoccupation of the mind, which makes ourimagination inattentive to the fluidic panorama of the Astral Light. When wesleep, this spectacle presents itself spontaneously before us, and in this waydreams are produced ... Animal Magnetism is nothing but the artificial sleepproduced by the voluntary or enforced union of two wills, one of which is awakewhile the other slumbers ... Thus, somnambulists do not actually travel to theplace where they are sent by the magnetiser; they evoke its images in the AstralLight and can behold nothing which does not exist in that light ...Magnetism between two persons is certainly a wonderful discovery, but themagnetising of a person by himself, awakening his own lucidity and directing itat himself at will, is the perfection of magical art.Every intention which does not assert itself by deeds is a vain intention, andthe speech which expresses it is idle speech. It is action which proves life andestablishes will. Hence it is said in the sacred and symbolical books that menwill be judged, not according to their thoughts and their ideas, but accordingto their works. We must do in order to be ...Magical operations are the exercise of a natural power, but one superior to theordinary forces of Nature. They are the result of a science and a practice whichexalt human will beyond its normal limits ... But in order to work miracles wemust be outside the normal conditions of humanity; we must be either abstractedby wisdom or exalted by madness, either superior to all passions or outside themthrough ecstasy or frenzy. Such is the first and most indispensable preparationof the operator .. .Man can be modified by habit, which becomes, according to the proverb, hissecond nature. By means of persevering and graduated athletics, the powers andactivity of the body can be developed to an astonishing extent. It is the samewith the powers of the soul. Would you reign over yourselves and others? Learnhow to will. How can one learn how to will? This is the first arcanum of magicalinitiation, and that it might be realised fundamentally the ancient custodiansof sacerdotal art surrounded the approaches of the sanctuary with so manyterrors and illusions. They recognised no will until it had produced its proofs,and they were right. Power is justified by attainment. Indolence andforgetfulness are the enemies of will, and for this reason all religions havemultiplied their observances and made their worship minute and difficult. Themore we deny ourselves for an idea, the greater is the strength we acquirewithin the scope of that idea ... What seek you therefore from the science ofthe Magi? Dare to formulate your desire, then set to work at once, and do notcease acting after the same manner and for the same end. That which you willshall come to pass, and for you and by you it has indeed already begun ... Anidle man will never become a magician ...Initiation is a preservative against the false lights of mysticism; it equipshuman reason with its relative value and proportional infallibility, connectingit with supreme reason by way of analogies. Hence the initiate knows no doubtfulhopes, no absurd fears, because he has no irrational beliefs; he is acquaintedwith the extent of his power, and he can be bold without danger. For him,therefore, to dare is to be able. Here, then, is a new interpretation of hisattributes: his lamp represents learning; the mantle which enwraps him, hisdiscretion; while his staff is the emblem of his strength and boldness. Heknows, he dares and is silent. He knows the secrets of the future, he dares inthe present, and he is silent on the past. He knows the failings of the humanheart; he dares to make use of them to achieve his work; and he is silent as tohis purposes. He knows the significance of all symbolisms and of all religions;he dares to practise or abstain from them without hypocrisy and without impiety;and he is silent upon the one dogma of supreme initiation. He knows theexistence and nature of the Great Magical Agent; he dares perform the acts andgives utterances to the words which make it subject to human will, and he issilent upon the mysteries of the Great Arcanum.So you may find him often melancholy, but never dejected or despairing; oftenpoor, never abject or miserable; persecuted often, never disheartened orconquered. He remembers the bereavement and murder of Orpheus, the exile andlonely death of Moses, the martyrdom of the prophets, the tortures ofApollonius, the Cross of the Saviour. He knows the desolation in which Agrippadied, whose memory is even now slandered; he knows what labours overcame thegreat Paracelsus, and all that Raymond Lull was condemned to undergo that hemight finish by a violent death. He remembers Swedenborg simulating madness andeven losing his reason in order to excuse his science; Saint-Martin and hishidden life; Cagliostro, who perished in the cells of the Inquisition; Cazotte,who ascended the scaffold. Inheritor of so many victims, he does not dare theless, but he understands better the necessity for silence. Let us follow hisexample; let us learn diligently; when we know, let us have courage, and let usbe silent.FROM A SEASON IN HELLARTHUR RIMBAUDEXCERPTSA SEASON IN HELLFormerly, if I remember rightly, my life was a banquet, at which all heartsopened and all wines flowed.One evening I took Beauty upon my knees. - And I found her bitter. And Iinsulted her.I have armed myself against justice.I have fled. Oh enchantress! Oh misery! Oh hatred! - it is to you that mytreasure has been entrusted.I am succeeding in banishing all human hopes from my mind. In order to strangleall joys I have sprung upon them stealthily like a wild beast.I have summoned the executioners, in order, while perishing, to gnaw thebuttends of their guns. I have summoned scourges so as to stifle myself withsand and blood. Misfortune has been my god. I have stretched out in the mud. Ihave become dessicated in the air of crime. And I have played fine tricks withmadness.Spring has taught me the idiot's hideous laughter.Now, finding myself, quite recently, on the point of croaking, I thought ofseeking for the key of the ancient feast, so that I might, perhaps, recover myappetite.Charity is that key. - This inspiration proves that I have been dreaming.\"Thou shalt remain a hyena, etc ...\" exclaimed the demon who crowned me withsuch pleasing poppies. \"Attain death with all your appetites, with your egoismand every capital sin.\"Ali! I have endured too much: - But, dear Satan, a less irritated leer, I beg ofyou! - and awaiting one or two little belated villanies, I detach for you - youwho love the absence of the descriptive or instructive faculties in a writer -these few hideous sheets from my notebook - the notebook of one of the damned.A NIGHT IN HELLI have swallowed a terrible draught of poison. - Thrice blessed be the advicewhich has been given me! - My vitals are burning. The violence of the venomtwists my limbs, deforms, and strikes me down. I am dying of thirst. I amchoking. Not a cry can I utter. This is hell, the eternal punishment, Behold howthe fire flares up! I burn properly. So be it, demon!I had glimpsed conversion to goodness and happiness - salvation. May I be ableto describe the vision, for the atmosphere of hell will not suffer hymns! Therewere millions of charming creatures, a sweet spiritual concert, strength andpeace, noble ambitions - what more do I know?Noble ambitions!And this is still life! If damnation is eternal! A man who wishes to mutiliatehimself is indeed damned, is he not? I believe I am in hell, therefore I am.That is the fulfilment of the catechism. I am the slave of my baptism. Parents,you have created my own and your own misfortune. Poor innocent one! Hell cannotattack the pagans. That is life once more! Later, the delights of damnation willbe more profound. Quick - a crime, that I may fall into nothingness, in the nameof the human law.Silence! - wilt though be silent? Shame and reproach are here: Satan says thatfire is ignoble, that my anger is hideously stupid. Enough! ... Errors,enchantments, false perfumes, puerile music are suggested to me. And to thinkthat I possess truth, that I behold justice. I possess a sane and fixedjudgment; I am ripe for perfection ... Pride - My scalp is drying up! Pity onme! Lord, I am full of fear. I am thirsty, so thirsty! Ali! Childhood, with thegrass and the rain, the lake amidst the stones and the moonlight when thesteeple struck twelve ... the devil is in the bell-tower at that hour. Mary!Holy Virgin! ... My dreadful stupidity.Are they not honest souls over there who wish me well ... Come ... I have apillow over my mouth and they hear me not: they are phantoms. Moreover, no oneever thinks of his neighbour. Let no one approach. Certainly I smell of burning.Hallucinations are innumerable. This is indeed what I have always had: no morefaith in history, and forgetfulness of principles. I will be silent on thatscore, for poets and visionaries would be jealous. I am a thousand times richer,so let me be as avaricious as the sea.Ali! Come now - a short time ago the clock of life stopped. I am no longer inthe world. - Theology is serious, hell is certainly down below - and heaven onhigh. Ecstasy, nightmare, slumber is a nest of flames.When mentally alert in the country, what malice is displayed ... Ferdinand,Satan keeps pace with the wild seeds ... Jesus walks on the purplish brambleswithout bending them down ... Jesus walked on the troubled water. The lanternshowed him to us, a white figure with brown tresses, upright by the side of anemerald wave ...I am going to unveil all the mysteries: religious or natural mysteries, deathand birth, the future and the past, cosmogony and nothingness. I am a master inphantasmagoria.Listen!I possess all talents! There is no one here and there is someone: I would notdistribute my treasures. Do you wish for native songs, houri dances? Would youlike me to disappear and dive in search of the ring? Is that your wish? I willproduce gold and remedies.Place your trust, then, in me, for faith relieves, guides and cures. Come, allof you - even little children - that I may console you and pour forth his heart- that marvellous heart - for your sake! Poor men and workers! I do not ask forprayers; with merely your confidence I shall be happy.And let us think of myself. This makes me regret the world but little. I amlucky not to suffer more. My life was wholly made up of sweet acts of folly, andthat was regrettable.Bah! Let us make every imaginable grimace.We are decidedly outside the world. There is not a single sound. My sense offeeling has disappeared. Ali! My chateaux, my Saxony, my willow-wood. Theevenings, mornings, nights, days ... How tired I am!I was bound to have my hell for anger, my hell for pride - and the hellconsequent on caresses. A veritable concert of hells.I am dying of weariness. The tomb awaits me. I am travelling to that horror ofhorrors - the worms. Satan, old blade, you wish to dissolve me with your charms.I demand, I demand! - a prod with your pitchfork and a drop of fire.Ali! Once more to ascend to life! To look on our deformities. And this poison,this thousand-times-cursed kiss! My weakness and the world's cruelty! My God,pity! Hide me. I make too poor a resistance! I am hidden and yet I am not.The fire is flaring up with its damned one.ALCHEMY OF THE WORDAs regards myself. The story of one of my follies.For a long time I boasted of being in possession of every possible landscape,and found modern celebrities in painting and poetry derisive.I was fond of idiotic paintings, frieze-panels, decorative pieces, mountebankcanvases, sign-boards, popular coloured prints; old-fashioned literature, churchLatin, ill-spelt erotic works, the novels of our grandmothers, fairy tales,little juvenile books, old operas, foolish refrains, and silly rhythms.I dreamed of crusades, voyages of discovery of which there were no records,republics without a history, suppressed wars of religion, revolutions in morals,migrations of races and displacement of continents. I believed in allenchantments.I invented the colour of the vowels! - A black, E white, I red, O blue, U green- I regulated the form and movement of each consonant, and, with instinctiverhythms, I prided myself on having fashioned a poetice diction accessible, oneday or other, to all understandings. I reserved the translation.It was, at first, a study. I wrote on the subject of silences and nights. Inoted the inexpressible. I fixed the frenzies.Far from birds and flocks and village girls, kneeling in the heather, surroundedby tender hazel-woods, amidst the warm green haze of the afternoon, what did Idrink?What could I drink - voiceless young elms, flowerless greensward, overcast sky!- in that young Oise? Drink from those yellow gourds, far from my hut, Darling?Some golden liquour which caused one to perspire.I fashioned an incoherent tavern signboard. - A storm swept across the sky. Ateve the waters of the woods lost themselves amidst virgin sands. The wind of Goddrove the icicles into the ponds.Weeping, I beheld gold - and I could not drink.[img/img0004.jpg][img/page0605_0000.svg][img/page0605_0001.svg][img/page0605_0002.svg][img/page0605_0003.svg][img/page0606_0000.svg][img/img0005.jpg]The old lumber of poetics played a great part in my alchemy of the word.To hallucination pure and simple I became habituated. In the place of a factoryI saw a mosque; I saw a school for drummers made by angels, coaches on the roadsof heaven, a drawing room at the bottom of a lake. The very title of avaudeville raised up terrors before me.Then I explained my magic sophisms by the hallucination of words.I ended up by finding the disorder of my mind sacred. I became idle, a prey toheavy fever: I envied the blissfulness of the animals - the caterpillars, whorepresent the innocence of limbo, and the moles, the repose of virginity!My character became embittered. In songs of sorts I said farewell to the world:THE SONG OF THE HIGHEST TOWER[img/page0606_0001.svg][img/page0606_0002.svg][img/page0606_0003.svg]I adored the desert, sunburnt orchards, tarnished shops, lukewarm drinks. Iloafed in stinking lanes, and with closed eyes offered myself to the god of fire- the Sun.\"General, if an old cannon on thy ruined ramparts remains, bombard us withblocks of dry earth. The plate-glass windows of splendid shops! And the drawingrooms! Make the town eat dust. Oxidize the gargoyles. Fill the boudoirs with thepower of burning rubies ..Oh! gnat intoxicated in the village urinal, enamoured with borage, and whosedestruction comes with a ray!HUNGER[img/page0608_0000.svg][img/page0608_0001.svg][img/page0608_0002.svg][img/page0608_0003.svg][img/page0608_0004.svg]At last - 0 happiness, 0 reason - I dispelled the dark azure from the sky, andlived - a golden spark of light and nature. Joyfully, I assumed an expression asludicrous and deluded as can be:[img/page0610_0000.svg][img/page0610_0001.svg][img/page0610_0002.svg][img/page0610_0003.svg][img/page0610_0004.svg][img/page0610_0005.svg][img/img0006.jpg]I developed into an incredible opera: I came to see that all beings feel aninvincible necessity for happiness; that action is not life, but a way of makinga mess of some force, an enervation. Morality is cerebral weakness.It seemed to me that to every being several other lives were due. This mandoesn't know what he is doing: he is an angel. That family is a litter of dogs.In the presence of several men I conversed aloud with a moment of their otherlives. And thus I loved a pig.None of the sophisms of insanity - the insanity which is put under restraint -have been forgotten by me. I can repeat them all. I possess the system.My health was threatened. Terror set in. I fell into slumbers lasting severaldays, and continued the saddest dreams on rising. I was ripe for death, andalong the road full of dangers, weakness led me to the boundaries of the worldand the Cimmerian land of darkness and whirlwinds.To divert the enchantments which had settled on my brain, travel was obligatory.And on the sea, which I loved as though it might cleanse me of defilement, theconsolatory cross arose before my eyes. I had been damned by the rainbow.Happiness was my fatality, my remorse, my torment: my life would ever be tooimmense to be devoted to strength and beauty.Happiness! Its tooth, sweet at the point of death, warned me by the crowing ofthe cock - ad matutinum, to Christus venit - in the darkest cities:[img/page0612_0000.svg][img/page0612_0001.svg][img/page0612_0002.svg][img/page0612_0003.svg][img/page0612_0004.svg][img/page0612_0005.svg][img/page0613_0000.svg][img/page0613_0001.svg]That is all over now. The power to greet beauty is now within my ken.FROM PETIT POEMES EN PROSECHARLES BAUDELAIRETHE TEMPTATIONS, OR EROS AND PLUTO AND GLORYTwo superb Satans and a She-Devil, not less extraordinary, mounted last nightthe mysterious staircase by which Hell assaults man's weakness when he sleeps,and communicates with him secretly. So they came and posed before me gloriouslyupright as if on a platform. A sulphurous splendour emanated from these threepersonages who detached themselves against the opaque darkness of the night.They looked so proud and so full of domination, that at first sight I took thethree of them for real Gods.The face of the first Satan was of an ambiguous sex; he had also, in the linesof his body, the softness of the ancient Bacchus. His large languishing eyes,whose colour was tenebrous and uncertain, were like scented violets still wetwith the rain of the storm, and his half-opened lips were like warm perfumeboxes - from which exhaled strange odours; and whenever he sighed, musty insectstook fire, as they flew from the ardours of his breath.Around his purple tunic was corded, like a girdle, a caressing serpent who, withlifted head, turned languorously towards him his eyes that were like livingembers. To this living girdle were suspended, alternating with phials withsinister liquours, shining knives and surgical instruments. In his right hand heheld another phial which contained something luminously red, and which had forlabel these bizarre words: \"Drink, this is my blood, a perfect cordial.\" In theleft hand he held a violin which one supposes served him as an instrument onwhose strings he could make vibrate his sorrows and his pleasures, and so spreadabroad the contagion of his folly over midnight Sabbats. Around his delicateankles trailed several rings of a broken chain of gold, and when the troublewhich came from them made him lower his eyes, he gazed with intense vanity onthe nails of his feet, brilliant and polished like precious stones. He gazed onme with his inconsolably broken-hearted eyes from which flowed an insidiousintoxication, and he said to me in a singing voice: \"If you desire, I can makeyou lord of souls, and you shall be the master of living matter, even more thanthe sculptor can be with his beings of clay: and you shall know the pleasure,forever reborn, of escaping yourself so as to forget yourself in others, and toattract other souls until they are conjoint with you.\"And I answered him: \"Many thanks, but I don't know what I would do with thisprecious pack of beings who, no doubt, are of no more value than my own littleself. In spite of the fact that I have some shame in remembering myself, I don'twant to forget anything. And even if I couldn't recognize you, old monster, yourmysterious cutlery, equivocal phials, and the chains around your feet, aresymbols which explain clearly enough the inconveniences of your friendship.Please keep your presents.\"The second Satan had none of this tragic and smiling aspect, none of this fineinsinuating manner, none of this delicate and precious beauty. He was large,with a fat, eyeless head, and his heavy stomach weighed down his thights. Everyinch of his skin was gilded and illuminated, as if it were tattooed, with acrowd of moving figures representing the myriad forms of universal misery. Therewere little emaciated men who were writhing, suspended from a nail. Deformedgnomes with supplicating eyes asked for alms with outstretched hands. There wereeven little mothers, who wore round their waists the remnants of abortions. Andthese were not all.The big Satan patted his enormous belly, and from it echoed a long, rattlingclick of metal, which ended with the sob of a chorus of human voices. Helaughed, and displayed his broken teeth, and his laughter was like thecomplacent chuckle of well-off men who have dined too richly.This Satan said to me: \"I can give you that which obtains all, that which isworth all, that which replaces all.\" And he tapped again on his immense gullet,and a rumbling echo made up the commentary to his impudent words.I turned from him in disgust, saying: \"I have no need for my own enjoyment, orfor anyone else's misery, and I certainly don't want the kind of riches thatafflict one with all the horrors displayed, like tasteless wallpaper, on yourcorpulent flesh.\"As for the She-Devil, I would be dishonest if I didn't admit that at first sightI found her a fetching creature, redolent of a bizarre charm. As for definingthis appeal, I can't compare it with anything better than that of very beautifulwomen who are on the wane, those who never seem to age, yet whose beauty is likethe enchanting magic of ruins. Her hair was imperious and disjointed, and hereyes, though tired, emanated a powerful fascination. What struck me most was themystery of her voice, in which I found the sound of a delicious contralticombined with the husky rumble of one who has enjoyed too fully the pleasures ofdrinking brandy.\"Do you want to know my power?\" said this Goddess with her charming andparadoxical voice. \"Listen.\" She took a gigantic trumpet, decorated like a reedpipe with the names of all the newspapers in the world, and putting it to herlips, she blared out my name. It rolled across the universe like the roar of athousand waterfalls, and reverberated back to me after returning from the mostdistant planets.\"The Devil!\" I cried, half in her power. \"That's what's precious!\" But, afterexaming more attentively the seductive virago, it seemed to me that I recognizedher after all. Yes, that's it - I had seen her in a compromising situation withsome knaves of my acquaintance, and the memory of that liason brought to mindthe atmosphere of a shop worn prostitute.So I answered resolutely \"Get thee behind me. I'm not one to take as wife themistress ofdullards I'd rather not remember.\"I had every reason to be proud of my courage, integrity and fortitude. But soonafter, I sadly awoke, and all my strength drained away. \"In truth,\" I said tomyself,\" I must have been dreaming to have shown such scruples. Now, if onlythey'd return when I am wide awake! Well, that would be a different story!\"I invoked them with ardour, begging their forgiveness, and assuring them that Iwould dishonour myself as often as possible, in order to warrant their return.But no luck. I hadn't the faintest doubt that I offended them, for they neverreturned.FROM LESFLEURS DU MAL (THE FLOWERS OF EVIL)CHARLES BAUDELAIRECORRESPONDANCES[img/page0620_0000.svg][img/page0620_0001.svg][img/page0620_0002.svg]A PAST LIFE[img/page0620_0003.svg][img/page0620_0004.svg][img/page0621_0000.svg][img/page0621_0001.svg]LITANY TO SATANCHARLES BAUDELAIRE[img/page0622_0000.svg][img/page0622_0001.svg][img/page0622_0002.svg][img/page0622_0003.svg][img/page0622_0004.svg][img/page0622_0005.svg][img/page0622_0006.svg][img/page0622_0007.svg][img/page0622_0008.svg][img/page0623_0000.svg][img/page0623_0001.svg][img/page0623_0002.svg][img/page0623_0003.svg][img/page0623_0004.svg]PRAYER[img/page0623_0005.svg]FROM COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESSR. M. BUCKEIWhat is Cosmic Consciousness? The present volume is an attempt to answer thisquestion; but notwithstanding it seems well to make a short prefatory statementin as plain language as possible so as to open the door, as it were, for themore elaborate exposition to be attempted in the body of the work. CosmicConsciousness, then, is a higher form of consciousness than that possessed bythe ordinary man. This last is called Self Consciousness and is that facultyupon which rests all of our life (both subjective and objective) which is notcommon to us and the higher animals, except that small part of it which isderived from the few individuals who have had the higher consciousness abovenamed. To make the matter clear it must be understood that there are three formsor grades of consciousness. (1) Simple Consciousness, which is possessed by saythe upper half of the animal kingdom. By means of this faculty a dog or a horseis just as conscious of the things about him as a man is; he is also consciousof his own limbs and body and he knows that these are a part of himself. (2)Over and above this Simple Consciousness, which is possessed by man as byanimals, man has another which is called Self Consciousness. By virtue of thisfaculty man is not only conscious of trees, rocks, waters, his own limbs andbody, but he becomes conscious of himself as a distinct entity apart from allthe rest of the universe. It is as good as certain that no animal can realizehimself in that way. Further, by means of self consciousness, man (who knows asthe animal knows) becomes capable of treating his own mental states as objectsof consciousness. The animal is, as it were, immersed in his consciousness as afish in the sea; he cannot, even in imagination, get outside of it for onemoment so as to realize it. But man by virtue of self consciousness can stepaside, as it were, from himself and think: \"Yes, that thought that I had aboutthat matter is true; I know it is true and I know that I know it is true.\" Thewriter has been asked: \"How do you know that animals cannot think in the samemanner?\" The answer is simple and conclusive - it is: There is no evidence thatany animal can so think, but if they could we should soon know it. Between twocreatures living together, as dogs or horses and men, and each self conscious,it would be the simplest matter in the world to open up communication. Even asit is, diverse as is our psychology, we do, by watching his acts, enter into thedog's mind pretty freely - we see what is going on there - we know that the dogsees and hears, smells and tastes - we know that he has intelligence - adaptsmeans to ends - that he reasons. If he was self conscious we must have learnedit long ago. We have not learned it and it is as good as certain that no dog,horse, elephant or ape ever was self conscious. Another thing: on man's selfconsciousness is built everything in and about us distinctively human. Languageis the objective of which self consciousness is the subjective. Selfconsciousness and language (two in one, for they are two halves of the samething) are the sine qua non of human social life, of manners, of institutions,of industries of all kinds, of all arts useful and fine. If any animal possessedself consciousness it seems certain that it would upon that master faculty build(as man has done) a superstructure of language; of reasoned out customs,industries, art. But no animal has done this, therefore we infer that no animalhas self consciousness.The possession of self consciousness and language (its other self) by mancreates an enormous gap between him and the highest creature possessing simpleconsciousness merely.Cosmic Consciousness is a third form which is as far above Self Consciousness asis that above Simple Consciousness. With this form, of course, both simple andself consciousness persist (as simple consciousness persists when selfconsciousness is acquired), but added to them is the new faculty so often namedand to be named in this volume. The prime characteristic of cosmic consciousnessis, as its name implies, a con sciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the lifeand order of the universe. What these words mean cannot be touched upon here; itis the business of this volume to throw some light upon them. There are manyelements belonging to the cosmic sense besides the central fact just alluded to.Of these a few may be mentioned. Along with the consciousness of the cosmosthere occurs an intellectual enlightenment or illumination which alone wouldplace the individual on a new plane of existence - would make him almost amember of a new species. To this is added a state of moral exaltation, anindescribable feeling of elevation, elation, and joyousness, and a quickening ofthe moral sense, which is fully as striking and more important both to theindividual and to the race than is the enhanced intellectual power. With thesecome, what may be called a sense of immortality, a consciousness of eternallife, not a conviction that he shall have this, but the consciousness that hehas it already.Only a personal experience of it, or a prolonged study of men who have passedinto the new life, will enable us to realize what this actually is; but it hasseemed to the present writer that to pass in review, even briefly andimperfectly, instances in which the condition in question has existed would beworth while. He expects his work to be useful in two ways: First, in broadeningthe general view of human life by comprehending in our mental vision thisimportant phase of it, and by enabling us to realize, in some measure, the truestatus of certain men who, down to the present, are either exalted, by theaverage self conscious individual, to the rank of gods, or, adopting the otherextreme, are adjudged insane. And in the second place he hopes to furnish aid tohis fellow men in a far more practical and important sense. The view he takes isthat our descendants will sooner or later reach, as a race, the condition ofcosmic consciousness, just as, long ago, our ancestors passed from simple toself consciousness. He believes that this step in evolution is even now beingmade, since it is clear to him both that men with the faculty in question arebecoming more and more common and also that as a race we are approaching nearerand nearer to that stage of the self conscious mind from which the transition tothe cosmic conscious is effected. He realizes that, granted the necessaryheredity, any individual not already beyond the age may enter cosmicconsciousness. He knows that intelligent contact with cosmic conscious mindsassists self conscious individuals in the ascent to the higher plane. Hetherefore hopes, by bringing about, or at least facilitating this contact, toaid men and women in making the almost infinitely important step in question.FROM HYMNS TO THE NIGHTNOVALISBefore all the wondrous shows of the widespread space around him, what living,sentient thing loves not the alljoyous light, with its colours, its rays andundulations, its gentle omnipresence in the form of the wakening day? Thegiant-world of the unresting constellations inhales it as the innermost soul oflife, and floats dancing in its blue flood: the sparkling, ever-tranquil stone,the thoughtful, imbibing plant, and the wild, burning multiform beast inhalesit, but more than all, the lordly stranger with the sense-filled eyes, theswaying walk, and the sweetly closed, melodious lips. Like a king over earthlynature, it rouses every force to countless transformations, binds and unbindsinnumerable alliances, hangs its heavenly form around every earthly substance.Its presence alone reveals the marvellous splendour of the kingdoms of theworld.Aside I turn to the holy, unspeakable, mysterious night. Afar lies the world -sunk in a deep grave - waste and lonely is its place. In the chords of the bosomblows a deep sadness. I am ready to sink away in drops of dew, and mingle withthe ashes. The distances of memory, the wishes of youth, the dreams ofchildhood, the brief joys and vain hopes of a whole long life, arise in graygarments, like an evening vapour after the sunset. In other regions the lighthas pitched its joyous tents. What if it should never return to its children,who wait for it with the faith of innocence?What springs up all at once so sweetly boding in my heart, and stills the softair of sadness? Dost thou also take a pleasure in us, dark night? What holdestthou under thy mantle, that with hidden power affects my soul? Precious balmdrips from thy hand out of its bundle of poppies. Thou upliftest the heavy-ladenwings of the soul. Darkly and inexpressibly are we moved: joy-startled, I see agrave face that, tender and worshipful, inclines toward me, and, amid manifoldentangled locks, reveals the youthful loveliness of the mother. How poor andchildish a thing seems to me now the light, how joyous and welcome the departureof the day, because the night turns away from thee thy servants, you now strewin the gulfs of space those flashing globes, to proclaim thy omnipotence, thyreturn, in seasons of thy absence. More heavenly than those glittering stars wehold the eternal eyes which the night hath opened within us. Farther they seethan the palest of those countless hosts - needing no aid from the light, theypenetrate the depths of a loving soul - that fills a loftier region with blissineffable. Glory to the queen of the world, to the great prophet of the holierworlds, to the guardian of blissful love, she sends thee to me, thou tenderlybeloved, the gracious sun of the night, now am I awake for now am I thine andmine, thou hast made me know the night, made of me a man, consume withspirit-fire my body, that I, turned to finer air, may mingle more closely withthee, and then our bridal night endure forever.2Must the morning always return? Will the despotism of the earthly never cease?Unholy activity consumes the angel-visit of the night. Will the time never comewhen love's hidden sacrifice shall burn eternally? To the light a season wasset; but everlasting and boundless is the dominion of the night. Endless is theduration of sleep. Holy sleep, gladden not too seldom in this earthlyday-labour, the devoted servant of the night. Fools alone mistake thee, knowingnought of sleep but the shadow which, in the twilight of the real night, thoupitifully cast over us. They feel thee not in the golden flood of the grapes -in the magic oil of the almond tree - and the brown juice of the poppy. Theyknow not that it is thou who haunt the bosom of the tender maiden, and make aheaven of her lap; never suspect it is thou, opening the doors to Heaven, thatstep to meet them out of ancient stories, bearing the key to the dwellings ofthe blessed, silent messenger of secrets infinite.3Once when I was shedding bitter tears, when, dissolved in pain, my hope wasmelting away, and I stood alone by the barren mound which in its narrow darkbosom hid the vanished form of my life - lonely as never yet was lonely man,driven by anxiety unspeakable - powerless, and no longer anything but aconscious misery. As there I looked about me for help, unable to go on or toturn back, and clung to the fleeting, extinguished life with an endless longing:then, out of the blue distances, from the hills of my ancient bliss, came ashiver of twilight, and at once snapped the bond of birth, the chains of thelight. Away fled the glory of the world, and with it my mourning - the sadnessflowed together into a new, unfathomable world. Thou, night-inspiration,heavenly Slumber, didst come upon me, the region gently heaved up itself, overit hovered my unbound, newborn spirit. The mound became a cloud of dust andthrough the cloud I saw the glorified face of my beloved. In her eyes eternity.reposed. I laid hold of her hands, and the tears became a sparkling bond thatcould not be broken. Into the distance swept by, like a tempest, thousands ofyears. On her neck I welcomed the new life with ecstatic tears. It was thefirst, the only dream and just since then I have held fast an eternal,unchangeable faith in the heaven of the night, and its light, the beloved.4Now I know when will come the last morning: when the light no more scares awaynight and love: when sleep shall be without waking, and but one continuousdream. I feel in me a celestial exhaustion. Long and weariful was my pilgrimageto the holy grave, and crushing was the cross. The crystal wave, which,imperceptible to the ordinary sense, springs in the dark bosom of the moundagainst whose foot breaks the flood of the world, he who has tasted it, he whohas stood on the mountain frontier of the world, and looked across into the newland, into the abode of the night: truly he turns not again into the tumult ofthe world, into the land where dwells the light in ceaseless unrest.On those heights he builds for himself tabernacles, tabernacles of peace, andthere longs and loves and gazes across, until the most welcome of all hoursdraws him down into the waters of the spring. Afloat above remains what isearthly, and is swept back in storms, but what became holy by the touch of love,runs free through hidden ways to the region beyond, where, like fragrances, itmingles with love asleep.Still you wake, cheerful light, that weary man to his labour - and into me youpour joyous life - but thou wilest me not away from Memory's moss-grownmonument. Gladly will I stir busy hands, everywhere behold where thou hast needof me, praise the lustre of thy splendour, pursue unwearied the lovely harmoniesof thy skilled handicraft: gladly contemplate the clever pace of thy mighty,luminous clock, explore the balance of the forces and the laws of the wondrousplay of countless worlds and their seasons. But true to the night remains mysecret heart, and to creative love, her daughter. Canst thou show me a hearteternally true? has thy sun friendly eyes that know me? do thy stars lay hold ofmy longing hand? and return me the tender pressure and the caressing word? wasit thou did adorn them with colours and a flickering outline, or was it she whogave to thy jewels a higher, a dearer weight? What delight, what pleasure offersthy life, to outweigh the transports of death? Wears not everything thatinspires us the colour of the Night? She sustains thee mother-like, and to heryou owe all *thy glory. Thou wouldst vanish into thyself, in boundless spacethou wouldst dissolve, if she did not hold thee fast, if she swaddled thee not,so that thou grew warm, and flaming, begot the universe. Truly I was, before youwere - the mother sent me with my brothers and sisters to inhabit thy world, tohallow it with love that it might be an ever-present memorial - to plant it withflowers unfading. As yet they have not ripened, these thoughts divine, as yet isthere small trace of our coming revelation. One day thy clock will point to theend of time, and then thou shall be as one of us, and shall, full of ardentlonging, be extinguished and die. I feel in me the close of thy activity,heavenly freedom, and blessed return. With wild pangs I recognize thy distancefrom our home, thy resistance against the ancient, glorious heaven. Thy rage andthy raving are in vain. Unscorchable stands the cross: victory-banner of ourbreed.[img/page0637_0000.svg]5In ancient times, over the widespread families of men an iron fate ruled withdumb force. A gloomy oppression swathed their heavy souls - the earth wasboundless - the abode of the gods and their home. From eternal ages stood itsmysterious structure. Beyond the red hills of the morning, in the sacred bosomof the sea, dwelt the sun, the all-enkindling, living light. An aged giant heldup the blissful world. Fast beneath mountains lay the first-born sons of motherearth. Helpless in their destroying fury against the new, glorious race of gods,and their kindred, glad-hearted men. The ocean's dark green abyss was the lap ofa goddess. In crystal grottos revelled a luxuriant folk. Rivers, trees, flowers,and beasts had human wits. Sweeter tasted the wine poured out by youthabundance,a god in the grape-clusters, a loving, motherly goddess grew in the full goldensheaves, love's sacred inebriation was a sweet worship of the fairest of thegod-ladies. Life rustled through the centuries like one spring-time, anevervariegated festival of heaven-children and earth-dwellers. All raceschildlike adored the ethereal, thousand-fold flame as the one sublime thing inthe world. There was but one notion, a horrible dream-shape:[img/page0638_0000.svg][img/page0638_0001.svg][img/page0639_0000.svg][img/page0639_0001.svg]The old world began to decline. The pleasure-garden of the young race witheredaway, up into more open, desolate regions, forsaking his childhood, struggledthe growing man. The gods vanished with their retinue. Nature stood alone andlifeless. Dry number and rigid measure bound it with iron chains. Into dust andair the priceless blossoms of life fell away in words obscure. Gone waswonder-working faith, and its alltransforming, all-uniting angel-comrade, theimagination. A cold north wind blew unkindly over the rigid plain, and the rigidwonderland first froze, then evaporated into ether. The far depths of heavenfilled with glowing worlds. Into the deeper sanctuary, into the more exaltedregion of feeling, the soul of the world retired with all its earthly powers,there to rule until the dawn should break of universal glory. No longer was thelight the abode of the gods, and the heavenly token of their presence: they drewover themselves the veil of the night. The night became the mighty womb ofrevelations, into it the gods went back and fell asleep, to go abroad in new andmore glorious shapes over the transfigured world. Among the people who too earlywere become of all the most scornful and insolently estranged from the blessedinnocence of youth, appeared the new world with a face never seen before- in thepoverty of a poetic shelter - a son of the first virgin and mother - the eternalfruit of mysterious embrace. The foreboding, rich-blossoming wisdom of the eastat once recognized the beginning of the new age. A star showed the way to thehumble cradle of the king. In the name of the distant future, they did himhomage with lustre and fragrance, the highest wonders of nature. In solitude theheavenly heart unfolded to a flower-chalice of almighty love upturned toward thesupreme face of the father, and resting on the blissforeboding bosom of thesweetly solemn mother. With deifying fervour the prophetic eye of the bloomingchild beheld the years to come, foresaw, untroubled over the earthly lot of hisown days, the beloved offspring of his divine stem. Ere long the most childlikesouls, by true love marvellously possessed, gathered about him. Like flowerssprang up a strange new life in his presence. Words inexhaustible and the mostjoyful tidings fell like sparks of a divine spirit from his friendly lips. Froma far shore, born under the clear sky of Hellas, came a singer to Palestine, andgave up his whole heart to the wonder-child:[img/page0641_0000.svg]Filled with joy, the singer went on to Hindustan, his heart intoxicated with thesweetest love, and poured it out in fiery songs under the balmy sky, so that athousand hearts bowed to him, and the good news sprang up with a thousandbranches. Soon after the singer's departure, his precious life was made asacrifice for the deep fall of man. He died in his youth, torn away from hisbeloved world, from his weeping mother, and his trembling friends. His lovelymouth emptied the dark cup of unspeakable woes, in ghastly fear the birth of thenew world drew near. Hard he wrestled with the terrors of old death. Heavy laythe weight of the old world upon him. Yet once more he looked fondly at hismother, then came the releasing hand of eternal love, and he fell asleep. Only afew days hung a deep veil over the roaring sea, over the quaking land -countless tears wept his loved ones - the mystery was unsealed - heavenlyspirits heaved the ancient stone from the gloomy grave. Angels sat by thesleeper, delicately shaped from his dreams, awoken in new godlike glory; heclimbed the limits of the new-born world, buried with his own hand the oldcorpse in the abandoned hollow, and with a hand almighty laid upon it a stonewhich no power shall ever again raise.Yet weep thy loved ones tears of joy, tears of feeling and endless thanksgivingover your grave - joyously startled, they see thee rise again, and themselveswith thee - behold thee weep with sweet fervour on the blessed bosom of thymother, solemnly walking with thy friends, uttering words plucked as from thetree of life; see thee hasten, full of longing, into thy father's arms, bearingwith thee youthful humanity, and the inexhaustible cup of the golden future.Soon the mother hastened after thee in heavenly triumph; she was the first withthee in the new home. Since then, long ages have flowed past, and inever-increasing splendour have stirred your new creation, and thousands have,away from pangs and tortures, followed thee, filled with faith and longing andfidelity, walking about with thee and the heavenly virgin in the kingdom oflove,serving in the temple of heavenly Death, and forever thine.[img/page0643_0000.svg][img/page0643_0001.svg][img/page0644_0000.svg][img/page0644_0001.svg][img/page0644_0002.svg][img/page0644_0003.svg][img/page0644_0004.svg][img/page0645_0000.svg]6LONGING FOR DEATH[img/page0645_0001.svg][img/page0645_0002.svg][img/page0645_0003.svg][img/page0645_0004.svg][img/page0646_0000.svg][img/page0646_0001.svg][img/page0646_0002.svg][img/page0646_0003.svg][img/page0646_0004.svg][img/page0646_0005.svg]"},{"pageContent":"SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHYArmory, Mark, Biography of Lord Dunsany (London: Collins, 1972)Ashley, Mike, Starlight Man: The Extraordinary Life of Algernon Blackwood(London: Constable, 2001)Baldick, Robert, The Life ofJ.K.
