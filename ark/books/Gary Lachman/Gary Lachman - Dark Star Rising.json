Occult means “hidden” andesoteric means “inner,” and in general both refer to aspects of reality that insome way exceed our standard, rational, scientific way of looking at things,what we can loosely call the “magical.” While mainstream science generally wantsto debunk such notions, declaring them superstitious and absurd, they persist,and as I have tried to show in other books, they have formed a kind ofcountertradition of “rejected knowledge” that has informed Western culture andits history practically since they began.1 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber0]One aim of my book Politics and the Occult was to show that while the popularview, promoted by writers like Umberto Eco, is that any kind of “occultpolitics” was distinctly on the right side of the political spectrum, this wasnot really the case.2 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber1] I argued that, on thecontrary, there was a “progressive” occult politics too, whose influence onhistory could be found if we looked for it. It could be found, for example, inpeople and movements like the Rosicrucians of seventeenth-century Germany andthe influence the Theosophists Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and Annie Besant had onIndia gaining independence from the British Raj.Blavatsky is a good example of the bad reputation the occult has when it comesto politics. As author of the esoteric classic The Secret Doctrine, an immenseoccult history of mankind and the universe, she is often tagged as the sourcefor the theories that, through their misappropriation by Aryan supremacistthinkers, fed the odious racial ideas of National Socialism. What is less oftenpointed out is that one of the most important influences on Mahatma Gandhi washis meeting with Blavatsky not long before her death and his introduction to theHindu spiritual scripture the Bhagavad Gita by some Theosophist friends. As Ishow in my book about Blavatsky, the Gita became the most important book inGandhi’s life and until his death he was thankful to Theosophy for hisintroduction to it. Even on the very day he was assassinated he wroteapprovingly of Theosophy in his journal Harijan.3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber2] This alone should suggest that a view of occultpolitics that places it solely on the right is inaccurate.I still believe this is the case, and that a view of the occult thatautomatically links it to the political right wing is inadequate, presentingonly half the picture. But this book will be different. Unlike Politics and theOccult it will focus on the link between the occult and far-right politics, notin the past but in the present, that is, today. Why is such a book needed, whenI have gone out of my way to argue that occult politics should not beimmediately shunted over to the far-right side of the political spectrum?Because in recent times it seems that the occult has entered politics again, andby most accounts it has not been invited in by the left.Why do I say this? The pages that follow will, with any luck, present theevidence for what seems to be a new incursion of far-right occultism into thecontemporary political landscape. But perhaps the best way to introduce thisdevelopment is by explaining how I first came across it. It came, as most thingsdo these days, through social media.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ON FACEBOOK ONE afternoon, I came across something that Harvey Bishop, the NewThought blogger, had posted. New Thought, as readers may know, is a generic namefor a variety of different beliefs, philosophies, and practices that have astheir central theme the idea that the mind can influence reality directly, thatthrough mental effort alone we can “make things happen.” Starting in its presentform in the early twentieth century, it has had many revivals and is by now insome version a mainstay of New Age and spiritual belief. Some readers may beaware of New Thought through Rhonda Byrne’s The Secret, a bestselling book andfilm of some years back. As Mental Science, Science of Mind, and other names,New Thought teaches methods of visualization and creative imagination, throughwhich one can envision a future reality and make it come true. Imagined withenough will, persistence, and commitment, the envisioned future will, itaffirms, come about.Bishop and other New Thought practitioners emphasize the positive aspects of NewThought and its links to spirituality. Indeed, one of its most popular claims isthat through the “power of positive thinking”—the title of an immenselysuccessful book about New Thought—one can achieve one’s aims, accomplish one’sgoals, and in general secure a good and fulfilled life. But Bishop’s post wasnot about this. It concerned something much darker.One of the most disturbing aftereffects of billionaire Donald Trump’s victory inthe November 2016 United States presidential contest occurred at the annualmeeting of the National Policy Institute, held in the Ronald Reagan Building,not far from the White House, shortly after the election. “National PolicyInstitute” seems an innocuous name for what many believe is a white nationalistorganization.4 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber3] Trump’s ascendancy has been seenby the far right—in the United States and also in Europe—as a sign that liberaldominance was over and that it was their turn in power. During Trump’s campaigna loosely connected new far-right movement emerged on the internet, christenedby the National Policy Institute’s leader, Richard Spencer, as the “alternativeright,” or “alt-right,” to differentiate it from its unsophisticatedpredecessors. Delighted by Trump’s victory, Spencer greeted the NPI meeting witha chilling cheer, which was received with an even more ominous response. AsSpencer declaimed, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail our victory!” the crowdresponded with enthusiastic applause and not a few Hitler salutes—or, as Spencerlater explained, Roman ones.5 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber4] What is moredisturbing is that Spencer and his followers took credit for Trump’s victory. Hecalled it “a victory of the will,” and declared, “We willed Donald Trump intooffice, we made this dream our reality.”6 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber5]As Bishop pointed out, making dreams a reality is a central aim of New Thought.It takes an ardent wish and, through the power of willed intention, materializesit. In his post Bishop expressed concern that Spencer and his followers may havetaken a leaf from New Thought’s book and turned the power of positive thinkingto something that Bishop, and many others, did not consider very positive.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •EXACTLY HOW SPENCER and the alt-right “dreamed” Trump into office—if indeed theydid—will be examined further on. Here I can say that it seems to have involvedwhat is known as “meme magic.” Meme is a term that comes from the biologistRichard Dawkins, of “selfish gene” fame, who argued that memes serve the samefunction in culture as genes do in organisms. Memes are ideas, behaviors,styles, images, symbols, slogans, or any other cultural development that can betransmitted to and imitated by others. Memes are flexible and are influenced bytheir transmission, rather like a game of “Chinese whispers” or “telephone,” inwhich a message gets distorted as it is whispered from one person to another,and in the end winds up very different from how it began. When Dawkins firstcoined the term back in 1989, the main media for the dispersal of memes werebooks, art, music, television, and films—old-school stuff. Today they spreadthrough the internet, rather like the similarly biologically rooted idea of“computer viruses.”The “magic” end of meme magic comes from its link to what is known as “chaosmagick.” What chaos magick is—it adopts the spelling favored by AleisterCrowley, the most famous magician of the twentieth century—will be explainedfurther on. For now we can say that rather than stick to the spells, grimoires,rituals, ceremonies, and symbols of traditional magic, it prefers a“do-it-yourself” creative approach that favors the magician’s personalinitiative and imagination, his ability, that is, to make it up as he goesalong. Rather than fuss over wands and bells and incense, and getting the nameof that particular demon just right, the chaos magician uses whatever is athand. For today’s chaos magician, this means the memes that are propagatedacross the internet.For chaos magicians and many other contemporary occultists, the internet servesthe same purpose that the “astral plane” does for traditional magicians, as akind of psychic ether that can transmit their willed intentions. Meme magichappens when something created on the internet bleeds into the “real world” andchanges it. In effect it is a kind of induced “synchronicity,” the psychologistC. G. Jung’s term for the phenomenon of “meaningful coincidence,” when what ishappening in our inner world happens in our outer one too, without any apparentcausal relation. If you substitute “internet” for “inner world” you can see theconnection.When it comes to the alt-right “magicians” who willed and dreamed Trump into theWhite House, the meme in question is a frog who goes by the name of Pepe. Thismay sound a bit confusing, but then the magick we are considering is interestedin chaos after all.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •NOW, IF ALL of this were limited to a small group of far-right enthusiasts whoin their excitement over a Trump victory let ideas about the power of positivethinking go to their heads, we could safely relegate it to the lunatic fringealong with believers in a flat earth, fake moon landings, and otherconspiracies. But that would be leaving out a key ingredient to the story. Thepresident that Spencer and Co. believed they willed into office was, as I said,Donald Trump.It is no secret that Trump himself is a keen believer in and promoter ofconspiracy theories, with his advocacy of the birther myth, his acceptance of“chemtrails,” and many other equally dubious propositions. What has also comeout is that Trump himself is a devotee of “positive thinking.” As he himselfsaid, he is the “greatest student” of the man who popularized the phrase, theReverend Norman Vincent Peale. Peale’s book The Power of Positive Thinking, asmentioned earlier, appeared in 1952 and was an immediate success, appropriatefor a book that told its readers how they too could succeed in life. From Peale,Trump learned the great secret, that “the mind can overcome any obstacle.”7[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber6] It seems that the president the alt-right“willed” into office through the power of positive thinking does quite a lot ofpositive thinking himself.Yet what is also strange about this very strange development is that Trump seemsto be something of a “natural” chaos magician too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ONE THING THAT came through during Trump’s campaign, and which was made evenclearer during the first months of his presidency, was that Trump did notoperate as other politicians did. Many say this is what attracted voters to him.Opponents of Hillary Clinton’s bid for the White House complained that with her,it would be “business as usual,” meaning the standard bureaucracy and all thatcame with it would remain solidly in place. Trump said that with him, it wouldnot be business as usual, and he was right. If one word captures for many thecharacter of Trump’s time in office so far, it would have to be “chaos.”8[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber7] Yet while many believe the random, “nonlinear,”contradictory, and frankly confusing atmosphere that has accompanied Trump’stime in office suggests a president out of control, a look at his previouscareer suggests something different.“I play it very loose,” Trump admits in his self-help book The Art of the Deal,a work from beginning to end full of positive thinking. “You can’t beimaginative and entrepreneurial if you’ve got too much structure. I prefer tocome to work each day and just see what develops.”9[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber8] “Sometimes it pays to be a little wild,” Trumpconfesses. He is always confident of success, but if situations seem to poseproblems, he will take his chances and rely on his chutzpah. He’ll “wing it andthings will work out.”10 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber9]Trump’s faith in his instincts and his ability to “move quickly and decisivelywhen the time is right” go hand in hand with his perception of the fundamentallyfluid nature of things, their volatile character, an insight that reaches backto the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus and which informs recentdevelopments in science, like chaos theory. It also provides the basis for chaosmagick.11 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber10] “Anything can change, withoutwarning,” Trump believes. “And that’s why I try not to take any of what’shappening too seriously.”12 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber11]That Trump does not take things too seriously can be gleaned from his manygnomic late-night tweets and non sequitur–style interviews, which if nothingelse reveal a flexible view of things like “truth” and “reality.” If, as onechaos magician tells us, for chaos magick “reality becomes a playground,” amake-believe world “chaoticians” temporarily take for real, Trump’s oftenoutrageous pronouncements give the impression that for him reality is a kind ofplayground too. Yet what is also interesting is that like New Thought, chaosmagick is interested in results, in “making things happen.” It pursues “visibleresults by which the magician demonstrates to himself that he can do thingswhich, a short while ago, never entered his mind as possibilities.”13[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber12] Getting a candidate into office might be one ofthose things. This is called “shifting the boundary of Achievable Reality,”which seems another way of expressing the desire to create reality itself.Another characteristic that Trump seems to share with chaos magick is that he isa product of postmodernism. He is, in fact, the first “postmodern president,” inthe same way that chaos magick is a kind of “postmodern occultism.”14[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber13]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •POSTMODERNISM IS A philosophical perspective that developed in the latetwentieth century, having its sources in earlier philosophers such as FriedrichNietzsche and Martin Heidegger, both of whom cut away at the notion of a stable,“objective” truth, the kind we use in everyday life and in science. Simply put,the essence of postmodernism—although it would deny that it has an “essence”—canbe summed up in the phrase “anything goes.” For postmodernism the kind ofscientific, rational certainties that built the modern world, as well astraditional values such as truth, no longer apply; at least they are seen to bemuch less certain than was believed. Well before it became a political buzzword,postmodernism knew all about being “post-truth,” and was aware of the“alternative facts” and “fake news” that accompany that condition. It could evenbe said that postmodernism and related schools like deconstructionism preparedthe ground for the epistemological skepticism pervading Western consciousnesstoday, which Trump both abets and profits by. Rarefied notions of a pliant,flexible, relative “truth” trickled down from the metaphysical heights, andinfected the popular mind with what the philosopher Paul Ricoeur called the“hermeneutics of suspicion,” a kind of cynical nihilism that we take for grantedas part of everyday life, and which Nietzsche, more than a century ago,predicted was on its way. Hence our conspiracy-ridden world, to which Trumphimself contributes. For postmodernism, the dictum “Nothing is true, everythingis permitted,” attributed to Hasan bin Sabbah, “the Old Man of the Mountain,”leader of the ancient Islamic sect of Ismailis called the Hashashin, orAssassins, is taken as given.15 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber14] The same goesfor chaos magick.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •AS I READ through the posts and newspaper articles that came in the wake ofTrump’s election, one stood out among the others as a clear indication that whatwe were engaged with was certainly not business as usual. One of the clearestsigns that with Trump’s election the political world had veered in a verystrange direction, taking the rest of us with it, was the report in The New YorkTimes that Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist and for a time a member of theNational Security Council, was a devotee of the twentieth-century Italianoccultist and esoteric philosopher Julius Evola.16[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber15] That The New York Times would mention Evola atall was surprising. That it did so in the context of the forty-fifth presidentof the United States was, I think, a game changer.“Baron” Julius Evola, author of books on the Holy Grail, alchemy, and otherarcane subjects, belongs to the school of esoteric philosophy known asTraditionalism. This began in the early twentieth century with the work of theFrench savant René Guénon. Traditionalism has influenced respected intellectualssuch as the historian of religion Mircea Eliade, the philosophers Huston Smithand Jacob Needleman, and the economist E. F. Schumacher, author of the classicSmall Is Beautiful. The central theme of Traditionalism is that a primordialrevelation of the truth about reality was given to mankind in ages past, fromwhich all the major religions have emerged. Since the golden age of that primalrevelation, mankind, at least in the West, has descended into decadence, our ownmodern age being the darkest and lowest stage of descent. As Guénon and Evolarepeatedly point out, we are in what the Hindu tradition calls the Kali Yuga, orwhat the ancient Greeks called the “Iron Age,” having got here after passingthrough the ages of gold, silver, and bronze.The modern world revolted Evola—Guénon had no time for it either—and he promotedhis own brand of militant Traditionalism in opposition to it. Since his death in1974, Evola’s “warrior”-style Traditionalism has informed some peculiar variantsof far-right politics, aimed at taking down the modern liberal civilization hedetested. Evola had an interesting career mixing esotericism with politics. Hetried to curry favor first with Mussolini, then with Hitler, and is enjoying aposthumous revival today with esoterically inclined readers who find themselveson the political right. With his forceful, articulate, intelligent writing andrefined, aristocratic image—photographs show him sporting a monocle—Evola iscelebrated by the alt-right as one of the “intellectuals” whose ideas make themdifferent from “old school racist skinheads.”17 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber16]As a wide-ranging esoteric scholar and practitioner, in the 1920s Evola editedan occult journal called UR, which focused on a number of magical themes. Evolacontributed many articles to UR, under several pseudonyms, and one of the themeshe came back to regularly was the magician’s ability to alter reality throughthe power of the mind alone, something we’ve seen that both New Thought andchaos magick are interested in. For Evola, the aim of the magician is to develophis own personal power, his will, which is a kind of force that he can exert inorder to refashion the world as he would like it.That Bannon, Trump’s close adviser, and the alt-right are readers of Evola iscurious enough. Things become even more curious when we recognize that it wasthrough the “platform” that Bannon provided for the alt-right during his time atthe ultraconservative website Breitbart.com that they were able to propagate thememe magic that Richard Spencer believed helped “will” Trump into office.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •AS I TRIED to assimilate this growing web of connections, strands of it radiatedout, linking it to other developments, leading into further strangeness. One ofthem headed east. I remembered some articles I had seen in Fortean Times not toolong ago, about the strange postmodern politics that the Russian presidentVladimir Putin had been presiding over for some time. The Russians are believedto have attempted to influence the U.S. presidential election via somecyber-sabotage, and by all accounts this is not just a paranoid idea. Afterlooking back at the articles and following them up with several hours on thenet, it struck me that Trump and the people around him were playing catch-upwith the kind of postmodern politics that Putin had been busy with for years.With Trump’s apparent close ties to Russia, he may even have gotten the ideafrom Putin. Where Trump seems to be putting on a kind of one-man show aimed atundermining the electorate’s sense of reality, Putin has had a team of“political technologists” busy at work, using a variety of media to create hisown reality, aimed at keeping his subjects entertained with electronic bread andcircuses and enthused with patriotic nationalist sentiments.18[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber17] And where Trump has Steve Bannon, whoname-checks Evola, to advise him, Putin has his very own Traditionalist onboard, the geopolitical savant Alexander Dugin.Dugin, who started out as a teenage Soviet dissident and is now part of theestablishment, is interested in Evola too. He seems a kind of ideologicalquick-change artist, adopting and discarding political ideologies—like NationalSocialism and fascism—and mixing them up in the same way that postmodernist artand architecture picks and chooses from an assortment of styles. Dugin has akind of Lego approach to ideologies, taking them apart and putting them togetherin different ways, adding a bit of Heidegger here and some Nietzsche there tosee what happens. This is also very much how chaos magicians make use ofbeliefs, not to be taken seriously but as “tools” to effect some outcome, and itcame as a kind of expected surprise when I learned that Dugin was keen on chaosmagick too. I say “expected surprise” because by this time in my journey downthese rabbit holes I had come to expect just about anything to turn up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ONE THING THAT did turn up was the European Union’s place in all this. Many sawBrexit, Great Britain’s exit from the EU, as the opening act for Trump’selection, and nationalists in the UK and Europe took it as a sign that the unionwas on its way out, something they looked forward to happily. As an Americanliving in London I could feel the rise of British nationalism, as did theEuropeans I knew who lived here as well. For many nationalists here and “on thecontinent,” the EU is an agent of globalization, which they see as a means bywhich the capitalist elite—mostly in America—will turn the world into a giantshopping mall, reducing the peoples of different backgrounds and cultures to thebland uniformity of consumers. Hence the rise in recent times of “identitypolitics,” which is driven not by ideology or economics, but by a fear of losingone’s national identity either through mass immigration or through globalconsumerism. Russia too was not happy with the EU (hence the business in Ukraineand the Crimea in 2014), and Dugin’s remarks about globalization are oftenlittle short of hysterical.After Trump’s “America First” inauguration speech, which spelled out anisolationist policy that seemed to put an end to America’s role as policeman ofthe world—although later developments indicated a change of mind—the EU was heldup by some as the last remnant of the New World Order that emerged after thechaos of World War II, and which had secured peace and stability in Europe sincethen. Something about this rang a bell and made me go back to Politics and theOccult.I recalled that I had written about something that seemed connected to thesedevelopments. When I found what I was looking for, I saw that I was right. Therewas reason to suspect that the EU itself had its roots in a kind of occultpolitics, in a strange esoteric sociopolitical movement called synarchy.Synarchy came to the world’s attention through the obscure writings of amysterious nineteenth-century French occultist named Alexandre Saint-Yvesd’Alveydre. Synarchy means “total government,” as opposed to anarchy, whichmeans “no government.” After a period of popularity in the years leading up toWorld War I, in the 1930s and ’40s a covert synarchic movement reached well intothe centers of French government, at least according to some reports. It mayeven have been the hidden hand behind a new “psychogeography” of Paris,responsible for the pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum and thestrange “stargate” at the towering Grande Arche de la Défense. Synarchy’s aimwas a kind of United States of Europe, and some of those who had written aboutit suggested that it was an echo of this idea—and perhaps more than an echo—thatlay at the foundation of the European Union.Synarchy was informed by the same vision of a primordial revelation that was atthe root of the Traditionalism that inspired Julius Evola, whose ideas werefinding a place for themselves where Evola always wanted them to, in thecorridors of power. One name that came up in the context of synarchy was that ofRené Schwaller de Lubicz, the maverick Egyptologist and esoteric philosopherwhose ideas about the true age of the Sphinx have, through bestselling authorslike Graham Hancock, inspired a whole genre of alternative “ancientcivilization” literature. In his early career Schwaller de Lubicz had moved inthe same Parisian occult circles that were familiar to Guénon and which had seenthe birth of both Traditionalism and synarchy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •FAR-RIGHT MAGICAL IDEAS at work in American and Russian politics? With anesoterically based European Union between them, the last redoubt of the by nowold New World Order, defiantly hanging on? I am not conspiracy minded, althoughconspiracy consciousness will play a large part in the account that follows. Butas I looked at all this and the other material that gathered around it, I beganto wonder. Are Order and Chaos gearing up for a magical battle that will changethe political landscape of the world? Is some kind of occult war on its way, orhas it already begun? Evola seemed to have thought so, and other esotericthinkers like Rudolf Steiner thought so too. Are the end times near?One may well ask, given that Steve Bannon and Alexander Dugin both haveapocalyptic visions of some coming decisive conflict and the ears of the men whocould make them a reality. This is a shuddering thought, given how accommodatingreality seems to have become in our “post-truth” times. If meme magick can putsomeone in the White House, what else can it do? Does positive thinking work?What part does it play in all of this? Which side is it on? And what can we doabout it?What follows is a kind of interim report on the occult politics at play in theworld today. Given that it concerns events that are still unfolding, much may bedifferent by the time it appears. Writing about contemporary events, one alwaysruns the risk of being out of date by the time one’s work reaches readers, andthe pace at which change takes place has in recent times accelerated. This isnot out of keeping with chaos magick and postmodernism. “We live in a world thatis rapidly changing,” writes one of chaos magick’s founders. This may bedisorienting for some, but chaos magicians are “profoundly at home in theaccelerating shift and fragmentation of daily life,” a sentiment shared bypostmodernists and by Trump.19 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber18] I have oftenfelt overwhelmed as new material came my way, sent to me by friends andcorrespondents, and links to one site and then another seemed to form an endlesschain. But at some point research must stop and a writer must put pixels on thescreen if he wants to get his message across.As my subtitle suggests, occult politics today have much to do with magick andpower. These are things of interest to both magicians and politicians. The twoseem unlikely neighbors, but they have more in common than we might think.Clearly one thing magicians and politicians are both interested in is power. Thepower of positive thinking, yes, but also the power over others.In some ways political leaders share some characteristics with gurus and otherspiritual leaders, and the difference between them and magicians is oftenblurred. Aleister Crowley, for example, was a magician and a guru teachingothers how to discover their “true will,” and he also tried to exert politicalinfluence. A guru holding sway over his disciples is doing on a smaller scalewhat a charismatic leader does with a nation. In both cases the power involvedcan get out of hand, bringing harm to both the guru and his disciples. On thelarger scale of politics it can lead to war and the destruction of nations. Whatis this strange need to lead, and the equally strange one to follow? What isthis will to power? Why do we pursue it? Must it always corrupt? Charismaticleaders cast a spell over their followers in the same way that a magician castsone over those he wants to enchant. The power of the image, of glamour, of one’sself-confidence, is at work in both—as it is in the confidence trickster. Themedium is the imagination, whether in its traditional forms or in its newelectronic version.If the imagination is simply about “make-believe,” an unreal substitute for anunwieldy reality, then we can take adequate steps to protect ourselves andignore “positive thinking” as a lot of nonsense. But what if reality is not sounwieldy, and imagination is about “making real,” as magicians have asserted forcenturies? What if positive thinking works?Politics and the occult may seem strange bedfellows. But in a post-truth worldwhat’s strange anymore? If reality today is up for grabs, shouldn’t we take holdof it before someone else does? Let us look out on the horizon, then, and seewhat dark stars are coming into view."},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]CHAPTER ONE“I’M A WINNER”BILLIONAIRE DONALD J. Trump’s victory in the November 2016 U.S. presidentialelection came as a surprise to many, but surely not to Trump. “I am a winner,”he said throughout his campaign, and it seems he was right. Winning is importantfor Trump; as more than one commentator has pointed out, it’s no exaggeration tosay that it is practically the only important thing for him. As he wrote in hisself-help book The Art of the Deal, designed to help its readers become winnerstoo, “I’m the first to admit that I am very competitive and that I’ll do nearlyanything within legal bounds to win.”1 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber19] Mostpeople who know Trump would agree with this self-assessment, although some mightsuspect that when necessary, he wouldn’t be averse to stretching the acceptableboundaries of achieving success just a bit.But business is one thing. Surely politics is another. Or is it? Trump’s victoryleft many reeling and set the political pundits pondering on the reasons for hisupset. Scrambling for answers, they looked to white middle-classdissatisfaction, Russian intervention, and Hillary Clinton’s bad reputation,among other things, for clues. But one sure contribution to Trump’s ascendancymust be his positive self-image, his certainty that, as he told his supportersover and over, he is a winner and that he will get what he wants. “People maynot always think big themselves,” Trump tells his readers, “but they can stillget very excited by those who do.”2 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber20]Trump is one of those who do. He thinks big. There is nothing small about him.3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber21] From Trump Tower to his aborted plans to buildthe largest building in the world to his massive Atlantic City casino,practically everything Trump turned his hand to was on a large scale, driven bya desire, with him from an early age, to “make a statement . . . to buildsomething monumental,” to take on what he called the “big challenge.”4[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber22]What accounts for this strident self-confidence, this unshakable assurance ofsuccess and driving need to stand out from the mediocre many? Narcissism,megalomania, egomania, selfishness, insensitivity to others, and otherpersonality traits have been offered as explanations for Trump’s unswervingoptimism and self-belief. To be sure, Trump’s psychological profile canaccommodate these characteristics and more; as I will try to show, he strikes meas an example of what the writer Colin Wilson called a “Right Man,” someone whounder no circumstances will admit to being wrong, and who will stop atpractically nothing to get his way.5 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber23] But in theflurry of news reports, articles, posts, and tweets that followed in the wake ofTrump’s victory, one possible reason that could account for Trump’s perpetuallyupbeat demeanor rose out of the mass of sound bites and caught my attention.According to some reports, Trump’s at times ruthless belief in his own powersand abilities may lie in his interest in an obscure and somewhat “magical”philosophy known as New Thought, Mental Science, or, as it is sometimes alsocalled, “the power of positive thinking.”Trump’s mentor in positive thinking was the man who popularized the phrase, theReverend Norman Vincent Peale. In 1952, Peale’s book The Power of PositiveThinking appeared and immediately became a success, spending ninety-eight weeksat the top of the New York Times bestseller list and making its author a wealthyman. It is still a healthy seller in the self-help and self-improvement market.Peale read earlier New Thought writers such as Ernest Holmes, Charles Fillmore,and Napoleon Hill and absorbed their fundamental insight, that the mind caninfluence reality directly, or, as its most basic formula has it, “thoughts arecausative.” This means that by merely thinking we can change the world aroundus. If that isn’t magical, I don’t know what is.Peale took this idea and, as the historian of New Thought Mitch Horowitz put it,“reprocessed mind-power teachings through scriptural language and lessons.”6[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber24] According to Peale, one could achieve bothspiritual and material success in life—he believed that contrary to much ancientwisdom the two are not mutually exclusive—and thinking positively was the way todo it. Trump started attending Peale’s sermons as a boy in the 1950s and he tookthis message to heart. Later he transferred it to the bank.Peale played a large role in Trump’s life. His parents attended Peale’s servicesat the Marble Collegiate Church on New York’s Fifth Avenue and Trump himself wasa familiar face among the parishioners there for more than fifty years. Trumpwas married to his first wife, Ivana Zelníčková, at the church, and rumor had itthat he met his second wife, the model Marla Maples, there too. Trump deniedthis but he did admit to seeing Marla at the services often. In any case, hismarriage to Marla was performed in the church by Peale’s successor, the ReverendArthur Caliandro.7 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber25]Peale’s doctrine of “positive thinking” appealed to Fred Trump, Donald’s father,another successful businessman, who said that there was “nobody else likePeale,” an estimate Donald agreed with. Trump admitted to two mentors in hislife: one was his father, the other was Peale.8 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber26]Given Trump’s great respect for his father, this was admiration indeed. Trumpcalled Peale “a great preacher and a great public speaker” and admitted thatafter hearing one of his sermons he could have “sat there for another hour.”What religious or spiritual import Trump absorbed from Peale’s sermons isdebatable, but Trump was clearly impressed by the Reverend’s “speaking ability”and “thought process.”9 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber27]What did Peale speak of? What were his thoughts about? Mainly about success, inthe world of the spirit, yes, but in the material one even more. As GwendaBlair, a biographer of the Trump family, said in a podcast, Trump’s obsessionwith winning may be rooted in the kind of this-worldly advice he absorbed atPeale’s sermons. The idea that winning was everything was brought home in thoseSunday services. “That’s a very Norman Vincent Peale notion,” Blair said, “thatnotion of success above all.”If Trump thought highly of Peale, the admiration was mutual. In 1983, tocongratulate him on the opening of Trump Tower, a fifty-eight-storymultimillion-dollar contribution to Manhattan’s skyline, Peale sent Trump a notepredicting that he would be “America’s greatest builder.” Peale was alwaysimpressed by successful people and effective self-promoters, and he was drawn toTrump after seeing him on television. What Peale may have thought of Trump’spolitical success is unknown—he died in 1993—but given that he backedRepublicans throughout his life we can imagine. Richard Nixon sought solace atPeale’s church after losing the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy, and was laterconsoled by Peale during the height of the Watergate scandal; Ronald Reagan wasa fan too. With Trump in the White House, the idea of being “America’s greatestbuilder” takes on a new meaning.Trump took Peale’s teachings as a kind of scripture and suggested that he wonthe approval of his mentor. “He thought I was his greatest student of all time,”Trump, no practitioner of false modesty, reported.10[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber28] Peale taught Trump to think only of the bestoutcomes—to, in the words of an old song, “accentuate the positive, andeliminate the negative.”11 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber29] “The mind,” Trumpbelieved, “can overcome any obstacle. I never think of the negative.”12[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber30] No wonder he’s convinced he’s a winner.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT IS EASY to see New Thought or “positive thinking” as a scam, a metaphysicalsnake oil sold to the losers in life’s scramble for success. Or as aself-serving religion to its winners, like Trump. Or, as Barbara Ehrenreichdoes, as a puritanical philosophy that denies valid cause for sorrow or sadnessand demands of its practitioners “perpetual effort and self-examination to thepoint of self-loathing,” not to mention cheerfulness on tap.13[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber31] But a closer look reveals something much moreinteresting.As mentioned, the philosophy of New Thought is based on the idea that the mindcan influence reality directly, that mental effort alone can make things happen.In all of its different versions, whether as Mental Science, Science of Mind,Creative Visualization, and others, it emphasizes the same idea. If we canimagine an outcome clearly enough, persistently enough, with enough confidenceand commitment, it will materialize. The mind, it affirms, can create reality.We need only believe firmly and it will be so.New Thought’s insistence on the power of the imagination to create reality seemsharmless, if absurd. Most of us accept that reality is not so accommodating andreject the idea outright. Experience, we say, tells us that it just can’t betrue. But the beliefs of New Thought are rooted in ancient occult ideas,insights into the magical nature of the mind and reality that informed thephilosophers of second-century Alexandria and the geniuses of the Renaissance,and which today are seen to be more and more in line with our understanding ofphysical reality at its most fundamental level.Ever since the rise of quantum physics, we’ve known, as the physicist WernerHeisenberg tells us, that the observer influences the observed. Around the sametime as the first forays into the quantum world were being made, in the earlytwentieth century, the philosopher Edmund Husserl came to a similar conclusion.Husserl’s fundamental insight, which informed later developments such asexistentialism, is that perception is intentional. That is, for Husserl,consciousness does not merely reflect a world that is already “there,” as amirror does, whether we want it to or not, but actively reaches out and “grabs”it, rather like a mental hand, and, as it were, molds it into shape.On a different track, a bit earlier than Husserl, and taking a hint from theGerman poet and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the esoteric teacherRudolf Steiner, most known today as the founder of Waldorf Education, arguedthat our minds are not mere witnesses but cocreators of the world around us. Andtoday, some of the most respected and successful people on the planet evensuggest that the entire world we know is really a kind of collective dream, asimulation, maintained by a secret elite, aware of reality’s plasticity andequipped with the knowledge and will to manipulate it—an idea that itself goesback to the beliefs of an ancient mystical sect known as the Gnostics.14[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber32]So if people adhering to the philosophy of New Thought, as Trump does, maintainthat the mind can create, alter, or affect reality, they seem to be in goodcompany.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT REALLY SHOULD be no surprise that a president who declared himself for“America first” should be a devotee of New Thought. The phrase “new thought”itself was coined by one of America’s greatest thinkers, the nineteenth-centurypoet, essayist, and orator Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson was the leader of aschool of philosophy known as Transcendentalism, which is a good candidate forthe first homegrown American intellectual movement. Another famousTranscendentalist was Henry David Thoreau, author of the classic Walden. In anessay aptly named “Success,” Emerson wrote: “To redeem defeat by new thought, byfirm action, that is not easy, that is the work of divine men.”15[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber33] The notion of success must have been importantto Emerson, as he also wrote a poem about it, although some believe the poemattributed to him was really written by Bessie Anderson Stanley.16[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber34] Either way, the kind of success the poem andEmerson’s essay aspire to is not the kind we associate with Trump, having moreto do with achieving a kind of inner harmony and leaving the world a betterplace than building monumental skyscrapers.Transcendentalism had its roots in German and English Romanticism, which itselfwas rooted in notions of the mind and its relation to reality associated with aschool of German philosophy known as Idealism. Rudolf Steiner, mentioned above,was deeply influenced by German Idealism. The two philosophers most associatedwith Idealism were Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.17[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber35]Idealism’s view of the world reached Emerson through English thinkers like thehistorian Thomas Carlyle and the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, both of whom werereaders of German metaphysics. The simplest way to understand Idealism is to saythat it is the polar opposite of the materialism that was the prevalent view ofreality in Emerson’s time and remains so today. That is to say, wherematerialism says that “matter,” the hard stuff of the physical world, is thefundamental truth about reality, Idealism says that what is “really real” is themind, consciousness, or spirit, and that the physical world is ultimately anexpression of this.Kant, for instance, believed that the physical world we see, the universe ofspace and time, is actually a product of our perceptual apparatus. For Kant ourminds somehow organize the raw data of reality into the world perceptible to oursenses. Kant did not mean, as some think he did, that we create the world out ofwhole cloth, that it is a pure fabrication. He is not saying that everything “isin our heads.” Such a route leads to solipsism, the belief that “you” are theonly thing that you can know, which leaves one in a kind of epistemologicalbubble, in touch with nothing else. There is a “real world” out there, but wenever see it as it is “in itself”—that is, as it appears when we are notperceiving it—but only as our minds deliver it to us. For Kant, it is throughthe mind’s action on the raw data of existence that anything like a “world”appears for us to experience. Hegel got over the hurdle of Kant’s verboten world“in itself” by saying that the entire universe, ourselves included, isparticipating in a vast process of evolution, in which Mind or Spirit, theultimate reality, comes to awareness of itself through human consciousness.There are other aspects of Idealism, and Edmund Husserl, mentioned earlier, wasa late exponent of it. The general idea is that for Idealism, the mind is notsome accidental passive product of a blind material universe—something manyscientists and philosophers persist in insisting on today—but is in fact incharge and at the center of things.Transcendentalism had roots in other schools of thought that emphasized the mindover matter. One was Hinduism, especially the spiritual scriptures of theUpanishads, which see the material world as a kind of illusion or dream called“Maya” from which our minds must awaken. Another was the teachings attributed tothe mythical founder of magic, Hermes Trismegistus, “thrice-greatest Hermes.” Asthe historian Frances Yates argued, the philosophers of second-centuryAlexandria and the geniuses of the Renaissance mentioned earlier were devoteesof the teachings of the thrice-greatest one.18 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber36]Emerson’s journals make more than one reference to Hermetic philosophy, whichhas come down to us in a collection of philosophical, mystical, and magicaltexts known as the Corpus Hermeticum. Central to Hermetic philosophy is thepower of imagination. In Book XI of the Corpus Hermeticum, Nous, or theUniversal Mind, tells Hermes that “within God everything lies in imagination.”He tells his awestruck student, who receives this revelation in a kind of wakingdream, that “if you do not make yourself equal to God you cannot understandhim.” Such is the power of the imagination that if Hermes were to command hissoul to go anywhere, Nous tells him, it would be there “quicker than yourcommand.” With imagination he can “grow to immeasurable size,” “be free fromevery body,” and “transcend all time.” And in a belief that will echo throughoutthe history of New Thought, Nous counsels Hermes to “Suppose nothing to beimpossible for yourself.”19 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber37]The educator Bronson Alcott, another leading Transcendentalist, introducedHermetic ideas to the Boston literary crowd at his salons in the early 1850s.One historian of esotericism has argued that Transcendentalism primed Americanot only for the Theosophical Society, which was founded in New York in 1875 byMadame Blavatsky, Colonel Henry Olcott, and William Quan Judge, but also for theNew Age, which has been with us since the 1970s.20[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber38] I should point out that Samuel TaylorColeridge, as mentioned an influence on Emerson, had ideas about the mind thatwere informed by Hermetic thought. For Coleridge, as for Hermes, the imaginationwas “a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in theinfinite I AM.”21 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber39] That is to say, for Coleridgeas for Hermes, the power with which God produced creation also resides in ourown minds.Another American intellectual giant was an enthusiastic advocate of NewThought.22 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber40] The philosopher and psychologistWilliam James had the same independent exploratory attitude as Emerson, and weshould remember that the essay, the literary form for which both Emerson andJames are famous, is an attempt at articulating something, a shot at trying itout. James certainly tried out a lot. He was interested in mystical experienceand to have one he inhaled nitrous oxide.23 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber41] Hewas interested in spiritualism and so attended séances. He was interested in“psychical research” and so investigated psychics.24[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber42] He was interested in religious experiences andwent through his own “dark night of the soul” and a kind of “conversion”experience through which he was convinced of the reality of free will.25[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber43] James believed that our attitudes and beliefsaffect our performance in the world. In “Is Life Worth Living?” he argues that afirm conviction of success is a deciding factor in whether we achieve a goal ornot, an example of what he called “the will to believe.”26[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44] He gives the example of having to jump across achasm from one cliff edge to the other. We have more of a chance of getting tothe other side, James argues, if we believe we can make it than if we think wecan’t.James was an exponent of Pragmatism, a hands-on, can-do American school ofphilosophy; his thinking aimed at getting what he called the “cash value” out ofbeliefs, an American ideal if there ever was one. What James meant by “cashvalue” and what Pragmatism in general focused on was how a belief affects ourexistence in the world, if it helps us in the struggle of life in some way. Thatis, its practical consequences. Although something of a simplification, forPragmatism what is true is what works.Among the many things that James tried were the various practices that in theearly twentieth century were referred to under the umbrella term “mind cure.”Under this rubric James placed readings from the gospels, Transcendentalism,Idealism, Spiritism, and the “optimistic evolutionism” of his day as sources ofinspiration.27 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45] But for James the “mostcharacteristic feature of the mind-cure movement was an inspiration moredirect.”28 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46] This was an “intuitive belief in theall-saving power of healthy-minded attitudes,” the “conquering efficiency ofcourage, hope, and trust.” Along with this came a “correlative contempt fordoubt, fear, and worry” and other “nervously precautionary states of mind.”29[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47] James recognized that much of the mind-cureliterature was so “moonstruck with optimism and so vaguely expressed” that mosteducated people would dismiss it, as they do today. But the results argued infavor of not rejecting wholesale America’s “only decidedly original contributionto the systematic philosophy of life.”30 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber48]And results there were. Armed with their belief in its efficacy, according toJames the blind have regained sight, the lame have walked, and invalids havediscovered new vitality, all through the power of New Thought.31[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber49] These were some of the practical results ofwhat James called “the philosophy of healthy-mindedness.” James was so convincedof their validity that he practiced this philosophy himself, resorting to aprogram of mind-cure treatments for angina, insomnia, depression, and otherailments.James was always fascinated by the untapped powers of the human mind. In “TheEnergies of Men” he argued that people “habitually use only a small part of thepowers they actually possess and which they might use under appropriateconditions.” “We live subject to arrest by degrees of fatigue which we have comeonly from habit to obey.” “There seems no doubt,” he wrote, “that we are eachand all of us to some extent victims of habit-neurosis.”32[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber50]For James the limits to our powers that we accept as “natural” or “normal” arenothing of the kind. They are merely “habits” of thought, and breaking thosehabits and developing new ones is the common aim of a variety of psychologicaland spiritual practices. If we altered these habits, James argued, we would beamazed at what we could do, in the same way that a successful chaos magician“demonstrates to himself that he can do things which, a short while ago, neverentered his mind as possibilities.” James was so convinced of the importance ofexploring the potentialities of mind-cure practices that when attempts were madeto minimize the availability of these ideas through state legislation, in orderto protect the public from supposed quacks and hucksters, he lobbiedsuccessfully in support of nontraditional medical practices.33[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber51]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •YET BEING ROOTED in the beliefs of two of the greatest American thinkers is notthe sole reason why New Thought is often considered a peculiarly American styleof thinking and why it has never caught on in Europe in quite the same way.34[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber52] It’s the success angle that does that. “Nothingsucceeds like success” may have been first written by an Englishman, but it isan American dictum through and through.35 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber53] Theimportance of thinking positively, of having a “can do” attitude and an“affirmative” outlook on life seems as American as apple pie. Ronald Reagan, asmentioned, like Trump, a proponent of positive thinking, had a similar aphorismthat he used in practically all his speeches, “Nothing is impossible,” a sayingthat would not be out of place in the Corpus Hermeticum. At least Reaganbelieved this was true of America and Americans. During his time in the OvalOffice, Reagan had a plaque on his desk that said “There is no limit to what aman can do or where he can go if he does not mind who gets the credit.” Next tothis was a sign reminding Reagan that “It CAN be done.” As the website of theReagan Foundation tells us, these affirmations were there to remind Reagan andany of his visitors that “in America, anything was possible—that we are limitedonly by our dreams.”36 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber54]“It CAN be done” is a perhaps more cautious affirmation than “Just Do It,”Nike’s tempting mantra to help us purchase more sportswear, but it is of thesame ilk. And “Just Do It” is not that far removed from Aleister Crowley’sindulgent maxim “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,” a writ ofpermission that has fueled many a magician—chaos or otherwise—since the GreatBeast first uttered it in the early twentieth century.37[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber55] Other exhortations to not be stymied by falselimitations include the U.S. Army’s recruiting slogan “Be All You Can Be,” someversion of which can be found in scores of self-help, motivational, andself-improvement teachings, calling on us to actualize to the full our manypotentialities.A life without limits and the will to pursue it seems part of the American dreamof success. And when the desire to be, as Jim Morrison once sang, “limitless andfree” is translated into more spiritual efforts, the goal of “being all we canbe” becomes no longer a purely American concern. Yet even here the admonitionsto be upbeat, cheerful, forward looking, and dismissive of any “negativity” canlead erstwhile deep spiritual pursuits into shallow practical waters. And thedangers of a will refusing to recognize any boundaries can be many.Yet New Thought did not always have success as its central goal, even if todaythat seems to be the concern with which it is most occupied. In his engaginghistory of New Thought, One Simple Idea, Mitch Horowitz shows that in its earlystages New Thought was more focused on health than anything else.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THAT THE MIND can affect the body was known to the ancients. In classicalGreece, for example, many people suffering from an illness went to spend thenight at the temple of Asclepius, the Greek god of healing, at Epidaurus. Aftera day spent in meditation and ritual purifications, they hoped to receive a“healing dream” that night, a visitation from the god that would effect a cureor point the way to one. Often the belief that one had had such a visitation wasenough to inspire a recovery. The teaching of the Stoic philosopher Epictetusthat “what disturbs men’s minds is not events but their judgments on events” isan axiom of positive thinking, and a similar sensibility informed the other“self-help” philosophies of Epictetus’s contemporaries, the Epicureans andSkeptics.38 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber56] All sought a kind of inner calm,ataraxia, a state of imperturbable tranquility, free from worry, that wouldpromote healing and maintain health, something that many of today’s mind, body,and spirit proponents equally pursue.In the sixteenth century the alchemist and healer Paracelsus anticipated muchmodern medical insight in his book Opus Paramirum (Work Beyond Wonders), which,among many other things, discusses what he calls the “illnesses of theimagination.” Such psychosomatic ailments were earlier thought to be the work ofevil spirits, but Paracelsus was adamant that what was really at work was thepatient’s own mind. Paracelsus was also convinced that the imagination canaffect other bodies as well. He affirmed that “It is possible that myspirit . . . through an ardent will alone, and without a sword, can stab andwound others,” a confirmation, it seems, of the dangerous power of the “evileye.”39 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber57]Paracelsus’s contemporary the magician and sage Cornelius Agrippa concurred withParacelsus’s belief in the remarkable powers of the imagination over the body.In On Occult Philosophy, his classic three-volume work on magic, Agrippa wrote,“The fantasy, or imaginative power, has a ruling power over the passions of thesoul.” This means that our moods are influenced by our imagination, that what wethink affects how we feel. But there is more. “Imagination does,” Agrippacontinues, “of its own accord, according to the diversity of the passions, firstof all change the physical body with a sensible transmutation, by changing theaccidents in the body, and by moving the spirit upward or downward, inward oroutward. . . .”40 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber58] The language may be obscurebut the meaning seems clear. Agrippa is saying that not only does theimagination affect our moods, when through autosuggestion we can think ourselvesinto depression, but it can also directly affect our body. Like much elseAgrippa wrote, this may seem pure moonshine; On Occult Philosophy includes somestandard magical “spells.” But it is something that contemporary medical scienceincreasingly recognizes.41 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber59]The medical roots of New Thought as we know it, however, begin somewhat nearerto us in time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IN 1833 A New England clock maker named Phineas P. Quimby was suffering fromtuberculosis. The state of medicine in America at the time meant that Quimby’ssufferings were double. The treatment he received was as bad as the ailment.Standard procedure back then was what was called “heroic medicine,” a way ofbattling an illness rather than healing the patient. From most accounts, theonly thing heroic about this were the patients, who had to put up with whatseems to us something akin to torture.“Heroic medicine” aimed to relieve the body of sickness by draining it of itsfluids. To this end Quimby took calomel, a mercury-based purgative that causedexcessive salivation and even foaming at the mouth. He was also subjected tobloodletting and other methods of emptying him of fluids. The results were notencouraging. After months of ingesting calomel, Quimby had lost most of histeeth and was suffering from a general toxicity. At one point things had gottenso bad that he had resigned himself to what seemed an inevitable early death.He took a last chance on the suggestion of a friend, who said he had curedhimself of a debilitating illness through horseback riding. This too wassomething the ancient Greeks had prescribed for some ailments. Quimby was tooweak to mount a horse so he settled for a carriage. Yet the horse provedunwieldy and would stop soon into a trot. It finally refused to move unlessQuimby ran beside it. After a taxing uphill sprint, Quimby collapsed into thecarriage and would have been stranded if he hadn’t called to a farmer in anearby field. The farmer got the horse going again, but Quimby felt too weak toeven raise the whip. But then something came over him and he began to drive thehorse as fast as he could. By the time they reached the stable, some miles away,Quimby’s strength had returned. In fact, he felt better than ever. “From thattime,” he wrote, “I continued to improve, not knowing, however, that theexcitement was the cause. . . .”42 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber60]Quimby’s remark that the “excitement” of his wild carriage ride was the cause ofhis recovery is a kind of pre-echo of a similar insight that came to WilliamJames. In “The Energies of Men,” mentioned earlier, James pondered over what cantrigger the release of our unused energies. What pushed some people beyond thelimits they have accepted as normal? James’s essay is full of accounts of peopleexhibiting remarkable powers of endurance and strength under exceptionallydemanding conditions. James concluded that in these cases, “Either some unusualstimulus . . . or some unusual idea of necessity induces them to make an extraeffort of will. Excitement, ideas, and efforts in a word, are what carry us overthe dam.”43 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber61]James developed a means of putting this insight into practice, which he calledthe “bullying-treatment.” It involves the doctor forcing his patient to makeefforts he refuses to make. Such “hyperesthetic” patients are subject toartificial limits of strength more extreme than those from which we all suffer.The doctor insists the patient make some effort that he complains is impossible,often something as simple as getting out of bed. The patient puts up a fight,but if the doctor wins, something unexpected occurs. As James writes: “Firstcomes the very extremity of distress, then follows unexpected relief.”44[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber62]James’s essay examines the phenomenon of “second wind,” the sudden inrush ofenergy that comes to athletes who feel they are already running on empty. Pushedto the extremity of their resources, in making one final effort, they oftenexperience the equivalent of an extra gasoline tank suddenly kicking in. James’s“bullying-treatment” is a way of inducing second wind, of forcing patients tomake an effort they feel is impossible. When they do, the relief seemsmiraculous. In Quimby’s case, he seems to have subjected himself to a form ofself-bullying, first by running up the hill and then by driving the horse asfast as it could go, producing the kind of “excitement” James saw could triggerour dormant powers.45 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber63]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT TOOK A while, however, for Quimby to understand exactly what he had stumbledupon. One clue came to him through a form of healing called “mesmerism.” Formost of us, mesmerism is another name for hypnotism, and while the two arerelated, they are really quite different. Franz Anton Mesmer was aneighteenth-century German doctor who believed that the universe was full of akind of tenuous vital fluid, what he called “animal magnetism,” animal heremeaning “animated,” that is, living. The Chinese notion of chi, or the Hinduidea of prana, is something similar, as is the “orgone energy” of the maverickFreudian psychologist Wilhelm Reich. For occultists it is the “astral light,”and Mesmer originally got his idea from a study of astrology; our wordinfluence—“in flowing”—comes from the astrological notion of some subtle forcereaching us from the stars. Ill health was a result of a kind of blockage ofthis animal magnetism in our systems, and Mesmer believed he had devised amethod of releasing the blocks and allowing the vital fluid to flow. Thisinvolved a series of passes and movements Mesmer made with his hands over apatient’s body.Mesmer achieved some celebrity in Vienna and then Paris, and “mesmeric baths”and the banquet, a kind of group therapy, became very popular just before theFrench Revolution. His celebrity waned after an examination by the FrenchAcademy of Science declared that Mesmer’s “animal magnetism” did not exist. Andit has to be said that the frequent dishabille of Mesmer’s attractive femalepatients, together with the orgy-like ambiance of the mesmeric salons and theorgasmic-like “crisis” that signaled a recovery, did not help his reputation.The French Academy was right. “Animal magnetism” did not exist, or at least itwas not responsible for Mesmer’s many cures. It was a disciple of Mesmer’s, theMarquis de Puységur, who discovered that what actually effected the cure was notan invisible vital fluid, but the ability of the “magnetic passes” to put thepatient into a trance. Mesmerism was really hypnotism, but it wasn’t until theEnglishman James Braid coined the term in 1841 that it was rechristened.Quimby encountered two mesmerists, in fact, in 1836 and 1841. Benjamin Franklinhad been part of the panel of the French Academy of Science that condemnedMesmer, but another hero of the Revolution, the Marquis de Lafayette, was one ofMesmer’s most ardent students. While it had faded in France, by the 1830smesmerism was a popular form of “alternative medicine” in America, and was oftencombined with the teachings of the eighteenth-century Swedish scientist andreligious philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg, who wrote of his contacts with thespirit world. By the 1840s mesmerism and Swedenborgianism were so popular thatEdgar Allan Poe wrote about them in some of his stories.Quimby was not entirely impressed by mesmerism. But it gave him the insight thatthe mind can have an extraordinary control over the body. He watched as onemesmerist put a teenage boy into a trance. He fell into a “magnetic sleep,” buta sleep very different from a normal one. Rather than become limp and relaxed,the boy’s body became perfectly stiff, statuelike. This was a phenomenon thatwould occur throughout the history of hypnotism, when a hypnotist would have asubject lie with his head on one chair and his feet on another, and his bodywould not bend when a member of the audience sat on his stomach. Hypnotizedsubjects could do remarkable things with the human body. They could, forinstance, hold live coals and not burn their hands. In Frankenstein’s Castle, abook about the right and left brain, Colin Wilson writes of a doctor whoobserved a dentist using hypnosis on a nervous patient. Once the patient was inthe trance the dentist told him that not only would he feel no pain, but hewould also not bleed. “This seemed preposterous. How can the mind controlbleeding?” Wilson writes. “Yet when the tooth had been extracted, no blood cameout of the cavity.”46 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber64] Somehow, while underhypnosis, the body is able to do things it seems unable to do in our “normal”state.Quimby saw that one needn’t be mesmerized in order for the body to respond tothe mind. He had shown that with his carriage ride. The excitement he had felt,the change in attitude, seemed to have gotten him over his weakness. He didn’tneed a mesmerist; he had somehow done it himself. Yet when he decided to put hisideas into practice, Quimby did use a clairvoyant for a time, placing anassistant into a mesmeric trance from which he would diagnose illnesses, amethod Quimby had witnessed in the mesmerists he saw. But he came to see that itwas not “animal magnetism,” or the herbal remedies his assistant prescribed, orany outside element that did the trick. What worked was the patient’s own mind.Quimby prompted a sense of confidence in the patient, and it was this thattriggered his cures. The belief itself seemed to do it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •QUIMBY’S WORK PLANTED seeds from which a variety of “mind cure” philosophiessprouted. He had a vague belief in a kind of universal mind—not unlike theHermetic Nous—from which all life and intelligence emanates and which wasultimately responsible for his cures. But human belief was the conduit of thispower. “Our happiness and misery are what follow from our belief” was one of hismaxims. In some way, Quimby was able to vitalize in his patients a belief in hiseffectiveness, and it was this confidence that made the difference.One of Quimby’s inheritors was the Methodist minister and Swedenborgian WarrenFelt Evans, who sought Quimby out and studied with him for a time. Evans seemedto combine Swedenborg’s ideas about the “correspondence” between the spiritualand the physical world, or that between the mind and the body, with Quimby’sinsights into the mental element in health. Swedenborg argued that everything inthe physical world corresponded in a precise way with a higher, spiritualreality, and that this same correspondence existed between the body and themind.47 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber65] As the physical world is only a shadowor image of the spiritual one, so too the body is only a kind of echo of themind. This suggested that if the body is ill, there must be something wrong inthe mind.For Evans this seemed to argue that right thinking would naturally lead to ahealthier and happier life. Evans linked this insight to his religious beliefand came up with a formula that in one way or another has proved durablethroughout the history of New Thought. “Faith is a force,” he concluded, thatproduces an “actual realization of what I am praying for.” “Believing that Ihave the thing for which I am praying causes me to have it.” If faith is “thesubstance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen,” as the NewTestament tells us, then for Evans it is also the fundamental “stuff” out ofwhich reality is made real. As Horowitz points out, Evans here has grasped thepower of positive thinking in a nutshell. “Mental certitude and visualization,backed by faith, is the engine of creation” is Horowitz’s reformulation ofEvans’s revelation.48 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber66] A clear picture of whatyou want, combined with the certainty that you already have it, will bring itabout.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •EVANS HAD THE basic idea but he still needed God to supply his faith. He wasstill short of arguing that it was the human mind itself that had the power.This was something at which the most famous “mind cure” proponent also stoppedshort. In fact for Mary Baker Eddy, it was the mind that was the seat of ourproblems.The religion of Christian Science, which Eddy founded in 1866, believes that theonly reality is the Mind of God. Sickness and disease are merely our mistakenperception of God’s infinite goodness and intelligence. It is our own mind,misunderstanding the true Reality, that is at the root of our problems. WhenMadame Blavatsky wrote that “the Mind is the great Slayer of the Real,” she wasechoing a conclusion that Mary Baker Eddy had come to some years earlier.49[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber67]Eddy’s road to founding a worldwide religion began when a series of personal andphysical hardships led her to Quimby’s door. She visited him several timesbetween 1862 and 1865, and gained strength and confidence from her “doctor,” asshe called him. But when Quimby died suddenly in 1866, she was desolate. She hadalready lost two husbands; one had died and the other was an absentee wastrel.Her father had recently died, and some years earlier she had had to give up herson for adoption. She suffered from a chronic spinal disorder, and just afterQuimby’s death, a slip on an icy pavement left her bedridden, her nervesexhausted. Life had not treated her well. When a disciple of Quimby’s refused totake on his mantle and give her guidance, Eddy decided to take things into herown hands. This meant putting them into God’s.What was the idea that led Eddy, against whom fate seemed to have stacked thedeck, to go on to have “worldwide influence” through a “doctrine counting itsadherents by the myriad,” as her biographer the Austrian-Jewish writer StefanZweig wrote?50 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber68] Simply that illness was anillusion, foisted upon us by our own minds. If we can free ourselves of thisillusion, and experience God as pure love, then we will be healed, as Jesushealed those who put their faith in him.Christian Science went on to be the most successful of the early mind-curephilosophies, and it remains an important belief system for many today. Yet itsinsistence that the human mind is the source of unreality, not reality, placesit outside our scope. It was, however, one of Eddy’s most able students, whosoon broke with her and went on to develop her own approach to New Thought, whosupplied the burgeoning “Mental Science” with fundamental insights that it stillemploys today.Emma Curtis Hopkins was a forthright freethinking woman with an interest inmetaphysics, Eastern religions, and the occult, and after hearing a lecture onChristian Science, she dedicated herself, body and soul, to Eddy’s doctrine. ButEddy was an authoritarian who wanted followers, not creative minds who couldinterpret her insights in new ways. She certainly did not want disciples who, inhowever humble a manner, could express insights of their own. Hopkins, however,had several of these, and they soon led to her expulsion from Christian Science.It was the best thing that could have happened, both to Hopkins and to NewThought. When she was free from Eddy’s censure, Hopkins’s interest in occult andmetaphysical ideas blossomed and she combined a variety of esoteric teachingsstemming from Hermeticism, Kabbalah, Theosophy, Egyptian religion, and othersources into a heady brew. Echoing Warren Felt Evans’s insight that “believingthat I have the thing for which I am praying causes me to have it,” throughlectures and instructions in mental visualization Hopkins introduced herfollowers in Chicago to the power of thought to “make things happen.” Illnesswas no longer her central concern, but something more like fulfillment or, as wewould say today, “self-actualization.” And what this entailed for Hopkins wasunderstanding and employing the powers of the mind.Affirmations to that effect were part of her approach. “The day is plastic toyou,” she told her audience, declaring the compliant character of reality in aphrase that would not have been out of place during the “revolt of theimagination” staged by Parisian students in May 1968. “Power to the Imagination”and “Take Your Desires for Reality” were some of the slogans that brought Paristo a standstill then.51 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber69] And where Eddy hadinsisted on the delusory character of the mind, Hopkins had turned in theopposite direction, stating, in various ways, that the mind can indeed createreality. As Horowitz remarks, her life and thought are testaments to a key NewThought tenet: the power of a deeply felt wish. We can achieve what we want inlife, but only if we want it ardently enough. It was this message that Hopkinsgot across to her students, many of whom, like Charles and Myrtle Fillmore,Ernest Holmes, William Walker Atkinson, and Ella Wheeler Wilcox, among others,went on to become New Thought teachers themselves.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •GRADUALLY, AS NEW Thought began to be accepted in American culture, its emphasisshifted from health to a central American pursuit enshrined in the Declarationof Independence: happiness. This took two forms which have remained a part ofNew Thought ever since: the drive to self-improvement and the right toprosperity. Both involve the power of the mind to alter reality.The idea of self-improvement or “character building” harkened back to Emerson’sessay “Self-Reliance”: “A man should learn to detect and watch that gleam oflight which flashes across his mind from within,” Emerson wrote, “more than thelustre or firmament of bards and sages.”52 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber70] Inother words, we should rely on our powers rather than lean on the achievementsof others. It was an admonition that suited a still young nation and it stillsuits much of New Thought today. Its basic aim is “self-mastery,” a mainstay ofmuch motivational literature. Through the work of improving ourselves, we becomemasters of our fate, and captains of our soul, as the poet William Ernest Henleyin his poem “Invictus” declared.53 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber71]With self-improvement, the reality one wants to affect is oneself. One “buildsone’s character” through conscious choices. As Ralph Waldo Trine, one of theleading inspirational New Thought writers, argues, these ultimately mean whatone thinks. Trine agreed with the import of the title of another highly popularNew Thought work, James Allen’s As a Man Thinketh, which was inspired by amisinterpretation of Proverbs 23:7, “as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.” Inthe biblical context it is a warning against duplicity, but Allen and hisreaders saw it as a confirmation of the idea that what we think determines ourlife.Trine’s In Tune with the Infinite, his hymn to the universal mind supporting allcreation, was one of the most popular works of New Thought, and it is still ahealthy seller today. In Character Building Thought Power, Trine turned hisattention to how we can remake ourselves through the power of our thoughts.“Your dominating thoughts,” he tells us, “determine your dominating actions.”What we think determines what we do, and what we do determines our character.Trine gives the example of someone gradually drifting into bad company andlosing himself to drink. At first the idea of sharing a drink with someacquaintances seems harmless, but a little voice may warn us of danger. If weharken to it, there is no harm. But having once given way, it is easier for usto do so the next time, until, imperceptibly, we may find ourselves caught bydemon rum. Trine counsels that what we need to do is to catch the thought ofhaving a drink as soon as it appears and cast it out of our mind. We should alsofill the empty space with a new thought, say, of the benefits of not drinking.Gradually, the new thought will dominate.This seems like a remarkable presage of cognitive behavioral therapy, ormindfulness, two very popular therapeutic approaches today, both of which workby paying attention to what we think. “The greatest strength and nobility ofcharacter,” Trine writes, “lies always in taking a firm stand on the side ofright.” “The great and strong character is the one who is ever ready tosacrifice the present pleasure for the future good.”54[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber72] If we want to live a good and healthy life,Trine tells us, we should fill our minds with good and healthy thoughts.Yet while Trine believed that “there are no shortcuts to wealth honestly made,”his own work was an inspiration for more straightforward proponents of whatwould come to be called “the prosperity gospel.” This was the belief that, inthe words of one classic of the genre, one can “think and grow rich.” NapoleonHill, the author of the very successful Think and Grow Rich, was a reader ofTrine, as was Henry Ford. Ford was a close friend of Trine’s and attributed boththe conception of the motorcar and his own success to Trine’s ideas.55[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber73]Self-improvement and character building were enough for Trine and for ElbertHubbard, author of A Message to Garcia, a once popular inspirational work aimedat motivating personal initiative. But it was not long before the belief inimproving oneself also included improving one’s finances. Along with health,personal improvement, and the variety of social issues that concerned earlyadvocates of New Thought—as Horowitz makes clear, many were devoted to socialreform and what later would emerge as women’s liberation—the idea of abundancesoon became part of the canon of positive thinking.A journalist named Prentice Mulford seems to be the one to clearly make the leapfrom the pursuit of happiness to that of wealth. Before becoming the foundingfather of the “prosperity gospel,” Mulford had been a hotelier, a whaler, aprospector, a reporter, and an editor who published Mark Twain and AmbroseBierce, among other occupations. Weary of his rollicking life, Mulford attempteda Thoreau-like stint “off the grid” in a cabin in the New Jersey woods, butfound solitude not to his taste. But his failure at using New Thought techniquesto defeat his depression led to his last and most successful self-reinvention,as a pamphleteer for what he, and many others, would call the “Law of Success.”From 1886 until his death in 1891, Mulford produced a series of pamphlets—laterbound into a book, Your Forces, and How to Use Them—aimed at telling his readershow they could use the power of the mind to increase their fortunes. Drawing ona clutch of sources—Spiritualism, Swedenborg, and earlier mind-cureadvocates—Mulford developed a repertoire of New Thought mantras that are stillvibrating today. “Thoughts are things,” he told his readers, an insight thatreaches back to Paracelsus, but which Mulford, in a breezy, readable manner,communicated clearly. For Mulford, and for practically every “prosperityevangelist” who followed, this meant that thought has as palpable an effect onreality as anything else. Grasping that “the mind is a magnet” is the essentialkey to the Law of Success. The strictures of that law are simple: your mood orframe of mind has more to do with success than anything else. Attitude counts.“Your mind is a magnet. It has the power, first of attracting thought, and nextof sending that thought out again.” What you think, you will attract. “Yourevery thought is a force, as real as a current of electricity. . . .” WhatMulford taught his readers to do was to direct that force toward the acquisitionof wealth.Mulford’s pamphlets worked—at least they were commercially successful for him.But he seems to have been plagued by recurrent depression. At the height of hispopularity—even William James wrote approvingly of Mulford in his mind-cureessay “The Gospel of Relaxation”—Mulford died under suspicious circumstances.56[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber74] He had decided to journey from Sheepshead Bay,Brooklyn, to Sag Harbor, Long Island, on his sailboat. But when the boatremained near Sheepshead Bay for several days, concerned friends went toinvestigate and found Mulford’s body. There was no sign of a struggle oranything else to account for his death, and it is possible his depression gotthe better of him and he took his own life.Yet Mulford’s ideas lived on. The Law of Success proved very successful. AndMulford’s notion that the mind is a magnet soon morphed into another law, whichhe was the first to clearly proclaim but which has echoed along the annals ofNew Thought down to our own day: the Law of Attraction. From Mulford to RhondaByrne’s very well-known secret, the belief that what we think, the ideas,images, expectations, and attitudes housed in our heads, determines thecircumstances of our lives, formed the basis of practically all versions of thegospel of prosperity. That the idea of a Law of Attraction was anothermisunderstanding of a spiritual insight, this time one of Swedenborg’s, did notmatter.57 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber75] It set the template for practicallyall the teachings to come that affirmed that by thinking in the right way, onecould grow rich. Or if that seems too straightforwardly acquisitive, how throughone’s thoughts one could share in the abundance that was rightfully one’s own.From Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Influence People to Florence ScovelShinn’s The Game of Life and How to Play It, Ernest Holmes’s Creative Mind andSuccess to Joseph Murphy’s The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, the prosperitygospel told those who had ears that if they used their minds in the right way,success would be theirs. All they needed was a little positive thinking.It was a doctrine that Donald J. Trump heard from an early age, and the messageseemed to take hold."},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]CHAPTER TWOPOSITIVE CHAOSWHAT EXACTLY DID Trump hear at those sermons at Marble Collegiate Church? Ifthey were anything like what Norman Vincent Peale told the readers of The Powerof Positive Thinking, it must have been something like this:Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Self-confidence leads toself-realization and successful achievement. Believe in yourself and releaseyour inner powers. Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental pictureof yourself as succeeding.1 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber76]To give these calls to self-confidence and belief in our inner powers somebiblical support, Peale would very likely have quoted from Philippians 4:13: “Ican do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me,” or referred to someother suitable passage from scripture. As readers of The Power of PositiveThinking discover, there are many of these. As mentioned, Peale was able to takethe basic principles and techniques of New Thought and repackage them in amodernized, Christianized version. To be sure, much New Thought and mind-cureteachings were already rooted in religious faith, but Peale’s ownself-confidence—born of a difficult battle with a debilitating inferioritycomplex—somehow informed his biblical references and homely anecdotes with aninfectious enthusiasm. His gospel was not one of sin and retribution, but ofsharing in the power of faith to achieve anything, and he had many examples onoffer to show that it worked. Many people leaving Peale’s sermons must havefelt, as Trump did, that if they could just adopt the right attitude and thinkpositively, nothing could stop them.The chapter titles in The Power of Positive Thinking offer more clues to themessage Peale delivered from the pulpit: “A Peaceful Mind Generates Power,”“Expect the Best and Get It,” “I Don’t Believe in Defeat,” “How to Create YourOwn Happiness,” “Try Prayer Power.”“Prayer power” is very important for Peale; we can say it is the central ideabehind all his work. The Power of Positive Thinking is full of testimonials frompeople about the power of prayer to solve any problem or remove any obstacle.But not any old prayer will do. We are told to pray “big, deep prayers,” andthat there are different prayer techniques for different problems.2[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber77] For Peale, prayer is a “manifestation ofenergy,” a scientific allusion that the founder of the prosperity gospel,Prentice Mulford, also made when he compared thought to a substance which, “inthe chemistry of the future,” will be recognized “as much as the acids, oxides,and all other chemicals of to-day.”3 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber78] If faithcan move mountains, according to Peale the right prayer applied in the right wayis like a laser beam, a tightly focused current of faith that can achieve itsend with pinpoint accuracy. Peale tells of a fitness expert who had a sign onhis wall on which were written the letters APRPBWPRAA. Asked what they stood forthe expert said “Affirmative Prayers Release Powers By Which Positive ResultsAre Accomplished.”4 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber79] As in many fairy tales,with positive thinking it pays to be very specific about exactly what you arewishing for.Peale writes that the purpose of the book is to “suggest techniques and to giveexamples which demonstrate that you do not need to be defeated by anything.”5[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber80] “By channeling spiritual power through yourthoughts,” he writes, “you can rise above obstacles which ordinarily mightdefeat you.”6 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber81] “You need be defeated only if youare willing to be. This book teaches how to ‘will’ not to be.”If we absorb the book’s teachings, assimilate its principles, and apply itstechniques properly, Peale tells us, we can change the circumstances of ourlives. We can assume control over them “rather than continuing to be directed bythem.”7 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber82] Harkening back to the insight of theStoic philosopher Epictetus—that what disturbs us are not events but ourjudgments about them—Peale insists that “any fact facing us, howeverdifficult . . . is not so important as our attitude towards that fact.” Hequotes the psychiatrist Karl Menninger for support: “Attitudes are moreimportant than facts.” While thinking negatively about some troubling fact candefeat us prematurely, “a confident and optimistic thought pattern can modify orovercome the fact altogether.”8 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber83]I’m not sure if Norman Vincent Peale ever thought in this way or that he wouldhave necessarily appreciated the connection, but his optimism about how to dealwith recalcitrant facts has a certain postmodern ring to it, and seems to fitright into our increasingly post-truth world.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •BORN AND RAISED in Ohio, Peale began his career as an “ambassador ofencouragement” in 1932 when he took over an ailing Marble Collegiate Church. Hewas ordained as a Methodist minister in 1922 and had to change his religiousaffiliation to the Reformed Church of America to take on the job. The church wasfailing, attendance was low, and Peale faced a difficult task getting his newparish back on its feet. Undeterred by the challenge, Peale applied some of thepositive thinking he would motivate in others and soon turned things around.Word quickly got out about the glad tidings coming from the church on FifthAvenue and West Twenty-ninth Street. The congregation steadily grew, drawn in byPeale’s adamant faith in the power of prayer.Soon after he arrived at the church, Peale met the positively namedpsychoanalyst Smiley Blanton, who had studied with Freud. The two decided that ablend of psychology and religion might be a useful combination to deal with themany problems facing people during the Depression. As he would emphasize in hiswriting, Peale thought that in the modern age, religion should look to sciencefor guidance, and taking a leaf from Rudolf Steiner, he thought of himself as a“scientist of the spiritual life.”9 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber84] Blanton sawa successful psychoanalysis as triggering a kind of religious conversion in thepatient, with revelations from the unconscious having an equal transformativepower to those from the divine. The Religio-Psychiatric Clinic was formed in1937 and worked out of the church’s basement, offering its clients a religiousor psychologically based therapy, or a combination of both. Blanton, however,balked at Peale’s increasing interest in “prayer power” and its ability toarrange the circumstances of one’s life. When The Power of Positive Thinkingappeared, Blanton distanced himself from it and declined to defend Peale when heand the book came under criticism. Nevertheless, the Religio-Psychiatric Clinicwas a success and continues to see thousands of patients today.Peale had many irons in the fire, and before his literary success he was a radiocelebrity with his program The Art of Living, which he broadcast for more thanhalf a century, starting in 1935. When television became the dominant medium, hemade the transition easily. Peale also founded and edited the magazineGuideposts, which featured stories in which the power of faith, prayer, orsimply hard work helped someone overcome seemingly insurmountable difficulties.He had also written a few earlier self-help books, but these had neither thephilosophy nor the impact of The Power of Positive Thinking.For someone interested in helping people deal with the grim realities of theDepression, Peale was a critic of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal, seeingit as an attack on individual liberties. If Peale was outspokenly positive fromthe pulpit, his political pronouncements often had a harder ring. In the early1950s, he supported a campaign by hard-line conservatives to put General DouglasMacArthur in the White House. His antipathy to liberal politicians came throughduring the 1956 presidential campaign in his denunciation of the urbane DemocratAdlai Stevenson for being divorced.10 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber85] ButPeale’s most controversial political statements were voiced in 1960, during JohnF. Kennedy’s presidential contest with Richard Nixon.Peale joined forces with a group of Protestant ministers who believed thatKennedy’s Catholicism would make him a kind of Vatican “Manchurian Candidate,”taking his orders from the pope and steering America into papist ways. Peale’sremark that a Catholic in the White House put American culture at risk and thatKennedy would serve papal interests over American ones brought much criticism onhis head. Many newspapers dropped his syndicated column and there were calls forhim to leave the pulpit. Peale weathered the storm and was eventually able topour oil on troubled waters, but it took some doing and henceforth he kept hispolitical counsel to himself.Yet it wasn’t only his political broadsides that alarmed critics. Peale’spositive thinking may have been welcomed by his readers, but there were many whohad a much less positive response to it. Like critics of New Thought today,their main criticism was that positive thinking simply didn’t work and thatreaders taken by Peale’s book were setting themselves up for a depressingletdown. Peale’s claims to the contrary, they said, were unsubstantiated, andone has to admit that throughout the book Peale refers to a “famouspsychologist” here or a “scientist” there who according to him confirms hisfindings, without telling his readers exactly who they are. Worse than makingunprovable claims were criticisms saying that Peale was peddling a form ofself-hypnosis that could lead to serious mental problems. This was a charge madeagainst him by the psychologist Albert Ellis in his book How to Make YourselfHappy and Remarkably Less Disturbable, which, one has to say, has its own“self-improvement” philosophy to proffer.Religious leaders were also less than positive about Peale’s philosophy.Theologians and churchmen thought that Peale sold his readers and parishioners akind of feel-good Christianity aimed at success that avoided the deeper issuesof life. God became a career adviser, helping one to get on in the world.Fundamentally, they argued that Peale put oneself over others and God and saw“prayer power” as a means of using religion to achieve the “good life,” acriticism brought against the prosperity gospel as a whole.Yet another criticism brought against Peale concerns us more directly. This wasthat positive thinking was really a refit of the Mental Science and New Thoughtphilosophies of the earlier part of the century. With its echoes of “mind power”and the miracle of “visualization,” many were concerned that Peale was a kind ofcloset occultist and that positive thinking was a kind of Christianized magic.These criticisms had some substance. Peale had been a reader of Ernest Holmes inhis younger days and credited Holmes’s Creative Mind and Success with helpinghim overcome his shyness and inferiority complex. Holmes was one of the greatNew Thought figures, founding the movement he called “Religious Science,” whichpromulgated a philosophy known as “Science of Mind.” He founded the movement’sjournal, Science of Mind, whose title came from Holmes’s best-known work, TheScience of Mind. Holmes was a great reader of Emerson and Mary Baker Eddy, aswell as other New Thought writers, and was a student of Emma Curtis Hopkins. In1914 he left the Maine of his childhood and relocated to California. There withhis brother Fenwicke, his ministry in Religious Science began. Holmes was apopular speaker, and he soon collected admirers in the early Hollywood scene,such as Cecil B. DeMille; later fans included Elvis Presley.The basic idea behind the Science of Mind is that what we picture in ourthoughts passes into reality. The world we see is an “out-picturing” of the oneinside our heads, an idea going back to Swedenborg. Thoughts, as PrenticeMulford said, are things, and they form the backdrop to the world we inhabit. Ifwe discipline ourselves and gain mastery of our thoughts, we can be thearchitect of our world. If we fail to do this, we will be at the mercy ofwhatever vagrant thought slips into our head, and such random uncontrolled ideaswill dictate our reality. Peale benefited from Holmes’s ideas personally and hisdoctrine of positive thinking was informed by them too.Other New Thought thinkers influenced Peale. The Reverend Arthur Caliandro, whosucceeded Peale at Marble Collegiate Church, recalled that Peale was a greatreader of Napoleon Hill. The author of Think and Grow Rich looked to the ideasof the Scottish American steel magnate Andrew Carnegie in order to grasp what hecalled the “Law of Success.” Peale himself was drawn to such successfulcharacters. Charles Fillmore, founder of the Unity School of Christianity; EmmetFox, whose services with the Divine Science Church drew thousands during theDepression; and the self-improvement and public relations guru Dale Carnegie,author of the still popular How to Win Friends and Influence People—and norelation to Andrew—were some of his other favorites.Peale’s notion of “prayer power” harkened back to Mesmer’s ideas of a kind ofsubtle force that could be directed at people. While recognizing the reality ofhypnosis, psychologists had dismissed the notion of some Svengali-likeradiation, emanating from the hypnotist’s eyes, through which he impressed his“will” upon his subject.11 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber86] Peale was noSvengali—whatever his critics might think—but he did believe that prayer was anactual energy, and he admitted that he often prayed for people unaware of hissolicitation. In some cases he was certain they felt it.12[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber87] Prayer for Peale was a way of becoming “in tunewith the infinite,” a phrase he borrowed from Ralph Waldo Trine. “All of theuniverse is in vibration,” Peale believed, and prayer was a way of aligning ourvibrations with those of the person we were praying for, as well as with God,the source of all vibrations.The idea that the universe is made up of vibrations has a long and variedhistory, ranging from the ancient Greek sage Pythagoras to the modern esotericteacher Gurdjieff. It appears in scientific dress in contemporary superstringtheory, which contends that the fundamentally “really real” things making upexistence are oscillating one-dimensional “strings,” an image that gives newmeaning to Pythagoras’s famous sensitivity to the “music of the spheres,”another phrase employed by Peale.Peale most likely came across the idea of prayer as a way of harmonizingvibrations through the work of Florence Scovel Shinn, an artist and illustratorwho spoke of “universal vibrations” in books like The Game of Life and How toPlay It. Shinn came upon the idea herself in what was probably the moststraightforward “Hermetic” work of New Thought. This was The Kybalion, a bookpurporting to be a study of a lost work of Hermes Trismegistus written by themysterious “Three Initiates,” and which gave a distinct esoteric spin to the Lawof Attraction. The Kybalion was not part of the Corpus Hermeticum—the closest itgot to anything Greek was its title, which sounds like a Hellenized rendition ofKabbalah—and the “Three Initiates” were actually one William Walker Atkinson, averitable one-man occult society. In Chicago in the 1900s, Atkinson, a lawyerand student of Emma Curtis Hopkins, wrote dozens of occult-oriented New Thoughtworks using several pseudonyms, such as Yogi Ramacharaka, Theron Q. Dumont, andMagus Incognito, published by his Yogi Publications Company.13[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber88]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •PEALE WAS FAMILIAR with the occult current in New Thought and he condensed muchof it into a simple formula. Along with the general rule of thinking positively,of keeping good, healthy, and success-oriented thoughts in one’s head, heproposed a more direct, specific approach. Its three steps call us to“prayerize,” “picturize,” and “actualize.”14 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber89]Fundamentally this is a way of visualizing a desired outcome with enoughconviction to make it comes to pass.To “prayerize,” for Peale, means to keep the problem or concern constantly inmind, talking it over with God—the source of prayer power—as one goes aboutone’s day. It’s unclear if Peale knew that this seems a variation of the RussianOrthodox “Jesus prayer” or “Prayer of the Heart,” in which, as St. Paul advisesin 1 Thessalonians 5:17, one is to “pray without ceasing.”15[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber90] In Peale’s version, through this unceasingprayerizing God becomes present to us, and his “Presence” finally comes todominate one’s conscious and unconscious mind.“Picturizing” is visualizing what Peale calls a “realizable wish,” which israther of the same stuff as chaos magick’s “achievable reality.” It won’t do topicturize something manifestly impossible, or so improbable that its chances ofhappening are practically nil. It also helps to picture an outcome of which Godwould approve. Once decided, we should picturize the outcome intently, andassume that it has already come to pass. Keeping the picture in our mind,holding it firmly in consciousness, we then let it sink into the unconscious, sothat it reaches God’s “Presence.” Peale tells us to visualize the desiredoutcome as we work at helping to bring it about.The last step is when what we have prayerized and picturized happens, when one’srealizable wish is actualized. How it actualizes may surprise us. God, we know,works in mysterious ways. But Peale insists that it will. “Go about yourbusiness on the assumption that what you have affirmed and visualized is true.Affirm it, visualize it, believe it, and it will actualize itself.”16[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber91]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT’S NOT CLEAR if Peale was aware of the work of another New Thought proponent,one who shared his mix of biblical references and Mental Science, and whoseapproach to “manifesting reality” shares much with Peale’s “three step” program.Neville Goddard, or Neville, as he was known, turned to the Bible to get hismessage across. But he had a peculiar interpretation of it, and his occultleanings were more up front than Peale’s.Neville Goddard had a more racy and exotic background than most New Thoughtteachers. He was born into a British family in Barbados in 1905 and his firstcareer was on the stage. He left the British West Indies in his late teens andwent to New York, where he was successful as an actor and dancer, although towhat degree is unclear; like many mystic teachers, Neville’s autobiographicalaccount is a mixture of exaggerated fact and impressive fantasy amid some solidtruth. But on a trip to England he became interested in occult and esotericideas and sat in on some séances.When he returned to New York, he became involved with a Rosicrucian society. Theoriginal Rosicrucians were a supposed secret society in earlyseventeenth-century Germany who were interested in Hermetic philosophy and alsoin what we would call “progressive” social ideas; I mention them in theIntroduction.17 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber92] By the early twentieth century,there were different occult groups claiming a descent from the Rosicrucians, andit is unclear which one Goddard joined. Whoever they were, Israel Regardie, astudent of Aleister Crowley, who writes about it, did not think highly ofthem.18 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber93] Although he eventually left them,during his time with the Rosicrucians, Neville underwent a kind of spiritualtraining leading to some unusual experiences with “astral projection” andclairvoyance.But his real spiritual path opened when he met an enigmatic “Ethiopian rabbi”named Abdullah. Exactly who Abdullah was—or if he even existed— remainsdebatable, although Horowitz suggests that a good candidate may be Arnold JosiahFord, a black nationalist mystic of the 1920s and ’30s.19[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber94] Neville’s meeting with Abdullah has all thetropes familiar to such fateful encounters. Neville went to see Abdullah speak,and at the end of his talk, the mysterious Ethiopian walked up to him and saidthat he was six months late. Neville had no idea what he was talking about andsaid so. Abdullah then explained that “the brothers” had told him of his comingand that he had been waiting six months for him to arrive.With Abdullah, Neville studied Hebrew, scripture, numerology, and metaphysics.Abdullah taught him how to read the Bible symbolically, an approach going backto the Alexandrian Jewish philosopher Philo.20 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber95]Abdullah showed Neville that the Bible should be seen as a work of psychologicalsymbolism, depicting the secrets of consciousness. In this sense we can say thatNeville carried on a tradition of “esoteric Christianity.”But it is Neville’s own approach to “prayerizing, picturizing, and actualizing”that concerns us here. With the poet William Blake, Neville believed that theworld we see around us, and which we take to be stubbornly “outside” and“objective,” is really a projection of our inner mind. “All Things Exist in theHuman Imagination,” Blake tells us, echoing the ancient Hermetic philosophywhich teaches that “within God”—Nous—“everything lies in imagination.” As Blakewrote in Jerusalem, “In your Bosom you bear your Heaven and Earth & all youbehold; tho’ it appears Without, it is Within, in your Imagination. . . .” AsErnest Holmes and Swedenborg, an early influence on Blake, taught, our thoughtsdetermine the world we see—or at least they can nudge it in a direction we wouldlike it to go.Neville had an experience of this during a difficult time in New York. He wantedto see his family in Barbados for Christmas but lacked the money for a ticket.Abdullah told him to act as though he was already there, and he would be. Thisdepended on creating in himself the feeling that he was indeed in Barbados, aswell as the conviction that he was. He imagined the warm sun, the ocean breeze,the familiar sounds of his family. He “picturized” being there with thevividness of those peculiar dreams we call “lucid,” in which we briefly know weare dreaming and yet the dream continues with crystal clarity. Neville did thiswith perseverance. Just before the last ship for home sailed, he received aletter from a brother he hadn’t heard from in years; with it was fifty dollarsand a steamship ticket for Barbados.Neville’s picturizing arranged reality for him, but it might just as easily havesent him to Barbados on its own. In his classic work The Occult, Colin Wilsonrecounts several stories of “bilocation,” in which a person appeared in onelocation while physically being in another. The Swedish playwright AugustStrindberg wrote of an experience of bilocation when, like Neville, he wanted tobe with his family. Ill in Paris, Strindberg imagined the living room of hishome in Sweden. Suddenly, he lost awareness of where he was and felt that he wasindeed standing near his piano at home. Strindberg writes that his mother-in-lawsaw his “apparition” and wrote to him to ask if he was ill. On another occasion,Strindberg was describing a past experience in some detail to a friend when heagain suddenly felt as if he were transported back to the time and place inquestion. It was something more than a vivid memory; he was actually “in” theplace he was describing.21 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber96]Strindberg was a good subject for picturizing, because its effectiveness dependson the emotional intensity with which we visualize an objective. Strindberg hadboth a powerful creative imagination and was known for his emotional intensity.Other examples of bilocation Wilson gives in The Occult involve the novelistJohn Cowper Powys and the poets W. B. Yeats and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, allhighly imaginative individuals, and all interested in the occult. Withvisualization, a peculiar emotional state is necessary for results. In his ownwritings on magic, Regardie often calls on his readers to “invoke often” and to“enflame thyself with prayer,” counsels known to his mentor Crowley. Neville’sbackground in theater and dance—two art forms very useful in magic—would haveprovided him with access to the kind of emotional intensity necessary toactualize what he had picturized.Like Peale, Neville relied on the Bible to illustrate his ideas, but hisconception of God was more like Blake’s. God was the Imagination, or, as Nevillecalled it, the fundamental “unconditioned awareness of one’s being.” Nevilleexpressed this notion using the phrase “I AM,” part of the answer God gave Moseswhen he asked his name (“I AM THAT I AM” is the usual translation from Exodus3:14). Before we are anything else, we are. I am a writer, a father, an expatAmerican, and some other things. But before all these, I simply am. I exist insome way before any limitations or conditions of my existence come into play,even the fact that I have a body. “I-ness” is sheer identity. Someone sufferingfrom amnesia may not know his name, but he still knows that he is. For Neville,human beings do suffer from a kind of reverse amnesia, remembering all sorts ofthings, except the fundamental fact that we are.22[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber97] Like other esoteric teachers, Neville wants tobring our awareness back to this inexplicable miracle.The idea of God or the ultimate reality existing in some unconditioned,unmanifest way—even a way that paradoxically precludes existence—is part of manyspiritual traditions, of both East and West. Hinduism has the notion ofneti-neti, which means that the ultimate reality is “neither this nor that.”Buddhism speaks of sunyata, the void or emptiness of true reality. Neoplatonismand Hermeticism speak of the One, the fundamental source of existence, which isbeyond our rational comprehension. The Gnostics spoke of what they called thePleroma, a formless source of all forms. In Kabbalah we hear of the Ain Soph,another name for the same idea. Early church fathers like Origen spoke of God asbeing without predicates or attributes. Even contemporary science speaks of atime paradoxically “before” the Big Bang, before existence that is—paradoxicallybecause it is with the Big Bang that time, along with everything else,supposedly began, so prior to this there could presumably be no “before.”What Neville told his readers and the audiences at his lectures was that ourfundamental sense of existing, our rock-bottom “I AM,” is this unmanifestultimate reality, a common insight in much spirituality. We are God, or ratherwe are fragments of the divine that have forgotten our identity, parts of theultimate reality that suffer from an existential amnesia. What he also told hisreaders is that, as the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge believed, within us residesthe same creative power that the unmanifested reality used to manifest creation.How did creation come about? Through imagination. Why did God or whatever wewant to call ultimate reality create it? Because he (she or it) imagined it anddesired to make it real. Unlike Buddhism, which sees desire as the source of allsuffering, Neville sees it as the source of all creation, the driving forcebehind reality.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •PHILOSOPHERS LIKE ARTHUR Schopenhauer, who was informed by Buddhist thought, sawreality as ultimately a mistake, the product of an ever craving “will” that,propelled from boredom to satiety and back again, perpetually creates a worldthat never satisfies it. For Schopenhauer, such an arrangement was deplorableand never should have happened. With Aristotle, he agreed that under suchconditions, it was best not to be born, and second best to die young.More optimistic thinkers saw things differently. In his play Back to Methuselah,a work of what, borrowing from the philosopher Henri Bergson, he called“creative evolution,” George Bernard Shaw argued in favor of the world and thedesire that creates it. Echoing Coleridge and Blake, Shaw wrote that“Imagination is the beginning of creation. You imagine what you desire; you willwhat you imagine; and at last you create what you will.”23[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber98]We can say Shaw was a proponent of New Thought, although he didn’t call hisphilosophy that. In Man and Superman he argues against the Darwinian notion ofevolution as a blind, mechanical process. With Bergson, Shaw saw it as the workof a purposeful “life force,” the élan vital, struggling against the resistanceof dense matter in order to master it and infuse it with new freedom, as asculptor masters stone. Shaw’s hero declares that “as long as I can conceive ofsomething better than myself I cannot be easy unless I am striving to bring itinto existence or clearing the way for it.” That sounds like self-improvementwith a vengeance. “The artist’s work,” Shaw tells us, “is to show us ourselvesas we really are. Our minds are nothing but this knowledge of ourselves; and hewho adds a jot to such knowledge creates a new mind as surely as any womancreates new men.”24 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber99]“New mind” is not the same as New Thought, but it is pretty close. Shaw’sremarks about art and creation bring us back to Neville. Reality, existence, theworld, Neville tells us, is the reflection of God’s imagination. The same istrue of ourselves. Our world is a reflection of our imagination. But as we arenow, sunk in our amnesia, we are more like shards of the great cosmic mirror,reflecting only a tiny bit of our true reality. The world we see is a reflectionof our shattered imagination, if I may extend the metaphor. If we could see themirror whole, Neville argues, it would show a different picture. We would beable to reflect in this magic mirror any reality we chose.The way to do this, Neville says, involves three steps, just as Norman VincentPeale’s formula for “prayer power” does.First we have to reach that bedrock awareness of our own existence, the “I AM”we share with the primal reality. Readers can go to Neville for the details, butthis is done through a process of relaxation. Essentially it means strippingaway the several layers of what we assume we are until we reach that level ofourselves that just is.25 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber100]Once there we need to work up an enthusiasm for whatever reality we want tocreate. As Israel Regardie says, this is where Neville’s experience as an actorand dancer comes in handy. A certain emotional intensity is required. We recallthat our word enthusiasm comes from the ancient Greek enthousiasmos, which means“divinely inspired,” a state of ecstasy, in which a god enters into us.Creative, dramatic types like Neville find this easier to muster than lessspontaneous characters. But as in all magic, the chaos kind or otherwise, thisenergy and excitement is essential. It is the fuel that powers the will. It isthrough this ecstasy that the magician invokes whatever god he or she wants tocontact, and does so by becoming that god, temporarily at least. FriedrichNietzsche, a reader of Schopenhauer until his inborn evolutionary thinking madehim turn away from his mentor, said that “the great man is the play actor of hisideal.” The same is true of great magicians.Having worked up this ecstasy, we must then focus it intently on our alreadybeing what we want to manifest. We need to imagine ourselves as what we want tobring about. As A. R. Orage, a follower of Gurdjieff’s, a contemporary ofShaw’s, and an early interpreter of Nietzsche, wrote, “Evolution is altogetheran imaginative process. You become what you have been led to imagine yourself tobe.”26 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber101] We do not, however, focus onspecifics—in this he differs from Peale. If we are in need of money to pay therent, we do not think of a specific amount. Rather we concentrate on the idea of“abundance” or “wealth” or some other general idea that would satisfy our need.We do this because it would not become a god to request $1,000 or a similarfigure. That would be beneath her. And in any case you, as the god, do not“request” anything. You are abundance, plenty, wealth, good fortune, etc. Fromyour state of unconditioned awareness of being, you temporarily take on thepredicates and attributes of the reality you want to manifest. So from simply“being” nothing in particular, you “become” what you desire. And as Nevillebelieved, “if a desire is intense enough, and can be reinforced by sufficientfeeling . . . it must necessarily manifest itself objectively.” Creation isinevitable. What is created is the question.I should point out that what is essential with Neville, and with Peale, is thatour desire reaches down into what for sake of convenience we can call theUnconscious Mind. This is not the same as the Freudian unconscious, althoughdesires aplenty inhabit that part of our being, mostly unfulfilled ones. It issomething more like how C. G. Jung, Freud’s onetime heir apparent, saw theunconscious. Jung’s Collective Unconscious is something more along the lines ofthe Gnostic Pleroma or the Hermetic One—at least when he wrote about it from amore “mystical,” rather than a racial, biological, or even neurologicalperspective.27 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber102] We must reach down into thatunconscious Will that Schopenhauer saw as the root of all our problems. We dothis not to inhibit it, but to give it a direction.In one sense Schopenhauer was right. The unconscious Will is the source of ourproblems. This isn’t because it is motivated by desire, but because we allow itto be driven by random thoughts and vagrant desires. Desire itself is not bad,contrary to much spiritual wisdom. But what we desire matters deeply. Theunconscious creative will is powerful, but it receives directions from us. If wewant more fulfilled lives, we need to be more serious about what we want andwhat we tell the unconscious will to do about it.28[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber103] Neville’s approach is a notch above much otherNew Thought, but in essence this is what it is about.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •HERE IT MIGHT be good to turn to the other “occult” occupation with which thenew president of the United States seems to have an affinity. If Trump absorbedthe doctrine of positive thinking from Norman Vincent Peale, chaos magick seemsto have come to him naturally. The odd thing is that these two forms of magic,which seem far apart, actually have much in common.Like much New Thought, chaos magick is rooted in nineteenth-century occultism.We can place its start in the work of the not always reliable French occultistÉliphas Lévi. Born in Paris in 1810, his real name was Alphonse Louis Constant;when his interest turned to the Kabbalah, the ancient Jewish mystical tradition,he adopted Éliphas Lévi as a Hebrew transliteration of his name. It was notexactly correct and gave an early sign of the liberties Lévi took with alanguage he did not really know. Constant started his career studying for thepriesthood; like many French esotericists, he mixed his occultism with sizabledoses of Catholicism. Constant did not last long with the church; by mostaccounts his exit was due to an ineradicable interest in sex. Like Neville,Constant then took to the stage. He was also a talented artist and earned acrust providing illustrations for magazines and books.Constant was drawn to the radical politics of the time; in Politics and theOccult I write of his account of the start of the revolution of 1848. He wrotesocialist pamphlets, more passionate than persuasive, and was imprisoned for histract The Gospel of Love. It was love itself, or the loss of it, that led him tothe occult. Constant wrote for a leftist newspaper, and while scribbling tiradesagainst the system, he was oblivious to the affair his young wife was havingwith his editor. When she left him, he was devastated, but a new passion cameinto his life.Constant had become the disciple of the eccentric Polish thinker Jósef MariaHoene-Wronski, whose ideas about the universe were so strange that he was forcedto leave his post at the Institute of Marseille. Hoene-Wronski’s messianisme,his synthesis of philosophy, science, religion, and politics, impressedConstant, and led him to his idiosyncratic study of Kabbalah. This resulted inhis first occult work, Dogme de la haute magie (Dogma of High Magic), whichappeared in 1854. Its second part, Rituel de la haute magie (Ritual of HighMagic), appeared in 1856. In 1896 the two appeared in English as TranscendentalMagic, translated by the British occultist A. E. Waite. Constant himself hadbeen translated too, into the magician Éliphas Lévi.Lévi promoted an idea embraced by Traditionalism, that of a primal revelationthat informs all religions and is at the base of all occultism. He spoke of a“doctrine which is everywhere the same and everywhere concealed,” but whichcould be deciphered in the Hindu Vedas, in the Egyptian Sphinx, in alchemy, inthe initiations of secret societies, and in much else. He is also responsiblefor popularizing the idea of the “astral light,” mentioned earlier when speakingof Mesmer’s “animal magnetism.”What places Lévi at the fount of chaos magick is his championing of twofaculties essential for any successful magic: imagination and will. The “astrallight” was for Lévi another name for the imagination. One mastered this magicallight through a discipline of the will. With Lévi magic shifted from afastidious attention to detail—getting the demon’s name exactly right—to thepower of the will to control the creative imagination. It was this more“artistic” approach to magic that influenced French symbolist poets likeBaudelaire and Rimbaud and surrealists like André Breton.But what truly places Lévi at the start of chaos magick is his inspired mistakeabout the Tarot and the Kabbalah. Lévi linked the twenty-two “paths” of theKabbalistic Tree of Life, symbolized by the twenty-two letters of the Hebrewalphabet, with the twenty-two Tarot trumps, the “major arcana.” He also linkedthe four suits to the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, the unpronounceablename of God.Most modern historians of the Tarot recognize that Lévi was wrong and that thereis no connection between the Tarot and Kabbalah, or with ancient Egypt for thatmatter, another of his beliefs—hence his idea that the Tarot is the ancient Bookof Thoth, the Egyptian god of magic.29 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber104]Academic students of Jewish mysticism point out that he is often woefullyincorrect about the Kabbalah. But Lévi’s inspired mistake is at the heart ofpractically all the magic that followed him. If magic is about the imagination,then Lévi’s imagination was powerfully creative and, what’s more, it worked.From the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the most famous magical society ofthe nineteenth century, down to practicing magicians today, Lévi’s mistake hasproved remarkably fruitful, as anyone who has done “pathworking,” a kind ofKabbalistic “inner journeying,” knows. It seems that in magic, “Is it right?” isless important than “Does it work?”Aleister Crowley went a step further. In my book on Crowley I tell of how heperformed an intricate magical procedure while on horseback in China.30[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber105] Crowley was gripped with a need to continue amagical ritual he had left uncompleted back in Britain. The necessary tools wereback home. Crowley felt he had two choices. He could astral travel back toScotland and perform the ritual there, in his astral body. Or he could visualizehis magical temple and everything else he needed in his mind and perform theritual there. Crowley decided on the latter and as he rocked in the saddlesomewhere in Asia he did all that was necessary with what he had at hand—namely,his imagination. Crowley later developed a system of sex magick that substitutedthe ecstasy of sexual orgasm for the more laborious efforts of ceremony, atactic employed by many chaos magicians today.Another chaos magick pioneer was the artist-magician Austin Osman Spare. Sparewas a contemporary of Crowley and an enfant terrible of the English artistic finde siècle. He briefly belonged to one of Crowley’s magical societies, but soonlost interest in the Great Beast and went his own way. Spare went Crowley onefurther by devising a magical system entirely his own that did away with theusual magical implements. He had a strong dislike of ceremonial magic andridiculed those, like Crowley, who still made use of it.Spare developed a system of making sigils, magical symbols used for invokingpowers, that relied more on his own creative instincts and insights than on anyformal magical apparatus. He would write down a wish—a “realizable” and“achievable” one—on a scrap of paper, then cancel out any repeating letters. Hethen designed a sigil out of the remaining letters—what he called “the alphabetof desire”—and then “charged” it with his imagination, often, like Crowley,using sex, not infrequently masturbation, as an excitant.As Neville did, Spare believed the wish needed to reach deep down into theunconscious mind, which he believed was the source and executant of all magic.Spare spoke of reaching what he called the “Neither-Neither,” a variant of theHindu neti-neti. This is what Neville called the “unconditioned awareness ofbeing.” Spare practiced what he called “death postures” in order to enter thestate of consciousness in between sleeping and waking. This is known as thehypnogogic state, a condition of consciousness thought to facilitate psychicexperiences.31 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber106] “Unconditioned” is synonymouswith “unformed,” which is a state of chaos; as Genesis 1:2 says, beforecreation, all was “formless and void,” what in Hebrew is called Tohu wah-bohu.One student of chaos magick writes, “chaos magick is the art of forming theunformed energies of creative chaos into a pattern leading to the outcome of themagician’s desire.”32 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber107] As with Neville, inchaos magick, desire is the fundamental motivation for “making things happen.”Kenneth Grant, a onetime student of Crowley’s, brought Spare’s work to a new,wider audience and made his own contribution to the prehistory of chaos magick.As Lévi did with the Tarot, in The Magical Revival Grant fused a nonexistentconnection between Crowley’s magick and the weird fiction of H. P. Lovecraft.Lovecraft was an avowed materialist who dismissed any kind of magic or occultreality, but the terrifying inhabitants of his Cthulhu Mythos have spawned morethan one magical cult, with rituals and ceremonies designed to attract andpropitiate these cosmic horrors. This is an example of how chaos magick usesculture—or memes—for its own purposes.Chaos magick finds other predecessors in the “cut-ups” of the Beat writerWilliam S. Burroughs and the artist Brion Gysin. These “literary” works, such asThe Soft Machine and The Ticket That Exploded, mix Burroughs’s own wordsrandomly with those culled from other writers, newspapers, magazines, andadvertisements in order to undermine rational, logical thought and enter someliminal “Neither-Neither” state. Burroughs was following in the footsteps ofearly twentieth-century anti-art movements like Dada, which owed their impact totheir illogical, contradictory products. (Even the name Dada means nothing; itis a French term for “hobby horse.”) In the 1970s, the writer Robert AntonWilson promoted a kind of “chaos philosophy” through his Illuminatus!trilogy—written with Bob Shea—a hilarious spoof on conspiracy theories whichfeatured Eris, the Greek goddess of discord, known to the Romans as Discordia.RAW, as he was known to his readers, continued the joke in other books likeCosmic Trigger, which were influenced by the work of Aleister Crowley, TimothyLeary, and an assortment of other countercultural icons.But the real start of chaos magick proper was in London in the 1970s.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •AS THE HISTORIAN of modern magic Dave Evans points out, the idea of a history ofchaos magick is, aptly enough, oxymoronic, given that, like postmodernism, chaosmagick affects an atemporal, ahistorical character, picking and choosing fromthe past, present, and, often enough, the future. And as with postmodernism, forchaos magick the idea of “truth” or “facts” is anathema. As Evans writes, “bytheir very nature Chaos magicians (or Chaotes) are fond of deception, playingwith words and demolishing the nature of beliefs”—they were, it seems, way aheadof “post-truth.” With their penchant for pseudonyms and for referring, asLovecraft did, to nonexistent literary sources, the information chaos magiciansprovide is at best “open to academic suspicion.”33[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber108] The histories of figures like Crowley, MadameBlavatsky, Gurdjieff, and even Neville are filled with tall tales and falsetrails, but chaos magicians seem to make a point of providing ampledisinformation.Most accounts place the appearance of chaos magick with a group of North Londonoccultists known as the Stoke Newington Sorcerers circa 1976. Among these wasPeter Carroll, whose book Liber Null is the acknowledged first “how-to” work onchaos magick. “Null” means zero, and Julian Vayne, another chaos magician, callschaos magick “empty handed.”34 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber109] Carroll wasfamiliar with the work of Spare and was a contributor to New Equinox, an occultmagazine, and he and its editor, Ray Sherwin, were both tired of the traditionalmagical scene. Most magic then was of the Crowley/Golden Dawn or pagan variety,concerned with achieving the “knowledge and conversation” of one’s “HolyGuardian Angel” or harmonizing with the powers of nature. Carroll and Sherwinwanted stronger stuff. They weren’t concerned with getting their pentaclescorrect or being at one with nature but with “making something happen,” that iswith magick as real power. Sherwin himself wrote a tract called The Book ofResults, which sounds like a New Thought title. Like pragmatism and positivethinking, chaos magick was interested in what works.Something known as the Deptford Olympic Goat Roast, coinciding with the 1976Montreal Olympics, seems to have been chaos magick’s “foundational” event.Carroll lived in Deptford in South London, an area associated with the earlydays of punk rock, and as might be expected the event included a spitted roastedgoat, a punk music ensemble, and a fireworks display put on by some of the localanarchists. Chaos magick arose in the atmosphere of the Sex Pistols, whose debutrelease in November 1976, “Anarchy in the U.K.,” set the tone for what was tocome. It’s not surprising that Chaotes earned a reputation as “punk magicians.”The idea behind punk was “do-it-yourself” and about creating as much havoc aspossible, at least in the UK version. Chaos magick was not far behind. And justas Johnny Rotten sneered at earlier rock groups like the Beatles or Pink Floyd,chaos magicians blasphemed against their magical predecessors. As Carroll wrote,“Magic will not free itself of occultism until we have strangled the lastastrologer with the guts of the last spiritual master.”35[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber110] “Shocking” statements like these earnedchaoticians a reputation as magick’s bad boys.Carroll formed a loosely knit collective called the Illuminates of Thanateros,known as the IOT, “Thanateros” being a portmanteau name made up of the Greeknames for the gods of death (Thanatos) and sex (Eros), linking the two intypical romantic fashion.36 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber111] An organizedanarchical group is something of an oxymoron, but it was precisely this kind oflogic that chaos magick wanted to overthrow.Carroll was an efficient mover and shaker, and branches of the IOT sprouted inGermany, Austria, Switzerland, and Australia, as well as in other parts ofBritain. Chaos magick’s collective international character, based on earlier“street radical” groups like the 1960s Situationists, was part of its appeal.Chaotes around the world kept in touch in pre-internet days via the ChaosInternational Magazine. The incorporation of cultural icons that characterizeschaos magick was in place early on. A major influence came from the Britishfantasy writer Michael Moorcock, whose Eternal Champion series depicts anongoing timeless battle between the forces of Order and Chaos. The symbol ofChaos in Moorcock’s books, an eight-pointed star, became a brand logo for themovement. One has to say it got around. Alexander Dugin, Vladimir Putin’sTraditionalist adviser, is a Chaote himself, and photographs of him on the netshow Moorcock’s “chaos star” in the background.Another novel that chaoticians found useful was William Gibson’s Neuromancer, aninfluential work of early cyberculture. A group in the UK midlands city Lincolncalled itself the Lincoln Order of Neuromancers, or L.O.O.N. It brought togetherthen cutting-edge technology with old-time magic—neuromancer echoes necromancer,one who speaks with the dead—but if critics called the members “loonies,” theywouldn’t have minded. Their method of banishing unwanted spirits is typical ofchaos magick. Rather than perform the traditional ritual, they shouted, “Fuckoff you bastards.”37 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber112] On a less crude note,many chaoticians employ a method known as “banishing with laughter.” Thisplayful approach says much about chaos magick’s appeal.Probably the most famous chaos organization was Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth(TOPY), formed by the performance artist Genesis P-Orridge. P-Orridge was partof the “industrial” music group Throbbing Gristle, which spiced theirperformances with hard pornography and Nazi imagery. TOPY was a kind ofcult-cum–fan club and magical organization, geared toward exploring the“transgressive” side of magic. Among its antinomian influences were the ProcessChurch of the Final Judgment—big in the 1960s—Burroughs, Gysin, Crowley, AntonLaVey of Church of Satan fame, the “love and death” guru Charles Manson, andchaos magick.38 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber113] P-Orridge is a proponent of“occulture,” a portmanteau expressing the blend of occultism and popular culturethat has come to characterize chaos magick. The meme magick that helped putTrump—himself a popular culture icon—in the White House was, we can say, a workof occulture.But enough history. How does it work?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE FIRST THING to understand is that chaos magick is in tune with the times,not with the infinite. “While other magical systems promise stability, an anchorinto fixed time and an ordered universe,” writes Phil Hine, “chaos magick moveswith the fusion and fluidity of modern life.” Unlike Traditionalism, chaosmagick accepts the modern and postmodern world. In fact, it positively revels init. It embraces its sense of flux and transience and its plethora of images. Itrecognizes that “we live in a world that is rapidly changing . . . where theapplication of high technology and media saturation enables us to mix stylesendlessly, where elements of the past, present, and possible futures areconjured up in most aspects of everyday life.”39[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber114] Rather than retreat from this, as some“spiritual” people do, chaoticians want to learn how to steer it toward theirown ends, much like, we might say, a jujitsu master who uses his opponent’sforce against him rather than his own.As with Austin Osman Spare, chaos magick wants to sink a desire down into thedeep unconscious, to the “Neither-Neither” or “unconditioned awareness of being”that Neville spoke of, our inner primal chaos. It wants to widen the borders ofAchievable Reality. It does this by grasping the flow of events and “nudging” ittoward what is wanted. The stability and constancy of “consensus reality,” whatwe usually accept as normal, is really an illusion; as with postmodernism andmuch of New Thought, for chaos magick reality is what we make of it.Chaos theory, which chaos magick draws on, speaks of a “sensitivity to initialconditions.” This is the source of the famous “butterfly effect,” which makes abutterfly’s wings flapping in China responsible for rain in Wyoming. Chaosmagick works on a similar principle. It recognizes that the right tap at theright time in the right place can move a situation in the way it wants. Magickcomes in because there is no obvious causal relation between the chaosmagician’s tap and the outcome, just as there is no obvious link between aChinese butterfly and a thunderstorm in Cheyenne. We can say that chaos magickworks by inducing synchronicities, by somehow purposefully creating meaningfulchance events.If we accept the reality of synchronicity, of events in the inner and outerworld happening in a synchronized manner, with no apparent causal relation but avery significant meaningful one, then we have no reason to deny a priori thepossibility that chaos magick, and New Thought, can work. That they do work is adifferent question. If this is so, then the idea that a cartoon frogappropriated by a far-right group helped to put the positively thinking DonaldJ. Trump in the White House is not beyond the realm of possibility. And one hasto say that is precisely the sort of thing—and through precisely suchmethods—that a chaos magician would like to bring about.How one does this, according to Julian Vayne and Greg Humphries, is to “take oneparticular variable in a situation and magically ‘nudge’ it so that thesituation develops in a way that turns to your advantage.”40[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber115] How does one “nudge” the situation? Through aritual that puts one in touch with the primal creative chaos, Spare’s“Neither-Neither” or Neville’s “unconditioned awareness of being.” Here thechaos magician has a free, or rather empty, hand. There are no constraints onwhat he or she can use, and most chaos magick rituals are rather like recipeswith many novel and unusual ingredients. And as with cooking, the proof of thepudding is in the eating. Here it shares much of its “how to” character with NewThought.A ritual is seen as any structured series of events designed to bring about aspecific end. The paraphernalia are up for grabs. So there are instructions onhow to make a talisman, an energized ritual object, out of a fridge magnet, orusing a picture of the singer PJ Harvey as an image of the Hindu goddess Kali.There is even a ritual in which the part of Harpocrates, the Egyptian god ofsilence, is played by Harpo Marx, the mute Marx brother. Chaos magick, like punkrock, is “a return to basic principles.” It does this by stripping away all theexcess baggage of tradition to reach the fundamentals. Anything that excites theimagination and stirs the magical will is fair game.Like much New Thought, a magickal work starts with a “statement of intent,” whatyou want to do. As in positive thinking, it should be something one couldachieve through “normal” means, only one’s idea of what constitutes “normality”is widened. The “art of making coincidence happen” begins with “changing ourstate of mind.” Through this we can “change the patterns of events in our lives”and so “control our destinies.”41 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber116] If we thinkdifferently we will act differently and so will those around us. What isnecessary is to break out of our “existing cognitive habits” and make the“creative leap beyond what is already known.”42[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber117] If we can free ourselves of the “tyranny ofConsensus Reality” by creating an inner Temporary Autonomous Zone, we canachieve the “deep certainty that one’s sorcery will yield the desired result.”43[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber118] As with Neville and Norman Vincent Peale,chaos magick works by convincing yourself that it already has. It aims to “forman intent in one’s mind, and simply know that the purpose is already achieved bythe formation of thought.”44 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber119]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT SEEMS THAT positive thinking, New Thought, and chaos magick all work on thepower of belief. As William James knew, the will to believe can accomplishremarkable things. But is it always a power for good? Let’s see."},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]CHAPTER THREEGURUS AND DEMAGOGUESTHE CREATIVE POWER of belief is not limited to devotees of New Thought or toadherents of chaos magick. It is also not a power exclusively for good. The roadto hell, we know, is paved with good intentions, and many a true believer hashelped lay out its tarmac. Self-belief, we can say, is a necessary ingredient inany successful creative effort, any act of will. As William James saw, believingthat you can do something is an indispensable aid in actually doing it. And itis a truism of practically all self-help and personal improvement philosophiesthat if you believe in yourself, other people will believe in you too. In somecases, they will be absolutely desperate to do so.With this in mind, consider the following quotations:Be assured, we too put faith in the first place and not cognition. One has tobelieve in a cause. Only faith creates a state.We want to believe, we have to believe; mankind needs a credo. Faith movesmountains because it gives us the illusion that mountains do move. This illusionis perhaps the only real thing in life.1 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber120]The first quotation comes from Adolf Hitler, who said this to his followers in1927. The second comes from Benito Mussolini, who wrote it in 1912, and whomHitler was consciously echoing.Both Hitler and Mussolini wanted people to believe in them, and both found thatthis was precisely what many people wanted to do. They, it seemed, were made foreach other. How Hitler and Mussolini got millions of people to believe in themwas by believing in themselves and their respective causes, in Hitler’s caseNational Socialism and in Mussolini’s fascism. They did not win this beliefthrough argument, persuasive reasoning, or a convincing display of facts. Theydidn’t force people to believe nor did they buy their compliance. Something muchdeeper and more immediate was at work. Something that is a part of the veryfabric of our being.Mussolini and Hitler gathered the masses behind them by fulfilling a need, avery powerful one, and also by meeting a desire. The need is to believe that ourlives have some meaning and purpose beyond that of fulfilling our basic animalappetites. This is the essence of all religion. We need to feel there is somereason for our existence. The lack of this belief leads to nihilism, the beliefin nothing, a condition that postmodernism seems to have saddled us with today.Man, we know, does not live by bread alone; if he did, any feasible plan for theequitable distribution of the planet’s resources would solve the world’sproblems overnight. As George Orwell, a witness to the rise of populistdemagogues in pre–World War II Europe, wrote, “Hitler . . . knows that humanbeings don’t only want comfort, safety, short working hours, hygiene, birthcontrol and, in general, common sense; they also want struggle andself-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty parades.”2[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber121]Orwell is critical of such romantic longings, but he knows that if they aren’tmet in some legitimate way, they will be satisfied by other means. We all have aneed to feel that our lives are part of something larger than ourselves—everydevoted football fan or pop star follower knows that—and Hitler and Mussoliniwere adept at providing many people in Germany and Italy with the sense thatthey belonged to some larger reality beyond their everyday lives. This is whyall attempts to explain Hitler’s success through economic, class, or some other“rational” reason are ultimately inadequate. They leave what we might call the“existential” element out of their reckoning, the need for a meaning to lifemore significant than a full stomach. How we fulfill that need is a seriousquestion. Authoritarianism, whether in the form of a demagogue or a guru, is adubious means of doing so. But that this need exists is without doubt. And thisleads to my second point.The desire Hitler and Mussolini met in millions of people was a simple one: tobe free of the burden of giving meaning to their lives themselves, of fulfillingtheir hunger for “struggle and self-sacrifice,” for some greater purpose thanthe satisfaction of their own appetites, through their own efforts. This is atemptation we all face at some time. As Laurence Rees writes in his analysis ofHitler’s “dark charisma,” “the desire to be led by a strong personality in acrisis, the craving for existence to have some kind of purpose, thequasi-worship of ‘heroes’ and ‘celebrities,’ the longing for salvation andredemption,” have much more to do with the success of populist dictators likeHitler and Mussolini, and, we might say, Trump, than any rational argument.3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber122]Something more, some sense of adventure, however misguided or misplaced, isnecessary for human beings to feel that their life is not pointless. People needfood, water, a place to live, and some kind of relationship to others. But whatthey need more than anything else is meaning, something Nietzsche andpsychologists like Jung, Viktor Frankl, and Abraham Maslow said long ago. And ifthey cannot find that sense of meaning in themselves or create it through theirown efforts, they will get it from someone else. As Colin Wilson writes in hisstudy of “rogue messiahs,” such people “want to find someone in whom they canbelieve as unreservedly as saints believe in God, and on to whom they cantransfer all their longings for a golden age and a life without moralresponsibility.”4 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber123] But as Wilson points out,such a relationship more times than not proves disastrous, for both thedisciples and the leader. The leader fulfills a need in the disciples, but thedisciples grow more and more necessary to the leader. His dominance over thembecomes a kind of psychological crutch. The need to lead and the need to followoften find themselves in a dysfunctional relationship.There seems to be an inverse ratio between a people’s lack of self-belief andthe enthusiasm with which they embrace a belief in someone else, provided hedisplays enough self-belief to fill the void within them. The examples aboverefer to how “charismatic leaders,” as the sociologist Max Weber called them, doprecisely this. For Weber such figures are set apart from ordinary men and areoften seen as superhuman or supernatural. Charisma is of Greek origin and meansa “gift of grace.” According to the psychologist Anthony Storr, charismaticpeople have “a special magical quality of personality” that sets them apart fromordinary men and women. They immediately impress and influence others andattract followers easily.5 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber124] If they operate inthe political world, their politics is less about shorter working hours orcommon sense, as Orwell noted, than about the “broader, almost spiritual goalsof redemption and salvation,” what in Politics and the Occult I called“illuminated politics.”6 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber125] They do not representa political party but a way of life. As Laurence Rees wrote of Hitler’sdemocratic election, “it was almost as if the German people were voting for anemotional state, one which was physically manifested in the charismatic personof Adolf Hitler.”7 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber126]Charismatic political leaders often take on a quasi-religious character. And ifwe look at the careers of other charismatic individuals, we find manysimilarities between the two. Gurus and demagogues have much in common, and bothshare certain characteristics with magicians like Aleister Crowley, who was alsoa guru and who had clear political views, some of which exhibit a strangesimilarity with those making the news in our post-truth time.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ACCORDING TO ANTHONY Storr in his study of gurus, Feet of Clay, both charismaticleaders and gurus feel they have a peculiar mission and that they possess theunique powers needed to fulfill it. Throughout his campaign, Trump insisted thathe was the only one who could heal “crippled America,” in the way that a gurumight tell a disciple that it is only through him that he may reachenlightenment. Both gurus and demagogues tend to gather disciples or followersbut not to make real friends. Both exercise an authority over others, adominance they maintain by appearing to forgo all common human needs forintimacy, rest, relaxation, even food and drink and other “guilty pleasures,”the weaknesses that make the rest of us “only human” and set them apart assupermen.“A leader can have no equals, no friends,” Mussolini said, “and he must give hisconfidence to no one.” Like Hitler and Trump, Mussolini claimed that he “did notneed advice and rarely felt the need ever to discuss policy with anyone.”8[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber127] Gurus and demagogues rarely enjoy small talk,and tend to avoid one-to-one conversation. They feel most at home addressing acrowd, when they can have complete control over their self-image, the personathey present to the world and through which they can influence it. It is herealso that their dominance can express itself most clearly. The leader becomesthe voice of the crowd, his speech giving form to the dreams and longings of thepeople in it. But the crowd also serves as a kind of mirror for the leader; init he sees his own self projected large and receives confirmation of his ownself-belief. As Storr points out, many gurus exhibit narcissistic traits, andthe same is true of charismatic leaders.Charismatic leaders also tend to be unpredictable. This is true of Trump, but itwas also a part of Hitler’s and Mussolini’s personalities, and is axiomatic forchaos magick. It is also true of the kind of gurus who exhibit “crazy wisdom.”Here the teacher performs unconventional acts, at least from the perspective ofthe nonbeliever, like the Zen master arbitrarily whacking his pupil on the head.The crazy guru’s motives, incomprehensible to the average person, are beyondscrutiny. Hitler, Mussolini, and Trump all said they favored their instinctsover reason and came to decisions suddenly, with firm resolution. According tohis biographer Denis Mack Smith, Mussolini liked to give the impression that heknew exactly where he was going, but he also liked to be seen as “incalculable,inscrutable, always taking others by surprise.” He set small store in coherence,again much like Trump, and “knew the value of violent effects and contrasts andwas enough of an illusionist to revel in the way they baffled the . . .audiences he met every day.”9 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber128]Hitler too made sudden, snap decisions and kept his entire program “deliberatelyvague on detail.”10 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber129] National Socialism was a“movement,” in German a Bewegung, rather than a political party. This gave it areligious character. People did not join the movement; they were swept up by it.The philosopher Jean Gebser witnessed the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1920sand concluded that the “group mind” emerging at the rallies was an expression ofwhat he called the “magical structure of consciousness.”11[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber130] Jung believed the German people wereoverwhelmed by an archetype from the Collective Unconscious.12[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber131] And while there is no evidence that Hitlerused “occult powers” to gain control of Germany—much literature on “occultNazism” aside—as the historian Hans Thomas Hakl cautions, “to abandon the mythof the ‘occult roots of Nazism’ does not mean that the genesis of NationalSocialism is explicable in purely materialistic terms.”13[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber132]Hitler’s vagueness allowed for flexible and multiple interpretations and let hisfollowers fill the gaps with their own projections. It allowed for a hazy senseof broad, overall meanings that Hitler could allude to with an inflection of hisvoice or a gesture of his hands. It did not matter that, when read in the coldlight of day, Hitler’s speeches lacked almost any concrete content. He was notpresenting ideas but stimulating an emotion. The great leader is antinomian,that is, not held back by the rules and not responsible to anyone but himself.He is beyond good and evil, and logic too, or at least is the author of theirdefinition. It is this presumed infallibility that gives him his power over aflock or a nation.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE GURU’S OR charismatic demagogue’s absolute certainty in his judgmentradiates out to his followers and puts them in a kind of ecstatic trance,temporarily lifting them beyond themselves. Earlier we saw that one of the aimsof chaos magick was to achieve “visible results by which the magiciandemonstrates to himself that he can do things which, a short while ago, neverentered his mind as possibilities.” Such is often the effect of a powerful guruor demagogue. A follower of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, one of the gurus Storrstudied, said that his guru “seemed to radiate energy and to awakenpossibilities in those who came into contact with him.”14[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber133] Similarly Hitler’s followers gained greatconfidence and self-esteem through their belief in him. Through him their livesbecame special.They became special because Hitler gave his followers a powerful sense of a“release from the limitations of all conventional restraint.” This is not farremoved from what New Thought and chaos magick aspire to, with their desire tore-create reality.15 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber134] If what is fundamental inchaos magick is to break out of our “existing cognitive habits” and make the“creative leap beyond what is already known,” and if, as positive thinking tellsus, “attitudes are more important than facts,” then we must recognize that themagical effect of demagogues and gurus can also manage this.16[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber135]In the case of Hitler and Mussolini, the “release from all conventionalrestraint” led to heinous acts of violence, in which neither chaos magicians,for all their punky rhetoric, nor positive thinkers are interested. But evenwith less dangerous characters, such as the magician Aleister Crowley, therelease from “all conventional restraint” led, more times than not, toquestionable, if not tragic consequences. “Do what thou wilt” can too easilyturn into “Do what you like,” or even “Just Do It,” and such an ethos oftenspells disaster.This power to entrance, to project a vision of the world and of himself, is partof the guru’s and demagogue’s appeal, as it is of the magician’s. It is hisglamour, his allure, his ability to conjure realities, to provide a spectacle ofpower, to draw his magic cloak around himself and “make things happen.” Glamour,style, image, appearance, the confidence they instill in the magician and thebelief they inspire in his audience are important parts of chaos magick. Henceits penchant for changing beliefs as one would a set of clothes. Mussolini had asimilar taste for self-dramatizing and for casting a self-image. In his earlysocialist days, he would appear “ill-dressed, dirty, and unshaven” whenappearing in public as a “proletarian leader,” but change into “patent leathershoes and a silk-lapelled coat” in private. He reminded some who knew him of a“burlesque actor” and he admitted that he once wanted to be a famous writer ormusician, much as a young Hitler had artistic aspirations. Mussolini soon foundhe lacked the talent to fulfill his dreams, but he was nevertheless determinedto be a “great man.”17 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber136] As with Hitler, whatmight have found a safe home in some creative pursuit was let loose on the worldwith savage fury.Hitler also early on knew the importance of keeping up appearances. He was oneof the first to grasp the central importance of propaganda and to make use ofthe new media of radio and film, much as today’s meme magicians use theinternet. He also knew that because of these media, propaganda must not beboring. It must entertain, something Hitler’s spin doctor, Joseph Goebbels,reminded him of repeatedly.Trump has an advantage here over his charismatic predecessors in that he spentyears entertaining millions of viewers through reality TV.18[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber137] The crossover between the “real” world and thetelevised one helps make the union of politics and entertainment more effective.All becomes spectacle, postmodern bread and circuses, that serves the familiarpurpose of directing attention elsewhere. Radical thinkers like the SituationistGuy Debord and the postmodernist Jean Baudrillard have spoken of the “society ofthe spectacle,” built on the media-saturated public’s taste for endlessdistraction.19 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber138] Baudrillard even remarked onhow the 1991 Gulf War “did not take place,” a comment on how its reality wasovershadowed by its media representation, its “simulacrum.”20[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber139]Street hustlers do the same thing. The confidence trickster gains his power overhis victim by making them feel good about believing him. The audience mystifiedby the magician’s tricks wants to be fooled—does anyone ever get angry at DerrenBrown for doing this?—just as the disciples of a guru want to jettison theircritical minds and accept the new reality he gives them. The appeal of all threeis ultimately an emotional one.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE GURU AND DEMAGOGUE’S complete conviction in himself gives him this power.Through it he is able to reduce life’s complexity to a simple duality of goodand evil, black and white, sacred and profane, winners and losers, “us” and“them.” Hitler, Mussolini, and Trump all share a very bleak vision of life, adog-eat-dog outlook in which the strong prosper and the weak go under, anoutlook that Crowley shared. A strict yes or no guides them. This simplicity isreassuring and accounts for the rise of fundamentalisms of different sorts,whether religious, social, or gender based, on either side of the politicalspectrum. It relieves followers of the painful business of navigating thedifficult waters of life on their own and provides them with a map to charttheir way through any situation. This is as true of convinced Marxists as it isof dogmatic Scientologists. All arguments to the contrary are undermined inadvance by the simple knack of having all answers to all questions ready athand. “Listening to Bhagwan, I gradually came to realize that he knows, he hasthe power, that if only I can say, ‘Yes, I leave everything to you,’ everythingwill be taken care of.”21 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber140]Such a safety net for life sounds tempting. In the face of an increasinglycomplex world, who would not want the burden of having to decide what was rightand what was wrong, what to think and what to do, even what to eat and what towear, lifted from them? But this relief comes at a price. One must neverquestion the guru.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •“GURUS,” ANTHONY STORR writes,” tend to be intolerant of any kind of criticism,believing that anything less than total agreement is equivalent to hostility.”22[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber141] As Storr points out, such an outlook isprofoundly narcissistic and easily bleeds into paranoia; the illogic that he whodoes not agree with me must be against me has led to many dark deeds. Suchcriticism could be met with meaningful silence, a torrent of abuse, rage, orexcommunication. But the kind of complete loyalty and acceptance ofinfallibility common to some gurus is also required from demagogues. “There issomething mystical, inexpressible, almost comprehensible about this oneman. . . . For us the Führer is simply infallible in all matters political andall other issues concerning the national and social interest of the people,”said Hermann Göring, one of Hitler’s main apostles.23[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber142] And if for some reason someone was foolishenough to mutter a word of caution about the leader’s decision, he would belucky if all he received was a blistering rebuke. With Hitler or Mussolini, hewould most likely be shot.Such instances suggest that many gurus and charismatic leaders are examples ofwhat Colin Wilson calls the “Right Man,” a term he borrowed from thescience-fiction writer A. E. van Vogt. A “Right Man”—or Right Woman, for thephenomenon isn’t limited to males—“will never, under any circumstances, admitthat he is in the wrong.”24 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber143] If faced withevidence to the contrary, he will do everything to deny it, including resortingto violence, even murder. He responds to criticism in this way because he is“characterized by a deep, nagging sense of inferiority, a feeling that he isultimately inadequate to meet the challenges of life.” Van Vogt first came uponthe Right Man through studying divorce cases, in which the husband treated hiswife and family as if he were a dictator—or the leader of a cult of which theywere members. That, of course, was bad enough, but what happens when the RightMan is a dictator? “When Right Men also happen to possess real power,” Wilsonwrites, “like Hitler or Stalin or Mao Tse-tung, they are perfectly capable ofordering the deaths of millions of people. The slightest show ofopposition . . . fills them with murderous rage; it seems self-evident that suchpeople deserve to die.”25 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber144]Gurus rarely have the power to express their “rightness” with such savagery,although some of the cases that Wilson examines in The Devil’s Party reachsufficient enormity. The sarin attack on Tokyo commuters launched by the AumShinrikyo followers of Shoko Asahara in 1995, the forced deaths of hundreds offollowers of the Reverend Jim Jones in 1978, and the murders committed by theself-proclaimed prophet of the Reformed Latter Day Saints Jeffrey Lundgren in1989 can serve as gruesome examples. And as Storr points out, the followers ofRajneesh were not reluctant to resort to crime and violence when they seemedexpedient.26 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber145] But even on a smaller scale, theabuse of power that often comes with the supreme self-conviction characteristicof gurus and demagogues makes itself known in a discouraging number of cases.Storr and Wilson do not say that all gurus or spiritual leaders are abusive,just as not all political leaders are corrupt. It is the leader/followerdominance syndrome and its often disastrous consequences that interests them.What seems to happen is that the power gurus have over others—and, less often,over themselves—usually leads to their downfall. When used to actualize andovercome oneself—one’s limited egocentric viewpoint—power, meaning strength ofwill and character, is a good. When indulged in as a means of dominatingothers—always a risk—the will to power becomes something altogether different.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •POWER IS PERHAPS the greatest intoxicant because it is linked to the feeling oflife itself. Nietzsche knew this, and it helped him to outgrow Schopenhauer’spessimism. “What is good?” he asks in The Antichrist.All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man.What is bad?—All that proceeds from weakness.What is happiness?—The feeling that power increases—that a resistance isovercome.27 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber146]Nietzsche’s rhetoric is powerful itself and is too often quoted out of contextto support attitudes and beliefs he did not share; that is an occupationalhazard of a good writer. Nietzsche is not advocating power over others, as he isoften said to be, but power over oneself. Life, Nietzsche tells us, is that“which must overcome itself again and again.”28[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber147] His Übermensch—usually mistranslated as“superman”—is not a demigod or member of a master race lording it over the restof us, but someone who has “overcome” himself, an “overman.” When Nietzsche’sprophet Zarathustra addresses the people in the marketplace and says, “Man issomething that should be overcome,” he means exactly what Bernard Shaw meant inMan and Superman when he says that “as long as I can conceive of somethingbetter than myself I cannot be easy unless I am striving to bring it intoexistence or clearing the way for it.” The greatest sense of power comes fromovercoming one’s own weaknesses and strengths, from growing beyond oneself. Thisis what creative evolution is about.But Nietzsche the psychologist knows that often this will to power finds othermore immediately stimulating channels and that it is all too easy to develop thehabit of following those rather than developing the more legitimate means ofheightening our sense of power, that is of growth. Indeed, one sign ofself-mastery is that one outgrows the temptation to get a quick, cheap thrill atthe expense of one’s development. But this is a trap that many gurus anddemagogues enter, some unaware, others quite willingly.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •AS COLIN WILSON discovered, one of the avenues for this is sex. Both Jim Jonesand David Koresh—leader of the Branch Davidian sect involved in the Waco tragedyof 1993—demanded and received sexual liberties among their flock that rivaled orexceeded those of any despotic sultan. Both exhibited characteristic Right Mantraits and both used sexual dominance over their followers as a means of shoringup their own perpetually threatened sense of superiority.29[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber148] In terms of the psychologist Abraham Maslow’s“hierarchy of needs,” characters like Jones and Koresh, and other less murderousgurus, are stuck at the “self-esteem” level.30 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber149]Their natural dominance places them over their followers, but their constantneed to bolster their sense of self-worth compels them to find more and moreways to exert their authority. In the small world of a cult, in which they livedlike dictators, their every whim was quickly gratified; they were free from “thelimitations of all conventional restraint” and quickly deteriorated, withhorrific consequences. Maslow’s next level, that of “self-actualization,” inwhich the approval of others is no longer needed or desired, escaped them. Theirwill to power over others was an addiction that eventually destroyed them.Other instances of a guru’s use of sex as a sign of dominance may manifest lesscrudely or dangerously. In 1991 the Traditionalist philosopher and spiritualteacher Frithjof Schuon, most known for his book The Transcendent Unity ofReligions, was indicted by an Indiana grand jury for child molestation. Althoughthe case was subsequently dropped, controversy remains over what exactly tookplace at the “primordial gatherings” where the alleged offense supposedlyhappened.31 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber150] These gatherings were specialceremonies in which the eighty-four-year-old Swiss Schuon sat naked, orpractically so, in the middle of a circle of naked or scantily clad dancingwomen followers, among whom were some underage girls. Although no sexual actstook place between Schuon and the girls, they were said to come into closecontact with his genitals. At different times during these gatherings Schuon issaid to have worn a Native American warbonnet, a horned headdress, or a turban,and they were “primordial” in the sense of entering that space of transcendentbeing that Traditionalists believe is the source of all revelation.At the time of the gatherings, Schuon had come to see himself as, if not divine,then not far from it, a belief he shared with Rajneesh, who often dispensedgifts of his hair or nail parings, considered sacred, to his devotees.32[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber151] According to the historian of TraditionalismMark Sedgwick, Schuon had moved away from his original adherence toSufism—something he had shared with René Guénon—and had become obsessed withcreating a “form of universalism that placed increasing emphasis on Schuonhimself.”33 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber152] He was convinced that he was “thehuman instrument for the manifestation of the Religio Perennis at the end oftime,” a final religion bringing the different scattered strands of revelationtogether.34 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber153] Animals were said to recognize hisdivinity, an insight they apparently shared with the archbishop of Strasbourg.Those who did not were said to be “frozen in their tracks.”35[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber154] He died in 1998.Schuon’s supporters were quick to come to his defense, arguing that his interestin nudity and his appreciation of the female body were elements in a profoundspirituality.36 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber155] Eyebrows may rise at the imageof a naked octogenarian guru amid a bevy of devoted naked beauties, but Schuon’sinterest in “sacred nudity” went back many years and involved the Virgin Mary.In 1965, on a ship heading across the Mediterranean to Morocco, Schuon wasdepressed at his lack of spiritual progress; the asthma he suffered from did notmake things better. It was then that the Virgin Mary came to him, and he felt“the heavenly comfort that gushed from the essential feminine.”37[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber156] To get closer to this, Schuon believed heneeded to be naked, as the baby Jesus was. From then on, Schuon went unclothedas often as possible.Not long after this he saw a statuette of the Virgin in a store window and wascompelled to buy it. In 1966, he had another vision. The statuette began to“quiver and stir slightly,” and the Virgin appeared to him, naked. From then onhe believed he had been given a “universal mission” and enjoyed a specialrelationship with the Virgin and God. Part of this special relationship includedpaintings he made of the Virgin in which she is naked with her genitals in fullview. After this Schuon believed that “everything he did had a sacralcharacter.” A further vision in 1973 filled him with “the overwhelmingconsciousness that I am not as other men.”38 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber157]In one sense this was clearly true. Like other gurus, Schuon took more than onewife.39 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber158] One was his wife on the “horizontal”plane, the sort most other men have. The other three—he had four in all—werewhat he called “vertical” wives, with whom he had a relationship of a purelyspiritual nature. But Schuon’s conviction that he was “not as other men” and wasthe “human instrument” or avatar of a new universal religion was so powerfulthat it convinced the members of his Bloomington, Indiana, community—some wouldsay cult— that they were in the presence of a spiritual prophet of uniquecharacter. His wives and the other members of his spiritual community, theMaryamiyya, whose devotees included the composer John Tavener—although heparticipated from afar in England—were expected to revere Schuon.40[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber159]Someone less convinced was a boyfriend of one of Schuon’s vertical wives, whowhen told that their relationship must end, spoke to the authorities about the“primordial gatherings.” It is unclear exactly why the case was dropped or howmuch influence Schuon’s followers brought to bear in this. In the end, theboyfriend came to feel that the primordial gatherings were not so much about sexin itself as about “serving the power needs of Schuon.”41[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber160]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •SOMETIMES SEX ISN’T the way in which a guru’s power is expressed. This seems tohave been the case with the one guru I met and had some contact with. In 1986,in Lucknow, India, Andrew Cohen, then thirty-one, met the guru H. W. L. Poonja.Cohen had been seeking spiritual enlightenment for some time and he was in luck.Practically as soon as they met, Poonja declared that Cohen was enlightened. Hisinitiation avoided the usual years of effort. Poonja taught that to achieveenlightenment, one must simply realize that one already had it. Cohen consideredthis, and when Poonja said that he was now his successor, he agreed.Cohen’s spiritual quest, which began with an experience of “cosmicconsciousness” at sixteen, had ended. Poonja, too, felt relieved; he said he hadbeen “waiting for Andrew all his life,” rather as Abdullah had been waiting forNeville. From then until 2013, Cohen taught a system of spiritual development hecalled “evolutionary enlightenment.”Over twenty-seven years Cohen created a successful international following andorganization, known as EnlightenNext, whose philosophy combined Easternteachings with the evolutionary ideas of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, SriAurobindo, Ken Wilber, and others. It differed from other spiritual teachingsanchored in Advaita, or nondualism, by seeing “enlightenment” as an evolutionaryprocess rather than a once-and-for-all event. Over the years Cohen garneredendorsements from prestigious names in the “mind, body, spirit” milieu, likeDeepak Chopra, Jean Houston, Michael Murphy—one of the founders of the EsalenInstitute—and Barbara Marx Hubbard, and he was keen to bring others into thefold.42 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber161]But the philosophy of “evolutionary enlightenment” was only part of Cohen’sattraction. What clinched it for devotees was Andrew himself. Like Rajneesh hewas said to have a special quality, a unique radiance of deeper consciousnesswhich he was able to transmit to others. Proximity to Cohen was a desired state.Those in his immediate surroundings shared in his spiritual glow.At least this was what some of his followers told me on New Year’s Eve 2010, atthe impressive EnlightenNext headquarters in Islington, a trendy up-market areaof North London. I had contributed a few articles to Cohen’s magazine, What IsEnlightenment?, later called EnlightenNext, and toward the end of 2010 was askedif I would take part in a “trialogue” on New Year’s Eve with Andrew and thewriter on mysticism Mike King.43 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber162] The topic wastime and how our consciousness now relates to the future.It turned out to be a pleasant evening. I met some very interesting andintelligent people, and my conversation with Cohen was friendly and engaging.But I did not find him as impressive a spiritual teacher as many of his devoteeshad. I had no contact with him after this, and in 2011 EnlightenNext stoppedpublishing.It wasn’t until a few years later that I saw articles on the internet asking“Whatever happened to Andrew Cohen?” In 2013 Cohen closed up shop on theEnlightenNext movement, off-loaded property and other assets, and stepped downfrom his guruship. This was precipitated by allegations of physical andpsychological abuse, financial intimidation, and dubious cultish behavior madeby people who were part of the EnlightenNext ashram Cohen had set up in Lenox,Massachusetts. In the face of these allegations, in a public apology Cohenrelinquished his twenty-seven-year reign as a “perfectly liberated spiritualmaster.”44 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber163]It had taken some time for Cohen to abdicate. Reports of abuse and spiritualdomination had been gathering for years. Even Cohen’s mother, who had given upher life to be with him in India in the early years, had turned against him. Inher book The Mother of God, Luna Tarlo said that she had gone from seeing herson as Buddha or Christ to thinking him another Jim Jones or Hitler. She toldJill Neimark of Psychology Today that “my son has become a monster to me,” andthat “the sweetest, sensitive kid had changed into an unrecognizable tyrant,”although she later revised her opinion of him.45[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber164]There was an assortment of accusations against Cohen. He had tried to fend theseoff, and a loyal band of followers had done what they could, but the dike hadburst and the flood came. He had taken quite a fall. Only a year before hisabdication he was ranked number 28 on the Mind, Body, Spirit magazine’s top 100most spiritual people of 2012. Now his reputation was shredded. Years earlier hehad denounced his erstwhile mentor Poonja for not meeting the standards offlawless behavior that he believed were required of a guru. Now Cohen was hoistby his own petard.The list of abuses was depressingly familiar.46[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber165] They included accusations of physicalviolence, hitting, slapping, and punching, either by Cohen himself or at hiscommand. Some students were ordered to attack others, or were restrained whileCohen hit them. One woman was forced to enter a freezing lake and had to betreated for hypothermia. One student had paint poured over his head, another wasforced to visit prostitutes and relate the experience in detail to his guru.Students were kept in isolation and had their passports, credit cards, or carkeys withheld. Those trying to escape had to do so “in the dead of night.” Thosecaught were subject to harassment, public embarrassment, or made to stay in anunused sauna that had been set up as a kind of “behavioral modification” cell.The walls were decorated with letters from students splattered with red paint,to symbolize the guru’s blood, and with drawings of ex-students falling offcliffs or meeting other sad ends.Sex was not a means of abuse, although the control of it by Cohen apparentlywas. Marriages were broken up, children separated from their parents, and somecouples were forbidden to have children, with reports of enforced tuballigations and vasectomies. Heavy fines were imposed for the infringements ofrules that changed without notice. Monetary gifts were accepted as penance forwrongs. There were also reports that Cohen used the organization’s money for hisown purposes. Students were coerced into making their own funds available forCohen’s use.The list goes on and makes for sad reading. One rationale for Cohen’s actionswas that everything was part of the “crazy wisdom” approach, and that Cohen wasdoing it for the students’ own good. It helped to break down their ego and getthem beyond themselves, a version of William James’s “bullying treatment.”Bullying may be helpful in some situations—Gurdjieff was notorious for makinglife difficult for his students—but Cohen’s behavior suggests a descent into adominance/submission cesspool. This went with the usual requirement that no onequestion his actions.As one former student wrote, “disagreeing with or challenging Andrew aboutanything was simply not permitted, and would be met with public humiliation andscorn. . . .” Letters addressed to Cohen had to begin “Dear Lord.”47[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber166] Colin Wilson wrote of the Right Man that“colleagues of such people were totally unaware of this paranoid behavior; theyfound him sociable and normal, a ‘nice guy.’ It was only in the privacy of hisfamily, where he felt he had total control, that he would behave like someeastern potentate.”48 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber167] Gurus are the heads ofvery extended families, but they often seem to act like the little Caesars ofthe home.49 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber168]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE KIND OF behavior Cohen seems to have exhibited is unquestionablyunacceptable, but one has to ask why so many of his followers put up with it forso long. In some cases the abuse went on for years. Why do so many disciples“seem to enjoy being bullied and battened upon?”50[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber169] Why do so many accept the lessons of “crazywisdom”? We might say that people attracted to spirituality, esotericism,“cosmic consciousness,” New Thought, or “eastern wisdom” are weak-minded, naïvefools to begin with, so it’s not surprising that they put up with abuse anyrational person would immediately reject. But what happens when the guru teachesan extreme rationalism herself?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •AYN RAND MAY not seem to fit the model of a guru, but accounts from her closefollowers suggest that she was the head of a cult. Rand came to fame in 1943with the publication of her novel The Fountainhead. It tells the story of HowardRoark, an architect with a mind of his own who refuses to compromise or topander to public taste, preferring independence and integrity to popularsuccess. Unusual for American fiction, it was a novel of ideas, and Rand’sfast-paced narrative, filled with striking characters, brought to life questionsabout the individual’s relation to society, about the clash of creativity andconformism, and about the conflict between freedom and security. It was filmedin 1949 with Gary Cooper in the lead role.The Fountainhead received strong praise and became a bestseller. But it wasRand’s next novel, her 1957 mammoth follow-up Atlas Shrugged, that turned herreadership into a huge cult following. Critics panned it but it became a popularsuccess, selling millions of copies, and laid the foundation for her philosophyof life, what became known as Objectivism. This was based on three centralthemes: reason, individualism, and capitalism, or as we might say, Aristotlemeets Andrew Carnegie.Atlas Shrugged takes place in America in an unspecified dystopian future whenexcessive regulations and government control lead many “captains of industry” toabandon their factories and disappear from public view. As the world’s economysteadily shrinks and conditions worsen, it gradually becomes clear that theworld’s men of genius and invention are “on strike,” refusing to contribute to asociety that hinders them through collectivism and state interference. Where inThe Fountainhead one man of integrity bucked the system, here a whole cadre ofthem do it. They are led by John Galt, a visionary determined to bring thesystem down and initiate a new world order.Rand’s pro-capitalist views were rooted in her early years in Russia. She wasborn Alisa Zinov’yevna Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg in 1905 to a Russian-Jewishfamily; she later took Ayn Rand as her pen name. Her father was a successfulpharmacist and good businessman who eventually owned his own pharmacy. Thebourgeois life Rand enjoyed as a young girl came to an end with the BolshevikRevolution of 1917. Her father’s business was commandeered and the family homelost. Rand was “purged” from the school she was attending. In 1926 she got avisa to visit relatives in the United States. She never returned.Rand’s experience of life under Vladimir Lenin fueled an almost religiousdevotion to free-market capitalism and a vehement rejection of societies thatsubjugate the individual to the mass. The symbol uniting conspirators in JohnGalt’s new order is the dollar sign. Rand believed that reason was the solemeans of securing knowledge and she rejected religion and mysticism; shepreferred Aristotle over Plato. After years working in Hollywood, Rand’sbreakthrough came with The Fountainhead. After Atlas Shrugged she abandonedfiction and devoted herself to spelling out the details of her philosophy ofObjectivism. She died in 1982.Objectivism denies the reality that New Thought and chaos magick embrace, of aworld and mind somehow intermixed. Reality exists independently ofconsciousness. We know it through reason and the senses and our aim in life isthe pursuit of happiness through rational self-interest. Rand’s outspokenrejection of altruism—by which the unproductive many profit by the productivefew—makes her anathema to socially minded people. Her forthright advocacy oflaissez-faire capitalism, the free market, and the rights of the individualmakes her an avatar of libertarianism.Her influence has been far-reaching. Devotees include the late Apple wizardSteve Jobs, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, and thecocreator of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, Steve Ditko.51[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber170] Other close Rand readers included AleisterCrowley and Donald Trump.52 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber171] Both Trump andCrowley identified with Howard Roark, the hero of The Fountainhead. Of the two,Trump is a closer match, given that Roark, a great builder, has orange hair.53[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber172] Trump even proposed a reality-TV show, TheTower, about his own life, inspired by The Fountainhead.54[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber173] Yet Crowley’s libertarian philosophy, spelledout in his Liber Oz—written during World War I while he was living in New Yorkwriting pro-German propaganda—strikes a Randian note. “Man has the right to liveby his own law,” Crowley wrote. He has the right to work, play, and love as hewill, and he has the right “to kill those who thwart these rights.”55[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber174]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IRONICALLY, FOLLOWING The Fountainhead, a group of Objectivist true believersknown as the Collective gathered around Rand. Alan Greenspan was one of them.Celebrating reason, individualism, and rational self-interest, according to JeffWalker in The Ayn Rand Cult, much of what the Collective got up to was mimickingRand as much as possible. This was based on the belief that Rand, like othergurus, was the exemplar par excellence of human virtue. As one ex-follower said,“Ayn was never wrong . . . about anything having to do with any aspect ofthought or of dealing with human beings.”56 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber175]This meant that “Ayn Rand is the greatest person that has ever lived or evershall live.”57 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber176] For a guru promotingrationalism, this seems a rather unreasonable belief.Rand’s reaction to any criticism suggests that she was a Right Woman. Thosearound her saw “how very quickly Rand could whip out the iron fist behind thevelvet glove and just tear a person to ribbons.” “She’d become incendiary oversome small thing,” another ex-follower said.58 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber177]As in the Stalin show trials of the 1930s, members were made to accept guilt fornonexistent crimes, or were excommunicated and turned into “nonpeople.” It’sdoubtful Rand caught the irony. She had little sense of humor and didn’t likesurprises, a characteristic she shared with Hitler and Mussolini.59[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber178]According to Nathaniel Branden, Rand’s lover and onetime second in command, theCollective “were a group organized around a charismatic leader. Our membersjudged one another’s character chiefly on our loyalty to that leader and to herideas.”60 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber179] Members were expected to like thethings Rand liked and to live as she lived. Many smoked because she did, evenusing cigarette holders as she did. Many followed her tastes in literature. Thisran from Victor Hugo to Mickey Spillane, author of hard-boiled detective fictionfeaturing the tough guy Mike Hammer.61 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber180]Spillane’s work, like I, the Jury, depicts a brutal world of black-and-whitegood or evil. Spillane’s Manichean vision appealed to Rand’s Aristotelianeither/or logic, something that Steve Ditko portrayed in his underground comiccharacter Mr. A.62 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber181] For Aristotle something iseither A or not-A; there are no in-betweens, which suggests that Austin OsmanSpare would not have taken to Rand. For Ditko, Spillane, and Rand, something iseither good or it is not. Another Ditko creation, The Question, has, like HowardRoark, orange hair.63 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber182]This black-or-white approach colored life around Rand. As Barbara Branden,another intimate, wrote, “innumerable times her shocked friends witnessed herverbal flailing of those she felt had failed her.”64[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber183] One of those who failed her was Nathaniel, whohaving left Barbara for Rand—a much older woman—then left Rand for a youngerwoman. The scandal led to the Brandens’ excommunication and a crisis inObjectivism, with Nathaniel labeled an apostate and his name stricken from theofficial Objectivist record. He went on to become a successful motivational guruin his own right, specializing in self-esteem.But “the dogmatic absolutism of her certainty” and the “blind conviction of herown rectitude” were not limited to the inner circle of the Collective. Rand’sfury was most disturbing at the public lectures that Branden and others hadarranged, in order to bring the Objectivist word to a wider audience. This wasespecially true when someone asked a question that Rand found irrelevant. “Ifshe did not believe the question to be valid and intelligent,” Barbara Brandenwrote, “she was scathing in her denunciation.” She justified her angerrationally, as an expression of “moral indignation,” “lashing out furiously atthe hapless questioner.”65 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber184] Rand’s tiradescowed her listeners and led to an absence of questions. Her impatience with heraudiences’ stupidity convinced her to give up lecturing.As with other gurus, the loyalty she demanded from her followers graduallybecame a prison, both for Rand and for the Collective. “Her need to know thatthey would never betray her,” Barbara Branden wrote, “became a demand impossibleto meet.” Her “moral condemnation of any deviation from the principles ofObjectivism”—which, as with other gurus, led Rand to decide who should marrywhom, among other things—led to a feeling that “everyone in our group was alwayson trial.”66 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber185] But it also left Rand trapped, afate not uncommon with gurus. She had little social contact outside theCollective and only heard from them what they thought she wanted to hear. Her“need to know . . . that they would remain unfailingly and unswervingly theconsistent denizens of her world”—as if they were characters in her novels—ledto an environment in which people perpetually walked on eggshells while notmentioning the emperor’s new clothes.When Nathaniel Branden broke off his long affair with Rand, her vituperationreached new heights. She even insisted that her literary agents drop Branden,whom they also represented, and who had become something of a success himself.They did not, but the Collective suffered a loyalty purge that spared no one andset longtime friends, even husbands and wives, against each other. Rank-and-fileObjectivists were left disoriented, now having to see Branden, hitherto secondonly to Rand herself, as a nonperson.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •LOOKING AT THESE various characters, where does Trump fit in? Is he a guru, ademagogue, or both? Much that has been written about Trump suggests that he is aRight Man. He is not known to admit to being wrong and has said that he neverapologizes. As he told the talk show host Jimmy Fallon, “I will apologize in thedistant future if I am ever wrong.”67 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber186] Hisreaction to criticism is generally aggressive. As a colleague remarked, “Trump’sstyle was to lash out when things weren’t going well.”68[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber187] Much of his ire is directed at the press. Inthe 1980s, Spy magazine took aim at Trump and put him in their pillory severaltimes, calling him among other things one of the “Most Embarrassing NewYorkers.” Their worst insult was that he was a “short-fingered vulgarian.” WhenTrump’s The Art of the Deal appeared, he sent Spy a copy, with his fingerscircled in gold on the cover. Inside was a note: “If you hit me, I will hit youback a hundred times harder,” a philosophy he learned from his lawyer and rolemodel Roy Cohn. Cohn himself had cut his teeth in the 1950s as a protégé ofSenator Joseph McCarthy during the Communist conspiracy paranoia that grippedAmerica then.69 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber188]This is a common theme with Trump: he knows how to hold a grudge. This came outduring a series of motivational lectures he gave at seminars hosted by theself-help guru Anthony Robbins. He told the crowd that paranoia was crucial tosuccess. “You have to realize that people are very vicious,” he said. “When aperson screws you, screw them back fifteen times harder.”70[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber189]It was advice he took himself. When Fortune magazine’s assessment of Trump’swealth disagreed with his own, he inundated their office with dozens oftelephone complaints. When New York Magazine criticized one of his buildings, hewrote to the critic, calling him a loser and bad dresser, an insult he used onmore than one occasion. A New York Times columnist received a copy of hercriticism with her face circled and annotated “The Face of a Dog,” a rebuke thatwould have pleased Crowley.71 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber190] When the DailyNews ran a story about Trump cutting ahead of the line at an Aspen ski lift,Trump said whoever told them was a “motherfucking liar” and that he would “beatthe fucking shit out of” him.72 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber191]Journalists were not the only ones to witness Trump’s wrath. Colleagues were onthe receiving end too, and were often humiliated in public because of someperceived fault, much as Ayn Rand did with backsliding Collectivists. When hefired his first wife, Ivana, from running one of his casinos, he added to theinsult by berating her before the staff for crying.73[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber192] When a contractor told him they’d be behindschedule on some building, Trump kicked a chair across the room. During divorceproceedings with Ivana, Trump was so outraged at a proposed settlement that hetold the judge he was “full of shit” and stormed out.74[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber193]Trump’s “Rightness” came out in his treatment of his ex-wives. He forced MarlaMaples to quash a book she had written about their relationship and preventedIvana from giving any “revealing” interviews.75[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber194] Like many who want to create reality, Trumpneeds to control the story, and he is determined to “break” those who don’t bendto his will.76 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber195] “My general attitude, all mylife,” he says, “has been to fight back hard.”77[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber196]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •HIS TENDENCY TO rage started early. He was known as a bully in school and hadlittle regard for others. On one occasion, builder and bully appeared together.Ignoring his protestations, Trump once glued his younger brother’s buildingblocks together, because he liked what he had made with them.78[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber197] As he liked to say years later, he built tolast. Apropos of this, we might mention that with Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin,Trump seems to revel in gigantomania, “the creation of abnormally large works,”something associated with totalitarian societies. Trump, we know, likes to thinkbig, and so did Hitler, who told his architect Albert Speer that he would erectbuildings for him that had not been made for millennia.79[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber198] Trump once said that what he created was theclosest thing in modern times to anything like the palace of Versailles. TrumpTower, symbol of his success, has an almost religious significance for him.“Through some blend of design, materials, location, promotion, luck and timing,Trump Tower took on a mystical aura.” Walking through the atrium, he said, “is atransporting experience.”80 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber199] “Look up, lookup,” he says in Crippled America, “and you’ll see the Trump building risingskyward. I’ve done things nobody else has done!”81[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber200]Like most charismatic leaders, Trump the showman prefers addressing crowds toindividuals and he has no talent for small talk. He is at his best before anaudience where his talent for creating reality or, as he calls it, “truthfulhyperbole,” can shine. This came through during his years promoting prowrestling, itself a very profitable kind of unreality. As one of hisco-promoters said, “he knew how to read a crowd and manipulate them.”82[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber201] Yet like other demagogues and gurus, Trump’slove of an audience and his effect on them—his obsessions with televisionratings is well known—leaves him stuck at Maslow’s “self-esteem” level,perpetually needing the esteem of others. At the end of Crippled America, hisplan for making America great again, where most authors have a paragraph aboutthemselves, Trump has fourteen pages. In them, like a tyrant of old, he trumpetshis many accomplishments. One can’t help but wonder: Is he trying to convinceothers that “there’s nobody like me,” or himself?83[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber202]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •LIKE CHAOS MAGICIANS and postmodernists, Trump is playful with reality, acharacteristic that others label more straightforwardly as “bullshitting.” Ashis biographer Wayne Barrett wrote, Trump “was born with bullshit capacitiesbeyond what you and I could possibly imagine.”This has even been confirmed academically. The Princeton University professor ofmoral philosophy Harry G. Frankfurt is a bullshit expert, having written OnBullshit, a philosophical analysis of the part it plays in modern life. In Timemagazine, Frankfurt wrote that Trump’s eyebrow-raising tweets and other publicstatements, which are “neither well-informed nor especially intelligent,” arenot examples of his lying but of his bullshitting. The difference between a liarand a bullshitter, Frankfurt writes, is that “the liar asserts something whichhe himself believes to be false,” and thereby “misrepresents what he takes to bethe truth.” The bullshitter “is not constrained by any consideration of what mayor may not be true.” He is indifferent to that. “His goal is not to reportfacts” but to “shape the beliefs and attitudes of his listeners in a certainway.”84 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber203] Where the liar knows the truth andrespects it—he does not want to get caught in his lie—the bullshitter couldn’tcare less about it. He isn’t interested in the truth, which for him is in theeye of the beholder, as beauty was for Keats. He is interested in the effect hisbullshit has on his audience. In other words, like positive thinking and chaosmagick, in what works.If we remember Norman Vincent Peale’s belief that “attitudes are more importantthan facts,” and chaos magick’s aim to escape our existing “cognitivehabits”—not to mention Hitler’s power to release his followers from the“limitations of all conventional restraint”—we can, I think, see a connectionbetween Trump’s “bullshit” and much of what we have been considering so far. Ifwe bring in postmodernism’s rejection of any notion of an “objective” truth—alltruth for it being strictly relative—we can see why Trump is the “post-truthalternate fact” patron saint par excellence. For chaos magick and postmodernism,whether something is true or false simply no longer matters. Truth or falsehoodare beliefs which we can take on or put off as need be. This is why confrontingTrump or his followers with proof of his mistakes, inaccuracies, and downrightlies has so far had little effect. Pointing out that Trump is bullshitting makesno difference. He knows he is. He is doing it on purpose and has done sothroughout his career. For him it is “truthful hyperbole,” what he calls “aninnocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.”85[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber204]Sometimes Trump’s hyperboles slide into magic, or at least illusion, or, aschaos magick has it, “glamour,” a show. When the board of directors of HolidayInn asked to see what work was being done on a project that had stalled, Trumparranged for his construction team to pretend to work, with a digger clawing uptons of earth and dumping it on the other side of the site.86[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber205] The board saw what they wanted to see and wereduly impressed; Trump got their approval. Like all good illusionists, confidencetricksters, and demagogues, Trump knows how to read his audience. It is a traitindispensable for his success and gave him a leg up on his competition. “Myleverage,” he writes, “came from confirming an impression they were alreadypredisposed to believe,” something demagogues make much use of.87[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber206] Hitler, Mussolini, and other charismaticleaders were successful because they convinced their listeners that what theyalready felt about the state of things was right; they only confirmed this.Illusionists do much the same.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT MAY BE difficult to see Trump as a guru, yet his many self-help books aim atshowing readers how they too can be winners like Trump. His philosophy ofsuccess is not that far distant from advice one can find in other positivethinking tracts of the “prosperity gospel” stamp. Fundamental is a clear idea ofwhat you want and persistence in pursuing it. “One of the keys to thinking big,”he tells his readers, is “total focus.” He calls it “controlled neurosis,” aquality he found in other successful men. “They’re obsessive, driven,single-minded . . . almost maniacal,” but it all goes into the work. It is“great when it comes to getting what you want.”88[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber207] It is also important to present a powerfulimage, to conjure a “glamour” of success. “People want to believe that somethingis the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular,” and Trump’s job is totell them it is. They will do the rest. He conveys this message by surroundinghimself with symbols of the fantasy life he is selling.In doing this he has had some help from two personalities or identities that atdifferent times in his career Trump has adopted. Posing as “John Baron” or “JohnMills,” Trump would call gossip columnists and society journalists, telling themabout the beautiful women who were dying to sleep with Trump, or had slept withhim, or whom he could get into bed if he wanted to. These ranged from Madonna toPrincess Diana, and the stories were invariably untrue. Aleister Crowley adopteddifferent identities when the mood struck him—and, like Trump, did his best tokeep his name in the newspapers—and chaos magick asserts that one’s identity ismalleable, that one should “reinvent” oneself often, play different roles. 89[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber208] We should pretend to be someone else, toenvision a “magical self” possessing all the qualities that we desire, somethingthat some New Thought advocates also suggest.90[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber209] Chaos magick also promotes the idea of using“shock tactics,” saying something “outrageous” in order to “enhance personalpower,” something that, as with much else about chaos magick, seems to come toTrump naturally. One also wonders about the odd hand gestures he makes whenaddressing a crowd, which often seem like the mudras used as meditation devicesin Hinduism and Buddhism.And guru or not, Trump can dole out “crazy wisdom” with the best. Once, spying asoda can outside Trump Tower, Trump called the project manager at two a.m. anddemanded she come and remove it. She did, but he called again at six a.m. justto make sure.91 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber210] And as in the case of some ofthe other gurus we’ve looked at, as Trump’s power increased, so did hisparanoia, as he has surrounded himself with yes-men who applaud his everydecision rather than questioning his logic. “The show,” as he said, “was Trumpand it is sold-out performances everywhere.”92 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber211]"},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]CHAPTER FOURALT-RIGHT NOWSO FAR WE’VE seen Trump as positive thinker, chaos magician, guru, anddemagogue. What about the people who say they helped put him into power? Who arethe meme magicians? What is the alt-right and what did Richard Spencer mean whenhe said that he and the other members of the National Policy Institute had“dreamed” Trump into the White House? And what does a cartoon frog have to dowith it?The alt-right or “alternative right” is the brainchild of white supremacistRichard Spencer, and it came to national if not global prominence when HillaryClinton inadvertently gave it the best publicity it could ask for. In hercampaign speech in Reno, Nevada, on August 25, 2016, Clinton spoke out againsther opponent, Donald Trump. She accused him of basing his campaign on “prejudiceand paranoia,” of supporting anti-Semitism and white nationalism, and ofbringing what had until then been a “paranoid fringe” in American politics intothe mainstream.This “paranoid fringe,” she said, was the “alt-right,” or “alternative right,” a“loosely organized movement, mostly online,” that—as she quoted from The WallStreet Journal—“rejects mainstream conservatism, promotes nationalism and viewsimmigration and multiculturalism as threats to white identity.” They may callthemselves “racialists” rather than “racists” and speak of “white nationalism”rather than “white supremacy,” Clinton said. But don’t let that fool you. We’veheard it before.Clinton spoke of the “de facto merger” between the alt-right and Trump broughtabout by his campaign manager, Steve Bannon, who, through the right-wing websiteBreitbart.com, gave the alt-right a place to air its views. As Bannon said, hegave the alt-right a “platform.” Through this she believed that “a fringeelement has effectively taken over the Republican Party.” This was, Clintonsaid, part of a “rising tide of hard-line, right-wing nationalism around theworld.” She included in this the far-right British politician Nigel Farage andVladimir Putin.1 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber212] We get an idea of whatconcerned Clinton. “There’s always been a paranoid fringe in our politics,” shesaid. “But it’s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouragingit, and giving it a national megaphone.” Now with Trump it did.Clinton spoke out against Trump’s endorsement of conspiracy theories and hisintransigence when criticized for accepting the support of people like DavidDuke, head of the KKK. She complained of his retweeting white supremacistpropaganda and giving his approval to the ideas of talk show host Alex Jones ofInfoWars infamy, who, among other things, claimed that the Sandy Hook massacrewas a fake.2 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber213] But Clinton’s understandablecondemnation of these and other of Trump’s “truthful hyperboles” had anunexpected effect. It took the alt-right out of online obscurity and toldeveryone about it. Before this they were mostly talking to themselves, but nowthey had an audience. They were in the news. And that was exactly where RichardSpencer wanted them to be.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •SPENCER WATCHED CLINTON’S speech in a hotel room in Tokyo, and nothing couldhave made his holiday better. He could not believe it. No sooner had he heardher words than he saw his inbox overflow with interview requests. He had beenspreading the alt-right word since 2008, the year he said he coined the name,mostly to deaf ears, and now his dedication to his cause had paid off. As hetold a journalist for the online political magazine Slate, he had “made it.”3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber214] At a press conference he held in Washington,D.C., soon after Clinton’s speech, Spencer told reporters that the alt-right wasfor “conservatives who don’t have anything to conserve anymore.” He decried theidea that the American Founding Fathers believed that all races were equal,regardless of what the Declaration of Independence said. “Race is real, racematters, race is the foundation of identity,” he told the crowd.4[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber215] While chaos magick and postmodernism seeidentity as fluid and up for grabs, for Spencer and his alt-righters, it’ssomething we need to defend to the death.5 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber216]Following Spencer’s notorious Hitler salute, celebrating Trump’s victory, whichSpencer called a “victory of will,” Trump told The New York Times that he“disowned and condemned” the alt-right. This rejection disappointed Spencer, buthe understood its political necessity. But that was after Trump’s victory.During Trump’s campaign they were fellow travelers. “Trump thinks like me,”Spencer once remarked, curiously echoing a strange pronouncement made byAlexander Dugin, Russia’s own far-right visionary. “The more Putin becomesDugin,” Dugin said, “the more he will become himself.”6[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber217] That Spencer’s estranged wife, NinaKouprianova, has translated Dugin’s work, under the name Nina Byzantina,suggests that when Hillary Clinton warned of the rise of a “hard-line,right-wing nationalism around the world,” she wasn’t kidding.Spencer and Kouprianova have appeared on Russia Today, Putin’s English-languagenews and propaganda program, and Spencer thinks well of Russia’s president.Russia, he says, is the “most powerful white power in the world,” and hesupports Putin’s authoritarianism. Like Dugin, Spencer has a vision of a whiteethnostate—a term Dugin has helped popularize—a “white homeland” for the“dispossessed white race,” and in Spencer’s world, Russians would be mostwelcome.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •RICHARD SPENCER WAS born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1978 and grew up inDallas, Texas, the son of an ophthalmologist and a cotton heiress. He went to anup-market conservative prep school in the 1990s and, like Trump, was good atsports. Although Spencer says that he wasn’t racist in school, someex-classmates recall some remarks that struck them as questionable. At theUniversity of Virginia, Spencer majored in English and music and went through afew ideological makeovers, embracing and rejecting a variety of ideas.Nietzsche, Napoleon, and the composer Richard Wagner were role models; he laterwrote a thesis on how the neo-Marxist philosopher and musicologist TheodorAdorno, doyen of the New Left, hid the fact that he loved Wagner’s music becauseWagner was an anti-Semite and had fans among the Nazis.Spencer’s views on race did not come to full bloom until he reached theUniversity of Chicago, where he came across the work of Jared Taylor, a whitenationalist, a “race realist,” and an editor of American Renaissance magazine.Taylor argued that blacks and Hispanics pulled white Western society down, andSpencer was inclined to agree. After some time at Duke University, Spencerdropped out of academia and, in his own words, embarked on a “life of thoughtcrime.” Works like the Harvard professor Samuel Huntington’s Who Are We?, whichargues that Hispanics are biologically less suited to assimilate to Americanculture than are European immigrants, sent him on his way.Spencer’s life of thought crime led him first to The American Conservativemagazine, where he became an assistant editor until his conservatism proved tooradical and he was fired. He then went to Taki’s Magazine, the online organ ofGreek journalist Taki Theodoracopulos. Taki had founded The AmericanConservative with other right-wingers like Pat Buchanan, and Spencer found ahome for his increasingly racist views with him, steering Taki’s Magazine intopurely white waters. In 2009 Spencer left Taki and founded AlternativeRight.com.It was here that the alt-right was born.Not long after this Spencer became executive director of Washington SummitPublishers, a white supremacist publishing house specializing in books on raceand intelligence, eugenics and anti-Semitism. A related effort was Spencer’sRadix Journal, in which, like a good chaos or meme magician, Spencer co-opted ascene from the film The Matrix to symbolize the effect his racial “awakening”had on him.In the scene, Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, presents Neo, played byKeanu Reeves, with two pills and one choice. If he chooses the blue pill, he cango back to sleep and return to the world he knew, which, in The Matrix’s Gnosticnarrative, is the false world created and controlled by sentient machines,living off human beings. If he chooses the red pill, he will awaken from thisand know “true reality.” In the Gnostic myth the “real world” is the spiritualreality of the true, unmanifest God. The “false world” is the one created by anupstart demiurge, who has usurped the true God’s authority.7[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber218] In a sense we can read this as chaos magick’saim of breaking out of our “existing cognitive habits.”Spencer would agree. In Spencer’s take, the real world is one in which “racematters” and those who have awakened to this have been “red-pilled.” The falseworld is the one of liberalism, multiculturalism, and multiracialism. ForSpencer and his followers practically everyone in modern Western society hasopted for the blue pill. Only he and his alt-righters have swallowed the red.AlternativeRight.com caught the attention of William Regnery II, anultraconservative publisher and “race realist” who was the money behind theNational Policy Institute. Regnery’s grandfather, William Regnery I, had fundedthe America First campaign in the 1940s, which lobbied against Americanintervention against Nazi Germany. Regnery II’s uncle, Henry Regnery, foundedRegnery Publishing, which finds among its authors Ann Coulter, a post-truthalternate fact spokesperson and champion of Trump.Trump’s inauguration speech, when he announced that “from this day forward it isonly going to be America First,” set alarm bells ringing.8[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber219] The original America First movement includedthe reader of Ralph Waldo Trine, Henry Ford, and the aviation hero, CharlesLindbergh, both of whom showed evidence of anti-Semitism. Ford was a staunchbeliever in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fraudulent text originatingin Russia in 1905, claiming to unveil a Jewish-Masonic-Communist plot to rulethe world. It was required reading in Nazi Germany. In a speech given onSeptember 11, 1941, Lindbergh argued that fighting the Nazis was neither in theAmerican nor Jewish interest, and that Jews presented a “danger” to Americabecause of their “large ownership and influence” in the media, a complaint stillcommon among red-pillers.9 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber220]Spencer gained some attention as an alt-right martyr in 2014 when he spent a fewdays in a Budapest jail for ignoring a ban on an international white supremacistconference to be held there, organized by Jared Taylor. Hungary’sultraconservative strongman Viktor Orbán, whom the alt-right thought a fellowtraveler, banned the event, hoping to show himself as more moderate in upcomingelections, and he meant business. When William Regnery II showed up, he wasimmediately sent back to the States. Spencer and some other diehards carried on,and when Spencer tried to hold an informal gathering at a Budapest pub, he wasarrested.He relayed his three-day ordeal through emails, and in the end the conference,now downsized to a dinner, went on, with red-pillers from the UK, Norway,Germany, Sweden, and, strangely enough, Mexico coming together to talk about thefuture of white Europe. Spencer’s arrest merely convinced them of therighteousness of their cause.10 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber221] It also madeSpencer a kind of internet sensation while, because of the Schengen Agreement,banning him from twenty-six European nations.Spencer’s Hitler-style haircut and conservative dress make for good media copy,and like Trump and other political self-seekers, he is anxious to be in thenews. He has an eye for the telling moment. He launched his new website,AltRight.com, on January 15, 2017, Martin Luther King’s birthday. A few dayslater, during Trump’s inauguration, Spencer was punched by an “antifa,” anantifascist. Spencer said that he “reached a stage of being a public figurewhere I am going to be recognized and then attacked” and that he would have toincrease his security. Yet the blow was turned to his advantage; the video of itgave him more publicity than ever. “I’m afraid,” he said, “that this is going tobecome the meme to end all memes.”On February 27, 2017, Spencer was kicked out of the Conservative PoliticalAction Conference because the members found his views “vile” and “repulsive.”Another alt-righter whom the CPAC had first invited then changed their mindsabout was Milo Yiannopoulos. An outspoken red-piller, Yiannopoulos lost not onlythis invitation, and his position at Breitbart.com, but also a lucrative bookdeal because of remarks he made that seemed to sanction pedophilia.11[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber222]Spencer should not have felt too bad about the CPAC snub. Just two days earliera meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, made possible the international gathering thatwas aborted in Budapest. Three hundred red-pillers attended and pulled analt-righter. Held in a secret location, according to the International BusinessTimes it was “the most important alt-right conference in Europe.”12[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber223] Attendees included Russian television hostLana Lokteff; Henrik Palmgren, whose Red Ice media network is Sweden’s answer toBreitbart.com; and Jason Reza Jorjani, editor in chief of Arktos Press,publishers of Alexander Dugin and Julius Evola. Jorjani hailed the meeting as“momentous.”Jorjani’s Ph.D. in philosophy from Stony Brook University has come underscrutiny because of his association with Spencer, the NPI, and otheralt-righters.13 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber224] His book Prometheus and Atlas,which argues that Western rationalism has purposefully marginalized elements ofreality considered “paranormal”—the kinds of things New Thought and chaos magickare interested in—is seen by some to harken back to the occult interests of someNational Socialist sympathizers. Jorjani agrees. “National Socialist Germany,”he said, “was the only political regime to seriously consider the implicationsof mainstream scientific recognition and widespread cultivation of those latenthuman capacities hitherto marginalized as ‘paranormal’”—although how Hitler’sarrest of astrologers and Freemasons and his closure of theosophical andanthroposophical activities squares with this is unclear. Jorjani’s advocacy of“Indo-European, or Aryan, cultures” as “uniquely worthy of affirmation, sincethey are the roots of almost every great discovery and world historicaldevelopment in spirituality, the sciences and the arts,” has also not helped hisreputation.14 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber225] Such views open the unwieldy canof worms that defending “freedom of speech” in the era of post-truth has become.This has led to some university students acting like Nazi youth, in shoutingdown professors whose opinions they do not share and whom, ironically enough,they accuse of being Nazis.15 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber226]Trump was the man of the hour at this secret location in Sweden, his electionbeing seen as unifying the “New Right” with a mainstream power structure. Butsomething else was even more significant, Jorjani said. This was a developmentthat was central to “the redemption and revitalization of our world”: Spencer’sAltRight.com.16 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber227] Here we might recall LaurenceRees’s remarks about charismatic leaders and their appeal to a hunger for“salvation and redemption.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ONE MEME THE alt-right did launch was Pepe the Frog. Spencer was wearing a Pepebadge when his antifa hit him. In fact, Spencer was in the process of explainingPepe’s importance at the time. Although now seen as a symbol of “redemption andrevitalization,” at least for alt-righters, Pepe offered little protection tohis high priest. But perhaps this is too much to ask of the little fellow.Indeed, how an innocuous cartoon amphibian came to be known as a kind ofpostmodern swastika requires some telling.Pepe came into the world through the work of the artist Matt Furie, who put himin his 2005 comic strip Boy’s Club. Furie pictured Pepe as a kind of millennialslacker, and in his first appearance he is urinating in public. When asked whyhe was acting so deplorably, Pepe answered, “Feels good man.” The sentimentcaught on and images of Pepe quickly appeared voicing similar feelings. He was aSad Frog, a Smug Frog, an Angry Frog, and soon there seemed to be a Pepe for allseasons. Pop singers Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj posted images of Pepe, spreadinghis appeal. But in the world of the internet once a meme is launched it’s beyondits creator’s control, and it wasn’t very long before Pepe found his way to thedark side.He got there via users of internet sites like Myspace. But he found a real homeon the 4chan site. 4chan is a Japanese internet message board adapted forWestern users. Its greatest appeal is that people can post items anonymously.This and the absence of any rules on what can be posted made it a haven forindividuals eager to air controversial views, while avoiding responsibility forthem.4chan grew out of an earlier internet message board called Something Awful. Thiswas mostly concerned with Japanese anime, and allowed for anonymous nonstopposting. When Christopher Poole, a fifteen-year-old anime fan and SomethingAwful user, adapted his Japanese bulletin board software, 4chan was born.17[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber228]Soon into its existence 4chan became a kind of breeding ground for a form of popnihilism characteristic of postmodernism, although the teenagers “living intheir parents’ basements”—as 4chan users describe themselves—most likely neverheard of postmodernism. Millennial “whateverism” slid into a peevishly sourirony, a kind of personal “plausible deniability” aimed at everything at large.It was the standard adolescent shrug at the elders, but now it had a wider briefand greater reach. What used to turn up on toilet stall walls found a new lifeas electronic graffiti. It was a kind of cyber Fight Club scenario with a sharedethos “to hate, to deny, to shrug, to laugh at everything as a joke.”18[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber229] Users were most likely unaware ofpostmodernism, but they were certainly expressions of it.Chaos magick suggests saying “outrageous” things as part of its “shock tactic”approach to enhancing “personal power.” 4chan users did the same. The easiestway to be shocking today is to go against political correctness, just as theeasiest way to be authoritarian is to go with it. Trump didn’t give a hang aboutbeing PC and that’s why he became a hero of 4chaners. A kind of introvertedcyberbully personality emerged from this, a character withdrawn from the worldand taking pot shots at it from the safety of his parents’ basement. The“anything goes” atmosphere of 4chan allowed users to express as many politicallyincorrect sentiments as they wanted, with racist and anti-Semitic ones toppingthe bill. As one 4chan user remarked, it was a “bullying and anarchic society ofadolescent boys,” suffering from what the Japanese call hikikomori, a “pullinginward” and “being confined” within a world of video games and chat lines.19[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber230] Or as another user remarked, “Here you’ll findthe lonely and depressed, the socially inept, the generational dropouts, and allshades of disenfranchised youth.” It was a space open to an “underdogmentality,” where “society’s status quo is mercilessly challenged.”20[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber231] It was also a space given over to chaos.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •BUT 4CHANERS HAD reach and, estranged from the “real” world or not, they foundthey could affect it. First they infiltrated other sites and caused havoc,simply because they could. They covered their tracks by laying the blame onsomeone else, usually a nonexistent site they summarily invented. The idea wasto keep 4chan secret. These “raids” grew more ambitious. Anonymous, the online“secret society” of international “hacktivists” that sabotage government andcorporate sites, grew out of one. It emerged out of a prank 4chan users playedon the Church of Scientology in 2008. Anti-Scientology videos were made by“Anonymous,” which at that point didn’t exist, being merely a name 4chaners usedfor a fictitious secret society. (As practically all 4chaners were “anonymous,”it could have meant anyone.) Then a “fake protest” against Scientology byAnonymous was arranged, a kind of “flash demonstration.” Here 4chaners reallyflexed their muscles. Word got out. They were taking on the “real” world.On the morning of the “demonstration,” hundreds of 4chaners wearing masks andcarrying signs saying “Scientology Kills!” were cordoned off from theScientology building on West Forty-sixth Street near New York’s Times Square.Most of the masks were of the Guy Fawkes face popularized by the film V forVendetta—made by the makers of The Matrix. Scientologists thought they wereunder attack by terrorists. But the whole thing was a joke. The 4chaners had noreal grievance against them, other than that they had taken a video of TomCruise, a celebrity Scientologist, that they found funny off the net. 4chanersliked the video because it gave good “lulz” and the true believers had no rightto deny them this. Their political philosophy was libertarian: they wanted to dowhat they liked, and they didn’t take kindly to people who tried to stop them.The protest was a joke, and had antecedents in the artistic hooliganism of theFuturists and Dadaists and the “street politics” of the Situationists. But itraises the serious post-truth question: When does a joke protest become real?When would a “fake terrorist” act slide into reality? Most likely the 4chanersinvolved didn’t think about this, and if they did they didn’t care. What wasimportant was that they discovered they could act effectively. They had breachedthe “reality barrier.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE INTERPHASE BETWEEN the “fake” world and the “real” one, between jokes andseriousness, looked wide open. And this is where “meme magic” comes in. Mememagic is when what happens in cyberspace has an effect on the “real” world.This, as mentioned, is an updated techno-literate take on the old magical beliefthat what happens in imagination can have real consequences. Thoughts arethings. According to meme magicians, internet memes are too.Users began to notice odd synchronicities between the bits and pieces of popculture they posted about on the net and events in the “real” world. They calledthis “synchromysticism.”21 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber232] Synchronicity, weremember, is Jung’s name for a “meaningful coincidence,” when somethinghappening in the mind seems to be mirrored in the outer world, with no obviousconnection. Synchromysticism substitutes the internet for the imagination.Nowadays, the internet has come to be seen as a kind of “exteriorized”imagination, just as iPads and other electronic devices supply a kind ofexteriorized interiority. That synchronicities may occur within it makes a kindof sense.At least it did to the 4chaners. It began with their noticing odd coincidencesbetween the crash of German Wings flight 9525 in 2015 and a scene from the 2012film The Dark Knight Rises. Fans of the film had a thread, “Baneposting,” andthey began to comment on the many similarities between it and the disaster. Apost pointed out that “Bruce Robin” was the name of one of the crashinvestigators, and that a nearby town in the French Alps was called “Bain.” Baneis the villain in the film, Batman’s secret identity is Bruce Wayne, and Robinis Batman’s sidekick. Bane causes the flight to crash and the evidence suggeststhat Flight 9525’s copilot crashed the plane deliberately. There are othercoincidences, and readers can get an idea of them at the knowyourmeme.comsite.22 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber233] 4chaners began to joke that theirposts were somehow responsible for the crash, an example of their “dark,”“shocking” humor. Oddly, Bane turned up again when many people noticed somestrange coincidences between Trump’s inauguration speech and Bane’s speech whenreturning Gotham City to “the people.”23 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber234]Granted, this is a stretch. But it was enough to get the memes going. If realityis not as “objective” as we believe, and if it and the mind somehowinterpenetrate, then what was to stop them?24 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber235]If life imitates art, and “art is what you can get away with”—as Oscar Wilde andAndy Warhol tell us—then it should follow that, as Robert Anton Wilson said,“reality”—another word for life—“is what you can get away with.” The users of4chan were discovering they could get away with a lot.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •PEPE GOT INTO this act when a 4chaner posted an image of him looking over theU.S.-Mexican border. Trump got the cue and tweeted an image of Pepe as himself.Then the meme took hold. Donald Trump Jr. posted a meme based on the film TheExpendables. The Deplorables featured Trump, Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones,Trump Jr., some others, and Pepe. Hillary Clinton had called Trump’s supportersa “basket of deplorables” and they agreed. Once again she had given her opponenta stick to beat her with.25 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber236]Images of Trump and Pepe began to flood the net with the alt-right and 4chanersspreading the meme. Pepe became the unofficial mascot of the alt-right movement,with Trump the charismatic leader they were all rooting for. For them, he wasthe ultimate internet troll, the personification of the cynicism they felttoward everything. He was a kind of spite incarnate. But if all Pepe amounted towas an amphibious postmodern swastika, a “symbol of hate” as Clinton had said,he would be annoying, even deplorable, but we could do our best to avoid him.But what if he was something more? Some 4chaners and alt-righters thought hewas—or wanted others to think so.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ONE OF THE strange things about synchronicities is that if you look for them youwill find them. Some devotees of Pepe did just that, finding a number of oddcoincidences featuring their mascot. This could be accounted for in a number ofways, as sheer invention, a version of Trump’s “controlled neurosis,” or simplypeople’s imagination getting carried away. But it could also mean that somehowPepe’s fans were making them happen. Or that something else was.In esoteric tradition there is something known as an egregore, a Greek term for“watcher.” It is a kind of thought form or imaginal entity created and fed bythe devotion of a group of followers. The prayers, thoughts, and imagination ofthe followers create a kind of psychic being, a group mind or spirit, that iskept alive and helped to grow through their attentions. At some point it cantake on a life and consciousness of its own, rather as what some AI enthusiastslook forward to happening with computers.The egregore’s power can be used for the aims and purposes of the group. But asValentin Tomberg, now recognized as the author of Meditations on the Tarot—oneof the truly esoteric works of the twentieth century—remarks, there are no“good” egregores, only “negative” ones. They can be “engendered by thecollective will and imagination of nations,” but the aims of an egregore arealways selfish, centered exclusively on gaining power and growing stronger atthe expense of its creators.26 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber237] Once it iscreated, the group can “rely” on the egregore. With it, they have found “anefficacious magical ally.”27 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber238] Yet theegregore’s help comes at a price. As the historian of esotericism JoscelynGodwin remarks, its creators must meet its “unlimited appetite for their futuredevotion.”28 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber239] Once brought into existence, anegregore is difficult to control and much harder to put down than to raise up.A similar phenomenon is known in Eastern magical traditions, the tulpa. This toois a thought form but it is generally the work of a single person. In Magic andMystery in Tibet, the Buddhist and explorer Alexandra David-Neel tells of herown experiences with a tulpa. Such a thought form, she says, is “tangible andendowed with all the faculties and qualities naturally pertaining to the beingsor things of which they have the appearance.” A tulpa may be an image of aperson or thing already existing. David-Neel says that “when he fled fromShigatze, the Tashi Lama left in his stead a phantom perfectly resembling himwho played his part so thoroughly and naturally that everyone who saw him wasdeceived.”29 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber240] (The Tashi or Panchen Lama isTibet’s second-in-command; his departure from Shigatze followed a dispute withthe Thirteenth Dali Lama in 1924.)Tulpas can also be “original creations,” as it were. David-Neel writes of how,after months of concentration and performing certain rituals, she created atulpa of a monk from scratch. She says that the “monk” became “a kind of guest,living in my apartment.” The monk was mostly visual, but David-Neel says that onoccasion he had a tactile presence; she could feel his robe brushing against herand once felt his hand on her shoulder. After a while, the tulpa outstayed hiswelcome, but like an oblivious dinner guest, she found it almost impossible toget rid of him. It took six months of hard work, David-Neel said, to“de-materialize” him.Alexandra David-Neel was a remarkable woman endowed with considerable mentalpowers. If she found it difficult to dissolve a thought form created by her ownefforts, how much harder must it be to get rid of the result of a collectiveeffort?The magician Dion Fortune experienced a tulpa sent by a rival magician toterrorize her, a story she tells in her book Psychic Self-Defense. Fortune hadgotten on the bad side of Moina Mathers, widow of MacGregor Mathers, onetimehead of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. A rivalry grew up between themand at one point Fortune and Mathers got into an astral battle. At theheadquarters of Fortune’s own magical society, the Fraternity of Light, demonfaces appeared and the building was overrun by mobs of black cats. “The horriblestench of the brutes” filled the place, and some members found that “the samepenetrating reek of the tom-cat” followed them home or to their workplaces.Astral cats appeared as well, and one morning Fortune was confronted on thestairs by “a giant tabby” that was “twice the size of a tiger.” Following anetheric wrestling match with Mathers, Fortune discovered that her back wascovered with the scratch of a “gigantic cat.”30[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber241]Madame Blavatsky, who knew about thought forms and, according to many accounts,was able to create one of herself on occasion, had a word of caution aboutpeople dabbling in astral adventures.31 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber242]Blavatsky became Public Enemy Number One with Spiritualists because she arguedthat the “spirits” that visited séances were not those of friends or relativeswho have passed on, as most spiritualists believed. They were instead thoughtforms emanating from the people at séances, who were unaware of theirinvolvement. These thought forms combined with the etheric “shells” of the dead,a kind of astral skeleton left behind as their souls moved on to greenerpastures, and became the “spirits” of one’s departed mother or child. Mediumsadd their own psychic matter to these shells, rather as devotees of an egregoreadd their imagination to the growing entity, and give them a kind of life.Blavatsky considered this a form of black magic, a kind of psychic slavery, withlow “larvae” of the astral realm taking possession of the medium’s mind andwill, rather as if etheric hobos broke into your house while you were away forthe weekend.When we read of how Hitler was able to “possess” an entire nation, suspicionsabout how he was in league with “dark forces,” however unlikely, seem to make akind of sense. Hitler would not need to perform rituals and consciously aim atcreating an egregore, nor would he need to consciously make himself the willing“medium” of some astral entity, in order for the one to come into existence orthe other to use him as a means of absorbing the imaginative energies of theGerman people. The constant devotion to the Nazi cause and Hitler’s ability tomake himself the mouthpiece for the “will of the people” could do the trick.Jean Gebser, we remember, saw in the rise of National Socialism an expression ofwhat he called the “magical structure” of consciousness, which he related to“group consciousness” and the “vegetative intertwining of all living things.”This “vegetative intertwining” is, for Gebser, behind Jung’s synchronicities.Writing about the Nazis, the cultural critic Morris Berman remarked that “anentire culture can eventually undergo very serious changes as the result of theslow accumulation of enough psychic and somatic changes on an invisiblelevel.”32 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber243] A nation’s “possession” does nothappen overnight. Gradually, by gaining a toehold on the imagination, theprocess can take place and be well established before those out of sympathy withit can offer adequate resistance.Am I saying that Pepe the Frog is an egregore or tulpa or is on his way tobecoming one? Perhaps. Or that he and his devotees are being used by somesupernatural entity for its own purposes? Again, perhaps. Is Trump himself atulpa or egregore, brought into existence by his fan base? It is notinconceivable. Pranksters are amused when their jokes are taken for real, atactic employed by many alt-righters to show that “social justice warriors” canget into a panic about practically anything. But perhaps they themselves arebeing pranked by some unknown power for its own purposes? Perhaps some entity’sentry into our plane is facilitated by agents unaware of their participation,who think their activities are just for “lulz”? Is Cthulhu calling? Whatever maybe the case, strange coincidences have happened around Matt Furie’s disaffectedamphibian. These suggest that it may be a good policy to keep an open mind aboutthe matter.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •PROBABLY THE STRANGEST ideas that have gathered around Pepe are those thatrelate him to an ancient Egyptian god.33 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber244] Asone website puts it, Pepe is “the modern-day avatar of an ancient Egyptian deityaccidentally resurrected by online imageboard culture.”34[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber245] How this association was made is as follows.Users of 4chan grew tired of the ubiquitous LOL—“laugh out loud”—to expresstheir finding something funny. In its place they began to substitute “KEK.”Where did KEK come from? It is a mistranslation of LOL found on the World ofWarcraft video game. (Strangely this involved the Korean language; Trump’s andKim Jong Un’s saber rattling about nuclear war seems to add another ominouslayer to the mix.) Gamers found that when they wanted to write LOL it came outKEK. They decided to go for it and use KEK from then on. So when one of Trump’stweets tickled them, they burst out kekking.I should point out that it was in the gaming culture that ex-Breitbart.comwriter Milo Yiannopoulos came to prominence. Yiannopoulos was Breitbart’stechnology editor and he promoted a conspiracy theory known as “Gamergate” thatstarted in 2014. This was centered around the idea that a few feminists in thevideo game industry—aka “social justice warriors”—appalled at its supposedoverly masculine character were using games to promote a gender-equality agendaand that journalists in the industry were colluding with this. It was atechno-tempest in a teapot, but it led to online harassment, much abuse, evendeath threats, and gave the alt-right community another target in its campaignto reveal the truth about liberalism and its progressive aims.35[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber246] Dubbing himself the “most fabuloussupervillain on the internet,” Yiannopoulos was also banned from Twitter for his“campaign of hate” against the actress Leslie Jones for her performance in theGhostbusters remake.36 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber247]Users on 4chan are anonymous, but each post is given an eight-digit number toplace it in its thread. Sometimes these numbers contain duplicate, triplicate,and even quadruple digits, which appear at random. So a post may receive, say,76563444. The three 4s are a “trip.” Users don’t know what number they’llreceive until they post, and many began betting on whether they would get a dubor a trip, rather like rolling dice or playing a one-armed bandit in AtlanticCity. Dubs, trips, etc., are considered lucky and “special,” and when onearrives, it’s called a “Get.” When a user got a “Get,” he would type “KEK.”What began to happen was that many Trump posts were “Gets,” with many gettingdubs, trips, and even “quads.” There seemed to be something special about them.But this was just the beginning. The number of Gets surrounding Trump seemed tosuggest that he was receiving some kind of divine, or at least magical, help.This was confirmed for many users when one of them noticed something odd indeed.Pepe, Trump’s alt-right mascot, was, it seemed, a postmodern online version—orincarnation—of an ancient Egyptian frog-headed deity whose name was—wait forit—Kek. And to make things even stranger, what is Kek the god of? Chaos.37[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber248]In the ancient Egyptian Ogdoad cosmogony—Ogdoad means “eightfold”—Kek is anandrogynous deity personifying the power of “primordial darkness” and the comingforth of day. (One wonders if 4chaners notice the repeating eightfold motif?Eight gods and eight random posting digits?) With his feminine form Keket, he isseen as one half of the duality of day and night. The two can appear with thehead of a snake, a cat, or a frog. The gods of the Ogdoad are very ancient,reaching back to what is known as the Old Kingdom in the third millennium BCE.In later texts, from what is known as the Late Period—664–332 BCE—and inGreco-Roman times—305–30 BCE—all of the male gods of the Ogdoad were depictedwith frog heads, the feminine form being snake-headed. So Kek was not the onlyfrog-headed Egyptian god. Even so, the chances of a cartoon amphibian, amistranslation of an acronym, and an Egyptian god coming together meaningfullydo seem rather slim.But it is Kek’s peculiar significance that puts the icing on this synchronisticcake. Most authorities agree that Kek represents “primordial darkness,” but thatwith his feminine aspect he personifies the shift from darkness to light, ornight into day. We’ve seen that another name for “primordial darkness” is chaos,and that such darkness is both the “Neither-Neither” that chaos magicians wantto reach and the “unconditioned awareness of being” that Neville said wasnecessary to achieve in order for one’s desire to manifest. So in one sense, wecan say that Kek symbolizes the fundamental basis of both chaos magick and atleast one version of New Thought. We know that Trump is a devotee of NormanVincent Peale. But another part of this synchronistic puzzle is the odd factthat a reissue of one of Neville’s books, At Your Command, seemed to coincidenicely with Trump’s “victory of the will,” at least to one blogger.38[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber249] As Peale was a New Thought reader whorepackaged its basic ideas in a mainstream acceptable way, I think we can takethis connection for what it’s worth.But Kek is not the only god of chaos making an appearance these days. Trump,we’ve seen, is an avatar of this particular state too, or at least of confusion,or, less politely, of a mess. For many on the alt-right, Trump is only thebeginning. For them his ascendancy marks the end of the Old World Order. Formany alt-righters, Trump is seen as the force of change. He is the agent whowill bring down the system, bringing on the night of “primordial darkness” inorder for a new day to dawn.One other item in the Kek experience makes an association that would, I think,have done Erich von Däniken proud. One Pepe/Kek devotee came across a statuetteof what was thought to be Kek, although it was actually of an Egyptian froggoddess named Heqet. What was striking was that the hieroglyphics on thestatuette seemed to depict someone sitting in front of what looks like acomputer screen, accompanied by a kind of DNA spiral. This, to the initiated,was a depiction of what postmodern Kek devotees are doing: posting images ofPepe/Kek on the internet as sigils designed to bring forth the primordialdarkness as the precursor to a new day.In chaos magick, practically anything can be a sigil, as long as it iseffectively charged with one’s desire. Pepe has become what is known as a“hypersigil,” one used by many people—he’s even appeared in the form of AleisterCrowley. That Trump too appeared as Pepe seems somehow suggestive. Withthousands of alt-righters and 4chaners posting images of Pepe, saturating theinternet with them, the idea was that their focused desire that Trump should winwas bound to have an effect. And according to them, it has.39[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber250] Trump went from being a kind of clown withouta chance of success to first winning primaries, then getting the nomination, tobecoming president. He is now one of the most powerful men on the planet, andpeople like Richard Spencer and his associates feel they have had a hand ingetting him there.And it seemed to them that Trump’s enemies were feeling the effect too. WhenHillary Clinton apparently fainted during a ceremony marking the fifteenthanniversary of 9/11, many Pepeists believed it was because of their efforts. Shegot on the wrong side of Kek and suffered the consequences.40[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber251] Following Trump’s election, others in theoccult world began to take notice of his “efficacious magical ally” and began totake steps against him. Such was the “mass spell” cast by witches around theworld, begun in February 2017, “binding” Trump and all his associates, whichseemed to have some effect.41 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber252] If that isn’toccult politics, I don’t know what is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IN MANY WAYS one man is responsible for all of this happening. Like Trump,4chaners, and the alt-righters, Steve Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, seems tohave a grudge against the system and would like to take it down. As with some ofthe charismatic leaders we’ve looked at, it may be that with Bannon a frustratedcreative drive turned sour in some way and fueled what became a kind of popapocalyptic thinking. On more than one occasion Bannon has voiced the opinionthat some catastrophic global conflict is approaching, a huge upheaval that willchange everything, and that he is looking forward to it. He’s described himselfas a “Leninist,” someone who wants to dismantle the state, to “bring everythingcrashing down and destroy all of today’s establishment.”42[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber253]Bannon was born in 1953 into a working-class Irish Catholic family and startedhis career as an officer in the U.S. Navy. Like Trump he went to a militaryschool, a background he shares with Vladimir Putin’s adviser Alexander Dugin.Following his navy service, Bannon, who went to Harvard Business School, found aplace at Goldman Sachs and was later at the center of the subprime financialcrisis of 2007–8. Working in the mergers and acquisitions department, Bannonbecame rich during the years of hostile takeovers. In 1990 he started his owninvestment company, specializing in media. As a fee for negotiating the sale ofCastle Rock Entertainment to CNN, Bannon received shares of several televisionshows, one of which was Seinfeld. Not long after this, Bannon became actingdirector of Biosphere 2, an ecological and environmental experiment in Arizona.As we will see, this linked him in other ways to his Russian counterpart.Bannon began to find his real métier in Hollywood, when he became an executiveproducer, writer, and director in the film industry. Some early efforts featuredname actors, like Sean Penn (The Indian Runner, 1991) and Anthony Hopkins(Titus, 1999), and received critical nods if not box office acclaim. But it wasin documentaries that he showed his real flare, both for disturbing, overwroughtimagery and for ultraconservative, far-right politics.Occupy Unmasked (2012) depicts the Occupy movement as a group of drug addicts,rapists, and vandals intent on destroying the American government. It wasdescribed by The Nation as a “total fantasy.”43[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber254] In Battle for America (2010) Bannon tries, inhis own words, to “weaponize film.”44 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber255] The factthat it has many explosions must have helped.45[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber256] Stock footage of Roman centurions, Africanslaves, meteors exterminating dinosaurs, and buildings imploding, to voiceoversby Ann Coulter and Newt Gingrich, aimed to motivate conservative voters. It wasa follow-up to his paean to women conservatives, Fire in the Heartland (2010),and a warm-up to his tribute to Sarah Palin, The Undefeated (2011). All threefilms show solidarity with the Tea Party movement, whose back-to-basicspatriotism and “traditional values” featured largely in Generation Zero (2010),Bannon’s take on the financial crisis of 2007–8.Described as a “horror film” about the U.S. economy, Generation Zero“weaponizes” one of Bannon’s pet ideas. This is the notion that every eightyyears, America experiences a generational crisis, a “turning,” that changeseverything, for good or bad, a theory he absorbed from the book The FourthTurning (1997) by historians William Strauss and Neil Howe. The film’s villainsare the baby boomers—Bannon’s own generation—who, in the 1960s, abandoned theirparents’ values, “let it all hang out,” and forgot about history. Filled withapocalyptic scenes, the film was designed to scare its audience into realizingthat the next “turning” was upon them. “Fear is a good thing,” Bannon said.“Fear is going to lead you to take action.”46 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber257]It was in the 1960s that the liberal, permissive, progressive ideas that, forBannon and the alt-right, have become the new establishment, took root.Generation Zero aims to convince its viewers that it is time to pull them up.But it was Bannon’s tribute to Ronald Reagan, In the Face of Evil: Reagan’s Warin Word and Deed (2004), that set the stage for what was to come. Bannon becamea Reaganite after watching President Jimmy Carter’s handling of the Iran hostagecrisis (1979–81) on a navy destroyer anchored in the Arabian Sea. The crisiscost Carter a second term and put Reagan into office. It also made Bannon one ofReagan’s biggest fans.Bannon’s film made a fan for him as well. Andrew Breitbart was another Hollywoodwannabe, a “Brentwood brat” who in the 1980s listened to post-punk and grungewhile driving scripts around Los Angeles. A fan of right-wing radio talk showhost Rush Limbaugh, Breitbart heard in him “the professor I always wanted.”47[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber258] He proved a good student. According to onecommentator, what Breitbart and Bannon shared was a “deep-seated and ineffablealienation from the products of the entertainment industry,” a resentment thatbeing “just out of reach” of one’s object of desire can often trigger.48[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber259] Breitbart and Bannon made the samepsychological transference from anti-Hollywood to antiprogressive, adisplacement that the industry’s excesses, combined with its often ostentatiousdo-gooderism and social justice advocacy—read political correctness—helpedalong. It was from this stew of profligacy, debauchery, and on-your-sleeveliberalism that the evil of “the Progressive Left” was born. As NationalSocialism was to “degenerate art,” Breitbart was to Hollywood’s dream factory.Breitbart’s views led him to working at the conservative Drudge Report and fromthere to Arianna Huffington’s new Huffington Post. His forte was “minimalistblogging,” slapping a few links together with a catchy headline. It worked. SoonBreitbart had the wherewithal to launch his own neoreactionary organ. In 2005Breitbart.com was born.In 2004 Breitbart met Steve Bannon at a screening of In the Face of Evil. Heliked Bannon’s work, calling him the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Partymovement—Riefenstahl made Triumph of the Will (1935), a film about Hitler’s 1934Nuremberg rally. Breitbart went on to finance several of Bannon’s films. He alsointroduced him to the Mercer family, a wealthy and influential supporter ofconservative causes, and gave him a place in his new rebel media empire.Bannon quickly became a leading light at Breitbart News, a far-right websiteBreitbart founded in 2007 which aligned itself with the European New Right andpromoted a number of conspiracy theories. Its aim was to “change the world”through the “destruction of the old media guard.” Rather than defeat theProgressive Left through direct political action, the idea was to change theculture, to open the “Overton window,” the gauge of public acceptability of“radical” ideas, so that it would allow in what had hitherto been unthinkable.It was a media version of chaos magick’s aim of dismantling our “existingcognitive habits.” It led to a far-right version of the “new normal,” a culturalmilieu that aided and abetted the rise of Trump.Much of this new normal amounted to racial slurs and antiliberal attacks onwomen, birth control, transgender people, and other embodiments of the despisedProgressive Left.49 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber260] As in the Hitler era, Jewswere a standard target. Bannon said the Trump era would be “as exciting as the1930s,” and for many it seems that’s true.50 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber261]One sign of this is the lulz many get from “naming the Jew,” pointing outcommentators and critics with Jewish-sounding last names and placing them within(( )), a kind of identity “echo chamber” that precludes any need for argument.Linked to this is the idea of a kind of “ethnic determinism,” which amounts tothe belief that one’s ethnicity determines one’s behavior. Like it or not Jewscan’t help being Jewish, even if they wanted to, something the Viennese Jewishphilosopher Otto Weininger, who found a fan in Adolf Hitler, believed. Thiswould mean of course that non-Jews of whatever background can’t help theirbehavior either, which begs the question of why the alt-right and its fellowtravelers are still a minority, or why the majority of non-Jews are not“ethnically correct.” Trump’s own ideas about genetics suggest a similarsensibility. His own family, he believes, are the carriers of “superiorgenes.”51 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber262]In 2012 Andrew Breitbart died and Bannon took over, a position he maintaineduntil he became Trump’s chief strategist in 2016. It was then thatBreitbart.com, a new, streamlined, user-friendly revamp, became, in Bannon’swords, “a platform for the alt-right.” As Trump did with the NPI, he wouldbackpedal from this announcement soon enough.52[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber263] Bannon’s politically necessary distancing hascost him some street cred with his erstwhile fan base. Many see him now as avoice for the “alt-lite,” not as bad as the “cuckservatives”—conservatives notas radical as the alt-right whom they despise as much as liberals—but no longerquite in the trenches with them.53 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber264] But beforethis Bannon raised the alt-right flag high. According to former Breitbart editorBen Shapiro, with Bannon in charge the comment section turned into “a cesspoolfor white supremacist meme makers.”54 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber265] Now thatBannon has left the White House and returned to Breitbart, in order to fight“from the outside for the agenda President Trump ran on,” it remains to be seenhow his relationship with the alt-right will develop.55[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber266]One cause they did share was was anti-immigration, a banner Bannon applaudedvigorously, as did others. Many of Bannon’s ideas about the danger ofimmigration—mostly of Muslims—came from a controversial novel published inFrance in 1973.56 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber267] The Camp of the Saints byJean Raspail depicts an “invasion” of Europe by a “flotilla of refugees,” notfrom the Arab world but from India.Geography aside, this very readable fiction depicts the effect of a “vanguard ofan anti-world bent on coming in the flesh to knock, at long last, at the gatesof abundance.”57 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber268] When well-meaningmuddleheaded liberals refuse to repel the invading armada of the wretched, theresult is the collapse of Western civilization. The 800,000 invaders encourage“people of color” within the white world to rebel. Chaos ensues and tables areturned. There are some defenders. A gentleman of old French blood shoots ahippie welcoming the horde. As he does so he thinks of other Western defenders:Charles Martel, Godfrey of Bouillon, and Baldwin the Leper King, defender ofJerusalem. As he does he reflects, “I’m sure I would have shown a certain zealpoking my blade through Arab flesh.”58 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber269] Somemembers of the Charles Martel Society, a revamp of the anti-Arab Charles MartelGroup of the 1970s, founded by Henry Regnery II in 2001, might agree.What troubles Raspail’s defender of the West is the “mixture of races, andcultures, and life-styles,” which for him would mean “the end of France as weknow it; the end of the French as a nation.”59 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber270]Such worries occupy old-school far-right politicians like Marine Le Pen and thenew breed of nationalists concerned with “identity politics.” The members ofGénération Identitaire share many of Bannon’s concerns. Bannon’s stamp is onTrump’s executive order banning travelers from seven Muslim countries enteringthe United States, an edict that may have hit an astral wall erected by the“binding spell” cast by anti-Trump witches.Bannon, an ex–military man, seems keen on war. We are fighting a war on “Islamicfascism,” a war to “save American jobs,” and will, sometime in the next decade,be at war “in the South China Sea.”60 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber271] Bannoneven wrote a letter to then President Obama, praising the atom bombs dropped onHiroshima and Nagasaki and berating him for “apologizing” for them. Hisbellicosity echoes that of Alexander Dugin, who is also looking forward to someglobal conflict. It isn’t surprising then that Bannon, like Trump and others wehave looked at, shows Right Man tendencies. When Bannon took control ofBiosphere 2 he immediately changed all the locks and erased the computer andtelephone codes. He called a female scientist who objected to this a“twenty-nine-year-old bimbo.” When she showed him a list of safety problems, hethreatened to “ram it down her fucking throat.” One of his ex-wives accused himof violence and more than one woman has done so for abuse.61[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber272] According to one critic, his rhetoric is“infused with the reactionary militaristic jargon of blood and horror,” anassessment with which viewers of his films might agree.62[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber273]Bannon’s time in the navy may have primed him for this military turn of mind.But the “warrior ethos” goes a long way with the alt-right. One intellectualheavyweight informing their views elevated the warrior to a high spiritualstanding. In “An Establishment Conservative’s Guide to the Alt-Right,” MiloYiannopoulos and Allum Bokhari give the uninitiated a quick rundown on thethinkers who set the alt-right apart from “old school racist skinheads.”63[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber274] What distinguishes the alt-right from itspredecessors, they say, is their intelligence. This is also what makes them“dangerous.”At least one of the thinkers they refer to as a “must read” was described asexactly that. In 1935 in a letter to his publisher Peter Suhrkamp, the Germannovelist Hermann Hesse—pacifist and prisoner of war advocate—spoke of someone as“a dazzling and interesting, but very dangerous author.”64[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber275] He was referring to Julius Evola."},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]CHAPTER FIVEIT’S TRADITIONON FEBRUARY 10, 2017, The New York Times ran a story about a speech Steve Bannongave to a select group in the Vatican in 2014.1[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber276] On a summer’s day Bannon spoke from LosAngeles via Skype to members of a conference hosted by the Human DignityInstitute, a group founded by conservative factions within the church in orderto promote a “Christian voice” in European politics.2[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber277] Bannon spoke of many things: the “global TeaParty movement,” which included members from the European far right, like UKIP’sNigel Farage and Marine Le Pen of France’s National Front; the dangers ofsecularization; the coming cataclysmic conflict between the Judeo-Christian Westand “Islamic fascism”; and the looming crisis of capitalism, among others.3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber278] But what stood out for the Times was that,while expressing his mixed admiration for Vladimir Putin, whom he considered“very intelligent,” Bannon dropped a name that set off some alarms. Talkingabout one of Putin’s “advisers”—Alexander Dugin—Bannon said that he “hearkensback to Julius Evola and different writers of the early twentieth century whoare really the supporters of what’s called the traditionalist movement.”4[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber279]Bannon repeated what is usually said about Evola, and which always gets hisserious readers up in arms, namely that Evola’s Traditionalism “metastasizedinto Italian fascism,” which is not exactly correct. And his linking of the“traditional values” that Putin supposedly espouses with Evola’s Traditionalismis perhaps even further off. But the fact that Bannon mentioned Evola at allseemed to suggest something, at least to those who knew who Evola was and whathe stood for.For Richard Spencer, Evola is “one of the most fascinating men of the twentiethcentury,” praise we might expect, given that Evola provides much of thedialectical finesse that separates Spencer’s alt-right from the “low IQ thugs”of the primitive old far right.5 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber280] AlexanderDugin thinks well of him too, and shares Evola’s vision of “modernity” as “thecause of the future catastrophe of humanity.”6 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber281]But not all praise for Evola comes from such expected quarters. Writing forParabola magazine, Richard Smoley, a scholar of esotericism not associated withTraditionalism, said Evola was “one of the most difficult and ambiguous figuresin modern esotericism.” Joscelyn Godwin, another respected esoteric scholar,said of Evola that “such an encounter with a totally original mind is a rarityin these days of bland consensus.” Reading Evola’s description of intensespiritual states, Godwin said, is “like watching a champion mountain-climber ona vertical glacier.”This would have pleased Evola, who was a mountaineer and whose ashes weredeposited in a crevasse on Monte Rosa in the Pennine Alps in 1974.7[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber282] Throughout his life Evola strove to keep astrict distance between himself and the world of common humanity, and heregarded society’s lowlands with what is usually called a “Nietzschean” disdain.As he wrote in his intellectual autobiography, The Path of Cinnabar, “I havekept myself free from the constraints of the society in which I live.”8[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber283]This stringent differentiation is the key to Evola’s life. He was always l’uomodifferenziato, “one who is different.” For him “mountainous peaks” and“spiritual peaks” “converge in one simple and yet powerful reality,” and bothare equally far afield from the average run of things.9[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber284] And just as the mountaintop is reached only bythe persevering few—except where a ski lift has been put in—so too the spiritualpeaks are available only to those infrequent individuals possessed of thenecessary will and daring to master them.To his admirers, Evola is such a one. Others have a different point of view. ForThe New York Times Evola “became the darling of Italian Fascists, and Italy’spost-Fascist terrorists of the 1960s and 1970s looked to him as a spiritual andintellectual godfather.” What the Times says here is only half true. Evola wasnot as influential on Italian fascism as he would have liked to have been, buthe was and remains an influence on far-right politics in Europe, and if thealt-right have their way, this will be true in the States too.Gábor Vona, leader of the far-right Jobbik movement in Hungary, wrote anintroduction to a collection of Evola’s essays, entitled Manual for NationalistYouth.10 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber285] The Greek neo-Nazi movement GoldenDawn—no relation to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn—puts another Evolacollection at the head of its mandatory reading list.11[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber286] In the 1990s, manuals on how to live theTraditional life, inspired by Evola, appeared in Italy. These promoted valuesthat could form a “bulwark against the onslaught of profoundly disruptiveforces” coming, more times than not, from the liberal side of the politicaldivide.12 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber287] These manuals were written bymembers of Raido, “a community of individuals ready to uphold Traditional valuesin society and politics.” Their aim was to educate “young political militants inthe ranks of the Italian radical right.”13 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber288]This was in service of a “jihad to be waged at every moment against the enemieswithin.”14 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber289]These and other similar writings were aimed at readers ready not only to embracenew and radical ideas, but to do something about them.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •GIVEN SUCH MILITARY sentiments, that Bannon, prophet of war, should name-dropEvola seems natural. Yet while Evola’s warrior spirituality might appeal toBannon, the kind of “economic nationalism” that Bannon professes would have leftEvola cold. Evola’s political and social views ran to caste systems andmonarchies, and the populist appeal that put Trump in power would have nauseatedhim, as would Bannon’s gestures to forces within the Vatican. It was these samemistakes of Mussolini that convinced Evola that fascism in Italy was heading inthe wrong direction. Mussolini depended too much on the mob and was too ready tomake deals with the church to insure his position. But this did not put Evolaoff fascism; it was only Mussolini’s brand that left a bad taste in his mouth.For Evola, what Il Duce had in place was simply not Fascist enough. Hisilluminated politics went way beyond it.“Darkness is good,” Bannon told The Hollywood Reporter. “Dick Cheney. DarthVader. Satan. That’s power.”15 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber290] Did Bannonthink of this when he name-checked Evola?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •TRADITIONALISM, WE’VE SEEN, believes in a primal revelation given at the dawn ofhistory, which was subsequently obscured by the accretions growing around thegreat religions. How did it become associated with fascism? How did the idea ofthe perennial philosophy come to underwrite notions of a totalitarian society?How did a belief that began in the Renaissance come to inform an ideology thatsees the Renaissance itself as the source of our modern woes? Is Traditionalism,as Umberto Eco believed, a kind of Ur-fascism, or is that true of only someexpressions of it?To address these questions we need to go back to the beginning. And this, infact, is exactly what Traditionalism itself wants to do.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ALTHOUGH IT PLACES its origin in the dim past, Traditionalism as it is knowntoday has its roots in the occult revival of the late nineteenth century.London, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and other European cities were filled with amystical excitement, even an occult hysteria. None were as exciting orfashionable as Paris. It was into this milieu that a twenty-year-old René Guénonarrived in 1906 and it is with him that Traditionalism begins.Guénon’s introduction to the Traditionalist faith came through his associationwith Gérard Encausse. Under his pseudonym “Papus,” Encausse, a doctor andsurgeon, was the doyen of occult Paris during the fin de siècle. Barely readtoday, even in the French-speaking world, in the years before World War I, Papuswas the authority on practically all aspects of the esoteric path. Encausee tookhis pseudonym “Papus” from a physician mentioned in one of the works ofApollonius of Tyana. Under that name he wrote dozens of books on everything fromthe Tarot to Freemasonry and was at the heart of practically every occultsociety in France active at the time. When a young René Guénon decided to enterthe Parisian occult world, he came to the right place.René Guénon was an eccentric character, a personality of fastidious exactitudewho was obsessed with “getting it right.” He was born in 1886 in Blois incentral France, and spent most of his early years ill, being cared for andtutored by a spinster aunt. Like many drawn to the occult path, he spent much ofhis time alone. Possessed of a sharp critical intellect, early on he developed ataste for mathematics, a preference for the stable and immutable over thechanging and transient. This need for certainty precluded an appreciation of theimagination, a lack that another advocate of tradition, the poet and Blakescholar Kathleen Raine, noted in Guénon.16 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber291]What concerned him was the “transcendent.” He had no interest in history. Forhim, the last two thousand years were “relatively unimportant.” This dismissalof history was linked to a profound antipathy to the modern world, a dislikeshared by Traditionalists to come.Another trait that surfaced soon was his “rightness.” Once Guénon had arrived athis conclusions about anything, no argument could shake him, and he refused toadmit he could be wrong. This certitude produced at times certain paranoidtendencies, which informed later beliefs about “black brotherhoods” and“counter-initiates” conspiring against him.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE OCCULT WORLD that Guénon entered centered on Edmond Bailly’s IndependentArts bookshop, in Rue de la Chaussée d’Atin, a location frequented by manyartists and writers in fin de siècle Paris. Claude Debussy, J. K. Huysmans,Odilon Redon, Erik Satie, and others would gather there with occultists likeStanislas de Guaita and Joséphin “Sâr” Péladan, head of a modern Rosicrucianorder. L’Initiation, Papus’s journal, was their occult reading material, as wasLe Voile d’Isis (The Veil of Isis), Papus’s other journal, which would laterbecome Les Études Traditionelles (Traditional Studies).Papus started out a Theosophist but left to focus on his own interests, whichwere more Western oriented. He started his own independent group for esotericstudies, what he called the Hermetic School. And he also started a Martinistorder, based on the work of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, who wrote books ofmystical insight in the early nineteenth century under the pseudonym of the“Unknown Philosopher.”There was one other esoteric tradition that Papus carried on, a strange form ofoccult politics known as “synarchy.” What is synarchy? The easiest way tounderstand it is to see it as the opposite of anarchy. If anarchy means “nogovernment,” synarchy means “total government.”Papus inherited this tradition from the eccentric French occultist JosephAlexandre Saint-Yves d’Alveydre. Saint-Yves acquired it himself, he said, fromastral journeys he had taken to the underground city of Agartha.Where is Agartha? That is a good question.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •BY MOST ACCOUNTS Agartha is somewhere under the earth, perhaps below the GobiDesert. Guénon himself would ponder this and write about it in his book The Lordof the World. Wherever Agartha is, it is governed under the laws of synarchy, atotalitarian caste-bound organic social ordering headed by a Sovereign Pontiffknown as the Brahmatma, Guénon’s Lord of the World. He is the supreme leader,the spiritual and political head of a theocratic state. Synarchy is the sort ofgovernment many Traditionalists would approve of. It is a kind of literalized“body politic,” based on universal principles in which everyone has his or herproper place and in which there is little room for what we think of asdemocracy. It is, depending on one’s perspective, a stable or rigid socialarrangement, something along the lines of Plato’s Republic or the Hindu Laws ofManu. Fundamentally it means a society based on the threefold division of thehuman being into intellectual, emotional, and instinctive functions.17[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber292]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •SAINT-YVES HAD AN interest in the occult, and like Éliphas Lévi, he combinedthis with an ardent Catholicism—his title “Marquis d’Alveydre” was given to himby the pope. Also like Lévi, he embraced the idea of an ages-long tradition ofsecret knowledge, handed down through the centuries, much as Traditionalismdoes, something he found in the work of Antoine Fabre d’Olivet, who wrote of the“primal language” at the dawn of history. The legend of Agartha came toSaint-Yves through his Sanskrit tutor, Haji Sharif, who, he discovered, couldalso teach him the unknown ancient Agarthian language of Vattan. Within theAgarthian tongue many secrets of the universe were concealed, Haji told him.Saint-Yves soon agreed.Saint-Yves would also have heard about Agartha or Asgartha from a book by theFrench traveler Louis Jacolliot, from whom Madame Blavatsky borrowedjudiciously, Le Fils de Dieu (The Son of God). In it Jacolliot speaks of ahidden prehistoric city, Asgartha, which lies somewhere in Central Asia and isthe home of the Aryan race. Many people later came to know of Agartha when itformed part of the grab bag of occult misinformation making up the bestsellingMorning of the Magicians, the book that set off the occult revival of the1960s.18 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber293] But Saint-Yves’s most detailedknowledge of Agartha most likely came from his own visits there, which he tookin a kind of waking dream, a journey into the “Neither-Neither” of thehypnagogic state.19 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber294]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •SAINT-YVES WROTE OF his astral adventures in Agartha in his book Mission del’Inde (The Mission of India). He described a vast, subterranean technologicallyadvanced empire whose millions of inhabitants are in perfect harmony with theirplace in the social hierarchy. They are fitted into their social slot as a cellis to a human body. And like cells, they cannot rebel against their fate withoutmaking the entire body politic ill. Ages ago, all of the earth shared in thisharmonious rule. But a schism circa 4000 BCE fragmented the world into aplurality of states and marked the start of the Kali Yuga, our present dark age,and forced the Sovereign Pontiff and his people underground. There he and theyhave waited ever since. When the upper world returns to harmony and accepts therule of synarchy, Saint-Yves tells us, the Brahmatma will be happy to share hisgreater knowledge and wisdom with it. In the meantime he is patient.Saint-Yves, however, was so eager to accept the Brahmatma’s generous offer thathe wrote letters to Pope Leo XIII, Queen Victoria, and Tsar Alexander III,pressing them to see the benefits of synarchic rule. Saint-Yves went on tocampaign very successfully for the synarchic cause, drawing large crowds tolectures, lobbying government ministers, and distributing synarchic literaturewidely. In 1893 he was made a Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur for his work inpromoting synarchy as a response to the threat of anarchist terrorism that wasas much a part of everyday European life then as it is today, with anarchistbombs exploding left and right in many capitals. Saint-Yves promoted thesynarchic cause vigorously, but he did have second thoughts about his source forsynarchist wisdom. No sooner had his account of his astral journey to Agarthaseen print than he ordered all copies of the book destroyed. Only two survived,Saint-Yves’s own and a copy his printer secretly hid. It is because of thishidden copy that we know of Saint-Yves’s adventures in the underworld.Saint-Yves never explained his action, which has left room for others tospeculate about it. One suggestion was that he had simply fabricated the storyof Agartha from earlier sources, like Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s tale of anunderground super-civilization, The Coming Race, and then had a change of heart.But perhaps the Brahmatma, hearing of his account, compelled him to recant it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •YET EVEN WITHOUT the benefit of Saint-Yves’s account synarchy seemed toflourish. In The Sion Revelation Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince argue thatduring the years entre deux guerres synarchy made its way through Frenchright-wing politics.20 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber295] It then found a home inVichy France, went underground, and may even be seen in the occult landscapingof François Mitterrand, who created a new “psychogeography” of Paris. Thepyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre, familiar to readers of The Da VinciCode, and the “stargate” at La Grande Arche de la Défense, along with othersites, were created by Mitterrand during his time as French president.21[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber296] These were laid out according to an esotericdesign that, Picknett and Prince argue, ultimately leads back to synarchy.Picknett and Prince even argue that the European Union, which we can say beganwith the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1950, is anoutgrowth of synarchy.22 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber297] Saint-Yves hadlobbied vigorously for a Europe united into a single, synarchic state, with ahierarchical structure not dissimilar to that of the church. This aim wasechoed, say Picknett and Prince, by Winston Churchill when in 1946 he called forthe establishment of a “kind of United States of Europe.” The gradual dominanceof the EU over more and more of its individual member states’ autonomy—as theEU’s critics see it—may be evidence, Picknett and Prince suggest, of a slowfulfillment of the synarchy plan.With this in mind it is curious to reflect that the warm-up to Trump’s “victoryof the will” was the referendum in Great Britain in 2016 to leave the EuropeanUnion, otherwise known as Brexit, which won by a close majority. The man mostresponsible for this was Nigel Farage, whose United Kingdom Independence Partyis a member of Steve Bannon’s “global Tea Party Movement.” Like Bannon, Farageis a staunch nationalist and an advocate of “traditional”—if notTraditionalist—values. Trump himself has expressed mixed messages regarding theEU and, as we will see, Vladimir Putin does not have its best wishes at heart.For Alexander Dugin, the EU is an expression of the global neoliberal hegemonywhich, as an agent of chaos, he is determined to bring down.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IN 1906 GUÉNON joined Papus’s Martinist Order and also found a place in hisIndependent Group for Esoteric Studies.23 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber298] LikePapus he backed away from Theosophy and would soon attack it and other forms ofmodern occultism as “counter-initiatic.” Spiritualism too would suffer hisdisdain but not before he himself dabbled in it. Spirits were in fact the reasonGuénon parted from Papus. During one séance with his fellow Martinists, a spiritclaiming to be that of Jacques de Molay, the last leader of the Knights Templar,instructed Guénon to establish a new Templar Order.The Knights Templar was a religious military order formed in 1118 to ensure safepassage for pilgrims in the Holy Land. They later rose to great prominence andpower but were suppressed by Pope Clement V in 1307. According to Saint-Yves,the Templars organized themselves along synarchic lines. They are a classicexpression of Evola’s “holy warrior.” Guénon later would argue that theirsuppression marked a singular phase of the Kali Yuga, signaling the abdicationof spiritual rule to secular power.The spirit Guénon contacted commanded him to start an Order of the TempleRenewed and Guénon complied. The Knights Templar are often suggested as thefounders of Freemasonry, with which Guénon had an ambivalent relation, writinganti-Masonic tracts for Catholic journals while he was still a Mason. Guénon’sRenewed Temple, however, did not last long. One reason was that Papus did nottake kindly to the fact that in order to swell its ranks, Guénon had availedhimself of his mailing list. Catching wind of this, he expelled Guénon from hisgroups. The etheric Jacques de Molay seemed to agree with this development; notlong after Guénon’s expulsion, he ordered him to disband the renewed Templarorder too.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •GUÉNON FOUND A literary home for a while in the Catholic journal Regnabit,associated with the Cult of the Sacred Heart, which Picknett and Prince argueplayed an important role in promoting a form of synarchy.24[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber299] He became involved with Charles Maurras andthe Catholic, nationalist, royalist right-wing movement Action Française, someof whose later members found common cause with the new National Front. He alsobecame a bishop in the Gnostic Church of Jules Doinel and started the journal LaGnose, where he published articles on spiritualism and esotericism. But the mostimportant influence on Guénon after Papus was a Swedish-French painter turnedSufi anarchist named Ivan Aguéli. Aguéli was an eccentric character who oftengave anarchist speeches wearing a turban and Arab dress. Aguéli’s anarchism didnot rub off on Guénon, but his Sufism did.25 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber300]Guénon was in search of a “living tradition,” a vital connection to thetranscendental truths revealed to mankind in the dim past, which he believedcould still be found hidden within the great religions. In an increasinglysecular world this was hard to come by. Guénon first believed he had found whathe was looking for in Catholicism. He was soon disenchanted with the church andturned his attention to Hinduism. His first book, Introduction to the Study ofHindu Doctrine, based on a doctoral dissertation rejected by the Sorbonne, waspublished in 1921. But after meeting Aguéli, Guénon switched allegiance toIslam. He may have been initiated into a Sufi order then, or this may have takenplace only later in Cairo. In 1927, Guénon abandoned an increasingly decadentEurope for Egypt, where he would live in practical seclusion until his death in1951. Either way, Guénon became in many ways a model Muslim and an exemplar tolater Traditionalists.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •BEFORE LEAVING FRANCE, Guénon was a familiar figure in the occult Paris of the1920s. He was a close friend of Paul Chacornac, of Chacornac Brothers, apublisher who ran an occult bookshop near the Seine in the shadow of Notre Damede Paris.26 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber301] They published Guénon’s work andtook over publishing Papus’s Le Voile d’ Isis after his death in 1917, whichGuénon had a hand in turning into Les Études Traditionnelles. Another importantesoteric meeting place was Pierre Dujols and Alexandre Thomas’s wonderfullynamed Librairie du Merveilleux (Bookshop of the Marvelous), which served as aheadquarters for Papus’s Martinist order. One of the many occult figures itcounted among its clientele was the then alchemist and later maverickEgyptologist René Schwaller de Lubicz.Schwaller de Lubicz is known to contemporary readers through the work of GrahamHancock, who, in books like Fingerprints of the Gods—written with RobertBauval—popularized Schwaller’s belief that the Sphinx is thousands of yearsolder than the official estimate. At this time, Schwaller had yet to turn hisattention to Egypt, and was deep into his alchemical research, carried on, hesays, with the enigmatic alchemist Fulcanelli. His main focus was on themysteries of the Gothic cathedrals about which Fulcanelli—his real identityremains unknown— would publish a book stolen, Schwaller de Lubicz said, fromhim.27 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber302] There’s no record of Schwaller deLubicz and Guénon ever meeting, but we may assume their paths may have crossedin the occult underworld along the Seine.Schwaller de Lubicz would head to Egypt in 1936, but before then he dabbled in akind of occult politics that would have appealed to Guénon and Evola. Indeed,the kind of “pharaonic” cosmology and psychology Schwaller de Lubicz later foundamong the monuments at Luxor would appeal very much to Evola’s own interest in a“regal” esotericism.28 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber303] But in 1917 Schwaller’spolitical ambitions were more modest and were centered around a group he hadformed called Les Veilleurs, “the Watchers.” This was a select group who feltthe same distaste for the modern world and the “revolt of the masses” thatSchwaller de Lubicz shared with Guénon.The Watchers’ numbers were not large. Included among them was Schwaller’s wife,Isha, author of Her-Bak and other books about ancient Egypt; the Lithuanianmystical poet and statesman O. V. de Lubicz Milosz; Gaston Revel, editor of thejournal Le Théosophe; and Vivian Postel du Mas, whom we will meet again shortly,along with a few others.29 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber304] Some famous nameswho occasionally attended meetings were the astronomer Camille Flammarion andthe painter Fernand Léger.The Watchers were opposed to the modern world and espoused the traditionalvalues associated with esotericism. They rejected democracy and socialism, allforms of mass culture, and materialism, and thought in terms of some kind oftheocratic state. They were linked to a group called the Apostolic Center whosemotto, “Hierarchy-Fraternity-Liberty,” gave a synarchic twist to the battle cryof the French Revolution, commonly accepted as an event ushering in the age ofmodern politics. The Apostolic Center espoused an “occultist synarchy . . .inspired by the ideas of Saint-Yves de’Alveydre.” In some accounts the ApostolicCenter acted as a kind of “exoteric” form of the Watchers, with suitableapplicants moving from one group to the other.30[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber305]As their name suggests the Watchers were not activists, but they did publish ajournal, The Watcher, the most objectionable aspect of which was its strain ofanti-Semitism. This was a trait of Schwaller de Lubicz’s that André VandenBroeckdiscovered to his dismay. Like many who study esotericism, VandenBroeck foundthat one’s search for inner wisdom does not always agree with one’s politics.VandenBroeck, who spent more than a year with Schwaller de Lubicz in the early1960s, saw that, for all his mystic insight, his guru was in many ways a“typical bourgeois French gentleman,” a “man of the right” who suffered from a“xenophobia coupled with religious intolerance.”31[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber306]This hit home especially when VandenBroeck read an article Schwaller de Lubiczhad written for the initial issue of The Watcher, in which members of Schwallerde Lubicz’s elite declared the group’s aims and values. VandenBroeck wastroubled that when announcing the Watchers’ existence to the world, Schwaller deLubicz’s contribution did not concern esoteric insights or deep interpretationsof alchemical symbols. It was instead a “Letter to the Jews,” urging them to “Gobuild your country and construct a square tower in Zion.” In other words, leaveFrance, which is not really your home, a sentiment not altogether different fromthat informing Raspail’s Camp of the Saints.VandenBroeck said he saw much value in some of Schwaller’s political views, butthat this was overshadowed by the “propensity for demagogism” and “fascism” thattoo often accompanied them.32 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber307] VandenBroeckfelt that once again he had encountered “the pernicious weed that grows at theextreme political right,” which is often offered “in the name ofspirituality.”33 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber308]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •YET EVEN MORE sinister was a casual remark Schwaller made about the Watchers’dress code. Part of their irritation with cultural decline included a distastefor modern dress. Noting the idiocies of the fashion industry—difficult tomiss—Schwaller casually remarked that this wasn’t the case with the Watchers.The men there, he said, “all wore the same attire: boots, riding pants, and adark shirt.”34 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber309]This getup would not have raised eyebrows except that in the same breathSchwaller added: “Ce qui plus tard est devenu l’uniforme des SA.” “This laterbecame the uniform of the SA.” The SA, or Sturmabteilung, were the brown-shirtedparamilitary thugs who were wiped out once they helped Hitler to power. ThatSchwaller could mention a link between his esoteric haute couture and Nazirabble-rousers without a pause was one thing. But how did the SA know how aWatcher dressed?VandenBroeck discovered the answer years later, after his apprenticeship withSchwaller had ended. Maurice Girodias, infamous publisher of the OlympiaPress—which featured erotic works by Henry Miller, Vladimir Nabokov, andothers—knew Schwaller and VandenBroeck, and visiting VandenBroeck once he left abook behind. In La Synarchie—he mentions no author—VandenBroeck read aboutVivian Postel du Mas, as mentioned, one of the early Watchers. The book said shewas an advocate of Saint-Yves’s synarchy and had written an Outline of anArchetypal Society as well as a Synarchist Pact, which described a society basedon the “four orders that correspond to the caste system.”35[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber310] VandenBroeck had heard of synarchy as ashadowy movement in France in the 1930s and ’40s, especially during the years ofNazi occupation. The book also made a reference to the Watchers and VandenBroecksuddenly saw the connection between them and the SA. One of the members the bookmentioned was Rudolf Hess, future deputy Führer of Nazi Germany and one of thefew top-ranking Nazis with real occult interests.VandenBroeck later read Girodias’s autobiography, where he describes meetingsome synarchists at a Krishnamurti lecture in Paris sometime in the 1930s.Referring to their riding boots, Girodias asked if they were “God’s own StormTroopers.” Girodias also saw du Mas at the founding of a Synarchist Order, wherehe presented a contemporary version of the caste system, a hierarchy andgovernment based on the “differences between distinct categories of humanbeings.”36 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber311]VandenBroeck soon connected the dots. Did Rudolf Hess copy the Watcher appareland import it to the SA? Was Schwaller de Lubicz really the inspiration for auniform that has come to symbolize the worst elements in human nature, anexample of what the political journalist William Pfaff called the “counterfeitchivalry” that characterized the fascism entre deux guerres?37[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber312] Like Evola, Schwaller de Lubicz had a tastefor chivalry and heraldry, which was for both a sign of their aristocratictemperament. Hess we know was a member of the notorious Thule Society, apro-Aryan Munich group that melded with Hitler’s German Workers Party, and whosefounder, Rudolf Sebottendorf, is sometimes counted among the Traditionalists.38[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber313] The German Workers Party would eventuallybecome the National Socialist German Workers Party, or Nazis for short. Doclothes make the man?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •SCHWALLER DE LUBICZ soon abandoned any political ideas and moved on, leaving theWatchers behind. Guénon was one step ahead of him—at least he never believed anygood would come from politics. The Western world was on its way out. We simplyneed to stand aside and watch it fall.Guénon made this point clear in The Crisis of the Modern World, which, with TheReign of Quantity, is probably his most influential work. The Crisis of theModern World appeared in 1927, a time when a sense of decline was in the air.Oswald Spengler’s Decline of the West had been a bestseller a decade earlier.Martin Heidegger’s Being and Time, published the same year, concerned with theWest’s “forgetfulness of being,” hit a similar note, as had T. S. Eliot’sepochal poem “The Waste Land,” published in 1922. But Guénon’s work had apeculiar ferocity. As “the primordial spirituality becomes gradually more andmore obscure . . . the purely material character” of our era, he writes, turnsthe modern world into “a veritable monstrosity.”39[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber314] It is the “abomination of desolation” of thegospels. It is a complete “inversion”—one of his main concepts—of the castesystem, the aim of which is to “eliminate every principle of higher order.”40[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber315] One of the central ills responsible for thisis “individualism,” which he sees as “the mainspring for the development of thelowest possibilities of mankind.”41 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber316]Guénon’s view of history was of irrevocable decline from a primordial goldenage, accelerated at certain points by particularly irredeemable developments.One such development was the Renaissance, the flowering of humanism, which setthe stage for what we know as the modern world. As Mark Sedgwick in his historyof Traditionalism points out, the irony here is that it is with the Renaissanceitself that Traditionalism really begins.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE IDEA OF a primordial revelation at the heart of all the great religionsappears in history during the Council of Ferrara-Florence (1438–45). It wasintroduced by Gemistos Plethon, a Byzantine Neoplatonic philosopher who, to keepbusy while his fellow attendees split theological hairs, gave a series oflectures on what he called the prisca theologia, or “ancient theology.” InPlethon’s version this was preserved by the Persian mage Zoroaster and otheradepts at the dawn of time, and it was at the heart of all religions. Plethonurged this idea on his audience in order to persuade them to see the newlyrediscovered Plato not as a threat to Christianity, but as a precursor of andcomplement to it.42 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber317]Not long after Plethon, the Renaissance Platonist Marsilio Ficino would add themythical Hermes Trismegistus to the members of the Aurea Catena, or “GoldenChain of Adepts,” the bearers of the primordial revelation handed down throughthe ages. As the historian Frances Yates argued, Ficino’s Hermeticism and beliefin a perennial philosophy shared by all religions informed much of theRenaissance genius and made important inroads in an attempt to steerChristianity toward a kind of “multi-faith” consciousness.43[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber318] In 1540 the Catholic scholar Agostino Steucocoined the term philosophia perennis as a name for the original source fromwhich both Christianity and Platonism emerged. It was some form of this ideathat led Éliphas Lévi to believe in a secret universal doctrine. In another formit reached Guénon.Traditionalism Guénon-style accepts the basic premise of a primordialrevelation, but it argues that since that noble beginning, mankind has steadilygone downhill, away from the spiritual and increasingly toward the secular. Thatin a nutshell is the Kali Yuga. The Renaissance saw the rediscovery of theancients, and the valorizing of the pristine past over the present, which is atthe heart of Traditionalism. But it also saw the rise of the human over thedivine. The past rediscovered in the works of Plato and the Corpus Hermeticumempowered the human, a development expressed in Pico della Mirandola’s Orationon the Dignity of Man, which jettisons the medieval idea of human beings aswretched sinful creatures. With the rise of science shortly after, thishumanism—or hubris, depending on your view—soon challenged the divine’s primacy.By the beginning of the twentieth century, this process had become complete,with materialism and “scientism,” “all too human” philosophies, supporting the“reign of quantity” over quality that Guénon saw in power everywhere.44[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber319]Politically this decline was expressed in the rise of democracy, socialism,communism, and other manifestations of the “people” geared fundamentally towarda high secular, not spiritual, standard of living. Guénon rejected these because“the higher cannot proceed from the lower.”45 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber320]Yet the modern world accepts this inversion, and where “all that really mattersis in fact in decline”—the truths of the primordial revelation—“people foolishlysuppose they see progress,” with the increase of “freedom,” “equality,”individualism, and material prosperity.46 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber321]Guénon’s synarchic tutoring is evident in his observation that in the modernworld “nobody any longer occupies the place that he should.” Caste, for Guénon,is nothing more than each person’s predisposition to “the fulfilment of one oranother particular function,” as Papus believed, like a cell in the body.Opposition to this, as in Saint-Yves’s synarchic Agartha, leads to disharmony,an illness in the body politic. As far as Guénon could see, the body politic ofthe modern West was pretty ill.There was one slight chance of recovery, or at least of briefly slowing thedecay and preparing for the return of the golden age. Guénon believed that asmall, spiritual elite, recognizing the need to preserve the truths ofTradition, could take steps to do so. The “living tradition” is not palatable tothe masses, its discipline is too demanding, its requirements too severe, anindictment most of us would accept. But a small band of devotees can assimilateit and disseminate it, as it were, behind the scenes in a way in which themasses would be unaware. “The true elite,” Guénon believed, “would not have tointervene directly in these spheres”—that of politics and society. But “it woulddirect everything by an influence of which people were unaware.” “If there werea numerically small but powerfully established elite,” he argued, the masseswould “obey its suggestions without suspecting its existence, or having an ideaof its mode of action,” a situation that many, and not all of them readers ofGuénon, in fact believe exists today.47 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber322]Guénon himself believed that there were similar elites, working on the oppositeside. They were in league, he suspected, with “some directing will whose exactnature must remain rather enigmatic.”48 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber323] Onemight think this paranoid, but for Guénon, nothing else could account for thestate of things. One of his readers agreed with him completely, although hethought that action on a larger scale could be beneficial.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •BARON JULIUS EVOLA was introduced to Guénon’s work by his onetime occult mentorArturo Reghini, who edited two important Italian occult journals, Atanòr andIgnis, in the 1920s. In 1927—the same year as Guénon’s Crisis—Evola and Reghinicollaborated in what was known as the UR Group, a magical association which,like New Thought and chaos magick, saw magic as “the science of the ego.” “UR”stood for the “primordial,” the “original,” and symbolized the belief that themagical traditions they were investigating were part of an ancient science,handed down through the centuries. Evola wrote several articles for the group’sjournal—it was over control of this that he and Reghini eventually fell out—andnot a few of them concentrate on the same notion of “creating reality” that wehave looked at throughout this book. We can say that with Evola the will topower, in both a magical and a political sense, manifests in a uniquelyinstructive manner. One of his earliest books, on Tantra, is called The Yoga ofPower. He would look for this commodity in the outer world too. Where Guénon wascontent to wait for the modern world’s inevitable collapse, Evola was impatientto help bring it down. To do this, he would break bread with some questionablepotential allies.Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola was born in 1898 to a noble Sicilian family. Thisnobility featured largely in Evola’s life. As mentioned, he distanced himselfearly on from the others around him. He would later write, “I have long feltrather detached from what is merely human.”49 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber324]One form this detachment took was a dismissal of Christianity, which for him, asfor many others, was a religion of the weak and ignorant masses.Like Guénon, Evola leaned toward the precise, an exactitude that aided hisstudies in industrial engineering. Scholarly inclined, Evola would, like Guénon,distance himself from academia. Also like Guénon, Evola came to what he calledhis “personal equation” early on. This blended an impulse toward the“transcendent”—which he admits led to a “certain insensitivity andcold-heartedness”—with a preference for the “warrior” over the “priest,” or, interms of the Hindu caste system, the kshatriya over the brahmin, a predilectionhe speculates he may have inherited from a past life.50[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber325]This would ultimately distinguish Evola from Guénon. Where Guénon the sagefavored detached contemplation, Evola the warrior wanted action. This expresseditself early on as his “tendency to take a clear-cut, uncompromising stand: akind of intellectual intrepidity” about some issue, which he defended with apowerful “logical rigor,” much like Guénon. And like Guénon, Evola showed signsof “rightness,” and the intellectual and personal rigidity characteristic of it.As the scholar Joscelyn Godwin, who has done much to bring Evola’s work into thefold of “acceptable” esoteric thought, remarked, Evola’s “character and idealswere fully formed before he was out of his twenties, and he remained true tothem for the rest of his life.”51 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber326] This wasrecognized by others. A. James Gregor, a political analyst with no interest inthe esoteric, said that “what is evident in almost everything that Evola wrotewas that his ideas had been fixed in his early manhood and never substantiallychanged over the next half-century.”52 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber327]Depending on your point of view, such steadfastness can be seen as evidence ofremarkable integrity or arrested development.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •EVOLA’S WAY TO the UR Group led through routes that seem curious for aTraditionalist who saw value only in the primordial past. In fact, they ledthrough swaths of modern art. Ironically, Evola started out as a Futurist, oneof F. T. Marinetti’s artistic pranksters who blended a love of speed, machines,and war into a new modernist aesthetic. Futurism’s celebration of cold, ruthlessefficiency, technology, and martial virtues at first appealed to Evola, as itdid to Mussolini. But Marinetti’s brash championing of the modern world soontired Evola, as it did many others, and a brief stint in the army in the lastdays of World War I, in which he saw no action, gave him an idea of war’sreality. Like another literary man of the right, the Japanese novelist YukioMishima, Evola’s warrior ethos had more to do with fantasy than with fact.53[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber328]Evola enjoyed military discipline and missed it when back in civilian life. Thisdisorientation led to an existential crisis, a continuation of a series of“experiences” Evola had while stationed in the mountains and in which hediscovered that “thunder, thunderbolts, and storms are not limited to thephysical world.”54 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber329] He found “normal” life“insufferable,” and saw the “flimsiness and vainness of ordinary human aims.”55[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber330] He was hungry for “intensity and absolutevalues,” and sought these in experiments with drugs, but what came of these werethoughts of suicide. This despair was dispelled by a Buddhist text that Evolacame upon which granted him even more detachment than he already had. Through ithe said he “acquired a steadfastness capable of overcoming all crises.”56[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber331] He would later write about this development inThe Doctrine of Awakening, his work on Buddhist “self-mastery.”From Buddha Evola next went to Dada, the anti-art movement that influences chaosmagick. Where Futurism, for all its noise, had by definition a positive outlook,Dada spoke to Evola’s aristocratic pessimism. Its sophisticated absurd disdainfor everything, for meaning itself—an attitude it shares withpostmodernism—appealed to his sense of spiritual decline, common at the time.Dada offered a “harsh necessity free from all discipline or morals.”57[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber332] Evola performed Dada poetry and painted Dadacanvases; one of his works hangs in a museum in Rome today.58[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber333] He even painted his fingernails violet.59[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber334] But even Dada wasn’t enough, and after writingan important essay on abstract art Evola moved on.Evola next turned to philosophy and devoted himself to grasping what he calledthe “absolute individual,” exploring themes that connect with what we’ve lookedat in New Thought and chaos magick. From 1924 to 1927, Evola worked on TheTheory of the Absolute Individual. He couldn’t find a publisher for it, and aswith Dada and Futurism, he soon abandoned the idea of a career in philosophy.But the ideas behind his “absolute individual” informed Evola’s plunge intomagic and the occult.Precisely what Evola meant by the “absolute individual” is not clear, but we canget some idea of it from his remark that such an individual enjoys “the abilityto be unconditionally whatever he wants,” something both chaos magicians andpositive thinkers aspire to. Evola was influenced by the philosopher ArthurSchopenhauer, who in The World as Will and Representation argued that the world“I” perceives is a representation of an unconscious Will—the same Will we lookedat when discussing Neville’s ideas about manifesting reality.60[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber335] For Evola the “absolute individual” is acondition of self-awareness that perceive the identity of itself and this Will.For him, “I” am the Will become conscious.This he saw as but a short step from magic. “One could envision,” he writes,” agradual process whereby the power of an ‘I’ expands from being the power ofthought to that of magical imagination and self-persuasion: to that ofpersuading others and, ultimately, of persuading and altering reality itself.”61[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber336] The “I,” then, for Evola is as much aboutpower as it is about identity. As he wrote, his “unbalanced affirmation of the‘I’” served as a “doctrine of power and autarchy.”62[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber337] Fundamentally it was concerned with “theprospect of the individual actually shaping the world,” an idea that we knowattracts positive thinkers and chaos magicians.63[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber338]Evola’s metaphysics of the “absolute individual” are reminiscent of a oncepopular but now little-read work of German philosophy, The Ego and Its Own, byMax Stirner. Stirner was an influence on Rudolf Steiner, whose book ThePhilosophy of Freedom, like Evola’s metaphysics, is concerned with the realityof the “I” and its ultimate freedom. Stirner wants to liberate the individualfrom the constraints of family, society, the church, and other forces, a themelater shared by Ayn Rand and Aleister Crowley. Evola takes this to anontological extreme and argues that each individual is actually free to createhis own world, but is unaware of this freedom or too timid to discover it. It isnot difficult to see that Evola’s “absolute individual” and Neville’s “I am” arepractically identical.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •EVOLA’S RUMINATIONS ON the “absolute individual” served him well as a member ofthe UR Group. Several members contributed to the journal UR on a variety ofoccult topics. Contributors used magical pseudonyms and Evola wrote under anumber of these. Although the subjects might vary, from alchemy to astrology,the central concern of the group in general and Evola in particular was to raisethe individual’s consciousness to such an intensity that it would be able to act“magically” on the world, a goal shared by positive thinkers and chaosmagicians.It was clear to Evola that what was at stake was power, the capacity to “makethings happen.” Writing as “Arvo” in “Conscious Thought-Relaxation-Silence,”Evola says, “To know very well what one wants, to fix and will its plastic imagewithout interruption . . . is to gather a system of occult forces into a powerof realization.”64 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber339] This would not be out ofplace in one of Neville’s books and is not far removed from Norman VincentPeale’s “prayer power.” The aim of Arvo’s article is to stimulate “thought thatis power”; again it could be Neville or any number of New Thought authorsspeaking to us. “By thinking you are,” a realization arrived at through themantra “I THINK! I AM!” “In me there is a force that is power and command. . . .Here lies the principle of magical force, rather than in ordinary ‘will.’” Evolaseems to have anticipated Trump’s “controlled neurosis”: “Thinking is realizedas power when only one thought dominates the mind and directs itunfailingly . . . toward only one purpose.”65 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber340]Other articles echo similar variations on the central theme of affecting or evencreating reality. “What is phenomenal,” Evola, writing as Ea in “The Nature ofInitiatic Knowledge,” tells us, is “merely that which characterizes a certaindegree of experience and a certain state of the self, while what is ‘absolute’is that which is correlative to another degree of experience and to anotherstate of the self. . . .”66 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber341] This means thatour experience of reality is determined by our inner state. If we change ourstate, reality too will change, something that chaos magick and positivethinking agree upon. Gaining “initiatic knowledge”—knowledge, that is, of occultpowers and realities—is a means of accomplishing this. On the “initiatic paththe acquisition of knowledge parallels the acquisition of power.”67[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber342]This power can be put to many uses. “Active identification with a cause,” Evolaargues, “virtually confers a power over that same cause,” a dictum that thedevotees of Pepe the Frog might consider. But the central focus is on the senseof power and will in oneself. In “On the Magical View of Life,” again by Ea,this results in a “renewed, heroicized perception of the world . . . thesensation of the world as power” and a vision of the world which perceives“everywhere beings made of strength.” “You must perceive yourself as a center ofstrength” and when you do a “superior calm will ensue” which will give rise to“pure and purifying action.”68 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber343]Evola did not like to relinquish control, a personality trait he shares withTrump and other gurus and demagogues. He was always in the driver’s seat. Thismeant a kind of self-obsession. “The only possible dichotomy,” he wrote, is“between self-centeredness . . . which on an objective level becomes power; andnon-self-centeredness, which is to say: leaving one’s internal throne empty oroccupied by ghosts.”69 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber344] For him the absoluteindividual embodies “the supremacy of will over spontaneity,” something hesought to achieve in his magical practice.70 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber345]Everything, all goals, came only from his own self-will. “These truths mustpenetrate the soul,” he writes. “There is no place to go, nothing to ask for,nothing to fear. The world is free: goals and reasons, ‘evolution,’ fate orprovidence—all that is fog, an invention by beings who did not yet know how towalk on their own and needed crutches and supports.”71[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber346] In other words, just do it. Evola’s depictionof the “magical view of life” is curiously reminiscent of postmodernism’srelativity of values and chaos magick’s flexible beliefs. But it is under suchconditions that Evola believed one can perform a “true act, namely an actionthat begins directly from the Self.”72 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber347]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE ACTION EVOLA most had in mind was to influence the turn of events in Italy,much as the meme magicians of the alt-right wanted to influence Trump’selection. Mussolini’s “march on Rome” put him and his Fascist Party in power in1922. Evola had his reservations—for one thing he was not a nationalist likeMarinetti—but he sympathized with Mussolini, as he would have with any enemy ofdemocracy or left-wing politics. He agreed with Mussolini’s ideal of a “RomanState and Imperium,” which he hoped would give birth to a “new type of Italian,disciplined, virile, and combative.”Ethiopia would soon encounter Mussolini’s combative Italians, but therenaissance of the other Roman virtues was slow in coming. Evola and otherimpatient UR members hoped to speed things up with rituals designed to instillthese in Mussolini’s followers. Like a good chaos magician, Evola wanted to work“behind the scenes in order to ultimately exert an effect on the prevailingforces in the general environment.”73 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber348] Inchaote-speak, he wanted to give things a nudge.That Evola took to more overt attempts to influence Mussolini suggests that theUR magic didn’t work, something the history of Italian fascism confirms. Afterhis contretemps with Reghini, Evola started his own journal, La Torre, “TheTower.” This would serve as an organ for what Evola called “various expressionsof the One Tradition.” La Torre took to pointing out that while Mussolini hadthe right idea, his fascism was not quite Fascist enough. What was needed was a“more radical, more intrepid Fascism, a really absolute Fascism, made of pureform, inaccessible to compromise,” a point Evola made in his article “Fascism IsNot Enough.”74 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber349]We can get an idea of what Evola had in mind from a remark he made late in life.In an interview in 1964 for Ordine Nuovo (New Order), the journal for afar-right group of the same name, Evola envisioned what his ideal state would belike. He advocated an “organic and hierarchical civilization in which all humanactivities are both ordained from above and directed toward it and defined bymore than merely human values.”75 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber350] Thesynarchic note here is difficult to miss. Evola did not reject fascism for theusual reasons most people would, as they would other forms of totalitariangovernment. Evola thought he could do it better. Mussolini didn’t, and afterEvola wrote critically of his relations with the Vatican, Il Duce sent him awarning. Evola stood fast, but after only ten issues La Torre was forced to stoppublishing.Evola’s magical politics saw print in his book Pagan Imperialism, which arguedthat a kind of Roman paganism, rather than Catholicism, should be the spiritualheart of fascism. The book aimed to give fascism a “soul.” Evola was critical ofMussolini’s regime, but he also attempted several times to find a place withinit and on some occasions did. He wrote on “problems of the spirit” for Fascistnewspapers and had contact with Mussolini more than once.76[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber351] Evola said that he never joined a politicalparty or voted in an election.77 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber352] Yet accordingto one Evola scholar, he did try to join the Fascist Party but was rejected.78[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber353]Evola’s relations with the Italian Fascists were never as cozy as some writershave suggested, but he most likely would not have minded if they had been. It istrue that, as A. James Gregor remarks, “Evola’s relationship to Fascism . . .was always, and throughout, highly problematic.” But to say that “it isdifficult to see Julius Evola as any kind of fascist at all” suggests the kindof hair-splitting favored by academics.79 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber354]Technically Evola may not have been a Fascist, as he was not a party member, apoint that served him well in 1951, when he faced charges of inspiringneofascism. But he didn’t exactly run away from fascism either.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •EVOLA’S CALL FOR fascism to embrace paganism and install a caste system, so thatit could be directed from “above” and not “below,” did not sit well with moremundane Fascists who wanted power pure and simple. Evola recognized that “Italyseems to have been incapable of providing adequate and suitable human materialfor the superior possibilities of Fascism,” and acted accordingly.80[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber355] He turned his attention to Germany. A Germanedition of Pagan Imperialism, augmented to suit Aryan readers, proved a success,and he was invited to lecture in the Fatherland. Two books on race Evola hadwritten, Aspects of the Jewish Problem and Outline of a Racist Education, alsoaligned him with sensibilities prominent in National Socialism.Ironically, Evola’s ideas about race were influenced by the Jewish philosopherOtto Weininger, who, as mentioned, had a fan in Hitler. In Sex and Character,Weininger argued that Jews embraced a hatred of things of a “higher”character—hence Marx’s “religion is the opium of the people”—something theyshared with women; in The Metaphysics of Sex, Evola would draw on Weininger’sviews again. But while noble Aryans might agree with this, Evola’s racialthought was more subtle than theirs. “Race” for him was more spiritual thanbiological. This meant that while one might be biologically Jewish, one couldnevertheless be “spiritually” Aryan. While this mitigates somewhat accusationsof anti-Semitism against Evola— his championing of The Protocols of the Eldersof Zion and other efforts, however, seem to make up for it—it did not sit wellwith Nazis, who had trouble accepting that while one had pure Nordic blood, onemight still have a Semitic soul.81 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber356]Ultimately the Nazis rejected Evola’s ideas, finding them too impractical. Theofficial view of him was unfavorable.82 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber357] To hiscredit, Evola was not a thug like the Nazis, but he nonetheless blackened hishands in his dealings with them. Some of this can be chalked up to a kind ofidealism. Naïvely Evola believed that he could “improve” Nazism by adding apinch of Traditionalism to it, or that he could use it to establish asynarchy-like organic state. At some point he must have known with whom he wassupping, although in his autobiography, he claims ignorance about the Nazis’worst deeds.83 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber358]Some Nazis no doubt enjoyed his company. He met SS Führer Heinrich Himmler, whotreated him to a tour of Wewelsburg, the castle and ceremonial headquarters ofthe SS Ordensburg, Himmler’s secret “knightly” order, to whom Evola lectured.The SS uniform and death’s head insignia—possibly inspired by Schwaller deLubicz— appealed to Evola’s severe aesthetic and chivalric romanticism, butafter an investigation into his ideas ordered by Himmler and carried out by theoccultist Nazi Karl Maria Wiligut, he was deemed undesirable.84[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber359]Evola had more success with talks he gave to Berlin’s prestigious Herrenklub,whose members were part of what was known as the Conservative Revolution. Thesewere right-wing politicians, intellectuals, and industrialists who rejectedWeimar democracy but found Hitler too crude. The writer and war hero ErnstJünger and the jurist Carl Schmitt belonged to this group, and with thehistorian Oswald Spengler they are finding new readers among the alt-right andothers today.85 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber360] Some of them too foundthemselves out of favor with the Nazis, but compared with their fate, Evola gotoff easy. Some were eliminated, along with the SA, in July 1934 during the Nightof the Long Knives. Others were hanged as accomplices in the failedassassination attempt on Hitler on July 20, 1944. Evola also had successaddressing Vienna’s influential Kulturbund, an Austrian version of theHerrenklub. But following the Anschluss of 1938, uniting Austria with Germany,these conservative gentlemen too fell from favor. One, Walter Heinrich, aTraditionalist himself, was immediately arrested.86[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber361]It may have been Evola’s success in Germany that led to a brief victory for himin Italy. When Mussolini, wanting to appear more than Hitler’s puppet, enactedhis own racial laws, he looked to Evola as a guide. Evola had already writtenquite a bit about race.87 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber362] In The Myth of Bloodhe produced a kind of encyclopedia of racist thought, emphasizing Nordicsuperiority, and in The Defense of Race he developed a racial theory based onTradition. In The Synthesis of Racial Doctrine he produced a work that, inMussolini’s words, was “just what he needed.” With it he could “conform” toHitler’s ideas, but also add his own twist, as a token of independence.88[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber363]Evola believed his synthesis had “engaged with the issue of race from asuperior, spiritual perspective.” He did his best to avoid “vulgaranti-Semitism,” but his assessment of the Jewish influence on modern culture as“corrosive”—a Nazi buzzword—met with the expected approval.89[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber364] Mussolini ordered newspapers to review thebook favorably and approved of Evola’s idea for an Italian-German journal calledBlood and Spirit. Less Traditional advisers in Il Duce’s cabinet were not sokeen and talked Mussolini out of it. The project was abandoned.Mussolini in any case would soon be out of a job. In the summer of 1943,following major victories by the Allies, the Grand Council of Fascism removedMussolini from office and had him arrested. He was rescued a few weeks later bySS Captain Otto Skorzeny in a daring operation, and Evola was among thosegreeting a liberated Il Duce at Hitler’s Rastenburg headquarters. For a timeEvola found a place in Mussolini’s short-lived Fascist Salò republic, but by May1945 both Mussolini and Hitler were dead. Evola spent the last days of the warrecruiting volunteers for an “international SS brigade” that would fight on tothe end. He himself suffered severe injuries during the Soviet shelling ofVienna. As he walked the blasted streets, “calmly questioning” his fate, aRussian shell shattered his spine and left him paralyzed below the waist. Forthe remainder of his life, Evola was confined to a wheelchair. For a mountaineerready to scale physical and spiritual heights, this must have been a bitterfate.90 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber365]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE COLLAPSE OF the thousand-year Reich convinced Evola that “really absoluteFascism” would have to be realized in another way. Like Guénon he nowconcentrated on standing aside from the despised modern world and observing itsdemise, rather than trying to establish a Traditional authoritarian state. Butthe kshatriya in him still wanted action, and in the postwar years he engaged ina kind of esoteric guerrilla war against modernity. Books like Men Among theRuins appealed to l’uomo differenziato, “those who were different,” who rejectedboth “Coca-Cola and Marx,” American capitalism and Soviet communism. He calledon them to embody individually what he called the “legionary spirit” and the“warrior ethic,” and to drag their feet against the modern tide. One influential“closet Traditionalist” who embraced the legionary spirit was the historian ofreligion Mircea Eliade, who was greatly influenced by Evola and shared with himan appreciation of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, leader of the Romanian far-right“chivalrous” Legion of the Archangel Michael, later known as the Iron Guard.91[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber366] It was around this time that Evola facedcharges of attempting to revive fascism. His eloquent defense and the fact thathe hadn’t joined the party cleared him of these, but he was considered adangerous influence from then on.Evola’s guerrilla war took the form of what he called apoliteia, a kind ofactive nihilism or philosophical terrorism that regarded every aspect of themodern world as a legitimate target for its scorn. In Ride the Tiger, one of hislast and most engaging books, Evola cast the withering gaze of apoliteia onmodernity’s latest developments—existentialism, the Beat Generation, drugs—invery readable and incisive prose, designed to provide “those who are different”with a kind of Rough Guide to the last days of the Kali Yuga.By this time Evola had gathered a group of followers, out of sympathy withpostwar democracy and contemptuous of the rising “Americanization” of Europe.Suddenly his books were selling to a new young radical right that the rise ofthe New Left had prompted. He was christened “our Marcuse” by the Italianfar-right leader Giorgio Almirante, a nod to Herbert Marcuse, the far-leftFrankfurt School philosopher taken up by the 1960s counterculture.In his small apartment in Rome, Evola spoke to a new generation of “spiritualaristocrats,” eager to hear his memories of Mussolini, Hitler, and Himmler. Hiswords reached some ardent ears. When he said “Nothing in this system deserves tobe saved” or “It is not a question of contesting and polemicizing, but ofblowing up everything,” some took this very seriously.92[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber367] By the 1970s neo-Fascist groups like the NewOrder, the National Vanguard, the National Front, and others tried, in differentways, to put Evola’s apoliteia into action, with an “armed spontaneity” aimed at“corrupt and bourgeois” democracy that was strangely reminiscent of the anticsof Evola’s old alumni, the Futurists.93 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber368] Withthe Kali Yuga coming to a close, this form of licensed mayhem seemed made toorder."},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]CHAPTER SIXA WAR OF ALL AGAINST ALLEVOLA’S MOST INFLUENTIAL and controversial work, Revolt Against the ModernWorld—which I’ve so far omitted mentioning—has to be one of the most unremittingattacks on Western modernity ever written, an assault even more blistering thanGuénon’s Crisis of the Modern World. It serves as a kind of blueprint foreverything the alt-right and their Traditionalist fellow travelers find wrongwith the modern West. As such, it deserves some attention.Revolt Against the Modern World is “a study in the morphology of civilizationand history,” an account of the West which depicts the modern era as “the finalphase in a vast process of general devolution.”1[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber369] The notion of a “morphology” of civilization—astudy of its forms—came to Evola from Oswald Spengler, whose Decline of the Westhe translated into Italian. Spengler believed in a kind of “organic” view ofhistory, which sees civilizations as living organisms that are born, mature, anddie. There is not one common linear history, of which all the variouscivilizations—Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek, and so on—are episodes, the standard,modern view since the Enlightenment. Instead, for Spengler, civilizations areself-enclosed totalities, with irreducible characters that set them apart fromone another, an idea that sits well with much of postmodernism’s relativity ofvalues and rejection of “grand narratives.”It is also an idea that appeals to various critics of Western “hegemony,”because it liberates them from Eurocentrism. There is not, say, one “history ofart,” which reaches from the earliest cave paintings to the latestaudience-friendly museum installation, but the different “art” of each differentcivilization, unique and incommensurable with others. And the same is true foreach civilization’s science, philosophy, politics, religion, and social norms.Spengler is the grandfather of today’s “cultural relativism.” Our modernversions of these things, according to him, are not “better” or more “advanced”than earlier models, as we naïvely believe, only different. Each civilization islike a flower in a garden; each has its own petals and fragrance and there is noideal outside itself at which it is aiming. Flowers do not “progress.” ForSpengler, neither does history.This pluralistic view will turn up later, as an alternative to what manyanti-Western thinkers see as the totalitarian character of modern liberal“globalization.” For Spengler the “Faustian” civilization of the modern West,which begins with the Renaissance and humanism, was on its way out, and aharder, more ruthless society was approaching.2[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber370] A look at today’s world might suggest thatSpengler was right. Evola certainly thought so, although the reasons he givesfor the decline of the West have less to do with biological metaphors than withmetaphysical intuitions. Where Spengler saw each civilization as a world untoitself, with its “decline” part of its natural life cycle, Evola posited a“primordial” beginning from which all subsequent history has gradually driftedaway, until it has reached the confusion and corruption that he saw rampanttoday.Revolt’s two parts are divided into an account of how Evola envisioned theTraditional world of the past and a depiction of the evils of the modern, fallenworld. It was published in 1934 and was written during Hitler’s rise to powerand with an Aryan readership in mind; it was in fact the German edition ofRevolt that prompted Hermann Hesse to call Evola “dangerous.” Nothing in Westernsecular society is spared Evola’s withering analysis. Many who find fault withthe modern world appreciate Evola’s views. But having Evola in your antimodernarsenal comes at a price. It requires adopting a perspective that is in manyways based on amplifying Evola’s “personal equation” until it becomes thearbiter of reality.The central theme of Revolt, and of the rest of Evola’s work, is what he calls“the doctrine of the two natures.” These are “being” and “becoming.” Being isthe world of the eternal, the immutable and unchanging, the fixed point ofperfection and power beyond space and time. In a word, the “transcendent.”Becoming is the ever-flowing flux of phenomena, the fluid, shifting world ofsensory reality and human history. Nietzsche contrasted these in The Birth ofTragedy in the Greek gods Apollo and Dionysus, beauty and intoxication. They arein fact at the root of the Western philosophical tradition, with thepre-Socratic philosophers Parmenides and Heraclitus saying that all is one andimmutable and all is change and transitory, respectively. In The Yoga of PowerEvola writes of them as Shiva, “the static, luminous, and masculine form of thedivine,” and Shakti, the “feminine, dynamic, and life-giving form,” or aspurusha, the “purely spiritual principle,” and prakriti, “nature.”3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber371] A similar polarity can be found in differentforms in practically all religions, the Taoist notion of yin and yang being themost well known.4 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber372]Tradition affirms that the “higher” or “transcendent” must rule over thetransitory, that the unchanging principles of Truth must govern the inconstantflux of things, otherwise chaos will ensue. In short, the spiritual mustdominate the secular. All “organic, differentiated and hierarchicalcivilizations,” Evola writes, are informed by a “transcendent influence . . .embodied by an elite or leader possessing an authority that is unconditional,legitimate and impersonal.”5 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber373] One recalls theinfallibility that Hermann Göring ascribed to Hitler or that members of theCollective did to Ayn Rand.This “transcendent influence” was the meaning of the Great Chain of Being, theladder of reality reaching from the Absolute to the sublunar world thatdominated cosmological thought until the modern period.6[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber374] According to Evola, a parallel arrangement wasin place in the social ordering of the past, at the time of the primordialrevelation. But since then the forces of “becoming” have gradually taken over,until we have arrived at the rapidly changing flux of contemporary post-truthlife that chaos magicians and postmodernists celebrate.Evola accounts for this predicament with his own version of the myth of theFall. In ages past, a noble Nordic-Aryan people lived in a strange land near theNorth Pole called Hyperborea, which means “beyond the north wind.” The “Thule”of Rudolf Sebottendorf’s Thule Society refers to a similar polar land, and Evolagot the idea of an Arctic origin of the Aryan race from a book by the Hindumilitant nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, The Arctic Home in the Vedas. This“lost continent of the European imagination,” as the anthropologist RichardRudgley calls Hyperborea, was a land of temperate climate, a perpetual summer,and in Greek mythology it was the home of the sun god Apollo.7[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber375] For Evola it was also the home of the“primordial revelation.”The Hyperboreans worshiped a patriarchal solar deity and embraced a “virilespirituality,” the kind of warrior ethos embodied in the kshatriya. They weredevotees of the way of being, valuing a transcendent immutable reality beyondthe senses. They lived in a stable, castelike hierarchical social order, led bya supreme leader, rather like the synarchy of Saint-Yves’s Agartha. In thisorganic society, everyone knew his place. It was the kind of society that Evolawanted to create with his “absolute fascism.” But a sudden catastrophe changedeverything. A shift in the earth’s axis, which gave it its tilt and started ourfour seasons, forced the Hyperboreans to leave their polar home and head south,rather as the Brahmatma’s descent into Agartha began following a similardisaster.8 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber376]This is when the trouble started. Leaving their homeland, the migratingHyperboreans encountered a southern race, with values different from theirs.These southern people were nature oriented and followed the way of becoming.They worshiped a moon and earth goddess, were peaceful, lived collectively incommunes, and embraced a kind of egalitarianism. In Evola’s terms, they wereTelluric—earthly—while the Hyperboreans were Uranian—of the sky. If theHyperboreans were warriors, these southern folk sound rather like hippies or“social justice warriors.”9 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber377] Evola based muchof his account of this southern lunar race on the work of the nineteenth-centurySwiss cultural theorist Johann Jakob Bachofen, whose book Das Mutterecht (“TheMatriarchy”) argued that prehistoric civilization had been matriarchal, ratheralong the lines of how Evola saw his southerners.Gradually miscegenation took place between the northern solar types and thesouthern lunar types. Over time the “virile spirituality” of the Hyperboreanswas diluted, and the southern, feminine virtues dominated. What this amountedto, as Guénon recognized, was a gradual “inversion” of the Traditional castesystem, with the higher, transcendent, nonhuman spiritual values that should beguiding society losing their importance while the “all-too-human” values ofmaterialism and individual “liberty,” embodied in specific races such as theJews, take pride of place.In this descent, power has moved from the priesthood to kings to thebourgeoisie, until now it resides in the mob—or, less dismissively, the“people.” This turns on its head the Traditional hierarchy of brahmin,kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra, or priest, warrior, merchant, and worker. WereEvola to include criminals and other disenfranchised members of society, whose“human rights” are often vigorously affirmed, he might have said that even theChandalas, or “untouchables,” were more important today than ever before.10[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber378]The end result of this decline is our secular world today, with the highertranscendent values ignored if not actively denied and the lower valuesdominating. Atheism, materialism, consumerism, individual “rights” and“liberties,” mob rule (democracy), hedonism, mass education, perpetualentertainment, eroticism, “scientism,” interracial marriages, gender swapping,and a variety of other distractions take the place of the spiritual realitiesthat according to Evola, Guénon, and other Traditionalists should be at theheart of civilization. As Guénon said, today we live under the “reign ofquantity,” and the immediate prospects of this changing anytime soon seem ratherslim. We have reached what the Greek poet Hesiod called the “Iron Age,” a timeof confusion and fear when “the center cannot hold” and “every man is forhimself.” It is a time of a “war of all against all.”One reader of Evola took this idea of a “war of all against all” very seriously.In the Russia Alexander Dugin emerged from, it was almost the order of the day.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •DONALD TRUMP MAY be the first postmodern U.S. president, but his counterpart inRussia, Vladimir Putin, has been involved with post-truth and alternative factsfor some time now. Trump seems in many ways to be modeling his administration onthe kind of system Putin has had in place for years, in which the business ofpolitics entails not only the practical concerns of running a government, butthe wider, more inclusive activity of creating reality. If Trump’s personalstyle and modus operandi suggest similarities with chaos magick, the kind ofreality Putin and his “political technologists” have been busy manufacturingseems in many ways very much like the kind of shifting, transitory world thatchaos magicians find appealing. It is a world in which one can be “lewd andrefined, cunning and naïve,” without breaking step, and in which the aim to “tryon every persona the world has ever known” seems a matter of course.11[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber379] It is a world in which, according to onewitness, “nothing is true and everything is possible,” and “life is oneglittering masquerade, where every role and any position or belief ismutable.”12 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber380]This state of affairs has its roots in the collapse of the Soviet Union in theearly 1990s. When perestroika and glasnost helped to bring down the Berlin Walland end the Cold War, hopes were high for a liberated Russia enjoying thepolitical freedoms and economic opportunities known to western Europe. But theidealism and optimism of the first few post-Soviet years turned todisappointment and disillusionment when Western notions of democracy and liberalcapitalism did not take hold. There were already tensions between Russians drawnto Europe and those who rejected the West, a split that had run through theRussian soul for centuries and which is still in place today. Many embraced thenew freedoms. Others found themselves adrift in a strange, bewildering, andinsecure world, and nostalgia for the old Communist regime quickly set in.The collapsing Soviet structures could not contain the new developments, andsoon the vacuum created by the end of communism led to a kind of anarchy. TheWest it began to resemble was more like the American Wild West than anythingelse. Police authority was replaced by private security firms. Governmentservices collapsed, gutted by political corruption. Political gangsterism becamethe norm, with powerful, wealthy, ruthless bosses cutting out fiefdoms from thecarcass of the USSR, with the Kremlin just one more gang among the rest.Organized crime thrived. It was the time of the rise of the oligarchs, withexecutive and economic power falling into the same very corruptible hands.When the ruble collapsed in 1998, the Russian economy went into free fall,taking everything else with it, destroying “all faith in the liberal marketmodel of society.”13 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber381] The chaos that followedwas the perfect environment for a strongman to emerge. He would take charge ofthe situation, stop the rot, bring stability to a confused, directionlesspeople, and make them great again. Enter ex–KGB operative Vladimir Putin.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •PUTIN’S ROAD TO becoming de facto tsar of twenty-first-century Russia was madeclear through the work of his postmodern spin doctor and PR man, VladislavSurkov, who served as Putin’s deputy chief of staff and deputy prime ministerfrom 1999 to 2013. Described as a “cynic in velvet,” Surkov combined hispolitical technology with a love of gangsta rap, Beat poetry, and writingpostmodern fiction. Almost Zero, a 2009 bestselling satiric novel abouttwenty-first-century Russian life, was published under a pseudonym but wasalmost certainly written by Surkov, although in the preface he does put his nameto, he denies being its author. The odd thing is that the milieu of cynicism andself-promotion that the book satirizes, in which “everything is PR,” is one thatSurkov himself created. Such ambivalence epitomizes Surkov’s character. He is areal twenty-first-century hipster, with posters of Che Guevara and John Lennonon his walls and a photo of Tupac Shakur topping his desk, next to one of Putin.He writes essays on modern art and the occasional rock lyric and can be seen atthe best galleries in town wearing a leather jacket and white shirt that is“part Joy Division and part 1930s commissar.”14[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber382]Known as Putin’s “gray cardinal,” Surkov was considered a “natural at PR becausehe was used to half-truths.”15 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber383] His media savvyand talent for prevarication were put to good use in his project of makingcynicism the main business not only of Russian politics, but of Russian lifeitself. While politicians have always had a penchant for double-talk, Surkovrefined the policy of eloquently saying nothing into a kind of conceptual artthat satisfied political expediency while providing first-class entertainment.In Surkov’s Russia, “to believe in something and stand by it . . . is derided,”while “the ability to be a shape-shifter [is] celebrated.”16[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber384] Post-truths, alternative facts, andmanufactured reality were Surkov’s stock in trade, and with him at the politicaldashboard, a whole host of personae, “mutable beliefs,” and ideologicalchameleons took center stage. Trump may be America’s first reality-TV president,a telly-tulpa, as it were. But Russia à la Surkov was one long season of BigBrother.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •BORN ASLAMBEK DUDAYEV in a Chechen village in 1964, Vladislav Surkov had aRussian mother and Chechen father. His mother was a schoolteacher and hisfather, who soon abandoned the family, was one too. A brilliant student and acharmer with girls, Surkov later moved to Moscow, where he tried out variouspursuits, including metallurgy and drama, before spending a few years inmilitary intelligence. (Once again a military background.) Like others we’veseen, Surkov had a tendency toward “rightness” and violence; he was given tophysical altercations and was expelled from drama school for fighting. As Surkovwent through changes, so did Russia, from post-Communist elation and economiccollapse to the rise of the oligarchy and the “mafia state.” In such a shifting,uncertain environment, to stick to any stable belief was a liability, and atalent for adopting and abandoning ideologies—cherished by chaoticians—an asset.Surkov was drawn to Moscow’s arty set, and the “performance art” popular thenwas a good warm-up for his real forte, public relations. He started his careerat twenty-three, when he became the bodyguard of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, one ofthe original Russian oligarchs. They met at a martial arts class. Years laterPutin as president had Khodorkovsky arrested on charges of fraud, which manysuspect were trumped up; he was eventually released in 2013. Khodorkovsky is oneof many who discovered that money was little protection if you got in the way ofTsar Vladimir’s plans.Khodorkovsky recognized Surkov’s intelligence—something he prided himself on—anddecided to make use of his brains rather than his brawn. In 1992 Surkov launchedthe first advertisement on Russian television, a commercial for Khodorkovsky’sBank Menatep. Khodorkovsky, soon to become Russia’s richest man, was shown withfistfuls of cash, assuring people that they too could become rich, rather like aRussian Trump. For a people brought up to believe capitalism was evil, to havewads of rubles thrust in their faces must have been something of a shock.Surkov soon fell out with Khodorkovsky and went to work for a rival bank. WhenKhodorkovsky was later arrested, Surkov was typically cynical about it. He wasby then in charge of the media campaign about the arrest; now instead ofpictures of the oligarch’s riches, Khodorkovsky was seen behind bars. Askedabout his treatment of his old employer, Surkov replied, “There are no limits toa man’s flexibility,” a neat gloss on “being all you can be.”17[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber385]Surkov found work as head of PR for Ostankino, the Russian television center,and it is here we can say that Putin’s Russia began. Russian media was then inthe hands of Boris Berezovsky, an engineer and mathematician who had rejectedacademia to use his talent with numbers to profit from communism’s collapse.Berezovsky had masterminded Boris Yeltsin’s reelection in 1996, through the helpof Gleb Pavlovsky, the Kremlin’s then top political technologist and spinmaster. While in the hospital Berezovsky was visited by Surkov, who had by thenfound a perch on Yeltsin’s presidential staff. Yeltsin, who was ill andalcoholic, had suffered from the Chechen war, and a successor to his office wasneeded.The successor would start as prime minister. Several people were up for theoffice, but a poll showed that the people’s choice would need to be like thehero of a World War II–era KGB television series of the 1970s, Seventeen Momentsof Spring.18 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber386] Vladimir Putin, who had enteredpolitics after the KGB closed shop, had joined Yeltsin’s staff in 1996 andseemed made for the part. He may not have been a TV star like Trump, but helooked like one.When Surkov visited Berezovsky in hospital, the oligarch told him of his ideafor a new political party, centered in the Kremlin, that would gain power andkeep it.19 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber387] This was the start of UnitedRussia, the largest and most powerful political party in Russia today. It is noexaggeration to say that United Russia occupies nearly the same political spacein twenty-first-century Russia that the Communist Party had in the Soviet past.As one political technologist remarked, “United Russia is not a party . . . it’sjust a mechanism for controlling people.”20 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber388]With Surkov in charge, that is certainly what it was.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IN 2000 A LANDSLIDE victory made Putin Russia’s second president. One of thefirst things he did in office was to seize control of the national television,press, and other media outlets. The era of post-truth and alternative factSurkov-style had begun. From then until 2013, when he retired from frontlinepolitics, Surkov the political technologist ran the country as “a wonderfulpostmodern theatre,” full of “experiments with old and new political models.”21[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber389] What Surkov mastered was the use of ademocratic and liberal vocabulary in the service of a totalitarian government.His aim was to create a “postmodern dictatorship that uses the language andinstitutions of democratic capitalism for authoritarian ends.”22[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber390] His term for this is “managed democracy,” oneof several Orwellian coinages that fuse antithetical ideas in true postmodernfashion. Others include “illiberal capitalism” and “conservative modernization.”People know it is not a true democracy, but the “stability” that Putin broughtto a collapsed society, resulting in a much higher standard of living than inthe Soviet days, compensates for the loss of freedom, and most are willing toaccept this.To some this is hypocrisy. To Surkov it’s simply being realistic. In a worldwhere everything is PR—or, as chaos magicians might say, “glamour”—notions like“truth,” “freedom,” and “reality” are negotiable and generally give way beforepragmatism. Such cognitive manipulation accounts for the cachet thatNLP—neuro-linguistic programming—and postmodern philosophy have acquired amongRussia’s power elite, each of whom wants to be the next master of reality.23[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber391] That chaos magicians also look to NLP forinspiration suggests that both camps share a common interest.24[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber392]From the beginning Surkov knew the truth of Goebbels’s dictum, that propagandamust be entertaining. The kind of “politics as entertainment” that Americans areexperiencing under Trump was the order of the day at the Kremlin, and Surkovdelivered. He was the grand vizier who, through the miracle of television andthe press, performed magic for millions of Russians, creating reality for themanew each morning. The task was to “synthesize Soviet control with Westernentertainment.”To manage democracy efficiently, the people must be kept amused, and Surkov didthis through television talk shows, news broadcasts, political announcements,all geared toward getting the message across in the most entertaining way, withan assortment of colorful speakers creating a simulacrum of real discussion andfeeding emotions of nationalism and fear. Media hysteria about fake foreign foescomplemented images of Putin as a kind of magician, transforming from machooutdoorsman and commando to postmodern tsar and global leader, star of thenation’s most popular reality-TV show. It was “factual entertainment,” a blendof “show business and propaganda, ratings and authoritarianism.”25[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber393] One reason it worked is that the media machinethat Surkov directed “always thoroughly researched the desires of theconsumer.”26 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber394] Like Trump, another televisionpresident obsessed with ratings, Surkov made sure he knew his market. Throughpolls and surveys, Surkov discovered what his audience wanted and he guaranteedthey got it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE KIND OF authoritarian state that, under the guise of a democracy, Putin waserecting dealt with opposition rather differently from its Soviet predecessor.Rather than suppress or oppress criticism, it got “inside all ideologies andmovements, exploiting and rendering them absurd.”27[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber395] By believing in nothing, Surkov could pretendto believe in everything, as chaotes do. His control of Russian media allowedhim to create fictitious opposition parties and give the appearance of freedomof speech by allowing them to “debate” issues while really being nothing morethan pawns in the reality he was creating. Any real opposition was shut out ofmainstream media, leaving only liberal journals of small circulation and onlinesites that many if not most Russians do not or cannot access as a means ofdisseminating its views.As a true postmodern politician, Surkov blatantly played both sides of thefence, funding and promoting opposing movements and allowing the clash betweenthem to produce the impression of true discussion, while, like the Wizard of Oz,manipulating everything behind the screen. He would fund human rightsorganizations and promote civic discussion about them, then support nationalistmovements that condemn human rights as Western propaganda. He would sponsoravant-garde art festivals featuring the most outrageous work, then promotereligious fundamentalists who condemned the artists as decadents.He created a Hitler Youth–style movement, Nashi (“Ours”), teenagers fed onpatriotism and nationalism who burn “subversive” books and harangue Westerndiplomats, but then he would write the kinds of novels that were going up insmoke. He would tell television heads whom they should support and whom theyshould criticize, who can be on their shows and who can’t, and what languagethey can use, often finalizing his directives with bribes. Words like“stability” and “effective” are echoed in choruses praising Putin for draggingRussia out of chaos, while vague references to “enemies” and “foreign powers”create an atmosphere of indistinct threat coming from the West, pulling thepeople together with patriotism. The main aim was to eliminate any word of“opposition” that did not emanate from the Kremlin itself.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •PERHAPS THE STRANGEST thing about Surkov’s “managed democracy” were theeccentric figures who paraded across Russian television screens. There was AntonVaino, Putin’s new chief of staff, who is thought to be the author of a strangepaper, “The Capitalization of the Future.”28 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber396]This by all accounts impenetrable work presents a new system of government,designed specifically for the postmodern age. It features a device called a“nooscope,” which is somehow able to access global consciousness—what PierreTeilhard de Chardin called the “noosphere”—and “detect and register changes inthe biosphere and in human activity.” What this amounts to is a claim to be ableto “read the mind” of the planet, something that Steve Bannon, with his links tothe data mining and analyzing firm Cambridge Analytica, knows all about.Cambridge Analytica helped Trump’s campaign as well as the Brexiters and isfunded by Robert Mercer, who also funded Breitbart News.29[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber397]The idea of the “noosphere” has been compared to Jung’s Collective Unconsciousand Theosophy’s Akashic Record, yet its more immediate model is the internet.With more and more “smart” devices feeding data into this stream, the ability tochart trends and predict and control movements in the “noosphere” will be moreand more desirable and possible. This will be important, especially as Vaino’snew model of social management resembles “some kind of all-embracing system ofgovernment that has to be enforced by top officials,” an assessment that strikesa sinister synarchic note.30 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber398]Other colorful types provided more factual entertainment. There was VyacheslavSkylarov, a homeless character in and out of mental homes who wrote aboutconspiracy theories and had visions of utopia; Anatoly Kashpirovsky, ahypnotherapist who “charged” viewers’ drinks with “healing energy” through theirtelevision screens; Grigory Grabovoy, who claimed to raise the dead; Bronnikov,who gave the blind vision through an “inner sight”; Vladimir Zhirinovsky, thenationalist demagogue who offered to impregnate lonely women and to floodGermany with nuclear waste; and Vissarion, an ex-mailman who believed he wasChrist returned. Others believed this too, and with his thousands of followersVissarion built a colony in the mountains near the Mongolian border where, likemany other Russians, they await the coming apocalypse.Boris Zolotov, an ex-Soviet physicist turned consciousness guru, spoke aboutmaterializing dreams—a good New Thought pastime—and of turning reality “intosegments you can travel through.” This was achieved through experiments withre-creating reality through language, undertaken while participating in whatwere called “sweating orgies,” designed to stimulate the new consciousness,which Zolotov believes can emerge only in Russia. The Night-Wolves, Russia’sanswer to the Hell’s Angels, are a patriotic biker gang who blend devotion toPutin with a fervent religious sentiment. Their leader, Alexey Weitz, anex-actor, trains politicians to “manipulate public consciousness” with NLP-like“verbal and non-verbal forms of influence,” and leads his followers in thepropaganda battle between Holy Russia and the Foreign Devils. Surkov fundedtheir annual bike show and rock concert, in exchange for their calls to restoreHoly Russia by taking back Ukraine.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT WAS DURING the 2014 war in Ukraine that Surkov’s mastery of reality may havereached a peak. He was brought out of semiretirement just for it. It was what hecalled the first “nonlinear war,” one in which physical confrontation is only apart, and in which opponents would change sides and form alliances in such rapidsuccession that the idea of “taking sides” would become redundant. As oneaccount suggests, the conflict may have been “a giant testing-ground for themilitary conquest of other nations’ noospheres, in a new programme ofquasi-physical propaganda wars without limit.”31[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber399]When Ukraine’s Putin-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted during thepro-EU revolution of 2014, Putin responded by annexing Crimea and beginning acovert war in Ukraine. A pro-Russia “revolt” in eastern Ukraine backed by Putinled to the declaration of two “people’s republics” in the Donbass region and acivil war that continues today. The pro-Russia Ukrainian “patriots” battlingagainst oppressive Kiev were really Russian special-forces troops, fightingincognito. Putin first denied then tacitly affirmed this, promoting the sense ofambiguity and frankly reveling in it.This was enhanced by propaganda back home. An online film showing Putin’s secretforces as “crooks and thieves” was banned because, following medical advice,media watchdogs argued that “hearing criticism of Vladimir Putin was harmful tochildren.”32 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber400] When Malaysian Airways flightMH17 was shot down in 2014 by Russian-backed eastern Ukraine “rebels,” Russiantelevision aired “leaked” images of a Ukrainian jet targeting the flight.Experts knew the images were faked, but most Russians watching the “news”weren’t experts.33 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber401] A 2014 work of “factualentertainment,” The Furies of Maidan, not far removed perhaps from one of SteveBannon’s products, broadcast on Russian television, claimed that the Ukrainianuprising was the work of Western lesbians, who had somehow channeled theirsexual frustration into promoting warfare. Scenes showed Russian women sendingdildos to appease the raving sapphists. One psychiatrist interviewed said thatwomen interested in politics were perverts, and claimed that the pro-UkrainianU.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland was also a lesbian because of her “mannish voice”and “broad shoulders.” The fear was that Ukraine would fall victim to thepro-gay EU and, like the rest of the West, turn decadent.34[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber402]Even stranger was the rash of fictional characters standing for office in localelections. At least fifteen Darth Vaders and other Star Wars figures campaignedfor votes across Ukraine; one “Emperor Dmitry Palpatine” even won a seat on theOdessa council, and a Chewbacca was arrested at a rally in the city.35[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber403] The spate of Vaders may only be the kind ofpostmodern joke that groups like Anonymous get up to, a kind of 4chan nosethumbing to the “establishment,” a half-serious “destabilizing tactic.” But asOdessa is a prime port figuring in Putin’s plans for the “Russia of tomorrow,”something more Sith-like may be in the cards.And even where real-life people were looking for votes, the elections were ajoke. In Donetsk, capital of the newly invented country Putin calledNovorossiya, or “New Russia”—although Alexander Dugin christened it first—Aleksandr Zakharchenko, an electrician turned warlord, won hands down againsthis “opponent.” This was not difficult, as his rival did not campaign and agreedwith Zakharchenko’s policies. Most appealing of these was the promise that hewould raise pensions so that the elderly of New Russia would be able to “travelto Australia at least once a year to shoot a dozen kangaroos on safari.”36[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber404] Aptly, Zakharchenko’s swearing in was held ina theater.The strange blending of fact and fiction that 4chaners saw in their“Banepostings” was also at work in Ukraine. Fyodor Berezin was for a timeDonetsk’s deputy defense minister. He is also an acclaimed science-fictionwriter whose nationalistic novels promote the fear of some imminent invasion by“Yankee devils, neo-fascists, and Euro-gays,” something along the lines of TheCamp of the Saints.37 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber405] Like Elon Musk hebelieves that reality is a simulation created by what he calls a “blackcalculator,” which can “count the entire universe,” and which is itself somehowensconced in a black hole.Prior to 2014 Berezin and his fellow anti-West writers wrote much about a comingwar between Russia and NATO, leaving Ukrainian analysts to suspect that thesefantasies of “future war” primed the public for the conflict. When fictionturned to fact, Berezin quickly took arms against the invading “gaymocracy.” Heclaimed to be protected by occult forces that made him invulnerable to theenemy’s bullets. He also believed that as the creator of imaginary worlds, hehas a special knack for profiting from the “glitches” in the “cosmic matrix”—inother words, for shifting the boundaries of acceptable reality and giving it anudge when needed.Even Putin himself is not fazed by the weirdness. On a live nationwide webcastin 2006 he was asked if he thought H. P. Lovecraft’s giant squidlike horrorCthulhu would rise from his Pacific Ocean slumber anytime soon. Putin respondedseriously; he advised to proceed with caution and suggested reading the Biblefor guidance. Viewers voted this the fourth most interesting question, followingthose about the president’s sex life.38 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber406]If Steve Bannon wanted to “weaponize” film, Surkov went one better andweaponized reality.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •BUT PERHAPS THE strangest and most disturbing figure to surface in Surkov’snonlinear Russia is someone else for whom the idea of a “war of all against all”is appealing.Alexander Dugin’s journey from teenage punk Soviet dissident to Putin’sgeopolitical adviser, via waystations as neo-Nazi and Communist reactionary,could have happened only in Russia, a place where extremes, contradictions, anddownright absurdities that would cripple anyone else find personalities wideenough to contain them. In an essay on Dostoyevsky, Hermann Hesse wrote of whathe called “Russian Man,” a strange protean personality who is not only ahysteric, drunkard, criminal, poet, or holy man, but “the simultaneouscombination of all these characteristics.” He is at once “murderer and judge,ruffian and sensitive soul,” “the complete egoist and a hero of totalself-sacrifice.” In him, Hesse says, “good and evil, outer and inner, God andSatan are cheek and jowl.”39 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber407]Alexey Weitz, leader of the Night Wolves, Vladislav Surkov’s patriotic bikergang, might have read Hesse. According to him, “We can fit everything insideus. . . . That is why we can have Stalin and God together. . . . The Russiansoul is holy. It can unite everything.”40 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber408]Uniting everything inside the Russian soul—or at least its borders—is somethingthat Alexander Dugin would very much like to do. He has called for a RussianFascist state, along synarchic lines, stretching from Vladivostok to Dublin, andfor the American “empire” to be “destroyed,” although with Trump’s victory, histone toward the United States, usually venomous, has grown less aggressive.41[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber409] Trump’s election, Dugin said, was “incrediblybeautiful—one of the best moments of my life,” a feeling, we’ve seen, thatfar-right advocates in other parts of the world also shared.42[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber410] He is now following developments in the UnitedStates “with great interest” and has asked Trump to “call me.”43[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber411] Given the trouble Trump and his team have hadwith talking to the Russians, it might be a while before Dugin hears from him.This sudden political mood swing is characteristic of Dugin, who takes Surkov’stactic of adopting contradictory political positions to new extremes, somethinghis training in chaos magick must have facilitated. His approach to politics israther like a chaotician’s to ritual: throwing disparate elements together tosee the effect, deconstructing National Socialism, picking out the good bits,and Velcroing these to Stalin-style authoritarianism to see what happens. Thisis something he pursues in his confusing and often incoherent work The FourthPolitical Theory, which cherry-picks from the authoritarian politics of theprevious century in order, with a pinch of Heidegger, to steer the postmodernworld into the postapocalyptic future. For Dugin, Trump’s ascension suggeststhat his dream of a Russian super-state, absorbing its ex-Soviet satellites andexpanding beyond them, is becoming a reality, or at least is made more“achievable.” For a political theorist savvy about hypersigils and forms of NewThought, this is a good thing. It also suggests a new meaning to the idea thatRussia was somehow behind Trump’s election.So far Dugin has had some success, much more than Evola, of whom he is a greatreader, ever had. It is no exaggeration to say that Putin’s annexing of Crimeaand incursions into Ukraine have been motivated in no small part by a strangetheory of geopolitics that Dugin promotes, and which itself is in no small wayinfluenced by the idea of a perennial war between “solar” and “lunar” types thatEvola advances in practically all his work. Geopolitics is the study of howgeography influences world politics—a discipline at which some Nazi theoristsexcelled—and Putin’s push into Ukraine and covetous glances at the Baltic statesand other neighbors are informed by Dugin’s take on this.44[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber412] Dugin’s vision of a new civilization, alongSpenglerian lines, rising up from the great “heart land” of which Holy Russia isthe center, calls for a global struggle between the maritime forces of the“lunar” Atlanticists, citizens of the “world island,” and the continental-basedforces of what he calls “solar” “Eurasia.”Readers of Orwell’s 1984 will recall the name of one of the world statesoccupied in perpetual war. Dugin’s vision of the coming end times includes thekind of nonlinear war that Surkov, a sometime ally, initiated in Ukraine, whichresulted in sanctions being imposed on both by the United States for theiractivities in the conflict. Dugin, who is looking forward to these being lifted,no doubt accepts that this is a small price to pay for helping the end of theworld along, which he sees as imminent and necessary and which will entail thekind of “war of all against all” that looms over Orwell’s novel—an example onceagain, perhaps, of fact and fiction fusing into something simultaneously moreand less than either. The end of the world will not happen by itself, he tellsus. We must give it a push or, as chaos magicians would say, a nudge. This isour “task,” our “practice,” what he calls “active metaphysics,” something thatin various forms we have been occupied with throughout this book.45[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber413]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •ALEXANDER DUGIN WAS born in Moscow in 1962 to an upper-middle-class family. Hisfather was an officer in Soviet military intelligence and his mother was adoctor. Dugin came to the authorities’ attention in 1983 when he was detained bythe police for singing at a party an anti-Soviet song he had written, whichcalled for the elimination of the Soviet leadership (“our revolvers will notmisfire”) and for Russian—not Soviet—soldiers to conquer the world.46[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber414] He was arrested at home and taken to theLubyanka, the notorious KGB headquarters, for questioning. Dugin’s father wasdemoted because of the incident, and Dugin himself was banned from then on fromworking at anything more than menial jobs.Early on, the military strain we have found in others appeared in Dugin, as wellas the tendency to “rightness” and violence that often accompanies it. He wasonce almost shot by an angry driver after drunkenly kicking in histaillight—Dugin was a heavy drinker—and during the occupation of Ostankino, thenational television station, by anti-Yeltsin protesters in 1993, he felt “thebreath of spirit” blowing through the chaos as troops loyal to Yeltsin retookthe building, massacring several demonstrators in the process.47[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber415] He is known to storm out of interviews if hisstatements are questioned, and has called for a new Russian political party, a“party of death, of the total vertical” that would be the equivalent ofHezbollah, the Lebanese militant Islamist group.48[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber416]Probably his most violent remarks concerned the war in Ukraine. When asked hisview on events, he said, “Kill them, kill them, kill them”—the Ukrainians, thatis. The outburst cost him his job in the Department of Sociology at Moscow StateUniversity.49 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber417] Dugin is also believed to beresponsible for the fake news story that Ukrainian soldiers “crucified” a youngboy in Slovyansk, in eastern Ukraine.50 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber418] As anexpert on “conspirology,” the study and propagation of conspiracies, Dugin nodoubt recognizes that the truth of some statement is no longer important, onlyits effectiveness, an insight he shares with Trump.By the time of his arrest Dugin had already been expelled from the MoscowAviation Institute because of his interest in various neo-Nazi ideas. Hisfascination with the Third Reich started early and was nurtured in the bohemianoccult–science fiction scene he entered in his late teens. One book popular withthis set was The Morning of the Magicians, which spoke of Hitler as “‘Guénonism’plus tanks.”51 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber419] While this is not quiteaccurate, it did set the mold for the blend of occultism and far-right radicalpolitics that attracts Evola’s readers and colored Dugin’s career.He was taken under the wing of Yevgeny Golovin, an alcoholic alchemist alsoobsessed with Hitler. Another older bohemian who guided the young Dugin wasGeydar Dzhemal, a Russian Islamist who, like Evola, promoted a kind of religiousradicalism. It was a milieu in which Satanism, séances, Ouija boards, occultism,drugs, sex, alcohol, role-playing, and fascism came together into a heady brew.Golovin was something of a Svengali, “zombifying” his followers and leading themthrough a variety of “performances,” directing them in fantasies as sailors,poets, Knights of the Round Table, and, invariably, Nazis, an early outing inthe role-playing that characterizes Dugin’s career. Dugin soon became anotherdominant figure on this scene, zombifying others himself, as gurus anddemagogues do. With his pudding-bowl haircut, hippie guitar, cavalry breeches,and aristocratic manner, he presented a striking persona, one with “a dash offascist imagery and a repertoire of occult songs.” “Dash,” however, does notquite cover Dugin’s Nazi obsession. He called himself “Hans Sievers,” after thedirector of Himmler’s Ahnenerbe, Wolfram Sievers, who researched “Aryanhistory,” and once smashed a bottle of port at a train station while shouting“Sieg Heil!” In 1947 the real Herr Sievers was hanged at Nuremberg.52[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber420]Dugin later claimed that his Hitlerism was only an expression of his anti-Sovietfeelings, a manifestation of the “transgressive” stance that included hisinterest in the dark poetry of the Comte de Lautréamont’s Songs of Maldoror,whose beautiful sadism inspired the Surrealists. He was, we might say, a kind of“Fascist dandy.” Years later, when questioned about his Nazi behavior, he wouldclaim, in standard postmodern fashion, that it was a joke, a bit of irony,implying that those who took him seriously had the problem, something thatalt-righters and 4chaners rely on today. This “plausible deniability” isdifficult to square with the neo-Nazi atmosphere in which he came of age and thepolitics he pursued.It was in this milieu that Dugin came upon Evola, whose books, oddly enough,were available off the shelf in the Lenin Library, not far from where he andGolovin’s other zombies would meet. Dugin, who taught himself French and otherlanguages, grabbed a copy of Evola’s Pagan Imperialism, the German edition, andquickly produced a samizdat edition of the work.53[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber421] This was the beginning of a career that wouldunite occultism with far-right politics in an often dizzying mix. He would laterwrite books about Evola and Guénon, linking them to the Russian Orthodox Church,in which he is a firm believer. In fact, he is an Old Believer, joining thebranch of the faith that maintains the rituals and practices prior to thereforms of the seventeenth century. As Guénon advised, he stuck close to theroots of tradition, even to wearing the beard and peasant dress associated withthe sect.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IN 1986 DUGIN joined Pamyat, an organization dedicated to restoring oldmonuments. This innocuous aim was soon overshadowed by the anti-Semitism of itsleader, Dmitry Vasilyev, a paranoid actor who believed the Jews were destroyingRussia’s patrimony and had sent Zionists to kill him.54[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber422] Pamyat attracted more hooligans,crypto-Fascists, and nationalists than art restorers, but it stirred a patrioticsense in Dugin; he began to wear a black shirt, leather belt, and shoulderstrap, the garb of the Black Hundred, a patriotic tsarist movement of the earlytwentieth century. The historian Walter Laqueur, who wrote a book about theBlack Hundred, noted Dugin’s activities as early as 1993; with Dugin, he wrote,“we move from the realm of a quasi-rational approach to the depths ofirrationality.”55 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber423] Readers of Dugin out ofsympathy with his ideas may agree.Dugin soon left Pamyat and began his ascent as a quick-change ideologue, acareerist radical looking for an “elevator to the top” and finding it infascism.56 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber424] He jumped from different politicalaffiliations and movements as easily as other twenty-somethings change theirgirlfriends or join rock bands. If in postmodern Russia being a shape-shifterwas an asset, Dugin became a kind of political chameleon. He adjusted hisbeliefs with the prevailing wind, but always kept his tack toward the desiredport, the “corridors of power” that had evaded Evola.After a fling with Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, inthe early nineties Dugin made several trips to Europe. It is unclear how heafforded these or obtained the necessary visas, given his dissident past. Duginclaimed that his books sold in enormous numbers, with print runs of 100,000copies, but this is difficult to verify. Some have suggested that Pamyat hadaffiliations with the KGB and that they somehow funded Dugin’s journeys. He metseveral figures on the European New Right, the most eloquent of whom was Alainde Benoist, but he also met with less sophisticated characters, one of whom wasClaudio Mutti, a disciple of Evola linked to Italian right-wing terror groups.Alexander Prokhanov, an ex–rocket scientist turned bohemian with links to themilitary, was introduced to Dugin and invited him to write for a newnationalist, ultraconservative newspaper he was starting, Den, “The Day.” Den’seditorial policy ran to xenophobia, anti-Semitism, Soviet nostalgia, andconspiracy theories. Prokhanov, a beatnik militarist, hired Dugin as a“professional conspiracy theorist.”Dugin took to it, churning out articles exposing the machinations of the Western“global elite” who aimed to create a “world government,” threatening Russia inthe process. Like Andrew Breitbart, Alex Jones, and Trump, Dugin served as an“aggregator” of wild fantasies, with a variety of secret agents, conspirators,and revolutionaries infiltrating one another’s organizations à la G. K.Chesterton’s The Man Who Was Thursday.Some conspiracies, however, had a basis in fact, like the failed coup of Soviethardliners against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. When opponents of Gorbachev’sreforms failed to seize power, it was the de facto end of the Soviet Union.Dugin, whose wrist was slapped by the KGB for singing an anti-Soviet song, nowexperienced a political enantiodromia—becoming one’s opposite—turning fromFascist dissident to nostalgic Communist. As the USSR became nonexistent, Duginrealized that he was a “Soviet man.”Yet the fall of communism meant more work for Dugin. With the collapse ofMarxism, an ideological vacuum opened. As Russia fell through social, political,and economic trapdoors, it also suffered an identity crisis. Without Marx, whatdid it mean to be Russian? Prokhanov introduced Dugin to members of the RussianAcademy of the General Staff, who were happy to hear his opinions on the matter;not long after, he would be lecturing to them regularly.Others, like the viewers of Red Square, a popular television talk show, wereinterested in Dugin’s opinions too; later they would also be interested to hearabout the failed coup of 1993 and the events at Ostankino. Dugin was shiftingonce again, from a “marginal intellectual” to a “respectable politicalpersonality,” whose views on current events were taken seriously.57[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber425] Through books, articles, magazines, journals,radio shows, lectures, and later websites and podcasts, a prolific Dugin quicklybecame a familiar figure on the national scene, and his opinions on matters ofstate carried weight.It may have been the seriousness of his new persona that led Dugin to form theNational Bolshevik Party in 1994 with the ex-dissident writer Eduard Limonov,whom Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn once described as an “insect who writespornography.”58 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber426] Like Dugin, Limonov hadmilitary pretentions and had taken part in the shelling of Sarajevo with BosnianSerb leader Radovan Karadžić; his punk novel, It’s Me, Eddie, was a hit with theFrench. This “red-brown” movement combined a nostalgia for Stalinist Russia withNazi chic and seemed a mash-up between Himmler’s SS and the UK’s Raving MonsterLoony Party, with some Temple of Psychic Youth thrown in.59[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber427] Dugin designed the flag: a black hammer andsickle on a white circle on a red background, reminiscent of the Nazi swastika.Like Hitler, Dugin is keen on striking symbols—or sigils—as his appropriation ofthe “Star of Chaos” shows. The NBP salute—a straight raised arm and fist—andslogan, “Da, Smert!” (“Yes, death!”), suggests that Dugin’s Nazi fascination wasstill in place.But once again it was all a joke, a kind of postmodern art project, a fauxmovement like the Anonymous Scientology protest. It was so “obviously” over thetop that if you took it seriously, you had been “punked.” As such it underminedany criticism, much as Trump’s blatant contempt for truth and facts undercutsany chance of pinning any charges of lying or dishonesty on him. This kind ofFascist Dada enables one to have it both ways: as with 4chan, you can make your“transgressive” statement, yet avoid responsibility for it.Yet “coming events cast their shadow before them,” and the kind of authoritariancounterculture that Dugin’s NBP embodied in a political pantomime seems apre-echo of the kind of far-right chic Richard Spencer and the alt-right memeabout today. The aim then was, as it is today, to open the Overton window, towiden the sphere of acceptable reality, to think the unthinkable and have othersthink it too. In a word, to become fashionable.The NBP also initiated the kind of “youth leagues” that Vladislav Surkov wouldshortly organize: neighborhood gangs, skinheads, football hooligans, punk bands,and other disaffected teenagers mobilized to control the streets, break up“unpatriotic” demonstrations, and take on whichever enemies of the state it wasmost politically profitable to harass. The NBP itself intimidated theauthorities into giving it a headquarters. It finagled an office below a policestation which one habitué described as a “boarding school for sociopathicchildren.”60 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber428]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •DUGIN’S OCCULT AND esoteric interests were not forgotten during this time. Heproduced two magazines, Elementy and Dear Angel, which helped fuse the disparateelements of his extremist palette in a weird alchemy of politics and the occult.His Arktogeia publishing house—named after the supposed Arctic home of the solarAryan race—produced his own books and others and fed a wide new audience, hungryfor anything that had until only recently been forbidden. Russians in the 1990shad an immense appetite for the esoteric, the occult, the hidden, for religion,spirituality, magic, everything that had been contraband under the gray dictatesof communism. An occult revival took place then, rather like the one the Westenjoyed in the 1960s and ’70s. Russian man—and woman—inhibited by Soviet rule,was back. The messianic streak in the Russian soul, always ready for themillennium, had returned.In “The Great War of the Continents,” written in the early nineties, Dugintalked about an idea that would occupy him for the rest of his career.61[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber429] Fundamentally it argues that with the end ofthe Cold War, the tensions between the East and the West have not ended, butmerely changed their form. What used to be the struggle between capitalism andcommunism now exists as the struggle between land-based and seafaring powers,between Russia and the West. There had always been this struggle, and during theSoviet period it had taken on the form of an ideological and economicconfrontation. But what was prior to this—primordial, we might say—was theeverlasting war between land and sea.This may sound like yet another weird idea coming out of postmodern Russia, butit originates with a British Edwardian historian, Sir Halford Mackinder. In alecture to the Royal Geographical Society in 1904, Mackinder argued that Russiawas Britain’s main strategic opponent in world politics, not Germany, as wasbelieved. This was because Mackinder believed that the whole sweep of historypivots on an eternal battle between land-based, continental powers and those ofthe sea. In “The Geographical Pivot of History,” Mackinder argued that the vastRussian heartland was locked in perpetual combat with the maritime nations ofthe “world island,” and that this unending struggle is the motor of history. Itwas a sort of global, unending war of all against all that kept the cycles ofhistory turning around.Mackinder could not have known it, but this seems rather like the eternal battlebetween Evola’s northern solar types and the southern lunar ones, or MichaelMoorcock’s never-ending war between Chaos and Order—points not lost on Dugin. Heequates the land-based peoples with Evola’s solar race and the seafarers withthe moon. Even the elemental character of the polar opposites echoes Evola, withthe land-based civilization (earth) associated with static “being” and themaritime peoples (water) citizens of fluid “becoming.”Dugin sought out other geopolitical thinkers and found confirmation of his ideasin the work of two Germans, the jurist Carl Schmitt and the geographer KarlHaushofer. Both thinkers contributed ideas that supported Hitler’s rule andjustified Nazi expansion, notions of Lebensraum (“living space”), the organicstate, autarky (self-sufficiency), and the legitimacy of the Führer.62[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber430] They too saw the struggle between land and seaas fundamental to world history and recognized the central idea of geopolitics,that a civilization’s culture and character are inextricably linked to the landin which it arises. It is, we might say, a product of that land as much as itsvegetation is. This is a rather different view from our abstract, rational ideasabout the modern state based on “mutual self-interest.” But Dugin’s mostinfluential precursor in articulating the world-historical import of the greatstruggle between the seafaring Atlanticists and the land-based Eurasians washomegrown and, like himself, a rather paradoxical “Soviet man.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE HUNGER FOR forbidden, alternative, and often downright irrational ideas thatcame with the collapse of Soviet restrictions brought to prominence the work ofan earlier Eurasianist, who had spent many years as a guest of the government insome of its worst gulags. One of the ironies in the history of Eurasia is thattwo of its most popular and prolific exponents began as Soviet dissidents andended as vociferous champions of the system they first opposed. In the case ofone of them, it was a system that had actively persecuted him. And yet one ofthe main aims of the Eurasian idea today is for Russia to regain the lands onceheld by Soviet rule and put them under its banner. In a sense we can say thatthe Eurasian idea, once suppressed under Soviet rule, has come back to absorbits oppressor.Many different ideas about language, ethnography, race, geography, ecology, andeven the cosmos find a home in the notion of Eurasia, which makes it at oncefrustratingly vague and head-achingly complex. The basic theme is that the vastRussian heartland, its enormous continental mass, is the home of a new,independent, organic civilization, rooted in beliefs, customs, and arelationship to the earth radically different from those of Europe and the West,meaning America. It sees its ancestry in the Mongol hordes of the unendingsteppes, rather than in the logic and reason of the Enlightenment. It is not adistant cousin of Europe, but a close relative of Asia. As such its peoples havean inherent preference for collectivist societies, vast families of nations heldtogether under a supreme ruler, rather than the atomistic, individualistic,“me-centered” societies of the West.We remember that Oswald Spengler believed that history was not linear andprogressive but made up of the birth, maturity, and death of different,irreducible, organic civilizations. It was not a straight line, but a series ofself-enclosed circles. Eurasianists today believe that as the West enters itssunset years, a new Eurasian civilization is rising that will embrace peoplesand nations that are in sympathy and contiguity with it and form an immensesuper-state that will take its place as a major global power.63[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber431] When Dugin envisioned a Fascist Russia, fromVladivostok to Dublin, he had this in mind. After all, Eurasia is a portmanteau,bringing Europe and Asia together.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •THE IDEA OF a “Russian Asia” has a long history. Following the defeat in theCrimean War in 1855, Prince Alexander Gorchakov advised Tsar Alexander II toforget Europe and look east as the direction in which Russia should expand. Inthe years leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution, the “White Tsar” NicholasII—who had his own Dugin in the form of Rasputin—had designs on a Russia East,and his court was open to figures like Zhamsaran Badmaieff, who practicedTibetan medicine, and Prince Esper Ukhtomsky, an Orientalist and practicingBuddhist and Theosophist. Ukhtomsky even visited the Theosophical Societyheadquarters in Adyar, India, with the young tsar-to-be, and he is sometimesidentified as the model for Gurdjieff’s Prince Lubovedsky in Meetings withRemarkable Men. Agvan Dorjieff, a Buryat Russian and tutor to the thirteenthDalai Lama, built a Buddhist temple in St. Petersburg. This was the time of the“Great Game,” the chess match between Britain and Russia over politicalinfluence in the Himalayas, part of what was known in the Russian court as“mystic imperialism.”64 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber432]In the early twentieth century, the Russian painter and mystic Nicholas Roerichtwice tried to create an independent Buddhist state in Mongolia, what he calledShambhala, drawing on the ancient Buddhist legends of a secret city—which,incidentally, is often confused with Agartha. At different times, Roerichmanaged to get both Soviet and U.S. aid for his plans—the secretary foragriculture under Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Henry Wallace, was a devotee andsupporter—but they eventually came to nothing.65[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber433]These and other ideas looked for an Asia under Russian influence. But theEurasia project is something different. It seeks a Russia under Asian influence,not in the present—as if Moscow would take directives from New Delhi—but in thepast.The idea started in the 1920s when White Russian intellectual émigrés, opposedto the Bolsheviks and stranded in Europe, began to think of new ideas abouttheir homeland that could guide it into the future once the Communist experimentcollapsed, as they were sure it would. They saw the revolution as a kind of“mystical catharsis” bringing on the “end of history.” In an atmosphere of“eschatological expectations” they wanted to have a new vision of the future tobring back to their country.66 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber434]As many Russians experienced in the 1990s, these thinkers faced a kind ofidentity crisis. They asked themselves: What sense can we give to being Russianthat won’t be Marxist or tsarist? The idea was that Russia should look to itsAsian roots for renewal, and should give up its attempts to “Westernize” itself,which began with Peter the Great in the seventeenth century. Russia was notEuropean and not suited to European values, but presented the possibility of a“Third Way,” a “median world,” a “Third Rome,” following the ancient EternalCity and Constantinople.Slavophiles, like Fyodor Dostoyevsky, were anti-Western; they rejected Peter theGreat’s ideas and envisioned a great pan-Slavic people. But Eurasianistsrejected these Slavic dreams and looked to their Turanian roots in Central Asia.Tensions between pro- and anti-Western Russians continue today, as events inUkraine make clear. The argument boils down to whether Russia should try to finda place within a European, Western vision of civilization—which so far it hasnot quite managed to do—or to celebrate and affirm its unique civilizationaldifference. Eurasianists today, among them Vladimir Putin, opt for door numbertwo.As history moved on and the Bolsheviks secured and cemented their power, theRoaring Twenties entered the Dirty Thirties, with Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin,and the dreams of the early Eurasianists faded, swallowed up by a world thatignored them. But Eurasia would rise again, this time from the most Soviet ofSoviet places, the gulag.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •LEV GUMILEV WAS born in 1912, the son of the poets Nikolai Gumilev and AnnaAkhmatova. In 1933, like Dugin he was arrested by the authorities for recitingan anti-Soviet poem, this one a criticism of Stalin by the great poet OsipMandelstam. So oppressive was Stalin’s regime that, as in Ray Bradbury’sFahrenheit 451, banned works weren’t copied and people had to memorize them.Gumilev was eventually released but soon after he was arrested again and sent toa labor camp at the White Sea–Baltic Canal; later he was sent to Norilsk, beyondthe Arctic Circle. He was released and served during World War II, but wasarrested again in 1949 and sent to labor camps in Karaganda, Kazakhstan, andOmsk, Siberia. He was finally released in 1956, during Russia’s“de-Stalinization” period. The specific charges against him varied, but the ideawas that with her son in prison, Akhmatova, a powerful and much-loved poet,would toe the party line.In the late 1980s, with glasnost and perestroika, Gumilev’s luck changed, andfor a brief time—he died in 1992—he enjoyed remarkable national celebrity andsuccess. From victim of the regime, banned from universities, denied doctorates,and openly denounced as anti-Soviet, Gumilev became a “cult figure” and hisideas were perceived as “dogmas that are above criticism.”67[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber435] His books, languishing in libraries, becamebestsellers, mandatory reading in the humanities and social sciences. Today hisvocabulary dominates history, ethnology, and related disciplines in Russia, andhis face adorns a postage stamp in Kazakhstan, where a university is named afterhim.68 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber436] As one commentator remarked, thevalidity of his ideas is rarely questioned; his cachet as a victim of the oldregime is sufficient insurance against this.69 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber437]Strangely, in the last days of the Soviet Union, Gumilev emerged as a vociferoussupporter of the regime that had oppressed him and suffered a nervous breakdownwith its collapse—evidence, perhaps, of a kind of “Stockholm syndrome,” when thecaptive identifies with his captors.70 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber438]As a boy Gumilev is said to have been given a book about the great tribes of theRussian steppes, the Mongols, the Tartars, and the Huns, as a present by hisfather. This was the start of his great love of the people of the steppes, likethe vast empire of the Golden Horde that ranged across the Russian heartland inthe Middle Ages. Because of his father—who was shot by the Cheka, the Sovietsecret police, in 1921, when Lev was nine—Gumilev was banned from university,but he read history and in the 1930s he came across the ideas of theEurasianists. But it was during his time in the gulag that his central visioncame to him.While in the camp he saw that the prisoners “naturally” formed themselves intosmall groups that ate together and became a kind of “family.” They took care ofeach other and kept each other company, and would even sacrifice necessities ifothers in the group needed them. This was not out of shared interests or a senseof friendship, or a feeling of universal brotherhood or common humanity. It was,Gumilev came to believe, an irreducible biological impulse, an unconscious,instinctual urge to distinguish one’s own group—“us”—from others—“them.” It wasas if a kind of force drew people of similar types and ancestry together, anattraction that like had for like, which set them apart from the others aroundthem.What distinguished these groups from each other, small enclaves, or, as Gumilevwould later argue, entire nations, races, or larger bodies he called “ethnoi,”was not any conscious identification, or rational idea of mutual self-interest,or religion or belief of any kind. It was the possession of a strange vitalenergy he called “passionarity.” This was a kind of life force that drovepeoples to expand, to create, to push themselves beyond their immediateneeds—with the tribes of the steppes, it is what sent them out to conquer. Itwas an irrational drive to forgo comfort and security and make enormoussacrifices for values and goals beyond reason or logic, something for which theRussian people had a great capacity and which underwrote their love of tyrantslike Ivan the Terrible. It was the sort of thing George Orwell recognized in theGerman people who voted for Hitler, who wanted “struggle and sacrifice” and notjust punctual trains. It could also account for a chela’s devotion to an abusiveguru.Different peoples had more or less passionarity, and passionarity itself wentthrough a fixed cycle, rising to its greatest strength and then declining. AsGumilev would later argue, the passionarity of the West was at a low ebb, butthat of the Russian and Arab peoples was still fresh and heading toward itspeak. Gumilev also spoke of another force, “complementarity,” which drew peoplesof different but related groups together to form what he called “super-ethnoi.”Although different, they shared enough to be considered part of the same family,just as a brother and sister are different but related.Gumilev came to believe in these “forces” as real, objective, physical facts,like electricity and magnetism. He believed he could chart the amount andcharacter of passionarity available at a given time, and quantify it in terms ofwhat he called Pik, a symbol he used on graphs, something the maverick FreudianWilhelm Reich did with a similar life energy he called “orgone,” and Mesmermight have done with “animal magnetism.” And like Reich and Mesmer, Gumilev cameto believe that the ultimate source of passionarity was outer space.Gumilev believed that ethnoi are created by sudden bursts of “bio-energy”emitted by the entire environment, unpredictable upsurges generated by the land,vegetation, animal life, the sun, and even the stars. Human groups, races, andethnoi are a kind of “crust” formed on the surface of the earth, and are as“natural” as forests or herds of antelope. We are really little more than a skinon the planet. He borrowed the idea of a “bio-energy” from Vladimir Vernadsky, ascientist who was part of the Cosmist school of pre-Bolshevik Russia. Vernadskywas interested in the interaction between humanity and the rest of thebiosphere, and he popularized the notion of the noosphere, mentioned earlier.This was the thin coating of mind that covers the surface of the globe.Vernadsky came to believe that humanity served an absolutely natural role in thecosmic economy—as much as trees and minerals do—as a receiver and transmitter of“cosmic energy,” an idea that Gurdjieff, a contemporary of Vernadsky’s, shared.For Vernadsky, “episodes of intense human activity are in some way connected tosolar and cosmic radiation.”71 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber439] Gurdjieff saysthis himself.72 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber440] Ultimately, for Vernadsky andGurdjieff, this means that what we believe are decisions arrived at through ourintelligence and free will are really the result of cosmic forces acting uponus. Humanity is pushed by the cosmos as clouds are by the wind, and itsconscious rational ego has little to say about it.Vernadsky’s ideas were central to Biosphere 2, the environment experiment thatSteve Bannon took over in 1993. The polymath John Allen, who initiated theproject in 1987, used as a guide an English translation of Vernadsky’s book LaBiosphere. This argued that the earth can be seen as composed of three“spheres”: its physical body, the “geosphere”; the life-forms on it, the“biosphere”; and the consciousness arising in humans, the “noosphere.” Vernadskyargued that just as life altered conditions on the planet, so too humanconsciousness is altering the conditions of life. The translation was taken froma manuscript in the possession of a student of Maurice Nicoll’s, himself astudent of Gurdjieff’s. Jacob Needleman, a philosopher influenced byGurdjieff—and also by Traditionalism—and the physicist David Langmuir, anotherstudent of Gurdjieff’s “work,” made the translation. Allen was influenced by theideas about the link between organic life and cosmic forces of another studentof Gurdjieff’s, J. G. Bennett, and to prepare for Biosphere 2, he studiedconditions in the Russian steppes, Gumilev’s childhood inspiration and whereGumilev did research himself.73 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber441]Gumilev brought all this together with his love of the great nomadic people,spreading out across the vast Russian spaces, and began to write about it. Hesaw himself as a scientist, grasping facts as indubitable as gravity, reached,however, through a poetic imagination inherited from his parents. Gumilev was asconvinced of the rightness of his vision as Evola or Guénon were of theirs, andhe relied on inspiration and sudden insights as they did, which he defended withan equal superiority and intransigence. His vision of a Russia rooted in theMongols, Huns, and Tartars, the great barbarian ethnoi brimming withpassionarity, sweeping across the infinite plains, required at times the kind ofcreative attitude toward facts that we have encountered throughout this book. Hewas a historian and a poet, a kind of novelist writing epic accounts of his heroRussia. “Fantasy and even direct ‘fiction’ play a paramount role in [his]work.”74 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber442] Yet often enough he was right and hisimagination enabled him to “‘guess’ secret, discreet, moments of history.”Ethnogenesis and the Biosphere of the Earth, his rejected doctoral dissertationon the rise of ethnoi, banned from publication, finally appeared in 1989 and wasa huge success. His many readers were gripped, but those, a small minority whorejected intuition and required documentation were less so.Yet at this point the requirements of academic credibility hardly seemed tomatter. A Russia looking for a new identity was less interested in documentationthan inspiration, and Gumilev’s new version of Eurasia came at the right time.It provided the ideological—if not scientific—support for the idea of Russia,not as a backward appendage to Europe, but as a new Spenglerian civilization inits own right. Russia was not lagging behind in its attempts to keep up with theWest, whose passionarity was empty. It was chock-full of the stuff and raring togo it alone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •DUGIN PUT ALL this into his geopolitical blender and in 1997 published TheFoundation of Geopolitics. It too came at the right time. Conspiracyconsciousness gripped the nation; its economy was on the brink and it had justsuffered defeat at the hands of Chechen rebels. Foreign powers were obviously atwork and it was time for Eurasia to retaliate against its Atlanticist enemies,who were plotting against it. The United States and NATO aimed to thwartRussia’s rightful rise to global power. The fractured USSR must reform as theEurasian Empire and oppose the West. The conflict now was not between capitalismand communism, but between the decadent West, eager to spread its permissiveliberal ideology through “globalization,” and a rising new Holy Russia thatstood for order and tradition and a “multipolar” world. The book sported a Starof Chaos on its cover, showed fascism and National Socialism in a favorablelight, and its six hundred–plus pages, covered in runes, graphs, maps, andreferences to obscure sources, promised to tell its readers the “truth”—hithertohidden from them—about geopolitics.It was a success, both in sales and in influence. The book got rave reviews.Copies were placed at supermarket checkouts, a strange venue for a bookdescribed as the most “curious, impressive, and terrifying” effort to emergefrom post-Soviet Russia, as well as a “primer on world domination.”75[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber443] Dugin had by this time been lecturing on hisideas to members of the Russian general staff; with the Cold War over, militarymen were happy to hear of other global tensions to keep them busy. To someextent Machiavellian motives were at work; Dugin’s acknowledgment of help fromthe top brass served to give the book some establishment ballast, and alsocurried favor with the generals. But it would not be long before Dugin underwentanother ideological metamorphosis.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •WHEN PUTIN TOOK office, Dugin went from hard-line opposition theorist to ferventsupporter of the nation’s new leader. Dugin soon pledged the kind of absolutefealty to Putin that Russians of old did to their tsars and that Hermann Göringdid to Hitler.76 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber444] They do not always see eye toeye. Differences of opinion have led Dugin to speak about a “Solar Putin” and a“Lunar Putin”—no mystery which one he prefers.77[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber445] But slowly, through the Surkov years andbeyond, Dugin’s Eurasian vision became something like national and internationalpolicy for Putin’s Russia.And Putin himself? Was he becoming more like Dugin, as Dugin believed? Was Duginzombifying the president, as his pre-Bolshevik precursor, Rasputin, was said tohave done with Tsar Nicholas II, or at least the tsarina? As the new centurybegan, the Eurasian vision grew and soon found itself a player on the worldstage, taken seriously in a way that none of Dugin’s earlier political personaehad ever been. What had started out as a “simulacrum,” it seemed, Duginreflected in an interview, was becoming “more and more real”—which is preciselythe sort of thing that practically everyone in this book is interested in.78[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber446]"},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]CHAPTER SEVENTHE POLITICS OF CHAOSTHE EURASIA MEME proved very successful. If we can grant Pepe the Frog the kindof power devotees such as Richard Spencer give him—that of making someonepresident of the United States (who, it seems, used positive thinking to helpthings along)—then I think we can say that Eurasia has surpassed even this.Granted, it has had a longer life—practically a century—and has had the time andthe attention paid to it to enable it to grow into a powerful egregore. Trumphas only just begun, and in a sense he has a harder road. Russia was already inchaos when the Eurasia meme took hold. Trump—or his tulpa—has been busy at work,creating chaos, bringing on the “old night” before the new dawn, but this maytake a while. Yet poor Pepe, having achieved his purpose, seems something of afifth wheel, rather as the United Kingdom Independence Party, having forced asuccessful referendum on Britain’s exiting the EU, more or less put itself outof business. There is not much left for these memes to do, while Eurasia,because of its success, seems to have new opportunities opening before it.Of course we can say that Eurasia resurfaced at the right time and in the rightplace, as ideas that come before their time often do, when later events createthe proper conditions for them. The early Eurasianists couldn’t compete withLenin, although they dreamed they could. Lenin quickly eliminated competitors,and there are suggestions that the first-wave Eurasianists were themselvesinfiltrated by the OGPU, the early Soviet secret state police. But for afloundering post-Soviet Russia, shorn of Marx and desperate for a newself-image, Eurasia seemed made to order. Its prophet was a martyr, a victim ofthe old evil regime, and at that time anyone with those credentials couldpractically write his own ticket. As the USSR faded, “challenging any orthodoxywas a sure route to popularity and scholarly fame,” and “ideas that no one tookseriously a decade ago” were “suddenly being enunciated from the tribune ofKremlin power.”1 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber447]Dugin, the professional conspiracy theorist, took advantage of the situation. Hebrought all of his fascinations together into an impressive if obscure and oftenconfusing mosaic of ideologies which carried the Eurasian impulse further,beyond academia and into politics. His aim was, like Evola and the alt-right, to“break the reality barrier” and “make things happen.” I think we can say he’shad some success.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •AS THE NEW century entered its second decade, the appeal of Surkov’s cynicalhyperreality wore thin, and the need for something more solid was felt.Perpetual entertainment no longer sufficed and, ironically, a taste forsomething “real” appeared in Russia, a purpose to hold the people together andprovide a stimulus to the urge for “struggle and sacrifice,” which is the signof a surfeit of passionarity. Dugin was able to move this hunger, to nudge it inthe right direction, for his purposes. It gained momentum and carried on and isstill growing today.There was no shortage of Machiavellian incentive or strategy in this. Here Duginis more astute than his master Evola, who merely knocked on the doors of powerthat opened wide for his student. Dugin’s interest in power is no secret, andhis protean political personae have moved steadily if circuitously toward hisgoal, taking him from beyond the pale to where he finds himself now, at the“radical center,” another of his Orwellian coinages. We can say that throughpatience and persistence Dugin has achieved what others failed to do throughmore ostensible coups. He has been able to do what Hillary Clinton accused SteveBannon of doing, of enabling a “fringe element” to infiltrate mainstreampolitics. But Dugin has gone Bannon one better. He hasn’t infiltrated mainstreampolitics. He has become mainstream politics.Dugin himself hardly takes credit for how things have turned out, and what theirconsequences will be—and for anyone alert to what is taking place, it is clearthey are not by any means over. As he sees it, events are playing out notaccording to the design of this or that political intriguer or through the usualgive-and-take of world politics. A more insistent hand is guiding matters. Notthe iron rule of the dialectical laws of history, as laid down by Karl Marx.Marx was just an agent of the real forces at work, a tool for the true motor ofevents. Like Marx, Putin, Trump, and other world leaders taking part in thisdrama today are, according to Dugin, “simply acting according to the logic ofRussian history and the laws of geopolitics.”2 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber448]Going by this logic, the Soviet Union and the Russian empire that preceded itwere just temporary manifestations of a kind of spiritual, mystical unity thathas characterized the Russian soul for ages and which arises from the vast openplains of the inner continent in the same way that its topographical featuresdo. Spengler said that Europeans look up at the night sky and say “I”; Russianslook out across the endless steppes and say “we,” an expression of what theRussian existential philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev called sobornost, a sense ofspiritual “belonging.” The one emphasizes the individual, the other thecommunity, and for Dugin the contrast exemplifies a fundamental rift in theworld. Russians are saying “we” again, and by “we” they mean Eurasia.Behind the tsars and their downfall and the Soviet Union and its collapse laylarger world-historical necessities which now, in the early twenty-firstcentury, are emerging clearly for what they are. What drove these events andwill drive those to come is the looming great confrontation between theAtlanticists, who seek to conquer the world through neoliberalism,individualism, and globalization, and the defenders of religion, order, andtradition, the people of Eurasia. We can call this a “clash of civilizations” onan epic scale.“Oceania is at war with Eurasia. It has always been at war with Eurasia,” Orwelltells us at the start of 1984—although, of course, as in Vladislav Surkov’s“nonlinear war,” here the sides change according to the directives of BigBrother. With Dugin, however, they remain stable, although for Oceania we shouldread the Atlanticists; the maritime character is the same. Eurasia has alwaysbeen at war with the Atlanticists, and if the way in which Dugin’s meme has gonefrom simulacrum to reality is any gauge, some of the most exciting stages inthis battle are to come.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IT IS INSTRUCTIVE to observe how the Eurasia meme spread. Dugin had been writingabout it throughout the nineties, but by the end of the decade and with TheFoundations of Geopolitics it really took off. By 2000 he and Putin had met andEurasia had begun to enter political discussions. On a state visit to Kazakhstanin 2000, where he visited the Lev Gumilev Eurasian University, Putin endorsedthe idea, a development that Dugin saw as “epochal.”3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber449] By 2001 Dugin formed the Eurasia Party, thepolitical entity to emerge from his larger Eurasia Movement. Dugin spread theEurasian message through television talk shows, like that of Mikhail Leontyev, apresenter close to Putin, where millions of viewers heard of his “scientificpatriotism,” a love of the homeland rooted in Lev Gumilev’s ideas about ethnoiand geopolitics. Several trips Dugin made to Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Belarus in2003—all countries that find a place in his Eurasian vision—were highlypublicized.4 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber450] In response to the pro-Europe“Orange” Revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia in 2003–4, in 2005 Dugin formed theEurasian Youth Union, whose symbol is the Star of Chaos, emblazoned on theirblack T-shirts. That their founding took place in the Alexandrov Kremlin, hometo Ivan the Terrible, should tell us something about Dugin’s inspiration.The EYU targets pro-Western diplomats, stages sit-ins at Western embassies,vandalizes symbols of Ukrainian independence—something Dugin himself has beenguilty of—and engages in “culture wars,” meaning they attack pro-Western oranti-Putin protesters and act out “for real” the kind of Fascist street politicsDugin’s National Bolshevik Party only parodied. These “Duginjugend”—“Duginyouth,” as the novelist Vladimir Sorokin called them—are vehemently pro-Putinand pro-Russia, and are a Russian version of the “political militants” that theEvola-inspired Raido manuals aimed to reach. Like them, the EYU is involved in a“jihad to be waged at every moment against the enemies within.”They are also concerned with the enemies without, particularly the UnitedStates—or at least they had been until lately. The “Program of the EurasianYouth Movement: Our Enemy” makes this clear. “Our Union has one absolute enemy.It is the USA. This is the beginning and the end of our hatred.”5[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber451] As mentioned, attitudes may have changed sinceTrump took office, although over the months that I have been writing this book,the “bromance” between Trump and Putin has gone through a few bad patches, andit is nowhere near settled just how relations between the two postmodernpresidents stand.In 2007 in a speech at the Munich Conference on Security Policy, Putin claimedthat a new Cold War was starting and that the West, and specifically the UnitedStates, was using its dominance in a new “unipolar” world to ensure its controlof the planet. This is something with which many others, who are not necessarilypro-Russian, may agree. Earlier, in an address to the Russian nation in 2005,Putin had claimed that the collapse of the USSR was “the greatest geopoliticalcatastrophe of the century,” a remark with which Dugin wholly agreed, saying ithad “colossal philosophical and historical significance.”6[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber452] Not only had it fostered separatist movementsin what remained of Russia, it also left “tens of millions” of Putin’s fellowcountrymen “beyond the fringes of Russian territory”—like those stuck in Ukraineand Crimea, for example.7 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber453]But the larger significance of the collapse of the Soviet regime is that it leftthe world in a perilous state of unbalance. What remained, Putin said, was: “Onesingle center of power. One single center of force. One single center ofdecision making. This is the world of one master, one sovereign.”8[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber454] For Putin, this could not be good—not forRussia and not for the world. It has left the United States and its allies ableto use force whenever they see fit; what’s worse, in most cases such force hasnot resolved situations, but only exacerbated them—again, an assessment withwhich many might agree, although they need not be pro-Putin.Western delegates were quick to ask if Russia’s autocratic turn—meaning rule byPutin—was going to accelerate. How much real concern about a lopsideddistribution of global power informed Putin’s speech is debatable; the need toshow voters back home that he could stand up to the West and make Russia greatagain was certainly important too. But the message was clear: Russia would notallow for a unipolar, purely Western world. In Dugin-speak, the Atlanticistscould not have it all their own way.Soon after this some of Putin’s fellow countrymen languishing “beyond thefringe” began to head back home. In 2008 pro-Russian movements in South Ossetiaand Abkhazia, near the Black Sea, broke away from Georgia, a former Soviet statethat became independent in 1991. Russia backed its “fellow countrymen,” sendingin armed forces; the result was a “free” pro-Russian South Ossetia and Abkhazia,and a reduced Georgia. Dugin and his EYU were on the scene, ostensibly attendinga kind of ethnographic summer camp, researching Russian links with the ancientSarmatians, a warrior people of Iranian descent, but also engaging in militarytraining themselves.In 2012 Dugin addressed a huge crowd in Moscow’s Victory Park, gathered inopposition to anti-Putin protests and in support of Tsar Vladimir, who wasreturning for another term as president after sitting one out as prime minister.Protesters claimed the election was rigged—a by now common complaint—but thePutineers wouldn’t have it. Dugin warned his 120,000-strong audience about theWestern powers that were trying to keep Russia in check, telling them of “fifthcolumnists” who were undermining Russia’s sovereignty and of Russia’s mission toresist the atomizing of society forced upon them by Western agents ofindividualism, concerns that Putin himself had voiced in his victory speech.9[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber455] The Russian people were different. They workedfor the good of the whole, the community, the country, not their “preciouspersonalities,” as Putin himself would say, picking up Dugin’s rhetoric.In his speech to the Valdai Summit in 2013, Putin criticized the West for itsloss of morality, its decadence, its rejection of its Christian roots,especially on matters of homosexuality and gender. He affirmed the “traditionalvalues” that Steve Bannon sees in him, in language that could have been scriptedby Dugin, although Putin assured his audience that he had written it himself.10[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber456] Putin had by then formed strong ties with arevived Russian Orthodox Church, many of whose new recruits were, like thepresident, ex-KGB men. Dugin’s place among the Old Believers was another link tothe new, religious Russia, where a strong state and a strong church go hand inhand. Through him far-right political radicals and staunch upholders of thefaith could meet and move in a milieu that also included members of thepersuasive Russian mafia.By this time the Eurasia meme had become the focus of Western concern. As shewould with the alt-right and Pepe the Frog, it was Hillary Clinton whointroduced it to a wider audience, at once legitimizing it and providing Putinand Dugin with more evidence of the Western conspiracy against Holy Russia. At anews conference in 2012, the then secretary of state told reporters that inRussia there is “a move to re-Sovietize the region.” They are not going to callit the USSR again, she said, but a “customs union,” or a “Eurasian Union.” Andin rhetoric similar to how she would speak about the alt-right, she warned, “Butlet’s make no mistake about it. We know what the goal is and we are trying tofigure out effective ways to slow down or prevent it.”11[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber457] Small wonder that Putin would much rather haveTrump in the White House, and that many assume that he would take steps, if hecould, to ensure this.Clinton’s attempts to slow down the Eurasian snowball were not successful. Themost spectacular display of the Eurasia meme exploded—literally—two years afterher remarks. Vladislav Surkov may have stage-managed the conflict in Ukraine,but Dugin predicted it. We may even say he “picturized” it. It was something hewanted to happen and it did.Long before Putin did, Dugin spoke of the pro-Russian eastern part of Ukraine asNovorossiya, “New Russia,” a name for the region going back to the RussianEmpire, before it was “given” to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republicfollowing the Bolshevik victory. (Putin even questions the reality of a countrycalled “Ukraine,” saying it is something “we”—the Soviets—“gave” to Ukrainiansin the 1920s.12 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber458]) In 2009 Dugin drew a map of adissected Ukraine, giving the eastern provinces the name “Novorossiya.” In aYouTube video he gave a detailed account of how the country would disintegrateand predicted that the 2010 elections would be the last Ukraine enjoyed as aunified nation.13 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber459] And in a book we will get toshortly, he wrote that the “western border of the Eurasianist civilization”included the eastern part of Ukraine, “making that newly-formed government afortiori fragile and not viable.”14 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber460]Five years later Dugin predicted that the breakaway “republics” of Donetsk andLugansk would declare independence weeks before they did. He also predicted thatPutin would send in ground troops well before the unmarked Russian specialforces turned up. Perhaps most striking was his prediction of the design of theDonetsk Republic flag; it would be red, he said, with a blue St. Andrew’s Cross.He was right about the flag and everything else. We could chalk this up tointuition, a reasonable educated guess—Dugin is, after all, a geopoliticalstrategist—or simple coincidence. But the fact that Dugin believes that magic isinvolved in this should give us pause for thought. Like Marx, Dugin is notinterested in a philosophy that only interprets the world. He wants to changeit. “We do not just study what exists,” he writes. “We follow the process andtry to affect it,” a remark that would not be out of place in a book on chaosmagick. “Wishful thinking and self-fulfilling prophecy,” he tells us, “is quitelegitimate and welcome here,” sentiments that can be found, I think, in morethan one text on New Thought.15 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber461] And in aphrase that would not be out of place in one of Evola’s essays for UR, hewrites, “We live in the creation of the external world by the internal self.”16[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber462] “Thoughts,” he tells us, “are magic.”17[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber463] This is something on which Swedenborg, Blake,Neville, Norman Vincent Peale, Trump, Austin Osman Spare, and others we havelooked at could agree.In 2008, writing of Dugin’s dissemination of “the myth of Russia as a greatpower, accompanied by imperialist, Aryanist, and occultist beliefs,” MarlèneLaruelle, an expert on Russia and international studies then at John HopkinsUniversity, concluded that the scope of Dugin’s enterprise was at that pointunclear, but that it “cannot remain without consequence.”18[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber464] Six years later events in Novorossiya may haveconvinced Laruelle that she had been right.In 2015 the treaty creating the Eurasian Economic Union, signed by the republicsof Belarus and Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation the year before, came intoeffect, making concrete an idea that, in different forms, had been discussedsince 1994.19 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber465] The republics of Armenia andKyrgyz were also party to the agreement, and more than likely other states onthe fringe of Russia’s borders will follow suit. This suggests that on both thediplomatic and geopolitical fronts the idea of a rising Eurasia is gaining moreground—literally in Ukraine and Crimea—and making the important transition fromdream to reality—something, once again, with which all the players in this bookare concerned.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •YET CLAWING BACK ex-Soviet satellites in order to make Russia great again,though important, is not the limit of the Eurasian dream. This is really onlythe prelude to the main event. For Dugin this is the inevitable, absolutelynecessary showdown between the awakening Eurasian giant and its Atlanticistfoes. Trump’s election may have put this on hold, but the détente between theUnited States and Russia seems fragile, suspicions that the recriminationsbetween the two leaders are really a pantomime distracting from their truerelations notwithstanding. Like his antecedents, Dugin has the genuine Russianmillenarian spirit, and topping the list on his political agenda is nothing lessthan bringing on the end of the world.This was a project he put forth in his apocalypse-rich book The Fourth PoliticalTheory. Its central thesis is that in the twenty-first century, liberalismremains as the seemingly only viable political and social reality. It has gonefrom being one political and economic choice, among others, to becoming a way oflife, even, to a great extent, an unquestioned “natural” state of affairs. Toquestion it is considered an aberration, its “good” too obvious to doubt. Itstwo main rivals, communism and fascism—with which Dugin includes NationalSocialism—did not meet the challenge of modernity, and collapsed: fascism withthe end of World War II, communism with the collapse of the Soviet Union.(Dugin’s concern is with the West, so he ignores communism’s survival in placeslike China and North Korea.)The conservatism of the Republican Party or the British Tories is, from hisperspective, still a form of liberalism; it is simply not quite as liberal asits opponent, an assessment that informs the alt-right’s condemnation of the“cuckservatives”—cuckolded conservatives—who lacked the nerve to get behindTrump. Aside from some critics sniping at its edges, Western liberalism hasemerged as the only possible political, social, and economic choice for sanehuman beings. There are still some holdouts, but time is against them andeventually they will see the light.This in effect is the same scenario that Francis Fukuyama presented in hisinfluential book The End of History and the Last Man. Fukuyama argued that withthe global spread of democracy and the free market, Western civilization hadtriumphed and was in the process of culminating in a united free world. Thephilosopher Hegel saw the movement of history as the progressive embodiment offreedom in human life. With a world permeated by notions of “human rights,”democracy, and the increasing reach of a free market–style economy, Fukuyamaargued that Hegel’s vision had been accomplished and that the world spirit,manifesting itself through human action, had reached its goal. History, then, atleast in a Hegelian sense, had reached its end.But while for Fukuyama, liberals, and capitalists this was good news, it did notgo down well with Dugin. For him it was the worst possible news. What Fukuyamaand other liberals saw as freedom was for him the worst kind of slavery. Westernliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism, spreading over the planet throughglobalization, meant the reduction of human beings to consumers, the leveling ofall life to economics, and a bland homogenization of cultures, as“underdeveloped” countries embraced Western progress and “oppressed” peoplesfought for democracy—which in the end meant a larger market for multinationalcorporations.This is not a particularly new complaint. The West itself has produced manycritics of the same developments that have Dugin up in arms; going by this book,this fact seems to have escaped him. But Dugin’s vehemence is a few notchesabove what most of us would take as passionate but reasoned argument. Hisrevulsion at the modern world equals Evola’s or Guénon’s, but his rhetoricreaches heights of vituperation that even these masters of condemnation missed.Perhaps the fact that he is Russian and that Russians have a tendency to takethings to extremes, to exceed the limits—as Hesse saw in his essay on RussianMan—is at work here. Whatever the reason, what comes across more than anythingelse from this book is Dugin’s hatred of the West and of the modern and nowpostmodern world that it has produced.If its “absolute enemy,” the United States, was “the beginning and end” of theEurasian Youth Union’s “hatred,” here Dugin appeals to other anti-West,anti-U.S., and antiglobalization movements, however different their final goals,to join with him and share in the energizing effects of their common “hatred ofthe present social reality.”20 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber466] The enemies ofmy enemy are my friends, so the thinking goes—until, as usually happens, thecommon enemy is gone and the friends start squabbling among themselves.Hatred can bring people together. Orwell knew this; “Hate Weeks” and a daily“two minutes of hate” are mandatory in 1984. As Eric Hoffer in The True Believersaid, “Hatred is the most accessible and comprehensive of all unifying agents,”something that Hitler knew very well. An enemy unifies a nation more thananything else, whether he exists in fact or in fantasy. The Jew was the enemyfor Hitler, and his hatred of him informs the rabid pages of Mein Kampf. Asimilar hatred informs the pages of Dugin’s book. But while hatred may serve asan excellent cohesive, it is a poor fuel, and fires started with it burn outquickly and produce an ugly smoke. There is much smoke in The Fourth PoliticalTheory. In a gentler analogy, it is rather like a cappuccino: more froth thancoffee. But through the fustian and foam, some basic ideas get through.One is the need for a new political theory that could seriously challengeliberalism. To that end Dugin “deconstructs” liberalism’s failed rivals, fascismand communism. This amounts to cherry-picking what he sees as positive inNational Socialism and Stalinism, rejecting the rest as out of step with thetimes. What good there might be in regimes responsible for the deaths of manymillions of people I leave the reader to discover. The main idea is thatprecisely because fascism and communism did not meet modernity’s requirements,they are, as it were, Traditionalist by default.We know Evola saw some Traditionalist aspects in Hitler, but seeing them incommunism seems a stretch. Allusions like these have led some critics to wonderjust how traditional Dugin’s Traditionalism is.21[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber467] Yet Dugin’s trick of fitting togetherideologies like Lego blocks should suggest that, like the postmodernism heostensibly despises, he, like chaos magicians, is not fussy abouttechnicalities. What appeals to him about totalitarian regimes is that theyemphasize the collective over the individual. And where the Jew served asHitler’s all-purpose bête noire, the individual fulfills that function forDugin.The individual is what is wrong with the West—the “hissing, rhizomatic,twittering sub-individual,” to be exact.22 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber468] Heis the Frankenstein monster let loose—liberated—by its loosening ofrestrictions. The freedom rampant in the West, which it wants to export, Duginsees, is only a freedom from some constraint or other. It has no positive value;it is not freedom for some purpose or goal. As Nietzsche said, “many lost whatwas best in them when they lost their chains,” meaning that without an aim orpurpose, freedom is merely license—or, as existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartresaw, a burden. And as noted, it is precisely this burden that gurus anddemagogues offer to take from us. This is what has happened in the West. Theindividual “I,” once held in check by the restraints of religion or morality,has, in the modern world, been for the most part released from these. This is infact part of the definition of modernity. We can do what we want—and that isprecisely the problem.What we want to do is consume, not only goods but, as Dugin argues, realityitself. The Western liberated ego knows no boundaries, and the assertion of the“I,” or rather, the “me,” demands that everything give way before it. Our “humanrights” ensure this. This has led to developments like “gender fluidity,” inwhich men or women believe that because they “self-identify” as the oppositesex, they “magically” are whatever gender they desire. Biological realities arenegligible; everything is socially constructed. What the free individual wantsis what matters, and, as Dugin sees it, notions of human rights are trivializedin order to accommodate this. Even more, these rights will soon, he argues, beextended to forms of artificial life and intelligence, to computers and cyborgs.The Western “me” will soon find its own physical embodiment a limit that itshould be liberated from and want the “right” to merge with machines or evenother species.23 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber469] In the past, religion taughtthat there was an “essence” to created things, to minerals, plants, animals, andhumans. The postmodern Western “me” rejects this idea: anything, it says, can bewhat I want it to be. Or rather, it should be.This unboundedness has, paradoxically, led to notions of “equality” that, likeliberalism, are practically unquestioned. The dissolution of barriers, ofdifference, of any notion that some things are “better” than others, has led toa leveling of values in which perceptions of “high” and “low” are dissolved andthe mass of individual “me’s,” each pursuing its own desires, results in a vast,mediocre uniformity. Any expression of values that conflicts with this is seenas an attack of the “rights” of others, and any manifestation of difference tooobvious to ignore is chalked up to “privilege” or some other social factor thatpromotes “inequality,” which can be rectified through social engineering. Suchis the aim of the “social justice warriors.” They believe that we will allreally be free only when we are all really equal. It is this state of affairsthat, from Dugin’s perspective, globalization and its agents want to spreadacross the planet. For him, as for William Blake, “One law for lion and ox isoppression,” and he rejects it.It is not difficult to see these forms of “dissolution” as emblematic of themaritime, consuming Atlanticists, whose fundamental metaphysics of “becoming”knows no boundaries or limits. It is also not difficult to see that the organic,collective, hierarchical, totalitarian “traditional” forms of human life andsociety that Dugin champions embody the metaphysics of “being.”24[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber470] It is these that Eurasia defends.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •AGAINST THIS BACKDROP Dugin envisions a coming cataclysm that will either bringan end to the spread of Western “meism” or its total victory, in which theworld, finally “globalized,” will become one vast shopping mall with not onlygoods but realities on sale. Here he looks to the philosopher Martin Heidegger,himself a supporter of National Socialism in its early days, for help. WhereHegel saw history as the gradual embodiment of freedom, for Heidegger it wassomething rather different.With Traditionalism, Heidegger believed that in the distant past, Western manlost the plot. For Heidegger this meant that with the rise of reason inphilosophers like Socrates and Plato, we eclipsed the mysterious fact of Beingitself. In our desire to control the world and have it suit our purposes, wehave cut ourselves off from authentic existence. With Gurdjieff, Heideggerbelieved that Western man suffered from “forgetfulness of being,” and thatrationalism, science, technology, and the consumerism that accompanies them haveleft us stranded in a false world, rather as the ancient Gnostics believed. LikeNietzsche, Heidegger saw that the West was heading into an age of nihilism andthat the history of Being would end, to paraphrase T. S. Eliot, not with a bangbut a price tag. It was out of what Heidegger called the “destruction ofmetaphysics,” his attempt to undo the damage, that movements likedeconstructionism and postmodernism emerged.Heidegger did see some faint hope. The drift into nihilism could be halted, hebelieved, if some event, what he called the ereignis, took place. This issomething rather like the “singularity” that physicists speak of when referringto a black hole, or New Age visionaries do when dreaming of some millenarian“happening” that will change everything and restore the fallen world toinnocence. Heidegger mistakenly saw National Socialism, with its “resolute”rejection of the false values of modernity and embrace of “traditional,”“authentic” values—blood and soil—as some version of this.25[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber471] He spoke of the Volk regaining the “truth” ofits “will to be,” and saw Hitler as “incarnating” a “world-historical movement,”the “encounter between global technology and modern men.”26[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber472] He was a “man of destiny.” Dugin seessomething similar in Putin. He wants him to bring on the event that he believeswill throw the world back into the chaos from which it emerged.Yet Dugin’s vision of a world free from the Western obsession with freedomhardly sounds appetizing. Just as Neville aims to return to an “unconditionedawareness of existence,” and chaos magicians to the “Neither-Neither,” Dugin toowants to achieve a condition in which the subject/object duality thatcharacterizes our everyday experience—and is the basis of Western metaphysics—isdissolved, not in the individual, but collectively. We would then return to whatHeidegger calls Dasein, or “being there.” This is our immediate experience of“being-in-the-world” before Western rationalism favored the rational ego as “themeasure of all things.”It does give pause for thought that, with all their differences, Guénon, Evola,Dugin, and Heidegger all see the Western ego, the “I,” as the source of all ourproblems. It is this animus toward the individual that prompts Dugin’s vision ofa post-egoic world, in which we would be so immersed in a collective societythat we would be, as many antimodern activists think we should be, little morethan animals, completely “at one” with our environment. We would fill our“natural” roles as the unselfconscious creatures of the forests do theirs. Thisis a vision of a future informed by the organic, hierarchical values ofsynarchy, and the cosmic biologism of Gumilev and Vernadsky. We could, if welike, call it “enlightened fascism.”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •WHAT ARE WE to make of this call to “immanentize the eschaton,” the philosopherEric Voegelin’s phrase for bringing about the last days? As I write, the UnitedStates and North Korea are engaged in some serious nuclear saber rattling. Onehopes it stays at that and that Dugin’s millenarianism is only another exampleof the excessiveness Russian Man gets up to. Yet in a post-truth world it ishard to know what to take seriously and what is only a pose. On September 12,2001, the day after the attack on the Twin Towers, Dugin posted about it on hisblog. He sympathized with the victims but called the jets crashing into theWorld Trade Center the “swallows of the apocalypse,” likening them to the shotfrom Gavrilo Princip that killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand and started World WarI. For him the attack initiated a “war between unipolar globalism . . . and therest of the world” and marked the “end of history.” History, we know, has beenending for some time now, yet given Dugin’s evident militarism, it might nothurt to take him literally.But then he, like Vladislav Surkov, knows that war today is not linear, that itis a “war of all against all.” This could mean some final conflagration, areal-life global conflict that would leave survivors starting over from scratch.Or it could mean something else. Apocalypse is a Greek word meaning “uncovering”or “revelation,” and the sense of its meaning the end times comes from the ideathat with the final divine “revelation,” history and the world in the earthlysense would indeed end and a new heavenly age begin. But this does notnecessarily mean some physical cataclysm. “Revelation” is linked to vision, andto the sense of something hitherto hidden being revealed. A revelation canchange one’s life, but it doesn’t necessarily destroy it. In fact, it can makeit better.The phrase “a war of all against all” comes from the political philosopherThomas Hobbes, who in his work Leviathan said that it characterized the state ofhumanity before civilization. In a series of lectures about the Apocalypse ofSt. John, recounted in the book of Revelation, given more than a century ago inNuremberg, Rudolf Steiner spoke of a coming “war of all against all” that wouldmark the end of our spiritual epoch. Steiner spoke of a distant future, yet hiswords seem eerily prescient today. This war “must be pictured quite differently”from how we are accustomed to think of war, Steiner said, something with whichVladislav Surkov would agree.The root cause of this war, Steiner says, is the “increase in egoism, ofself-seeking and selfishness on the part of man”—by which of course Steiner alsomeans woman. He speaks of the “I” as a “two-edged sword.” It is the reason thatman “hardens himself” and wants to use everything, to have it at his “disposal.”Here Steiner anticipates Heidegger’s warnings about technology and its“utilizing” of the world. This “I” is interested only in its own satisfactionand in possessing for itself that which “belongs to all.”To be at war with all other egos is one side of this “I,” and so far Steiner’sremarks seem to echo Dugin’s. Yet the other side of the “I,” Steiner sees, is ofabsolute importance. It is what gives us “independence and inner freedom” and“in the truest sense of the word” elevates us. It is the “basis of the Divine inman.” It is worth every effort to preserve and to develop the “I,” and it is ourspiritual task to do so. “It would be wrong,” Steiner says, “to crave to go downagain . . . into some sort of universal consciousness, some sort of commonconsciousness,” which Steiner argues we emerged from millennia ago, and whichseems to be what Dugin has in mind. It would go against the current of evolutionand waste the centuries of struggle during which humanity rose up from itsunconscious animal beginnings.We do not need to abandon the “I,” Steiner tells us, but to strengthen it untilit can join with others in a “community of free and independent Egos.” But thisisn’t easy. Egoism without love, “I” without the “other,” separates us andbrings on the “great War of All against All.” Such egoism will lead “not only tothe war of nation against nation,” only six years away for Steiner, who wasspeaking in 1908. This is because the “conception of a nation will no longerhave the significance it possesses today,” something we know at first handthrough globalization and which has sparked a resurgence of nationalism. But itwill lead to “the war of every single person against every other person . . . ofclass against class, caste against caste, and sex against sex. . . .”27[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber473]I think if Steiner were alive today he might reconsider the estimated time ofarrival of his war of all against all. For what do we see today but people ofdifferent religions, classes, sexes, genders, ages, nationalities, and races“warring” with each other, fighting over their “rights,” over being “respected,”over their “identities,” which in the end means over their “I’s”? I would saythat this war extends into ostensibly demilitarized zones, into social media.For what else are we doing when we compete with others for “likes” and otherevidence for our online popularity? We push ahead of our “friends,” grasping forattention, seeking boosts to our self-worth. In The Caretakers of the Cosmos Iargue that the rise of social media suggests that most of us in the West havereached what Maslow called the “self-esteem” level of psychological development,when what matters most is what other people think about us.28[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber474] Maslow believed that at the next level,“self-actualization,” such attention is no longer desired. How close we are tothis is debatable.If a “war of all against all” is nonlinear, could it include forms of magic andoccultism? And would all the combatants be human? Steiner thought that occultforces were at work throughout history. At least on this point Guénon, Evola,and Dugin agree with him. We’ve seen that Guénon believed that “blackbrotherhoods” and “counter-initiates” were working against him, and that therewas some “will” behind them whose exact nature must remain “enigmatic,” an ideahe passed on to Evola. Writing of this “occult war” in Men Among the Ruins,Evola spelled out various “tactics” and “strategies” by which the forces of“global subversion” waged an “imperceptible war” against the defenders ofTradition. These forces operate in a “subterranean dimension” and theirinfluence, Evola believed, “cannot be reduced to what is merely human.”Dugin seems to agree. Writing of “angelic politics,” he says that “the sphere ofthe political is starting to be controlled by and is starting to ground itselfupon the confrontation between superhuman entities.” This development, he says,“possesses a huge potential to assign political roles without taking humanoidsand post-humanoids into account.”29 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber475]What this posthuman politics would mean for the people involved is unclear,except that it would spell the end of the “individual” as we know him. As Duginsays, “We propose the theory that every human identity is acceptable andjustified, except for that of the individual.”30[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber476] “Man is anything but an individual.” In fact,such a creature does not really exist. What the individual is “is not derivedfrom himself,” Dugin argues, but from “politics,” that is, the state.31[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber477]This means that you, reading this book and considering the ideas presented init, do not really exist as a separate “I.” Your sense that you do is only anillusion. What you are essentially is provided by the group of whom you are onlya member. Without them you are nothing. How this differs from Rudolf Steiner’snotion of the individual should be clear.But not only angelic or demonic forces participate in an occult war. We too areinvolved. Like others we have looked at, Dugin is aware of the power of thought.“Thinking,” he says, is “action.”32 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber478] Speakingof “activity as mentality,” he alludes to the “theurgic” power of theNeoplatonists, the ability to “animate” the inanimate that the ancientphilosopher and magician Iamblichus ascribed to the “performance of mysteriousacts” and the “power of unutterable symbols.”33[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber479] We could just as well say sigils. The idea isthe same: through intention, word, and deed, reality becomes malleable.Dugin knows this. “Thoughts,” he tells us, “can change reality.” They can“replace reality as fact,” something that Trump and every alternative factadvocate knows. He speaks of a “supranatural world,” in which there is “nobarrier between idea and realization.” Echoing Evola he speaks of adopting a“magical view of the world” in which “thought is the only thing that crossesworlds, and everything we cross with is nothing more than a thought.” He speaksof “pure thought” and produces another portmanteau, “menactivity,” which hedescribes as the “transformation of spirit into body and body into spirit” andwhich he says was the “main problem of hermeticism.”34[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber480]To read this in a book about magick, or New Thought, or esoteric philosophywould be one thing. To find it in a book that proposes a new political theory,based on salvaging what is good in National Socialism and Stalinism, and whichin part anticipates events that would transpire five years after itspublication, written by an adviser to the leader of a major power, seemssomething else. Well in advance of Trump, the alt-right, and Pepe the Frog,Dugin seems to have advocated a meme magic approach to politics. And as we’veseen with the rise of Eurasia, he seems to have done quite well.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •LET ME BRING together some of the main ideas of this book so we can get somesense of where we stand.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------• • •IMAGINATION IS ONE of the central themes of New Thought, positive thinking,chaos magick, and other forms of mental philosophy. But in one sense, it strikesme as noticeably absent today. In fact I would say that the entire postmodernphenomenon exhibits a curious lack of imagination, at least according to thedefinition of it given by the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.As mentioned, Coleridge believed that the human imagination was “a repetition inthe finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM.” This iswhat Coleridge meant by “Secondary Imagination,” that of the great artists andthinkers, who create their worlds in the same way, but not on the same scale, asGod. Coleridge also called imagination “the living power and prime agent of allhuman perception,” meaning that the very act of perceiving the world is really a“creative” one. Coleridge was not alone in believing this; Edmund Husserl, forexample, the founder of phenomenology, developed a hugely influentialphilosophical method based on the same insight.Coleridge also spoke of what he called “Fancy.” This is something different.Primary and Secondary Imagination truly create something “original,” in thesense that they reach into the fundamental source of all creation. Fancy doesn’tdo this. Fancy, for Coleridge, takes what is already created and combines it inodd ways with other things. A unicorn and a flying pig are examples of Fancy butnot, for Coleridge, Imagination, because they are only the result of an unusualcombination of otherwise commonplace items. They add nothing “original” toreality, unlike, as Coleridge believed, true imagination does. In a sense,Coleridge relegates art movements such as Surrealism, which produced scores ofsophisticated flying pigs and unicorns, into the category of Fancy. Others, Isuspect, could find a place there too.Postmodernism seems to me to be little more than an expression of Fancy. Itallows us to pick and choose from a wide selection of different styles,attitudes, images, ideas, beliefs, ideologies, and characters, and mix and matchthem as we please. But for all the “freedom” it grants, postmodernism is notcreative. It says that there are no restrictions on reality and that we cancreate whichever kind we like. But in actuality, along Coleridge’s lines, all itreally leads to are slightly different unicorns and somewhat novel flying pigs.I would say that Dugin’s talent for mashing up different ideologies is anexample of Fancy, just as is chaos magick’s trick of adopting different beliefs.And the post-truth world, in which we can pick and choose from among different“facts,” seems to suit it well. The term postmodern itself is an example of thevery portmanteau character I am speaking of. It itself shows a lack ofimagination: it simply means “the period after the modern,” which could beanything.I think we can say that Fancy and postmodernism are both simulacra of trueimagination, that they are, in fact, false versions of it. The “freedom” thatcomes with the liberating thought that “anything goes” is ersatz. As mentionedearlier, it is a “freedom from,” not a “freedom for.” We are free to put thebits and pieces of reality together however we like, but we can’t add to them;we can only play around with what we have. This suggests that sooner or later wewill exhaust the possibilities and be stuck with the equivalent of watchingreruns.Yet one of the themes we’ve considered is the idea of “breaking the realitybarrier,” of having the unreal pass into the real, the inner into the outer.This is the essence of the meme magic we’ve looked at. It is also at the heartof New Thought, positive thinking, and chaos magick. I started this book byasking a question: Could meme magick have helped Trump get into office? Couldhis own positive thinking have helped too? In other words, does it work? This isreally the only reason to pay attention to it. Whatever the psychological orsocial consequences of practicing positive thinking or New Thought, what mostconcerns people who do is whether or not they are wasting their time. Trump,Richard Spencer, Alexander Dugin, and others seem to feel they are not. In thisbook we’ve seen some of the reasons for their confidence.But “breaking the reality barrier” isn’t limited to magicians. Reality TV hasprimed a whole generation on the idea that there is little difference betweenwhat they see on the screen and what happens in their own life. The membraneseparating “fact” from “entertainment” became very porous in Russia whileVladislav Surkov manned the controls. And in Trump we have the first reality-TVpresident. Somehow, as our entertainment became more “real,” through HDtechnology as well as Big Brother, reality became more like a television show.Could obscuring the distinction between fact and entertainment somehow haveaided other attempts to cross the “reality divide”? Could reality’s ambiguity inthe cultural world have somehow seeped through into actual Being, into whatphilosophers call its ontology, its fundamental “is-ness”? Could this be a caseof life imitating art, or at least of reality imitating television? If so, thenwe may want to consider the possibility that in a world in which distinctionsbetween “truth” and “representation” have dissolved, efforts to nudge reality ina certain direction may have more effect. Recalling that the president inquestion was for years a reality-TV star—and a practitioner of positive thinkingfor longer than that—may help in this.In a sense I would say that Trump’s election may have been the kind of “event,”the “singularity,” that Dugin and many others have anticipated, which would endthe old world and clear a path for the new. I say this because it does seem thatwith his victory—“of the will,” we recall—we have entered new terrain, a new“normal” in which long-held ideas about truth and reality no longer apply andstandards and criteria once absolute are ignored. Trump we can say is thesimulacrum that has become the reality, the tulpa created by his followers whois now on the loose. He has made the transition from representation to fact,from television screen to “real life,” like a meme warping off the internet andinto reality. The portals are open, everything is negotiable, and soon “allthings will be possible again,” as Ivanka Trump promised when she introduced herfather to the Republican National Convention.35[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber481] With this many have felt the kind of “releasefrom the limitations of all conventional restraint” that charismatic leadersoften inspire—with debatable results. We may not have collectively returned toDasein, our “authentic being,” as Dugin hopes, but reality after Trump’selection certainly seems different from reality before it.We should also consider that for many years a variety of occult-friendly people,myself included, have argued against the limitations of a reductive, overlyrationalistic “scientism,” and the limited notions of “truth,” “fact,” and“reality” that it champions. In a post-truth world, these restraints seem tohave been lifted, but not necessarily with the result many envisioned. We wanteda more “magical” world; now we seem to have one—or at least one in which theusual standards of proof and verification no longer matter.The philosopher Jean Gebser, a contemporary of Evola’s, believed that in thetwentieth century, the West was experiencing what he called the “breakdown ofthe mental-rational structure of consciousness.”36[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber482] Essentially this meant that the worldviewbased on logic and reason, which saw its greatest expression in modern science,had entered what he called its “deficient mode” and was taking itself apart.This was in preparation for the emergence of a new “consciousness structure,”what Gebser called the “integral.” He died in 1973 just as deconstructionism andpostmodernism were beginning to dominate Western thinking. Had he lived to seetheir success, I believe Gebser would recognize them as symptoms of hisbreakdown, and that the post-truth world we now inhabit, and which makespossible a President Trump, is the “dark night of the soul” that Westernconsciousness must endure before any new light comes over the horizon. Gebserwas hopeful it would come, but there were no guarantees.If it is true that we have entered a time when the walls separating inner fromouter have thinned, what does it mean? I am perfectly happy to accept that allthis might be nonsense and that an economic, sociological, or some otherrational explanation—like Russian intervention—can account for Trump’s victory.Such a conclusion would be preferable. But after considering everything I’veread over the months spent writing this book, I have to say it is not completelysatisfying. My own experience has shown that the partitions between the mind andthe world are not always strong.In fact, the book I finished just before starting this one dealt with preciselythe place of imagination in human consciousness. In Lost Knowledge of theImagination I argue that, rather than being about “fantasy,” “escapism,” or“make-believe,” imagination is actually about making things real, precisely theopposite of what we are usually taught. I examined this idea through the work ofdifferent philosophers, psychologists, and poets, Coleridge among them. Thecentral insight is that imagination is a “way of knowing,” that we learn truthsabout reality through it that would otherwise remain obscure, and that itsrelegation to “unreality” through the rise of science in the seventeenth centurywas a mistake with serious consequences. But not only this. We participate withthe world through our imagination; even more, it is through it that we helpbring the world’s reality into being. Readers will recall remarks to this effectfrom an earlier chapter in this book.“Bringing reality into being” sounds very much like the aim of chaos magick andNew Thought. In Lost Knowledge I look at this idea historically, outlining howthe true nature of imagination was obscured with the rise of rationalism andlater “scientism.” Here I’ve considered it in more specific terms, but theprinciple is the same. The mind does not simply “reflect” a reality that is “outthere” and “ready-made.” In some way we don’t yet understand, it is intimatelyinvolved in shaping that reality, in “creating” it. If philosophers like Kantand Husserl, poets like Blake and Coleridge, esoteric teachers like Swedenborgand Steiner, scientists like Werner Heisenberg, and magicians like AleisterCrowley agree that, in some way we do not yet fully grasp, our minds interactwith the outside world, then there is no reason to deny that positive thinkingor meme magick is possible. Anyone who has practiced it and gotten results knowsthis already.Assuming this is so, the way in which we use this power becomes crucial. Exactlywhat do we “bring into being”? If positive thinking can put someone in the WhiteHouse and chaos magick can help in the rise of a new Russia, then this power isconsiderable. Esoteric tradition has long recognized this, as we’ve seen withthe dangers of tulpas and egregores. “Don’t call up what you can’t put down” isgood magical advice. The poet Goethe warned that we should be careful what wewish for in youth, as we will receive it in middle age. And W. B. Yeats, anotherpoet and practicing magician—Goethe himself practiced alchemy—echoed him when hesaid that “Whatever we build in the imagination will accomplish itself in thecircumstances of our lives.” When devotees of New Thought tell us that “thoughtsare things,” we may shake our heads, but we should remember that Goethe andYeats would agree with them.Even Evola recognized that pursuing the “absolute individual” who can be“unconditionally whatever he wants” was hazardous. The “chances of an individualruinously going haywire after embracing such a dangerous doctrine,” he wrote,“appeared all too evident.”37 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber483] Evola is talkingabout the solipsism that threatens a completely self-generated consciousness,the maddening idea that you are the only reality, and not only in a narcissisticsense. But a less extreme version of this can accompany a consciousness occupiedsolely with asserting its will. And this I would say is the main drawback of NewThought, positive thinking, chaos magick, and other forms of “mental philosophy”or “science of the ego.”It is good and necessary to pursue and achieve goals, to keep the will taut andactive. We need to use it or it will go flat, like the battery of a car left inthe garage too long, and such a condition is dangerous. It can lead todepression, even suicide, what Colin Wilson calls “life-failure.” But some“goods,” perhaps the most important ones, come to us when we are not concernedwith ourselves and satisfying our desires. Positive thinking, New Thought, andchaos magick seem to leave out of account the impersonal meanings and valuesthat appear when we see the world objectively, and not through the lens of ourneeds. This is the “newness” or “otherness” that comes to us when we see thingsfree of our wants, as realities in themselves, and not as objects of desire orobstacles in our way. Great music, art, literature, or thought can give us asense of this. We can get it through a spring morning, a starry sky, a sunset,even a glass of wine; these convey to us a sense of what the poet Wordsworthcalled “unknown modes of being,” the sheer strangeness, complexity, andinterestingness of the world.Focusing on our goals, keeping our “eyes on the prize,” we may achieve our aims.But without the breath of objective reality, its freshness and vitality—what theliterary scholar George Steiner calls the “sovereignly useless”—what we want maydwindle to trivialities. We may become so used to getting our way, to expectingit, that like the gurus and Right Men we have looked at, our slightest whimbecomes all important. Becoming absorbed in something that has nothing to dowith you, but for its own enigmatic sake, is something peculiar to humans. Itmakes us curious about the world and its mysteries as an end in itself, not as ameans to some more personal end. It is the essence of wonder. Early advocates ofNew Thought, like Emerson or William James, knew the importance of this. But itstrikes me that somewhere along the line, it’s been lost.But there is a more immediate danger. The French philosopher and scholar ofmysticism Henry Corbin wrote extensively on the imagination and what he calledthe Imaginal World, a kind of realm in between the physical world and that ofpure thought. It is the realm in which dreams take place and hypnagogic visions,and in which the “picturizing” that leads to the “actualizing” of our prayersgoes on. Like many others, Corbin saw the inadequacies of our usual notion ofimagination as a kind of “substitute” for reality. It was precisely this errorthat led him to use the term Imaginal to differentiate it from the “imaginary.”The Imaginal is real, Corbin argued, but it’s a different reality from what weare used to.Yet Corbin also recognized that the alternative to inadequate ideas about theimagination was not to let the imagination run riot. He argued that without someguidelines, such an unrestricted imagination—or, as Coleridge might say,Fancy—would be “out of focus” and its “recurrent conjunctions with ourwill-to-power” become “a never-ending source of horrors.”38[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber484] Corbin died in 1978, and what he might havethought of our post-truth world, full of meme magick and visualization, we canonly guess. Curiously, the kind of guidelines Corbin had in mind would not havebeen unknown to Evola, Dugin, and other followers of Tradition. He spoke of a“cosmology” reflecting a “plurality of universes arranged in ascending order,” acommon idea among many spiritual traditions. Whether we accept Corbin’ssuggestion or not, the meaning is clear. A philosophy of “anything goes” is notthe answer to a too limited notion of the imagination.Exactly what guidelines we impose on our imaginations is, of course, a seriousquestion, and one I must leave for another time. But the very power involvedsuggests we should proceed with caution, as anyone of any seriousness would;only children play with matches. This does not mean timidly, but with care andan awareness of the responsibility involved. The future perhaps is not only inour hands, but in our minds, and the reality that awaits us in the time aheadmay be germinating there now. Let us hope that when it arrives we will be equalto it and that it will bring clearer skies and brighter stars on the horizon.London, May–August 2017"},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]AFTERWORDSINCE DELIVERING the manuscript of Dark Star Rising and subsequently editing theproofs prior to its publication, it became clear that many changes had takenplace in the world that the book explores. This was only to be expected. A week,we know, is a long time in politics, but in the shape-shifting post-truth,alternative fact milieu of Trump and his entourage, as well as in thatsurrounding Vladimir Putin, that period of time reduces to hours, sometimes evento minutes. We all know how quickly things change today—that in fact is thecentral truth of our time—and to keep adequately up-to-date requires media otherthan books. But one significant development that seemed important to point outis the departure of Steve Bannon from Trump’s team, amid alleged power strugglesbetween him and other of Trump’s advisers. After leaving the White House Bannonfirst returned to his original port of call, Breitbart News, but then in asurprise move, left there as well.1 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber485] He hascome under fire for comments he reportedly made to Michael Wolf—included in hisbook Fire and Fury, an account of Trump’s presidency—alluding to theTrump/Russia election-collusion scandal, and he has also lost the patronage ofRebekah Mercer, billionaire daughter of Robert Mercer, who supported Bannon’spolitical efforts.2 [17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber486] At the time ofwriting—March 2018—Bannon had embarked on a tour of Europe, addressing far-rightand populist audiences in France, Germany, and Italy.3[17_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber487]"},{"pageContent":"[../image/1.jpg]ACKNOWLEDGMENTSSeveral hands helped in making this book possible.

There was an earlierEnglish exponent of Idealism, Bishop George Berkeley, who argued that esse estpercipi, which means “to be is to be perceived.” In essence Berkeley argued thatthere is no unperceived reality. Nothing exists that is not being perceived bysome consciousness; all reality is therefore mental. The reason why the objectsin my room, for example, do not disappear when I or someone else is notperceiving them, Berkeley argued, is because God is perceiving them.18 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_I_m_a_Win.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber36].

In Beyond the Robot:The Life and Work of Colin Wilson (New York: TarcherPerigee, 2016), p. 202, Ipoint out that C. G. Jung and the esoteric teacher G. I. Gurdjieff both employeda version of James’s “bullying.” Gurdjieff spoke of what he called“accumulators,” a sort of energy tank inside us. We have small “accumulators”for our everyday tasks, but more serious efforts require drawing on a muchlarger one that we rarely use. We can access this large accumulator through whatGurdjieff called our “emotional center,” that part of the “human machine” thatdeals with our feelings and values. Gurdjieff’s “emotional center” would, itseems, be responsible for the “excitement and ideas” that James believed lead usto make the effort necessary to break into second wind. See P. D. Ouspensky, InSearch of the Miraculous (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1949), pp.234–35. Gurdjieff, it seemed, was able to tap into his large accumulator whenneeded and was also able to access something he called the “Great Accumulator,”some reservoir of energy only a few could draw on. He was also able to send thisenergy to others. See Colin Wilson, G. I. Gurdjieff: The War Against Sleep(London: Aeon Books, 2005), pp. 13–23. Wilson’s chapter also includes adiscussion of James’s “The Energies of Men.”46 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_I_m_a_Win.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber64].

William James, On VitalReserves (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1922), p. 73.57 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_I_m_a_Win.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber75]. Swedenborg believedthat after death, our spirits are drawn to either heaven or hell because of whathe called our “true affections,” our real loves and affinities. In this case, itis we who are attracted to our rightful place in the afterlife. A similar ideawas proposed by the American spiritualist Andrew Jackson Davis. Swedenborg’sversion is not wholly different from the more popular New Thought take, however,in that he believed that heaven and hell are states of mind that we alreadyinhabit, here on earth. Heavenly thoughts bring us closer to heaven, and hellishthoughts bring us nearer to hell. And the heaven or hell we inhabit in theafterlife is fashioned from the “affections” we have in this one. So we docreate our own reality. But Swedenborg did not think in terms of attractingwealth or any other earthly goods (Lachman, Swedenborg, p. 115). A more esotericversion of the Law of Attraction can be found in what Gurdjieff called “magneticcenter.” This is a kind of deeply felt genuine interest in esoteric ideas thatdraws information about them to one and leads one to seek them out.

Again, in a moresophisticated context, this is rather similar to what in phenomenology, thestudy of the structures of consciousness, is known as “bracketing the naturalstandpoint.” See Gary Lachman, Lost Knowledge of the Imagination (Edinburgh:Floris Books, 2017), pp. 69–71.26 [09_CHAPTER_TWO_Positive_.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber101].

Space does not allowme to pursue this here, but a remarkable book by Thomson Jay Hudson, The Law ofPsychic Phenomena (1893), discusses in detail the incredible powers of theunconscious, which Hudson called the “subjective mind,” and its relation to whathe called the “objective mind,” our everyday consciousness. In Beyond the Robot:The Life and Work of Colin Wilson, I discuss Wilson’s analysis of Hudson’s work.His essential insight is that for all its seemingly miraculous power, the“subjective mind” takes its cues from the “objective mind,” that is, theunconscious follows the directions of the conscious ego. If the conscious mindgives it positive messages, it will respond accordingly (pp. 195–99).29 [09_CHAPTER_TWO_Positive_.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber104].

I should point outthat although chaos magick and New Thought share a “results-based” attitude totheir practices, and that the practices themselves show similarities, there arealso profound differences between them. For one thing, New Thought and positivethinking do not hold to the “anything goes” approach that informs chaos magick.They find guidelines and limits in gospel teachings. For some this may make themtoo tame; for others it is a healthy alternative to the formlessness that canovercome the chaotician.17 [10_CHAPTER_THREE_Gurus_a.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber136].

Both Bannon and thefictional Carl Anheuser express “realistic” views about the catastrophe,indicating perhaps that Bannon’s quip suggests a seriousness about taking stepsto survive the coming storm. His interest in Biosphere 2, an experiment increating a man-made environment that could sustain life, may have had more thana monetary or scientific motivation.3 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_It_s_Tra.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber278].

The psychologist StanGooch argued that a similar clash of lifestyles occurred between Neanderthal manand Cro-Magnon, with Neanderthal the communal moon worshipper and Cro-Magnon theindividual solar hunter. Modern humans are the result of breeding between thetwo. The archaeologist Marija Gimbutas had a similar scenario involving an earlyMother Goddess culture being invaded and conquered by patriarchal Kurganwarriors, a theme popularized in Riane Eisler’s book The Chalice and the Blade(London: Harper & Row, 1987). See Lachman, A Secret History of Consciousness,pp. 110–12, 112–17.10 [13_CHAPTER_SIX_A_War_of_.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber378]. Oddly, someone withwhom Evola has much in common is the American weird fiction writer H. P.Lovecraft. Lovecraft also embraced “tradition,” not Evola’s version, but that ofan eighteenth-century Anglo-Saxon gentleman.

Haushofer is regularlymisidentified as a member of the Thule Society, as a student of Gurdjieff’s, whotaught him the secret of the swastika, and as instigating a mysterious VrilSociety in Berlin—pearls of misinformation gathered from The Morning of theMagicians. He was none of these things, but a student of his, Rudolf Hess, was amember of the Thule Society. It is believed that it is through Hess that some ofHaushofer’s ideas reached Hitler, although Haushofer himself denied having anyinfluence on Nazi policy.63 [13_CHAPTER_SIX_A_War_of_.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber431]. I should point outthat the original German title for Spengler’s masterpiece is Der Untergang desAbendlandes, the “Undergoing of the Evening Lands,” so named because it is inthe west that the sun sets.

Gurdjiefftold Ouspensky some curious things about how the planets affect life on earth,and about how the moon is “the chief, or rather, the nearest, the immediatemotive force of all that takes place in organic life on the earth.” “Allmovements, actions, and manifestations of people . . . depend upon the moon andare controlled by moon,” he said (pp. 85–86). In the weeks leading up to andimmediately following the November 2016 U.S. presidential election, the moonentered what is known as a “perigee full moon” or “supermoon.” This is when itis both full and at its closest to the earth. The supermoon of November 2016 wascloser to the earth than it had been since 1948. In Gurdjieff’s system, the moon“eats” the souls of unconscious human beings. That the supermoon coincided withTrump’s election may give followers of the Fourth Way, as Gurdjieff’s teachingis called, pause for thought. www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/10/the-science-of-supermoons-the-lunar-lowdown-on-the-biggest-and-brightest-in-60-years[http://theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/10/the-science-of-supermoons-the-lunar-lowdown-on-the-biggest-and-brightest-in-60-years].73 [13_CHAPTER_SIX_A_War_of_.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber441].

Readers of RudolfSteiner may see in this a similar polarity to Steiner’s ideas about Lucifer andAhriman. The danger of Lucifer is limitless expansion; the danger of Ahriman isstatic materialism. Steiner finds a creative union of the two in Christ, or, ashe called him, the Representative of Humanity. Dugin offers no mediating agentbetween his two poles.25 [14_CHAPTER_SEVEN_The_Pol.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber471]. Heidegger was notalone in thinking some good might come from National Socialism. Jung felt thesame at first. See Lachman, Jung the Mystic, p. 168.26 [14_CHAPTER_SEVEN_The_Pol.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber472]. George Steiner, MartinHeidegger (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 119–21. Steiner, agreat reader of Heidegger and a Jew, writes: “It was Heidegger’s error andvanity, so characteristic of the academic, to believe that he could influenceNazi ideology, that he could bring his own doctrine of existential futurity tobear on the Hitlerite program. . . .” See also Hugo Ott, Martin Heidegger: APolitical Life (London: Fontana Press, 1994).27 [14_CHAPTER_SEVEN_The_Pol.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber473].http://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0104/19080625p01.html[http://wn.rsarchive.org/GA/GA0104/19080625p01.html].28 [14_CHAPTER_SEVEN_The_Pol.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber474].
