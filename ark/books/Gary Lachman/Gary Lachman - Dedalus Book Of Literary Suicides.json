There, are course, the familiar names: Sylvia Plath,Virginia Woolf, Hemingway, Chatterton. These, I found, readily came to mind whenI mentioned to friends that I was planning a book on writers who had killedthemselves, or had tried to, or had written about suicide at some length anddepth. But once I began to research in earnest and had moved past these wellknown figures, the field opened up considerably, and I found myself echoing thatline from Eliot’s The Waste Land: “So many, I had not thought death had undoneso many” – so many, that is, killed by their own hand.At the risk of bludgeoning the reader into a stupor at the outset, let mesupport this remark with a list, not exhaustive, sadly, but certainlyrepresentative. So, in no particular order, and in addition to those mentionedabove – who died by gas, drowning, gun shot and arsenic respectively – we haveGérard de Nerval (hanging), Cesare Pavese (barbiturates), Yukio Mishima (harikari), Heinrich von Kleist (gun shot), Georg Trakl (cocaine overdose), L. H.Myers (barbiturates), Robert E. Howard (gun shot), Jan Potocki (gun shot), PaulCelan (drowning), Walter Benjamin (morphine overdose), Guy Debord (gun shot),Gilles Deleuze (fall), Otto Weininger (gun shot), Anne Sexton (carbon monoxide),Empedocles (volcano), James Webb (gun shot)1, Romain Gary (gun shot), JackLondon (morphine overdose), Arthur Koestler (barbiturates), Ross Lockridge, Jr.(carbon monoxide), John Kennedy Toole (carbon monoxide), Geza Csath (poison),Stefan Zweig (barbiturates), Klaus Mann (sleeping pills), Thomas Lovell Beddoes(poison), Hart Crane (drowning), Primo Levi (fall), Harry Crosby (gun shot),Richard Brautigan (gun shot), Sadegh Hedayat (gas), Vachel Lindsay (poison),Hunter S. Thompson (gun shot), B.S. Johnson (slit wrists), Sarah Kane (hanging),Malcolm Lowry (sleeping pills), Eugene Marais (gun shot), Jerzy Kozinski(barbiturates and asphyxiation), Philipp Mainländer (hanging), Mário deSá-Carneiro (strychnine), Egon Friedell (fall), Marina Tsvetaeva (hanging),Charlotte Perkins Gilman (chloroform), Eleanor Marx (prussic acid), Henry deMontherlant (cyanide and gun shot), Sara Teasdale (sleeping pills), AdalbertStifter (slit throat), René Crevel (gas), William Seabrook (sleeping pills) –and I think with any luck you get the idea.If we add to these the names of writers and thinkers who have either writtenextensively about suicide or in whose work or life suicide played a importantrole, the list swells to unwieldy proportions. Shakespeare, Goethe, Dostoyevsky,Tolstoy, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Camus, Hesse, Wittgenstein, Kafka, Montaigne,Flaubert, Villiers de I’Isle Adam, Mary Wollstonecraft, Jorge Luis Borges areonly some of the names. Others come to mind too, and to be perfectly honest it’sdifficult to decide who to include and who to leave out. So, for instance, atthe end of his novel Auto-da-Fé, Elias Canetti’s protagonist, Peter Kien, setshis library aflame and burns himself to death. Clearly this is a literarysuicide (a very literal literary one) and also a symbol of the westernintellectual’s self-destruction. And the eccentric hero of Knut Hamsun’s novelMysteries. He kills himself, this time by drowning. Include these or not?Faced with this wealth of dark thoughts and saddening lives, I at first thoughtto compile an encyclopaedia, but I rejected this idea for two reasons.Encyclopaedia entries on most of these individuals exist already, and not onlywould I be repeating work already done, the structure of the book would requireme to either standardize the space devoted to each case, and so lose a greatdeal of important material, or to have some very long entries and some veryshort ones. And this consideration led to my second reason. Some of the casessimply seemed more interesting than others. In some, as in the case of theJapanese novelist Yukio Mishima and the American poet manqué Harry Crosby,suicide, their self-destruction, seemed an inevitability, and not because ofmanic-depression or some other mental instability, but because of who they were,their self-image and their self-obsession. Death, for both Mishima and Crosby,was an idea not far from their minds, and it was something they looked forwardto, but neither were particularly depressive characters, unlike, say, the poetPaul Celan or the novelist Richard Brautigan.In other cases, more understandable and external reasons led to the individualtaking his or her own life. Illness was the motive for the philosopher GillesDeleuze and the short story writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman, incipient blindnessfor the novelist and dramatist Henry de Montherlant (who, incidentally, onceconsidered writing a handbook on suicide), and escaping old age for the gonzojournalist Hunter S. Thompson. All of these people are interesting because oftheir life and work, and that they committed suicide sets them apart from mostother people. But their suicide itself isn’t a focal point of their lives as itis, say, with the tragic French Romantic poet and writer Gérard de Nerval, whohung himself in a decrepit alley in Paris after battling years of madness andpoverty, or the Austrian philosopher Otto Weininger, whose brilliant and extremeideas about sex, race and genius led him to take his own life. In these andother cases, the suicide doesn’t seem something ‘tacked on’ to their lives,something that, given other circumstances, may not have happened. With deNerval, Weininger, Mishima, Crosby and others, their self-inflicted deaths have,as I’ve said, an aura of inevitability. And while I am aware how romantic suchconsiderations seem, I nevertheless find them difficult to ignore.If he hadn’t shot himself, it’s doubtful that Harry Crosby would be rememberedtoday solely on the strength of his poetry, or as something more than a richliterati groupie, hovering in the vicinity of Hemingway and others in Paris inthe 1920s. Perhaps more than anything else, this says something about the powerof suicide as a publicity stunt, an idea not limited to moderns, as is evidencedby the case of the Greek Cynic philosopher Proteus Peregrinus, who capped off aturbulent career by publicly cremating himself in the Olympic flame in AD 165.Lucian’s account of Peregrinus’ self-immolation, “On the Death of Peregrinus,”pictures him as an exhibitionist, eager for fame, and given that I am talkingabout him here, nearly two millennia later, he seems to have achieved some ofit. But Crosby’s death, narcissistic, juvenile and murderous as it was (he tooka lover with him, unwillingly by some accounts), it nevertheless remains, forall its stupidity, something more than a headline grabber. Ironically, it wasthe meaning of his life.So, for some, we can say suicide presented itself as a practical solution to apressing problem. For others, however, it had a deeper, more vital meaning.SUICIDE AND DEPRESSIONThat writers and poets seem to be prone to suicide has not gone unnoticed. Moretimes than not, the connecting link most often suggested is some form ofmanic-depression – or, put less medically, melancholy. “Why is it,” Aristotleasked, “that all men who are outstanding in philosophy, poetry or the arts aremelancholic?” One answer to this question is “Are they?” One could, I think,produce a list of men (and women) outstanding in philosophy, poetry or the artsthat are not melancholic, or at least no more melancholic than individuals lessoutstanding in these fields. One can be moved by Weltschmerz without beingoverwhelmed by it, and the list of writers and poets (and artists and composers)who didn’t kill themselves is longer than the one above. Yet, it is clear thatin some way Aristotle is right. Painters and composers are also melancholic, andthey kill themselves too, but the numbers of suicides in their group seemsmaller than those among writers.“That such a final, tragic, and awful thing as suicide,” writes Kay RedfieldJamison in Touched by Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the ArtisticTemperament, “can exist in the midst of remarkable beauty is one of the vastlycontradictory and paradoxical aspects of life and art.”2 Yet although, as shestates, “recent research strongly suggests that, compared with the generalpopulation, writers and artists show a vastly disproportionate rate ofmanic-depressive illness,”3 one of the arguments of this book is that, as in thecase of Mishima, Crosby and others, not all literary suicides are the product ofdepression. Or, to put it another way, to equate all thoughts of suicide (andthe act itself) with symptoms of manic-depression (or some other pathologicalcondition) strikes me as overly reductive.It may be unfashionable to think so, but angst, it seems to me, is somethingmore than a chemical imbalance. The poet Robert Lowell once remarked about hisown recurring manic attacks, “It’s terrible […] to think that all I’ve suffered,and all the suffering I’ve caused, might have arisen from the lack of a littlesalt in my brain.”4 Lowell’s suffering was real, and I would not deny him hissalt, but I want to argue that existential concerns about the value of life, andwhat we might call ‘aesthetic’ concerns about the freedom to leave it underone’s own steam, are not necessarily manifestations of a pathology. Indeed, thewhole shift in thinking about our inner states from a philosophical ormetaphysical point of view to a medical one (melancholy as a state of mind, asopposed to manic-depression as a pathological condition) is something I findtroubling. Clearly, I’m not suggesting that people who benefit fromanti-depressant drugs should cancel their prescriptions. Nor that in many,probably most cases of suicide, depression is the root cause. I am saying thatthe reflections on suicide of writers and thinkers like Camus, Hermann Hesse,Dostoyevsky and others, which we will discuss further on, are something morethan the morbid thoughts produced by a pathological condition. When breaking offa course in psychotherapy, the poet Rilke, no stranger to thoughts about death,famously remarked that “if my devils leave me, my angels will too.” Rilkecontinued to be troubled by his devils, and he continued to write some of themost powerful poetry of the twentieth century. If I am here subscribing to the‘tortured genius’ school of romanticism, I make no excuse for it.As some have suggested, it may be irresponsible to think that the confusion,loneliness, despair and isolation experienced by many individuals of the‘artistic temperament’ should not be lessened by the insights ofpsychopharmacology. The general feeling seems to be that if these can be eased,they should be. But consider this passage from Shaw’s John Bull’s Other Island,when the ‘melancholic’ priest Keegan, who sees the world as a “place of tormentand penance” where we are sent to “expiate crimes committed in a formerexistence,” confronts the businessman Broadbent, who finds the world “rather ajolly place.”KEEGAN. “You are satisfied?”BROADBENT. As a reasonable man, yes. I see no evils in the world – except, ofcourse natural ones – that cannot be remedied by freedom, self-government, andEnglish institutions. I think so, not because I am an Englishman, but as amatter of common sense.KEEGAN. You feel at home in the world, then?BROADBENT. Of course. Don’t you?KEEGAN. [from the very depth of his nature] No.BROADBENT. [breezily] Try phosphorous pills. I always take them when my brain isoverworked.5It’s no coincidence that Colin Wilson, who himself came close to suicide in histeens, used this passage as the frontis-piece to The Outsider, his study ofalienation, extreme mental states and the crisis of meaning in modern man. TheOutsider, Wilson tells us, sees “too deep” and “too much” to feel “at home inthe world,” and many of the writers and artists he discusses considered suicideas a real response to their alienation. The idea that their troublingreflections on life’s meaning could be excised through a pill seems a clearnegation of those reflections’ value. Although it may be the case that hisrelations with people might have improved if he had, I somehow can’t regret thatKafka, who often thought about suicide, didn’t have the advantage of takingProzac.Yet, understandably, most attempts to grasp this link between writers and, asthe philosopher William James, who entertained suicidal thoughts, phrased it,“the pistol, the dagger, and the bowl,”6 have centred on depression. A. Alvareztitled his study of suicide – to which this book is indebted – The Savage God,and speaks of the urge as manifested in Sylvia Plath as “not a swoon into death,an attempt to ‘cease upon the midnight with no pain’ ” but “something to be feltin the nerve-ends and fought against.”7 Alvarez writes of the “shabby, confused,agonized crisis which is the common reality of suicide,”8 and of course he isright. In the majority of cases, which are not literary, suicide is a darkcul-de-sac in a trapped, despairing life. But when considering literarysuicides, depression, as common and as devastating as it is, does not, it seemsto me, cover all the bases.A TAXONOMY OF SUICIDEWith this in mind, and thinking of how to structure this book, it struck me thatI would have to do a ‘taxonomy’ or ‘phenomenology’ of suicide. Rather than lookfor some root cause, linking the different cases I had collected, I thought itbetter to simply describe and categorize them. There may not be an ‘essence’shared by all the suicides in this book. There may not even be something likethe notion of a ‘family resemblance’ a la Wittgenstein – who, incidentally,endured many a suicidal thought. But they do seem to fall into certain ‘types’.There is the Existential Suicide. There is also the Romantic Suicide. There isthe Aesthetic Suicide, and, as I’ve been discussing, the Manic-Depressive orMelancholy Suicide. There is also the Political Suicide and the Surreal Suicide.Each of these will be looked at in some detail as we go on. There are also somesub-categories, like the Fame Suicide, mentioned above, and the strange categoryof Imitative Suicides. One striking example of this type is the case of EleanorMarx, youngest daughter of Karl Marx, and translator of Flaubert’s MadameBovary, which famously ends with the suicide of its heroine. Jilted by hersocialist lover Edward Aveling, Eleanor was so impressed by Emma Bovary’s deaththat she ended her own life in the same way, by taking poison. The imitation wasnot exact, however. Emma ate arsenic, but in Eleanor’s case it was prussic acid.Some cases are perhaps unique, and it might be a good idea to begin our surveyby touching briefly on some of the different types of literary suicide that falloutside of the main categories mentioned above.One such I might call the Fan Suicide. One disciple of Rousseau was so enamouredof his master that he blew his brains out at his grave; he is honoured with atomb at Ermenonville, near Rousseau’s own.9 There is the philosophical suicide.The German Romantic playwright and short-story writer Heinrich von Kleist, whowe will discuss in detail further on, may be the one case of a suicide overepistemological reasons; reading the philosopher Kant – not an enticing prospectfor most of us – Kleist was led to blow his brains out. There is even a case ofa suicide in the cause of literature. In Berlin in 1834, Charlotte Stieglitzstabbed herself to death, trusting her death would inspire her husband, the poetHeinrich Stieglitz, to greatness. Sadly, Heinrich remained a mediocre poet, andher sacrifice was in vain. Another example of the imitative type involves theConan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes scholar Richard Lanceyln Green. There is thesuspicion that he arranged his suicide to appear as a murder, in effectmimicking the plot of one of Doyle’s last Holmes stories, “The Problem of ThorBridge.”METHODS OF SUICIDEWriters’ methods of ending their life can also be unique and deserve someclassification. The eighteenth century Polish traveller, ethnologist andfabulist Jan Potocki, author of the strange work The Manuscript Found atSaragossa, was a student of the occult, a Freemason and a possible member of thesecret society the Illuminati. In his last days, suffering from ill-health,family troubles and disillusionment with the outcome of the French Revolution,Potocki had come under the belief that he had become a werewolf, and he tooksteps to remedy this. Taking the silver knob of a sugar bowl, he filed this intoa silver bullet, had this blessed by a priest, and then blew his brains out withit by shooting himself in the mouth. The French romantic poet Gérard de Nerval,mentioned earlier, was, like Potocki, a student of the occult; he is also famousfor walking a lobster on a leash through the Palais-Royal in Paris. After twostays in an insane asylum and several bouts of madness, he finally hung himselfwith a filthy apron string he had carried for years and which he assured friendswas really the Queen of Sheba’s garter.10Other methods seem exceptional in their severity. The poet Vachel Lindsay killedhimself by drinking Lysol, a powerful cleaning fluid. The playwright Sarah Kane,at twenty-eight enjoying success and a promising career, was found hanging in abathroom in London’s King’s College Hospital. And after two unsuccessfulattempts at taking his life, as well as enduring harrowing multiple courses ofelectro-convulsive therapy, which many believe only worsened his condition,Ernest Hemingway blew his brains out with a shotgun on the landing outside hiswife’s bedroom door; she had to step over his remains in order to get down thestairs.REASONS FOR SUICIDE: FAILURE AND SUCCESSOf the many reasons for suicide, it seems obvious that failure would be a commoncause among writers. In the case of John Kennedy Toole this is true. Toole’snovel, A Confederacy of Dunces, was rejected by several publishers in the 1960sand this, combined with depression and possible confusion over his sexuality,led Toole to heavy drinking and eventually to gassing himself in his car.Toole’s mother, a domineering woman, had absolute faith in her son’s genius andafter his death, she continued to hunt for a publisher for the book. Eventually,through the help of the novelist Walker Percy, Toole’s novel was finallypublished, to great success. In 1981 he was posthumously awarded the PulitzerPrize, and A Confederacy of Dunces has since achieved ‘modern classic’ status.Yet, success, too, is no defence against the literary suicide. In 1948, RaintreeCounty by Ross Lockridge, Jr., an epic of the US Civil War, was published towide acclaim and massive sales, the sort of response every writer secretly (andnot so secretly) desires. The manuscript, which Lockridge had been working onwhile ostensibly doing a dissertation on Walt Whitman at Harvard University,weighed nearly twenty pounds, and was accepted by Houghton Mifflin almost onsight; he arrived at their offices carrying it in a battered suitcase. Prior topublication Life magazine ran an excerpt from it for a hefty sum. Lockridge alsowon an enormous prize offered by MGM Studios, as well as a movie contract (thefilm was eventually released in 1957 starring Elizabeth Taylor and MontgomeryClift, and seen as another Gone With the Wind) and it was the main selection ofthe Book-of-the-Month Club. Yet, two months after publication, and a day beforeRaintree County was announced as No.1 on the national best-seller list,Lockridge killed himself in the same way as John Kennedy Toole would twentyyears later, by carbon monoxide poisoning. Lockridge too was suffering fromsevere depression, some of which was rooted in the anxiety such massive successoften brings: the pressure of living up to the acclaim, the challenge,basically, of the second book.THE UNSUCCESSFUL SUICIDEThere are still other categories of literary suicide. One is the AmbiguousSuicide; another is the case of writers who attempted suicide, or were about toand, for one reason or another, were stopped, which I might call the AbortedSuicide. One of these, Mary Wollstonecraft, we will look at in some detailfurther on. Goethe, who is held responsible for a spate of copy-cat romanticsuicides, and who will also be explored in detail further on, has the eponymoushero of his drama Faust stopped from killing himself by hearing the church bellson Easter Sunday.One case in which a book, or at least a pamphlet, prevented a writer fromkilling himself is that of the Prague occultist and novelist Gustav Meyrink.Torn between the demands of his life as a sober financier, and the pleasures ofbeing Prague’s most extravagant dandy, Meyrink was at the brink of suicide whena pamphlet was pushed under his door. It was an advertisement for a book onoccultism. Meyrink read the signs and decided not to end his life; when hisExpressionist novel The Golem appeared some years later, it was a bestseller.The French short story writer and novelist Guy de Maupassant seemed to presagehis own suicide attempt in his story “The Horla,” in which the hero’s mind isincreasingly dominated by a strange extra-dimensional creature, and he iseventually led to kill himself. Many see this eerie tale as a vision ofMaupassant’s own incipient madness, brought on by syphilis. His hero’s suicide,however, was wish-fulfilment. Maupassant attempted to avoid the fate of hisbrother, who also went mad, by committing suicide, but was prevented by hisservant.11Another unsuccessful suicide was the Lithuanian poet, novelist, esotericphilosopher and diplomat O.V. de Lubicz Milosz, a writer little known in theEnglish speaking world, although his reputation in his adopted country of Franceis secure. Milosz began his writing career as a symbolist and decadent, and ateighteen, was one of the habitués at the Kalissaya, the first American bar inParis, where he was often in the group of would-be geniuses surrounding OscarWilde. Sitting at a table with George Moore, Ernest Lajeunesse and the poetMoréas, Wilde once remarked to a friend “This is Moréas, the poet.” SeeingMilosz come in he continued “and that is Milosz – poetry itself.” Milosz (whowas the uncle of the Nobel Prize winner Czeslaw Milosz) was a devotee of Poe,Lamartine, Baudelaire, Novalis, Byron and Hölderlin, and he took part in cafédiscussions at the Kalissaya and at another poetic watering hole, theNapolitaine. Yet, in spite of his decadent pose, Milosz was unhappy with notionsof ‘art for art’s sake’, and in a letter to his friend Christian Gauss, admittedto being “horribly sad … with a sadness that nothing can vanquish.” “This life,”he told Gauss, “is horribly empty with its anxious loneliness surrounded by theidiots of the Napolitaine and the Kalissaya …”12 This loneliness increased andeventually led Milosz to a suicide attempt. As he told Gauss in another letter,on 1 January 1901, “towards eleven o’clock in the evening – with perfect calm, acigarette at my lips – the human soul is, after all, a strange thing – I shotmyself in the region of the heart with a revolver.”13 He botched the job, buthis doctors didn’t think he’d survive. Unexpectedly he did, and Milosz wassufficiently moved by the experience to cast off his aesthetic garb and turnhimself into a philosophical poet of a highly metaphysical and spiritualcharacter.Another suicidal failure was the poet Charles Baudelaire, one of Milosz’sheroes. In 1845, Baudelaire’s extravagantly decadent tastes had depleted theinheritance he received from his father, who died when Baudelaire was six. Hisdomineering mother and strict step-father took steps to curb the youngaesthete’s expenditure, effectively impounding the funds, and doling out to hima small allowance. This humiliation, combined with his masochistic dependency onthe illiterate, coarse and frequently drunk mulatto woman Jeanne Duvall, ledBaudelaire to despair, and he tried to escape his fate by stabbing himself. LikeO.V. de Lubicz Milosz, he bungled the job, which we can assume only added to hishumiliation. The crisis however had a beneficial result; out of it Baudelaire’sfirst published writing, the Salon of 1845, was met with approval, andestablished him as a respected, if not well-paid, critic.14Another failed suicide, a somewhat tragic-comic and colossal one, was WilliamCowper, whose account of his fruitless attempts to end his life are too long toquote here but can be found in the Suicidal Miscellany at the end of the book.SUICIDE, OR NOT?The writer Graham Greene presents us with a case that could be considered eithera failed attempt or an ambiguous one, but in my opinion, and Greene’s, doesn’tqualify as a suicide attempt at all. In “The Revolver in the Corner Cupboard,”Greene relates how he relieved his teenage boredom by playing Russian Rouletteon Berkenstead Common. In his late teens Greene suffered from an acute case ofennui. He writes that “For years it seemed to me I could take no aestheticinterest in any visual thing at all: staring at a sight that others assured mewas beautiful, I would feel nothing.”15 Here Greene echoes the ahedonia of anearlier, sometimes suicidal poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In “Dejection: AnOde,” Coleridge writes:Yon crescent Moon, as fixed as if it grewIn its own cloudless, starless lake of blue;I see them all so excellently fair,I see, not feel, how beautiful they are!Coleridge himself considered suicide in his early years, when, as his biographerRichard Holmes relates, he lived a kind of double-life at Cambridge, alternating“wild expenditure on books, drinking, violin lessons, theatre and whoring” with“fits of suicidal gloom and remorse.” “He abandoned himself to a whirl ofdrunken socializing, alternating with grim solitary resolutions to shoot himselfas the final solution to bad debts, unrequited love and academic disgrace.”16Coleridge’s older brother Francis had in fact committed suicide and theinfluence of Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, which we will discussfurther on, probably had something to do with these thoughts ofself-annihilation.Graham Greene, however, hit upon an effective means of dissipating his boredom.Discovering a revolver among his brother’s things, Greene decided to try hishand at Russian Roulette, having read of Russian soldiers entertainingthemselves in this way during long and dreary campaigns. Greene found somebullets and, loading one into a chamber, spun the revolver behind his back.Taking the pistol to the Common, he put the barrel to his temple and slowlypulled the trigger. He writes: “There was a minute click, and looking down atthe chamber I could see that the charge had moved into place. I was out by one.I remember an extraordinary sense of jubilation. It was as if a light had beenturned on … and I felt that life contained an infinite number ofpossibilities.”17 Greene continued the practice, finding a “craving” for itseffects. Eventually, however, the kick of not blowing his brains out wore off,and he stopped.Greene makes clear that his dangerous game, however, had nothing to do withsuicide, although Kay Redfield Jamison counts him among her manic-depressives.18Greene writes, “… this was not suicide, whatever a coroner’s jury might havesaid of it: it was a gamble with six chances to one against an inquest … Thediscovery that it was possible to enjoy again the visible world by risking itstotal loss (my italics) was one I was bound to make sooner or later.” And toinsure that his possible death would not be taken as intentional, Greene wrote averse and left it on his desk, which included the line “I press the trigger of arevolver I already know to be empty.”19AMBIGUOUS SUICIDESOf other ambiguous or border-line suicides, the proto-surrealist Arthur Cravanis a good candidate. Cravan was a contemporary of Alfred Jarry, creator of theUbu plays, and rivalled him in his eccentricities, combining a career in boxing– he once went six rounds with Jack Johnson – with aggressive, Dadaesque poetry.It is generally believed that Cravan committed suicide, throwing himself intothe sea during a voyage from Mexico to Valparaiso to meet his wife, the poetMina Loy; but an article by Charles Nicholl in the London Review of Booksundermines this account, and suggests that he simply lost control of his lessthan seaworthy craft and sank; the voyage would in any case be demanding foreven a highly competent sailor.20 Like many surrealists, Cravan however had apredilection for suicide, and once filled a Parisian hall with his announcementthat he would kill himself in public. But when the hall was full, he promptlyaccused his audience of crass voyeurism and treated them to a lecture on entropyinstead. (One suspects many wished he would have stuck with the advertisedentertainment.) Cravan’s aesthetic ‘terrorist’ tactics would later be a majorinfluence on the Situationist Guy Debord, who would commit suicide in 1994,shooting himself through the heart at his farm house in the Auvergne. Debordclaimed that he wanted to see “whether one could live with the responsibility ofcommitting an act of supreme transgression,” and his biographer Andrew Husseyspoke of his “supreme and sovereign act of self-destruction.”21 This is arefrain that will accompany many who choose what we can call the Aestheticsuicide. The problem with this and with all notions of ‘transgression’, is thatthere are no acts of “supreme transgression.” The other usual candidate for anact of “supreme transgression,” murder, has its own drawbacks, but, as we shallsee, in the case of some aesthetic suicides, like that of Jacques Vaché, thesewere apparently negligible.Another ambiguous case is that of the novelist Malcolm Lowry, best known for hismasterpiece Under The Volcano, an hallucinatory account of the last twelve hoursin the life of Geoffrey Firmin, an alcoholic ex-British Consul, drinking himselfto death in Mexico. The action of the novel takes place on the Day of the Dead,and the book is saturated in occult and mystical symbolism, much of it takenfrom the Tarot; one card with great meaning for Lowry was the Hanged Man. Firmintempts certain death by frequenting a low tavern, the Farolito, and at the endof the novel is killed there by local fascists and Nazi supporters. Lowry’s ownlife, filled with alcoholism, broken marriages, poverty and failure, seems along, drawn out descent into a personal hell, and at the end of it, the officialassessment was ‘death by misadventure.’ Yet there is some suspicion of suicide.The cause of death was asphyxiation – Lowry choked on his own vomit after aterrific binge. Yet a bottle that had contained twenty sodium amytal sleepingpills was found empty nearby. Lowry had been battling his addiction for yearswith little success and may have simply given up. But as his biographer GordonBowker suggests in Pursued by Furies: A Life of Malcolm Lowry, there is thepossibility of foul play; it is possible that Lowry’s second wife, MajorieBonner, with whom he had quarrelled ferociously on the night of his death, hadgiven Lowry the sleeping pills while he was in a drunken stupor.22Another borderline case is the novelist Jack London. Associated with clean cutrugged boys’ adventure tales like The Call of the Wild and White Fang, Londonhad a dark side, an obsession with pushing himself to the limits, a kind of‘supersize’ philosophy of life. His capacity for food and drink was enormous andwould in the end kill him, although it is possible that the overdose of morphinewhich capped off his hedonistic career was intentional. Although London couldsay that, “After having come through all of the game of life, and of youth, atmy present mature age of thirty-nine years I am firmly and solemnly convincedthat the game is worth the candle …”23 he would also keep a loaded revolver inhis desk, ready to use against himself at any time.24Addicted to morphine and opium, London was a phenomenal drinker and was one ofthe first major writers to publicly confess to his alcoholism; his “alcoholicmemoir” John Barleycorn shocked the readers of his adventure tales and inpuritanical America, turned many against him. In his passion for excess, it iseasy to see a subliminal death-wish, a desire to pass beyond the limits of theself. London admitted to once almost drinking himself to death in a binge, andon another occasion, as he relates in John Barleycorn, he drunkenly stumbledinto San Francisco Bay and “some maundering fancy of going out with the tidesuddenly obsessed me.” London drifted for hours with the intention of lettinghimself drown, but sobered up in the end and was saved by fishermen. The hero ofhis semi-autobiographical novel Martin Eden kills himself, and in The LittleLady of the Big House the heroine, suffering from a mortal and inoperablegunshot wound, is helped by her doctor to end the pain by taking her own life.London may have killed himself or he may have died from the uremia that waskilling him anyway (his kidneys were failing and filling his system with thewaste product urea). Other suggested causes are a heart attack, a stroke, or anaccidental overdose of morphine. Whatever may have killed him, like RossLockridge Jr. (and a cadre of rock stars), success, which he had a great dealof, was no fun for London. “Success – I despised it,” he wrote, and one wondersif the collapse of ventures like the palatial Wolf House, his schooner theSnark, and his huge Beauty Ranch – all expensive enterprises that proved dismalfailures – were brought about by an unconscious wish for annihilation. London’schildhood with a depressive, unhinged mother – who lived with an astrologer andspiritualist after London’s father deserted her – his early years working at acanning factory, and his frequent need to adapt to difficult environments madehim in many ways a survivor. His own social views were very much in line withSocial Darwinism. Yet, as one of his biographers suggests, they also came at acost. “Jack never developed a robust sense of self, and he would enter adulthoodwith little self-esteem.”25 Although driven by an urge to better himself (he wasa determined autodidact) and in every way a self-made man, London was plagued bywhat he called White Logic: “the messenger of truth beyond truth, the antithesisof life, cruel and bleak as interstellar space, pulseless and frozen as absolutezero, dazzling with the frost of irrefragable logic and unforgettable fact.” Forall his worldly success – he was, at one point, the highest paid writer inAmerica – London never really felt good about himself. Possessed of aNietzschean belief in the superman, he was also prone to a cosmic pessimism, afatalism that prevented him from adjusting his behaviour when faced with theresults of his superhuman excess. When the tide of drugs, alcohol, and a failingbody started carrying him out to the cosmic sea, he may in the end have just lethimself go.THE SLOW SUICIDELondon’s case raises the question of writers who may be seen as indulging in aslow drink or drug-filled suicide. That writers often have an unhealthy fondnessfor the bottle or drugs is well known. The Beat novelist Jack Kerouac is a casein point. After the initial success of books like On The Road and The DharmaBums, Kerouac retreated into an increasingly esoteric prose style and analcoholic solitude, effectively drinking himself to death while living with hismother; he died at forty-seven in 1969. Another is the decadent poet ErnstDowson, a devotee of absinthe, opium, hashish, alcohol and other inebriants.Dowson, a friend of Arthur Symons, Yeats and others of the ‘Tragic Generation’,is described by one writer as “living almost hermit-like in a ramshackle housewhere he drank absinthe and took opiates in abundance.”26 He died at thirty-twoof consumption, drink and overall self-abuse. Dowson’s poetry is filled withimages and metaphors of ennui, world-weariness, decline and early death; perhapshis best known poem is “They Are Not Long,” with its cheery admonition that“They are not long/The days of wine and roses/ Out of a misty dream/Our pathemerges for a while then closes/” In another poem, “A Last Word,” he wishes togo to “the Hollow Lands” where there is, “Freedom to all from love and fear andlust/Twine our torn hands/O pray the earth enfold/Our life-sick hearts and turnthem into dust.” Dowson may not have had the strength to commit suicide, and hisworld-weariness may have been something of a pose, one adopted by many of hispeers, but he did nothing to halt his sure drift into non-existence. Yet if weallowed his case and that of Kerouac’s (and sadly many others) to count assuicides, this book would grow unmanageable, and so I think we must leave themout.27FAKE SUICIDESSome writers have a kind of ‘double’ relationship to suicide. The Portuguesepoet Fernando Pessoa didn’t commit suicide, but one of his ‘heteronyms’ did.Heteronym was the title Pessoa gave to the various literary alter-egos hecreated throughout his career; more than a pseudonym, Pessoa’s heteronyms – hehad dozens – were actual complete other identities, with histories,psychologies, and literary styles all their own. One of these, the Baron ofTeive, author of a work entitled The Education of A Stoic, is led to suicidethrough strictly logical reasoning. Believing in the “impossibility of producingsuperior art,” and deciding to kill himself after burning all of his works, theBaron works on one final piece of writing, a manuscript which will explain whyit is impossible to capture in writing the literary works he imagines in hisbrain. As so often happens with Pessoa, this work, too, is only fragmentary, aliteral testament to the impossibility of literature. The Baron has “reached theheight of emptiness, the plenitude of nothing at all.” What leads him to suicideis “the same kind of urge that makes one go to bed early.”28 As Heinrich vonKleist had discovered (as we shall see), Teive sees that “the rational conductof life is impossible. Intelligence provides no guiding rule,”29 and likeKleist, he concludes that there is only one option, suicide. “I feel I haveattained the full use of my reason,” Teive writes, and so “that’s why I’m goingto kill myself.”30 And after burning all of his previous fragments, he does.Another of Pessoa’s heteronyms, Bernardo Soares, the author of the best known(in the English speaking world) of Pessoa’s works, The Book of Disquietude –although to call this enormous collection of fragments a ‘work’ is misleading –considers suicide as well. But, as is usual with Pessoa, his take on it isparadoxical. Pessoa/Soares writes: “The active life has always struck me as theleast comfortable of suicides.”31 If that is the case, then Pessoa’s own life,which, aside from his considerable literary activity was far from active, may beseen as a long avoidance of this particular method of doing yourself in: hespent nearly all of his life in Lisbon, practically in the same neighbourhood,had few friends and probably died a virgin. Yet anyone who reads The Book ofDisquietude can’t help but recognize its deep world rejection and unrelentingennui, and, like myself, may feel that suicide was never far from Pessoa’s mind.It’s understandable then that he would find the idea of helping another poetfake his own suicide attractive. The poet in question, however, is more wellknown in his other guise as a magician, occultist and drug addict.Pessoa came into contact with the notorious Aleister Crowley through theirmutual interest in astrology, and on a visit to Lisbon, during which the GreatBeast quarrelled with his current Scarlet Woman – his magical concubine –Crowley coaxed Pessoa into helping him with his prank.32 Leaving a forlornlover’s note at a treacherous rock formation on the coast west of Lisbon, knownas the Boca do Inferno – the Mouth of Hell – Crowley created the impression thathe had ended it all by leaping into the sea. Pessoa explained to the Lisbonpress the various occult symbols that accompanied the note and even offered thefact that he had seen Crowley’s ghost the day after his disappearance. Inreality, Crowley had left Portugal via Spain, and he enjoyed reading the reportsof his death in the newspapers; among his other addictions, getting his name inthe press was high on the list. Eventually, though, he tired of the ruse and‘miraculously’ appeared at an exhibition of his paintings in Berlin, once againgetting his name in print.33 Pessoa, however, had a still more significant linkto suicide. In 1916, his great friend and collaborator in Lisbon on theavant-garde magazine Orpheu, the writer Mário de Sá Carneiro, author of thenovel Lucio’s Confession, committed suicide in Paris by swallowing five bottlesof strychnine. He was only twenty-five, but like Dowson and others, was addictedto alcohol and opium.Sá Carneiro’s case suggests another category, which unfortunately I do not havethe space to explore here: cities of suicide. Although all big cities have theirshare of suicides, there is something about Paris that gives the idea aromantic, poetic attraction. Along with Paul Celan, de Nerval, Gilles Deleuze,Sadegh Hedayat and others, Sá Carneiro seems to have taken seriously Rilke’sremark about Paris, in The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge: “So this is wherepeople come to live; I would have thought it is a city to die in.”AGENTS OF SUICIDEAnother category of suicides are writers who, while not committing suicidethemselves, led others to it. The case of Goethe and The Sorrows of YoungWerther will be considered at length further on, and in any case, in thatinstance, it was Goethe’s work, not the man himself, who was responsible. Here Iam talking about the writer himself. It may be stretching it to include Freud inthis category, but it’s not unusual today for Freud to be seen as more of aliterary than a scientific or even a medical figure; and the fact that he was,say, compared to Jung, an exceptionally eloquent writer, helps.As books like Paul Roazen’s Freud and his Followers makes clear, the circle ofFreud’s disciples was like a secret society; Freud even handed out rings to hiselect, a sign of the follower’s acceptance into the esoteric clique. The flipside of this honour was Freud’s wrath toward apostates. At the start of thecourtship, the dogmatic and dictatorial Freud would allow new members a certainfreedom of thought; but this was only, as one writer put it, “so that theultimate triumph of the psychoanalytic doctrine would be the more complete.” Ifit became clear to Freud that the newcomer had reservations, however slight andreasonable, about his theories – specifically the sexual basis of neuroses –then “there was a ritual of excommunication,” and the unbeliever was “solemnlyanathematised and placed on a list of ‘prohibited persons’.”34 Jung himself, whoFreud considered the heir to his doctrine, eventually broke with the master, andthe experience was so devastating for Jung that it led to something like apsychotic episode. Jung survived and went on to start his own school ofanalysis; others were not so strong. One of these was Victor Tausk.Tausk was a brilliant individual who basically accepted Freud’s vision; hisproblem was that he was too brilliant, and his independence of mind, even whenstill working within the Freudian framework, troubled Freud. Freud wantedfollowers, but he didn’t want ones capable of thinking for themselves. Freud’sire turned toward Tausk when Tausk came to the defence of the Viennese satiristKarl Kraus, who, wary of Freud’s ideas, made the perceptive remark that,“Psychoanalysis is the disease for which it claims to be the cure.” Kraus alsocriticized Freud’s attempt to reduce the genius of men like Dostoyevsky andLeonardo to manifestations of penis envy. Eventually the true believers foughtback, claiming that Kraus’ own attacks on the tabloid press of the time were anexpression of his penis envy. Tausk would have none of it and simply remarkedthat the shallow Viennese press was worthy of Kraus’ attack. This was enough forFreud, and when Tausk, who was going through some difficult times, asked Freudfor help – specifically to psychoanalyse him – he refused. Freud subjected Tauskto petty humiliations, suggesting that he submit to analysis with one of Freud’sstudents instead, and rebuffed any attempts to regain their former intimacy.Tausk plummeted. Soon after the rejection, he wrote a letter to Freud and one tohis mistress, tied a curtain cord around his neck, and shot himself in the head,strangling himself as he fell back from the blast.Another disciple to receive the Freud treatment was Herbert Silberer “the mostpotentially brilliant and original of Freud’s followers.”35 Silberer madeimportant observations about the strange half-dream state called hypnagogia, andin his book Problems of Mysticism and Its Symbols (1917), he explored therelation between unconscious imagery and alchemy years before Jung did.36Although Silberer held Freud in high esteem, he also found much of value inJung’s work. Silberer politely questioned Freud’s belief that the sexual theoryoffered a complete interpretation of alchemical symbolism, and suggested thatthis could also be seen ‘anagogically’, as an expression of a religious ormystical impulse, as ‘instinctive’ as the sexual one. He believed that his basicadmiration for Freud would compensate for any differences of opinion. Freuddisagreed, and cast the heretic into the outer darkness. When Silberer,increasingly puzzled by Freud’s rejection, offered to call on him, Freud wroteback: “As the result of the observations and impressions of recent years I nolonger desire personal contact with you.” Silberer was shattered. A few yearslater, unable to throw off a sense of worthlessness, he hung himself from thewindow bars in his home. There must have been a touch of the morbid in Silberer.When he hung himself, he arranged a light so that when his wife came home thefirst thing she saw would be him.Another writer surrounded by suicides is the Russian decadent Valery Briusov,author of the remarkable occult novel The Fiery Angel, the basis of Prokofiev’sopera of the same name. Briusov was the magus of Russian Symbolism; as novelist,poet, editor and critic, in the early twentieth century, he was a supremelyimportant figure in the literary cliques of St. Petersburg and Moscow. LikeParis and London, pre-revolutionary Russia was caught up in a obsession with theoccult. Satanism and diabolism in particular fascinated the Russian avant-garde,and one expression of this were the several ‘suicide clubs’ that sprang up amongthe intelligentsia. Briusov dominated the scene and gathered a coterie offollowers. Highly disciplined and cautious, Briusov was attracted to wilder,more ecstatic types, one of whom, the precocious poet Alexander Dobrolyubov, wasthrown out of high school at seventeen for preaching suicide to young femalestudents, apparently with some success.Another character who attracted Briusov was the novelist Andrei Bely, author ofthe modernist occult novel Petersburg. Bely, a highly labile and poeticcharacter, was an infant terrible of Russian Symbolism. At first attracted toeach other, Briusov and Bely soon developed a feud. Bely believed Briusov wastrying to hypnotize him, and an occult war sprang up between them. This becamethe basis of Briusov’s The Fiery Angel. At the centre of the novel was theerotic triangle between Briusov, Bely, and the poetess Nina Petrovskaya.37Nina loved Bely, but he spurned her for the wife of the poet Aleksandr Blok. Sheturned to Briusov for help; Briusov had a reputation as a magician and she hopedhe could cast a spell to win Bely’s affection. When this failed she becameBriusov’s lover, plunging into a seven year long sadomasochistic relationship,involving drugs, madness and suicide pacts. But after using Nina as a model forhis novel, Briusov lost interest in her and dropped her. Crushed, she leftMoscow and later committed suicide in Paris, joining the ranks of Sá Carneiro,Paul Celan and others. Another poet Briusov got involved with after Nina alsocommitted suicide was Nadechda Lvova. According to the poet V.F. Khodasevic,Briusov encouraged Nadechda’s suicidal feelings, and presented her with a pistolthat Nina had once turned on Briusov himself. When Briusov ended their affair,she shot herself with it. Still another poet, the twenty-one year old VictorGofman, was advised by Briusov to kill himself as well; he, too, apparently tookthe master up on this suggestion.One last possible agent of suicide. At the time of writing, BBC 4 presented aremarkable documentary about the ‘anthropologist’ and drug-guru CarlosCastaneda. Much of it was familiar to me; having written about Castaneda in myTurn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius,I was aware that most likely Castaneda had pretty much invented the whole of hisadventures with the Yaqui brujo Don Juan, depicted in a series of bestsellingbooks. What I didn’t know was that in the last years of his life, Castaneda hadgathered a group of female followers with whom he apparently shared an esotericteaching concerning a kind of cosmic resurrection after death, something alongthe lines of the Heaven’s Gate cult.38 Castaneda himself died of liver cancer in1998, a shock to many of his followers who had accepted his own teaching that hewould not die, but ‘ascend’ to some higher sphere. His death was kept secret forsome time and was, as they say, shrouded in mystery. His body was cremated, and,according to Amy Wallace, author of a memoir of her time as one of Castaneda’sdisciples, lovers and wives (he had several simultaneously), burning was a meansof releasing the spirit into a higher form.39 Shortly after Castaneda’s death,at least three of the women in his intimate group, known as ‘the Witches’,disappeared. Florinda Donner-Grau, author of bestselling books based onCastaneda’s work, Taisha Abelar, and Patricia Partin, seemed to have simplyvanished, and were never heard from again. In 2003, the wreck of a car was foundin Death Valley, California, and had evidently been involved in a fire. DNAtesting on human remains found in the wreck showed them to be those of PatriciaPartin. Partin had a particular relation to Castaneda, as she was both hisadopted daughter and his lover. To date the other women have yet to surface, andthe assumption among some is that they may have taken the teachings of DonCarlos to a perhaps fatal extreme.AGAINST SUICIDE?These, then, are some of the many types of literary suicide that deservemention, but that fall outside of the main categories with which the rest ofthis book will be concerned. Needless to say, however, not all writers and poetsare attracted to suicide. As several of the selections in the SuicidalMiscellany show, there were those who argued against it, those who made light ofit, and those who, at first finding it attractive, were later purged of theidea. There is the question too of how sincere were the many writers who,writing darkly of the desirability of ending one’s life, did not, in actualpractice, end their own. In his novel Manalive, G.K. Chesterton, whose “Balladeof Suicide” starts off the Miscellany, offers a sure-fire (no pun intended) testto determine one’s seriousness about the value of life. The only way to prove ifsomeone who claims life isn’t worth living is serious, Chesterton argues, is topoint a loaded pistol at his head and propose to pull the trigger. If he remainsunmoved, then his nihilism is sincere, and you would probably be doing him afavour if you carried on. If he flinches, then it’s just a pose. Althoughposeurs are not hard to come by – and most of us have been one in our time –most of this book is concerned with those for whom, more or less, the questionof suicide was deadly serious.To end this introduction, let me add a personal note. In writing about suicide,more often than not, most writers devote some time to their own attitude towardit and describe, if such is the case, their own encounters with it. Like manypeople – writers or not – I have passed through difficult times, patches andeven long stretches of my life when I was subject to much hardship andpsychological and emotional suffering. But I have never attempted suicide, nordid I ever seriously consider it as an option, although the idea of ceasing theharangue of thoughts and anxieties that accompanies bad times at a single blowcan be tempting. Why this is so probably depends on several factors, not theleast of which is a recognition that, however bad my situation was, killingmyself was certainly a shabby way of dealing with it. A sense of fastidiousnessthen, an awareness of the mess and complications and difficulties I would leavebehind, ruled suicide out. I was also too aware of that piercing yet sadlyuseless consciousness, shared by Anna Karenina, Emma Bovary and others, thatkilling themselves was, in the end, a really bad idea and that in the face ofthat finality, life, as difficult as it is, is infinitely preferable. In morerecent years, which have not been without their troubles, the fact that I am afather and that two young boys would, I think its safe to say, be severely upsetat my absence, make it a definite non-issue. To avoid a long, slow, painfuldeath through an incurable illness, to say farewell when it is still possible,before old age incapacitates one’s lucidity and grasp on life: I can appreciatethese circumstances and understand ending one’s life in these cases, althoughhow I will feel and react if I find myself in these situations remains to beseen. Everything else, however, strikes me as selfish and, realizing fully thatmost people bent on suicide will not be stayed by this, irresponsible, evenegotistical. It is, I think, in some ways a kind of supreme egotism: the notionthat my death will matter to the universe.I will add one more thing. Reading these accounts of tragic and lost lives, itstrikes me that it is never the major philosophical or religious arguments thatconvince people not to kill themselves – although in some cases, metaphysicsdoes seem to have succeeded in prompting the opposite. What changes people’sminds are the little things: Goethe’s Easter bells, Chesterton’s “little cloudall pink and grey,” the glass of wine that Hesse’s suicidal Steppenwolf drinks,avoiding the razor back at home. Like Graham Greene’s experience of RussianRoulette, these things somehow trigger a sense of life’s “infinitepossibilities,” the awareness of which makes suicide seem an absurd blunder. Whythese everyday items, which we normally take for granted, can at times release amystical sense of the absolute value of life, remains a mystery. Perhaps when wesolve it, most reasons for suicide may become a thing of the past.Notes 1 Unfortunately, space does not allow me to discuss the tragic deaths of allof these individuals.

Greene’s attemptsto shock himself out of a spiritual lethargy are an example of “livingdangerously,” an ideal which Colin Wilson associates with many of his Outsiders.Wilson argues that there is a kind of “indifference threshold” in humanconsciousness. “There is, “he writes, “a certain margin of boredom orindifference when the human mind ceases to be stimulated by pleasure, but canstill be stimulated by pain or discomfort.” (Encyclopedia of Murder with PatPitman [Arthur Baker: London, 1961] p.22) Greene (and Coleridge), who could seebut not feel beauty, had reached this threshold, and the prospect of blowing hisbrains out, and then discovering he hadn’t, for a brief time galvanised hisconsciousness. In her account of Greene’s experience, however, Kay RedfieldJamison fails to mention that his motive in playing Russian Roulette was toachieve a feeling of greater life, not to end his own. This is one of the problems with Jamison’s book, which, as a study ofmanic-depression among writers and artists, is excellent, as far as it goes. Butbeing a clinical psychologist, Jamison tends to see everything in terms ofeither mania or depression. One example she gives of ‘manic’ behaviour is Poe’sshort story “The Man of the Crowd.” She quotes Poe’s narrator remarking how,convalescing after months of illness, he finds himself in a London coffee house“in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui –moods of keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs … andthe intellect, electrified, surpasses … its everyday condition.” For Jamisonthis is an expression or confession of Poe’s manic states, but it is clear thatPoe is simply speaking of the poetic condition itself, the kind of clarity andacute sensual and psychic appreciation which reveals to the poet the poeticobject. Psychologically speaking, Poe’s narrator is having what the psychologistAbraham Maslow called a ‘peak experience’. This isn’t ‘manic’ at all, and issomething, Maslow argued, experienced by most healthy people. This kind of‘peak’ is shared by many of the depressives Jamison writes about, people likeColeridge, William James and others. But she fails to recognize it as such, anderroneously speaks of it as an indication of a pathology.20 Charles Nicholl “The Wind Comes Up Out of Nowhere,” London Review of Booksvol. 28 no. 59 March 2006.21 Andrew Hussey The Game of War: The Life and Death of Guy Debord (Pimlico:London, 2002) p. 2.22 Again, for more on Lowry, see The Dedalus Book of the Occult: A Dark Muse.23 Quoted in Alex Kershaw Jack London: A Life (Flamingo: London, 1997) pp. 5–6.24 Ibid. p. 153.25 Ibid. p. 25.26 Martin Booth Cannabis (Bantam Books: London, 2004) p. 155.27 Another possible category is the strictly literary suicide.

Legendsays that Empedocles, one of the earliest Greek philosophers, killed himself bysecretly jumping into Mt. Etna in Sicily; his idea was that the volcano woulddestroy his corpse and people would think he had been transformed into animmortal god and had been raised to the heavens. This ruse was uncovered,however, when Etna, not agreeing with Empedocles’ plans, threw up his goldensandal. Most historians discount the legend – there’s good reason to thinkEmpedocles died somewhere in Greece – but if it’s true, then along with the lessrenowned Proteus Peregrinus, mentioned in the introduction, Empedocles belongsto the group of fame suicides, who used the act of taking their life as a meansof promoting their celebrity. How successful Empedocles was at this can bejudged by Matthew Arnold’s account of his death, found in the SuicidalMiscellany.Zeno, founder of the Stoics, who counselled suicide in some cases, is said tohave hung himself at 98 when he stubbed his toe on a turtle. The Roman poet andphilosopher Lucretius, author of On The Nature of Things, is said to havecommitted suicide after being driven mad by a love potion, but few historiansgive much credence to this idea today. Another ancient philosopher associatedwith suicide – although his death, I think, really doesn’t count as one – is theone philosopher most people have heard of: Socrates. Rather than cease frompestering the Athenians with his incessant questioning, or go into self-exile,Socrates preferred to drink hemlock. Given that he could have avoided death byleaving Athens, which his followers suggested he do, and that Socrates wouldmore than likely not have poisoned himself unless compelled to, I can’t counthis death as a true suicide. In this, Socrates is in some esteemed company. Theother famous death upon which Western culture is based, that of Jesus, is, likeSocrates, one that was consciously chosen; but although many would disagree, itwas a death that could have been avoided. Judas Iscariot, the apostle whobetrayed Christ and so was instrumental in his arrest and crucifixion, famouslyhung himself when he realized what he had done; yet there is some doubt aboutthis as well, and in some apocryphal accounts, Judas doesn’t kill himself, butis stoned to death by the other apostles.Another example of self-killing from the classical period that, for me, fallsoutside of suicide is the writer and debauchee Petronius, whose Satyricon givesus the word satirist. During Nero’s reign, Petronius, known for his profligatelife, fell foul of Nero’s minister and favourite Tigellinus, and was compelledto commit suicide. He did so by slitting his wrists and letting them bleed, thenbinding them, then opening them again, and so on. During this slow process ofbleeding to death, he dined luxuriously and talked among his friends. Petroniusenjoyed some poetic posthumous revenge when, under the reign of the emperorOtho, who found him despicable, Tigellinus was forced to cut his throat.The Romans seem a people for whom suicide was something of a matter of course,and some of the greatest names in Roman letters, like Seneca, Cato, Lucan andTacitus, either wrote of it or, in the case of Seneca and Cato, did actuallykill themselves. Seneca, like Petronius, also got on Nero’s bad side, and wasordered to take his life. He slit his wrists, but his arteries were clogged, andthe blood came slowly and with much pain. He then procured some poison, but thisdidn’t work either. Eventually, he took a hot bath, hoping the heat would thinhis blood; in his Annals of Imperial Rome, Tacitus records that Seneca died ofsuffocation from the steam. Following the defeat of Metellus Scipio, with whomhe sided against Caesar in the civil wars, Cato, refusing to live under thedictator, chose to kill himself with his sword. Plutarch recounts that becauseof an injured hand, Cato’s attempt was unsuccessful. His servants found him, andcalled for a physician, who bandaged his wound. Cato waited until they left,tore open the bandage and apparently ripped out his intestines to finish thejob.Most early philosophical discussion of suicide centred around ideas of when itwas justified; an example of this, from Epictetus, can be found in the SuicidalMiscellany. Later thought questioned the prevailing Christian idea that it was asin; David Hume, for example, who can also be found in the Miscellany, arguedagainst this. Some philosophers, like Arthur Schopenhauer (also in theMiscellany) argued, at different times, for and against suicide, and some, likethe mathematician Alan Turing – considered the father of computer science – andthe physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, best known for his work on the statisticalinterpretation of the second law of thermodynamics, did kill themselves.Depressed over his arrest and subsequent persecution for his homosexuality, in1954, Turing is thought to have eaten an apple laced with cyanide. Boltzmannsuffered from severe bouts of manic-depression, and, in low spirits overcriticism of his theory of atomic structure, he hung himself while on holidaywith his family in the Bay of Duino, near Trieste. Although the second law ofthermodynamics may seem a rather specialized concern, Boltzmann’s insights intothe ‘increase of entropy’ (disorder) in a closed system, is linked to ideasabout the eventual ‘heat-death’ of the universe that troubled Victorian thinkerslike Arnold, Tennyson and Carlyle.One philosopher who put the theory and practice of suicide together in adramatic way was the little known German thinker, Philipp Mainländer, adisciple, like Boltzmann, of Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer’s grim view of life,spelled out in detail in his single masterwork, The World as Will andRepresentation, can be summed up in this quotation. “We can regard our life,”Schopenhauer tells us, “as a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful reposeof nothingness. Human existence must be a kind of error: it is bad today andeveryday it will get worse, until the worst of all happens.” That Boltzmann’scalculations led to the conclusion that eventually, the organised energy in theuniverse – collected in planets, stars, galaxies and so on – would level outinto a kind of lukewarm cosmic soup, suggest a kind of scientific proof ofSchopenhauer’s ‘blissful repose of nothingness’. But although it’s unclear howmuch, if at all, his philosophical beliefs motivated Boltzmann’s suicide,Mainländer’s was clearly prompted by a metaphysical pessimism that outdid evenhis master’s.Mainländer’s central insight, which eventually led to his death, was that theuniverse itself is a result of God’s suicide. As Jorge Luis Borges, in his essayBianthanatos, which is a reading of Thomas De Quincey’s abridgement of JohnDonne’s treatise arguing that Christ’s death was a suicide, remarks ofMainländer, “he imagined that we are fragments of a God who, at the beginning oftime, destroyed himself, avid for non-being.” “Universal history,” Borgescontinues, “is the shadowy death throes of those fragments.”1 Borges rightlysuggests that Mainländer’s view is very reminiscent of that of the Gnostics, whobelieved this world was the creation of an evil demiurge, and that it was bestto escape from it as soon as possible. This was a sentiment favoured byAristotle as well; in his Poetics he suggests that it is best not to have beenborn, and second best to die young. Some later Gnostic sects, like the Cathars,sometimes helped the ill and aged among them to escape the demiurge bysuffocating them. It is unclear what, if anything, Mainländer knew about theGnostics, but he might have pointed out to them that, as he writes in his workThe Philosophy of Redemption, “Our world is the means and the only means ofachieving non-existence.”2Mainländer, whose real surname was Batz, was born in the small German town ofOffenbach am Main in 1841. Although early on he showed an interest in literatureand poetry, in order to please his father he studied commerce at Dresden. Aftera period in Italy, he returned to Germany, where he helped in his father’sbusiness. Then, in 1860, the single most important encounter of his life tookplace: he came across Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation;ironically, it was the year Schopenhauer died. The effect of Schopenhauer’s workon Mainländer was similar to that on another one-time disciple, Nietzsche.Mainländer, as Nietzsche (and Boltzmann) would be later on, was stunned bySchopenhauer’s pessimistic vision. Schopenhauer, whose thought is in many waysvery similar to Buddhism, argued that the world was the result of a blind,compelling will, that forced human beings to live. All wills are in conflict andno sooner is a will satisfied than it is bored with its satisfaction and is onceagain driven by an unappeasable hunger. Like the Buddha, Schopenhauer arguedthat the higher life is achieved through cessation of the will and abstentionfrom its desires, hence lessening suffering. Ironically, Schopenhauer, whopreached a profound world-rejection, lived a rather comfortable life, andaugmented his ‘nay-saying’ with many civilized pleasures; Nietzsche, hisone-time disciple, who later created a ‘pro-life’ philosophy of ‘yea-saying’(Mainländer in fact was one of his targets) had a miserable life, full ofillness, loneliness and poverty.Schopenhauer argued that by withdrawing from the will’s compulsion one couldattain a degree of freedom and a measure of ‘blissful repose’. He also arguedthat life itself was a very big mistake, and that suicide was neither a crimenor a sin. But he didn’t actively advocate killing oneself: suicide, hebelieved, was merely one more manifestation of the will, rather than a validretreat from it. Mainländer, however, went further. Not only is suicide neithera crime nor a sin, it’s the clearest act of devotion to God.Mainländer argued that immortality – which Christians believe they willparticipate in after their death – is unbearable and agonizing, even for God.But being eternal by nature, God cannot avoid it. The only way for God toachieve the release – or ‘redemption’, as Mainländer puts it – of non-being, isby transforming himself into our world of time, space and matter, “which isconstantly progressing from a transient existence into a permanent oblivion anddeath.”3 This, I may add, is precisely the condition that Boltzmann foresaw asthe outcome of his ‘increased entropy’, a lecture about which, we remember, thepseudo-suicide Arthur Cravan treated his Parisian audience to, in lieu ofkilling himself.As one commentator suggests, according to Mainländer’s view, the Big Bang isbasically the result of God blowing his brains out. “Everything in theuniverse,” Mainländer tells us, “is directed toward non-existence.” Mainländerargued that eventually, human beings will realize that non-existence ispreferable to existence, and act accordingly. i.e. commit suicide, which, forhim, is an “act of redemption.”Mainländer’s own act of redemption took place in his thirty-fifth year. Theremay have been a suicidal strain in the family; three of his siblings would alsokill themselves, although it is doubtful they were led to it via metaphysics.Mainländer had for some time deferred to his father’s wishes and worked at abank. He hoped to save enough of a nest egg so that he could devote himself tophilosophy and poetry. The stock market crash of 1873, however, ruined him, andMainländer was left adrift. He seemed to have a craving for ‘submission andobedience’ which led to him taking on menial work; it also led to him enteringthe military. But although he had signed up for a three year term, he wasreleased early; it is unclear why. Prior to his service, Mainländer threwhimself into writing The Philosophy of Redemption. When he finished, he gave themanuscript to his sister, charging her with the task of finding a publisher. Hisonly request was that his surname, Batz, did not appear, and that he instead beknown as Philipp Mainländer. His motivation for this seems to be a combinationof love for his hometown, and a reluctance to “being exposed to the eyes of theworld.” Mainländer’s mind then became unbalanced and he grew obsessed with hiswork, producing, in a short time, his memoirs, a novella, and a second volume ofhis magnum opus. He developed a kind of megalomania, declaring himself “themessiah of social democracy,” and advocating celibacy as a means of avoiding theprolongation of life. The exact trigger of his suicide is unclear, but on 1April 1876, the day after The Philosophy of Redemption was published, Mainländerredeemed himself by hanging himself, apparently by stepping off a stack ofreview copies of his work.Although philosophers like Schopenhauer, and more extremely, Mainländer, gavereasons and arguments in favour of suicide, a later group of thinkers werefocused on the question why, given the world was meaningless, more people didn’tkill themselves. Inheriting a world that had already become inured to the ideaof ‘the death of God’, the gradual rundown of the cosmos, and our own descentfrom the hairy ape, and to which the ideology of ‘progress’ no longer seemed toapply – a world in which human existence seemed pointless and accidental –beginning in the late nineteenth century, writers and thinkers began to chartthe effect of this loss of belief on human consciousness. Nihilism, the belief,literally, in nothing, took hold of western consciousness and led those who weresensitive to it to an abyss. Unlike anarchists, with whom they are oftenconfused, nihilists were not necessarily prompted to action by their belief.According to the historian Jacques Barzun, “The genuine kind believe in nothingand do nothing about it.”4 Although the pointlessness of life seemed apparent tothem, most nihilists also recognized the pointlessness of killing themselves andavoided making the effort. Nietzsche, who considered himself an anti-nihilist,agreed with them that the universe is meaningless, but disagreed with them inbelieving that one’s own life needn’t be. Yet suicide was not far from his mindtoo. “The thought of suicide,” he wrote in Beyond Good and Evil, “is a powerfulsolace: by means of it one gets through many a bad night.”5 And in Thus SpakeZarathustra he counsels us to, “Die at the right time.”6 Sadly, this is onecounsel Nietzsche himself did not follow. Having gone insane in 1889, mostprobably from syphilis, he remained in a state of mental and physical paralysisuntil his death in 1900; during that time he was under the care of hisantisemitic, pro-nationalist sister Elizabeth, who forged his work, and oftendressed him in a toga to impress important visitors.7Nietzsche and another 19th century thinker, S#toren Kierkegaard, are creditedwith starting the school of philosophy known as existentialism, the most famousexponent of which was Jean Paul Sartre, whose Being and Nothingness is a massiveelaboration on Hamlet’s suicidal query “To be or not to be.” Existentialism isconcerned with questions about the meaning of life and the significance of one’sactions, considerations that it believed had been lost in the abstract academicapproach to philosophy, still dominant today. Kierkegaard thought that in the‘present age’, life had become so abstract that even suicide was affected. “Noteven a suicide does away with himself out of desperation,” he wrote, “heconsiders the act so long and so deliberately, that he kills himself withthinking – one could barely call it suicide since it is thinking which takes hislife. He does not kill himself with deliberation but rather kills himselfbecause of deliberation.”8 But the existentialist writer and thinker with whomthe philosophical question of suicide is most often associated is Albert Camus.Camus is best known for his novels The Stranger and The Plague, but he firstmade a name for himself with his long philosophical essay, The Myth of Sisyphus,which asks the simple question, “Is life worth living?” “There is but one trulyserious philosophical problem,” Camus writes, “and that is suicide. Judgingwhether or not life is worth living amounts to answering the fundamentalquestion of philosophy.”9 Camus himself didn’t commit suicide, although hisdeath in a road accident in 1960 at the age of forty-six seemed, as one writerthought, to make sense.10 Another writer agreed. In his account of his owndepression and near suicide, Darkness Visible, William Styron remarks apropos ofCamus’ death that “there was an element of recklessness in the accident thatbore overtones of the near-suicidal, at least of death flirtation […]”11 Styronalso remarks that his and Camus’s friend, the novelist Romain Gary, who latercommitted suicide following the suicide of his ex-wife, the actress Jean Seberg,had told him that Camus had often spoken of suicide, if in a darkly comicalway.12 Styron, understandably focused on his own harrowing experience ofdepression, wonders if Camus’ philosophical preoccupation with suicide “mighthave sprung at least as strongly from some persistent disturbance of mood asfrom his concerns with ethics and epistemology,”13 an expression of the‘pathologizing’ of metaphysics I talk about in the introduction.The Myth of Sisyphus is concerned with why we should not kill ourselves, givenwe live pointless lives in a meaningless universe, a universe that Camus calls‘absurd’. In such a universe, there is no reason why we should do anything,including live. Earlier God had given a direction and meaning to existence, butsince God’s ‘death’ – not by his own hand a la Mainländer, but chiefly throughthe increase in scientific knowledge – that direction and meaning has vanished,and we are left facing a vast, empty space that is oblivious to our presence. Asthe existentialists pointed out in various ways, there is nothing necessaryabout us being here; there is, in fact, no reason why anything should exist atall. This, more or less, has been the dominant view ever since.14Camus ranges through a gallery of existential thought, encountering andrejecting the work of figures like Karl Jaspers, Edmund Husserl, Lev Shestov andothers, and the essay rambles on much more than I recall from my first readingas a teenager many years ago. Suicide is the hook on which Camus hangs histhought, but his central preoccupation is with delineating what he calls ‘theabsurd’, a theme he shares with Sartre, who spoke of the experience of ‘theabsurd’ as ‘nausea’. In a oft-quoted passage, Camus writes of that “odd state ofthe soul in which the void becomes eloquent, in which the chain of dailygestures is broken, in which the heart vainly seeks the link that will connectit again,” and in which he detects “the first sign of absurdity.” “Rising, tram,four hours in the office or factory, meal, tram, four hours of work, meal, sleepand Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, according to thesame rhythm […] But one day the ‘why’ arises and everything begins in thatweariness tinged with amazement.”15 Faced with the inability to answer that‘why’, we are, Camus tells us, confronted with the ‘absurd’, and with theinescapable meaninglessness of our lives. To be sure, we are fenced in by avariety of immediate ‘meanings’: we work in order to feed ourselves, to supportour families, to go on living. “You continue making the gestures commanded byexistence for many reasons, the first of which is habit.”16 But, he continues,sometimes the habit falls away and we are left asking why we go on living, andthen we are adrift.Another writer, one we wouldn’t usually associate with Camus, asked a similarquestion some years earlier. In his Experiment in Autobiography, H.G. Wells hitthe existential note a decade before Camus when he wrote that, “What was oncethe whole of life, has become to an increasing extent, merely the background oflife. People can ask now what would have been an extraordinary question fivehundred years ago. They can say, ‘Yes, you earn a living, you support a family,you love and hate, but – what do you do?’ ”17 Surprisingly, Wells, who hadhitherto looked to science as the great emancipator and agent of human progress,took a darkly existential view in his last book, Mind at the End of Its Tether,in which he announced that “the end of everything we call life is close at hand”and that “everything was driving anyhow to anywhere at a steadily increasingvelocity …”18Camus calls on the figure of Sisyphus from Greek mythology to symbolize hisanswer to the question of suicide. Although Sisyphus is doomed to a pointless,repetitive act – rolling a boulder up a mountain, only to have it roll downagain, “futile and hopeless labour,” his own version of the workaday week – wemust, Camus tells us, “imagine Sisyphus happy.”19 If anyone should have cause toembrace suicide as a means of escaping an ‘absurd’ existence, Sisyphus does. Yethe is “happy.” We, then, Camus suggests, should be too. Yet how can Sisyphus behappy?Although Camus rejects any religious or metaphysical ban on suicide and wants tolive life “without appeal” to anything beyond it, and although he faces the‘absurd’ squarely without flinching, he rejects suicide. For Camus, “killingyourself amounts to confessing.” “It is confessing that life is too much for youor that you do not understand it … It is merely confessing that that ‘is notworth the trouble’.”20 Yet it is not only this. “Dying voluntarily implies thatyou have recognized, even instinctively, the ridiculous character of that habit[life], the absence of any profound reason for living, the insane character ofthat daily agitation and the uselessness of suffering.”21 So in an absurduniverse, suicide is an expression of man’s freedom, perhaps his only one. Wecan, as Ivan Karamazov would like to in Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov,return to God the entrance ticket to this absurd universe, and not subjectourselves to its cruelties and pointlessness. Yet, for Camus, this would somehowbe beneath the dignity of the ‘absurd hero’. “There is no fate,” he tells us,“that cannot be surmounted by scorn,”22 a sentiment reminiscent of ErnestHemingway’s dictum that “a man can be destroyed but not defeated.” Hemingway,too, was a writer with an interest in the question of suicide, a question whichhe eventually answered by blowing his brains out, although there is good reasonto believe that the electro-shock therapy Hemingway received as treatment forhis depression, and which left his memory and his ability to write in ruins, waswhat finally sent him over the edge.Although the world is absurd, our lives contingent, and the future withoutreprieve, and although Sisyphus, “the proletarian of the gods […] knows thewhole extent of his wretched condition,”23 yet he can rise above it, be greaterthan it by not giving in to the impulse to give back the entrance ticket andsink into non-existence. Existence, for all its absurdity, is preferable to itsopposite. In the face of it, Camus tells us, “the absurd man says yes.”Dostoyevsky, who Camus refers to frequently, and whose novel, The Possessed, headapted into a play, was another writer obsessed with questions of life ordeath. Camus and Sartre had both put their lives in danger while being membersof the resistance during the Nazi occupation of France. But Dostoyevsky had amore intimate encounter with his possible immediate death. Arrested forsubversive activities, Dostoyevsky was facing a firing squad in the St.Petersburg’s Semyonovsky Square when a last minute reprieve was issued; theexperience was so shattering that one of his fellow prisoners went insane. Thisnear miss produced in Dostoyevsky a mystical appreciation of the absolute valueof life, a vision of its “infinite possibilities” (Graham Greene) that returnedin the visionary states preceding his epileptic attacks. Possibly the mostconcise expression of this insight occurs in Crime and Punishment, whenRaskolnikov contemplates that:… someone condemned to death says, or thinks an hour before his death, that ifhe had to live on a high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he’d only have roomto stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlastingtempest around him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space allhis life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than die atonce.24Dostoyevsky is full of these strange visions of meaning. In The BrothersKaramazov he tells the story of an atheist who disbelieved in life after death;when he dies, God, as a penance for his disbelief, sentences him to walk amillion miles before he can enter heaven. The atheist refuses, and for a millionyears he doesn’t take a step. More time passes and he still doesn’t move.Finally, he gives in, and grudgingly does his penance. When he is allowed toenter heaven after walking his million miles, he immediately declares that apenance ten times as great would be nothing compared to five minutes in heaven.Yet there is also the counter image. Again in Crime and Punishment there is thecriminal Svidrigalov, who sees eternity as the corner of a small dusty room,full of cobwebs and spiders. Like several of Dostoyevsky’s characters,Svidrigalov kills himself.The novel that more or less has suicide as the main theme is The Possessed; init two of the central characters kill themselves, and there are also somemurders. Dostoyevsky wrote for a popular audience, and books like Crime andPunishment, The Possessed and The Brothers Karamazov are in many ways‘thrillers’. (We can say this of practically all the fiction written byexistentialists; given that they deal with ‘life at the edge’, they tend toevoke a ‘noir’ atmosphere; the anti-hero of Camus’ The Stranger, for example, isarrested for shooting an Arab.) Yet in focusing on crime, murder, suicide, andother dark aspects of human existence like incest, paedophilia, and madness,Dostoyevsky can throw a spotlight on the extremities of human life, and throughthis arrive at a deeper insight into its meaning.The plot of the novel centres around the activities of the radical PyotrVerkovensky, who is based on the real-life anarchist Sergei Netchaev. A ruthlessfanatic, who combined political idealism with the mind of a thug, Netchaev isbelieved to have been involved in the plot to assassinate Alexander II whileimprisoned in the Peter and Paul fortress; when asked by his followers whetherthey should rescue him or focus on killing the Tsar, he replied unhesitatinglythat they should kill the Tsar. Alexander II was removed, and Netchaev remainedin prison, where he died of scurvy. The plot of The Possessed is based on anincident in Netchaev’s career. Posing as a representative of the ‘EuropeanRevolutionary Alliance’, Netchaev brought together small groups of studentradicals into what he called “revolutionary committees”, which he planned to useto unleash a wave of killings. When one student thought better of this, theothers suspected that he would betray them. Netchaev arranged for him to bemurdered. One of his followers had conveniently planned to commit suicide, andNetchaev intended to have him write a suicide note, confessing to the killingand to various other crimes committed by the ‘revolutionary committees’. In thenovel, this student is the ‘suicide maniac’ Kirilov. But whileNetchaev/Verkovensky provides the action – there are several murders and a townis set on fire – the real heart of The Possessed is the existential drama ofKirilov, and his fellow suicide, Stavrogin.Although Kirilov and Stavrogin both commit suicide, they do so for verydifferent reasons. As Camus suggests, suicide can be seen as an act of humanfreedom. This is how Kirilov sees it. And in a godless world, such an act is theparamount expression of the fact that Kirilov himself is God – or at least thatthere is no will greater than his own. Kirilov cannot believe in the OldTestament God, because he cannot conceive of anything more real than his owninner world, his subjectivity, his will. And to prove this, he decides to killhimself. Suicide is the one, ultimate irreversible act by which he can asserthis absolute freedom. The logic isn’t easy to follow, and as one of the fewlikable characters in Dostoyevsky (most often they’re rather unpleasantindividuals, like the anti-hero of Notes From Underground), one wants him tofind some other way to show his freedom. But this willingness to give up hislife at any time in order to express his freedom, creates in Kirilov a profounddetachment from life’s pettiness and pointlessness. Like Graham Greene, he isaware of life’s “infinite possibilities;” and like Greene, by “risking the totalloss” of the world, Kirilov becomes almost painfully aware of its beauty. Hespeaks of seeing a leaf, and its sheer ‘is-ness’ produces in him the recognitionthat “all is good.” (Again, this is another example of Dostoyevsky’s ‘visions ofmeaning’, and the reader is referred to the selection from The Possessed in theSuicidal Miscellany.) As he is about to be shot, Graham Greene’s ‘whisky priest’in The Power and the Glory understands that it would be “easy to be a saint.”Kirilov knows this too. Verkovensky and his plans are irrelevant. Kirilov’sdisplay of will is essential, and one has the impression that if Kirilov doesn’tkill himself now, the idea will haunt him, and that eventually, he will do it.But if Kirilov kills himself in order to express his freedom, Stavrogin does sobecause of too much freedom. Again, like the teenaged Graham Greene, Stavroginhas reached a state of spiritual emptiness, the accidie that attacked manyChristian mystics, “a paralysis of the will, a failure of the appetite, acondition of generalized boredom, total disenchantment.”25 Like Hamlet, forStavrogin, the world has become “weary, stale, flat and unprofitable.” But iffor Hamlet, the Everlasting has “fix’d his canon against self-slaughter,”Stavrogin knows no such hesitation. He will kill himself, eventually. But to getto that point, he will have to make a few detours.Throughout the novel, Stavrogin engages in what appear to be rather strange,pointless acts, as if he had been possessed by Poe’s ‘imp of the perverse’. At avery proper social event, he kisses someone else’s wife. He pulls a retiredgeneral’s nose, bites the ear of an old man, and lets himself be slapped in theface without hitting back. He’s involved in a duel and lets his opponent firefirst; when its his turn he merely shoots in the air. He admits that animbecilic peasant woman is his wife, when practically every desirable woman inthe book would be happy to sleep with him. Yet this is only the surface of hisunaccountable behaviour, and in the ‘confession’ that was left out of earlyeditions of the book, he relates a series of acts that the writer Merezhkovskyregarded as “the concentrated essence of horror.” “Stavrogin’s Confession”(originaly published by Virginia Woolf’s Hogarth Press; Woolf, of course, wasanother suicide) recounts how Stavrogin shifts from these odd but harmlessgestures, to acts of sheer evil. He steals money he doesn’t need from a poorfamily, when he knows they will be devastated. He lets the young daughter of hislandlady be punished for stealing his penknife, when he knows it has only beenmisplaced. He later rapes the girl and, although he could stop her, allows herto kill herself when she realizes what has happened. Through all this, Stavroginremains impassive; he feels nothing, and his whole array of crimes is an attemptto shock himself into some sense of reality. They fail. His ‘freedom’ offers noresistance, he encounters no barriers, and he may just as well do good as doevil: the result is the same. Where Kirilov embraces suicide as an act offreedom in a world brimming with ‘meaning’ (“Everything’s good”), Stavroginfinally kills himself because he is weary of not existing.One writer who seems to have combined Kirilov and Stavrogin in one character isthe German novelist and Nobel Prize winner Hermann Hesse. Harry Haller, themiddle-aged existential hero of Hesse’s Steppenwolf, is another suicide. At thebeginning of Harry’s journal, which makes up the bulk of the novel, Hallerreflects that his life has become full of “the moderately pleasant, the whollybearable and tolerable, luke-warm days of a discontented middle-aged man; dayswithout special pains, without special cares, without particular worry, withoutdespair; days on which the question whether the time has not come to follow theexample of Adalbert Stifter and have a fatal accident while shaving should beconsidered […]”26 (Adalbert Stifter was a 19th century German writer who slithis throat with a razor.) Although Haller admits “there is much to be said forcontentment,” after a short time it fills him with “irrepressible loathing andnausea”27 and he finds he must throw himself on the road to pleasure, or if thatfails, to pain. “A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes inme, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life. I have a madimpulse to smash something, a warehouse perhaps, or a cathedral, or myself, tocommit outrages, to pull off the wigs of a few revered idols […]” even, asStavrogin did, “to seduce a little girl.”28Like Stavrogin, Haller too suffers from a sense of unreality which he cannotbear, and which he tries to relieve by drastic measures (although he is toodecent to commit the crimes Stavrogin does) and he decides that on his fiftiethbirthday, which is approaching, he will allow himself to give back the entranceticket, and commit suicide. Yet, like Kirilov, Haller too has his moments when“Everything is good.” Sitting in a tavern, resting from an evening walk in whichhe bemoaned the cheapness and emptiness of the modern age (“I cannot understandwhat pleasures and joys they are that drive people to the overcrowded railwaysand hotels, into the packed cafés with the suffocating and obtrusivemusic …”29), Haller sips a glass of wine. Suddenly, his despair vanishes. He isno longer the “beast astray, who finds neither home, nor joy, nor nourishment ina world that is strange and incomprehensible to him.”30 No. “The golden trailwas blazed and I was reminded of the eternal, of Mozart, and the stars.”31 Harryis always having these flashes of poetry and the sublime, which blow away hisdark mood and remind him that he is not a wretched “wolf of the steppes”, alonely, solitary, unhappy man (a ‘lone nutter’, as we would say today), butsomething akin to the gods. Yet these moods pass, and he finds himself onceagain back in his discontent, considering the example of Adalbert Stifter.That Harry’s initials and those of his creator are the same suggests that Hesseis writing about himself. And it is true that Hesse went through a spiritualcrisis in middle age, a plunge into debauchery peppered with thoughts of suicide– including his fiftieth birthday as the day to end it all – which is depictedin the novel and in a series of poems entitled Crisis, written at the same time.Hesse had earlier brushes with suicide as well. A ‘problem child’ who rejectedthe authoritarian educational system of his day, in his teens Hesse ran awayfrom the seminary at Maulbronn (later used as the setting for his novelNarcissus and Goldmund) where he was groomed for a career in the clergy; whenfound he was sent to a institution for the mentally retarded. Soon after he madehis first suicide attempt, after being rejected by a girl seven years his elder.He made another attempt not long after, and throughout his life, which wasfilled with personal, marital, health and professional problems, Hesse’s mindalways turned toward suicide as a possible means of escape. It was also a themein much of his fiction, practically all of which is a thinly disguised accountof Hesse’s own life and struggles. The eponymous hero of the early novel HermannLauscher kills himself. So does the schoolboy Hans Giebenrath in Beneath theWheel (also published as The Prodigy). Heinrich Muoth in Gertrude takes hislife, as does Klein in the novella Klein and Wagner. Emil Sinclair in Demian,written after Hesse’s psychoanalytic sessions with the Jungian Josef Lang,counsels another lost youth against killing himself. Hesse’s Indian alter ego,Siddhartha, in the novel of that name, makes an unsuccessful suicide attempt.And although it is not an outright attempt at suicide, Joseph Knecht, the heroof Hesse’s last and monumental novel The Glass Bead Game, spurred by thoughts ofyouth and the encouragement of his young student, yet knowing the danger,plunges into an ice cold lake and is overcome and drowns.Steppenwolf however is the novel with suicide at its centre. Hesse’s theme inall of his work is the reconciliation of opposites; he most often depicts thisthrough the device of two characters, who embody the conflicting poles of thisstruggle, which was Hesse’s own. In Beneath the Wheel, for example, HansGiebenrath, the gifted schoolboy crushed by the system, is the Hesse who was ledto attempt suicide by the unfeeling teachers and ignorant philistines whodisparaged his sensitivity and yearning to be a poet; Hermann Heilner is Hesse’sidealized self-image, the young rebel who runs away from home and school andsuccessfully becomes a poet.32 Probably the most well known of these dualpersonalities are the world-rejecting monk Narcissus and the life-affirmingartist Goldmund. Whether Hesse ever successfully reconciled the conflicts in hispsyche is debatable; in Steppenwolf, however, he discarded the motif ofembodying them in two characters, and placed them, Faust-like, in one.Because of its drug references, ample sex and psychedelic setting – Harry triesopium and cocaine, enjoys a threesome and experiments with homosexuality andmost of the action takes place in the surreal Magic Theatre, reserved “ForMadmen Only” – Steppenwolf was understandably a hit with readers in the 1960s.33But the book’s essence, which most readers missed, can be found in theremarkable “Treatise on the Steppenwolf,” that Harry purchases from a mysteriousman wearing a sandwich board advertising “anarchist entertainment.” What thetreatise turns out to be, is actually an essay on the metaphysics of suicide.After delineating Harry’s own crisis in remarkable detail, and arguing that, farfrom being miserable parasites on society, Steppenwolves like himself areactually the “vital force of the bourgeoisie,” enabling it to prosper and grow,admittedly at the expense of their own happiness34, the Treatise focuses on thecentral issue of Harry’s and Hesse’s own lives. Its analysis arrives at somesurprising insights. “To call suicides only those who actually destroythemselves,” it tells us, “is false.” There are many “who in a sense aresuicides only by accident and in whose being suicide has no necessary place.”There are many “of little personality and stamped with no deep impress of fate,who find their end in suicide without belonging on that account to the type ofthe suicide by inclination; while on the other hand, of those who are to becounted as suicides by the very nature of their being are many, perhaps amajority, who never in fact lay hands on themselves.” The peculiarity of thesuicide is that “his ego … is felt to be an extremely dangerous, dubious, anddoomed germ of nature; that he is always in his own eyes exposed to anextraordinary risk, as though he stood with the slightest foothold on the peakof a crag whence a slight push from without or an instant’s weakness from withinsuffices to precipitate him into the void.” These individuals believe thatsuicide “is their most probable manner of death,” and while one might suspectthat such characters are inherently weak, the opposite is actually true: “amongthe suicides are to be found unusually tenacious and eager and also courageousnatures.” But these souls “develop at the least shock the notion of suicide.”They “present themselves as those who are overtaken by the sense of guiltinherent in individuals,” who find the aim of life “not in the perfecting andmoulding of the self, but in liberating themselves by going back to the mother,back to God, back to the All.” Yet although “many of these are wholly incapableof ever having recourse to real suicide,” conscious of it being a sin, theynevertheless are suicides, for they see “death and not life as the releaser.”They also know that suicide, “though a way out, is rather a mean and shabby one,and that it is far nobler and finer to be felled by life than by one’s ownhand.” Knowing this, they are left to a “protracted struggle against theirtemptation,” as a kleptomaniac struggles against his.35As Hesse did himself, Harry Haller struggles against his temptation, and by theend of novel, among other things, he experiences a night at the Magic Theatre,which includes masochistic submission, group sex, terrorism, murder and even a“delightful suicide: you laugh yourself to bits.” He realizes the truth thetreatise has made known to him. Although his ego yearns to be dissolved and hisself obliterated in the embrace of the Mother, he rejects this path. “The way toinnocence, to the uncreated and to God leads on, not back,… but ever furtherinto sin, ever deeper into human life. Suicide, even, unhappy Steppenwolf, willnot seriously serve your turn. You will find yourself embarked on the longer andwearier and harder road to human life.” He recognized the truth discovered inthe Magic Theatre, that “the conquest of time and the escape from reality, orhowever else it may be that you choose to describe your longing, means simplythe wish to be relieved of your so-called personality. That is the prison whereyou lie.”36 He was, he knew, “determined to begin the game afresh.” “I wouldsample its tortures once more and shudder again at its senselessness. I wouldtraverse not once more, but often, the hell of my inner being.” And one day hewould be “a better hand at the game.”37Notes 1 Jorge Luis Borges The Total Library (Allen Lane: London, 2000) p. 336. 2 There is little on Mainländer available in English, and for interestedreaders I suggest an article I came across on the net, and to which this sectionof this book is indebted.

She wasfound several days later in her car in a cul-de-sac in Paris. She had previouslytried to throw herself in front of train. A year later, her ex-husband, RomainGary, author of The Roots of Heaven and other successful novels, shot himself inhis flat in the rue du Bac. Gary is unique in being the only author to win thePrix Goncourt twice: once under his real name, and a second time under thepseudonym Émile Ajar. He also wrote books under the names Fosco Sinabaldi andShatan Fotog. He was a film director, a diplomat, and in WWII a pilot with theFree French forces. Other suicides that Styron discusses are that of thepolitical activist Abbie Hoffman, the poet Randall Jarrell, and the writer PrimoLevi. Although many who knew Hoffman deny that his death was self-induced, theyare unable to account for the fact that he had somehow swallowed 150Phenobarbital pills. Although the official ruling in Jarrell’s death was‘accidental’, he had been struck by a car while walking on a stretch of highwaynear Chapel Hill, North Carolina. His presence on the road at night isunaccountable, and Newsweek reported the death as a suicide. Jarrell, too,suffered from depression, and had slashed his wrists while in hospital. Atsixty-seven, Primo Levi, a survivor of Auswitch, threw himself down a stairwellin Turin.13 Darkness Visible p. 2414 It is a view not limited to the humanities. The physicist and Nobel LaureateSteven Weinberg famously remarked that, “The more the universe seemscomprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.” In Weinberg’s view theuniverse, and everything in it, including ourselves, was created 15 billionyears ago, when less than nothing exploded for no reason (the Big Bang). Onealmost prefers Philipp Mainländer’s idea of creation via cosmic suicide. Suchpronouncements as Weinberg’s troubled thinkers like Camus, but our ownpost-post-modern sensibility, nursed on nihilism as on mother’s milk, acceptsthem as given and leaves it at that.15 The Myth of Sisyphus p. 19.16 Ibid. p. 13.17 H.G.

It’s the only one that takesplace entirely within a city, albeit a city more aligned with Hesse’s psychethan with the Zurich and Basel upon which it’s based. Unlike the urban milieu ofmuch existential writing, Hesse’s other fictions inhabit more exotic locales: anidealized Medieval Age, a mystic orient, a future utopia, or, in the traditionof German Romanticism, against the backdrop of a beautiful, idyllic nature. Andwhile the existential suicide is led to self-destruction either as a gesture ofhis sovereign freedom, or, with Stavrogin, as an escape from a deadeninghalf-life, like Harry Haller, the romantic suicide has a more emotional, evenerotic, relationship with death. The romantic suicide has moments when, likeKirilov, he experiences a kind of ecstasy, an overwhelming feeling that,“Everything is good.” Yet, it’s precisely this ecstasy that undermines him.After his flights of deep feeling (which, more times than not, are triggered bythe opposite sex), the return to the mundane world is a shock. Stolid,implacable reality remains, and the world, life, and self-consciousness becomeunbearable. Death, the great unknown, with its apparent promise of release fromthe cares of a troublesome existence, takes on an alluring appeal. As the lyricsof a sentimental pop song of the 1970s, about another suicide, Vincent Van Gogh,have it, many romantics came to believe that “this world was never meant for oneas beautiful as you,” the “you” more often than not being themselves.Death has seemed the way out of inescapable situations for many tragic couples.Cleopatra followed Mark Anthony in suicide. The story of Tristan and Isoldeinspired Richard Wagner to compose probably the most seductive piece of music inthe repertoire, the Liebestod, “love death.” Romeo, mistaking a sleeping Julietfor a dead one, kills himself; and Juliet, when she awakes and finds Romeo dead,follows suit. The equation love = death seems somehow imprinted in the westernpsyche; certainly this seems the case at least since the late eighteenth centuryand the rise of the Romantic movement. Death and sex are so entwined in ourcultural consciousness, that the sexual orgasm has even earned the sobriquet ofla petite mort, ‘the little death’. The ecstasy of orgasm obliterates ourrational consciousness, and, with any luck, for a brief while we enter a kind oftrance, in which we are ‘dead to the world’. Obliteration of their rationalconsciousness is something many romantics sought, and the most obliteratingexperience of all seemed to be death. With this in mind, it’s strange to thinkthat a session of mutually satisfying sex is something like a suicide pact.Perhaps the most extreme example of this erotic yearning for nothingness isfound in Villiers de l’Isle Adam’s influential Symbolist play Axel. Althoughlittle read and even less performed today, Villiers’ play had a profound effecton the literary elite of the time, especially W. B. Yeats, who was among theaudience at the play’s first performance in Paris in 1894. The plot of Axel issomewhat convoluted, involving mystical societies and hidden treasures, but thecentral characters are the ennui-ridden Rosicrucian aesthete Axel d’Auërspergand the ex-nun Sara Emmanuèle de Maupers. Axel spends his days studying occulttexts and mystical philosophy in his castle, cut off from crude reality. Whenhis philistine cousin Kaspar d’Auërsperg suggests that Axel enjoy himself bymaking use of the treasure his father has hidden in the castle, Axel runs himthrough. And when Axel discovers Sara, the renegade nun, who has come lookingfor the treasure, they battle, only to discover that they are soul mates. YetAxel’s romantic world rejection is so deep that, after announcing their love toeach other, he convinces Sara that their passion can only be consummated in ahigher sphere, i.e. death, and suggests a dual suicide. Sara, more red bloodedthan the dreamy Axel, suggests at least one night of a more earthly passion,before they quit their mortal coils. Yet Axel rejects the idea with contempt. “OSara,” he cries. “Tomorrow I would be prisoner of your splendid body. Itsdelights would have fettered the chaste energy impelling me at this instant.But … suppose our transports should die away, suppose some accursed hour wouldstrike when our love, paling, would be consumed by its own flames … Oh! Let’snot wait for that sad hour …”Still not convinced that suicide is their best choice – after all, they areyoung, beautiful, rich, and have an entire castle at their disposal – Sara makesone last attempt to draw Axel back into the world. Compressing her argument intoa single plea, she throws herself at Axel and commands him to, “Come, live!”“Life?” asks Axel. “No – Our existence is already full and its cup runneth over!What hourglass could measure the hours of this night? The future? … we haveexhausted it… . As for living? Our servants will do that for us.”This haughty, “As for living? Our servants will do that for us,” became themotto of scores of delicate, world weary aesthetes that followed Axel in hisworld rejection. Although most associated with the fin-de-siècle, it’s asensibility common to youth, whose idealism, as yet not chastened by the roughsurface of life, finds the contrast between the world as it is and the world asit should be unacceptable. Unwilling to give up the ideal, they hold reality incontempt, and, in different ways, seek an escape from it. Most often the meansof escape are drugs, but in some extreme cases, the preferred method is death.One romantic who sought in death release from an impossible situation, and whoseactions are said to have triggered a spate of copycat suicides, was theunfortunate hero of Goethe’s early novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. Goethe’snovel of unrequited love, social barriers, romantic extremes and suicide,kick-started the period of Sturm und Drang, ‘storm and stress’, that blazedacross Europe in the late eighteenth century, before blossoming into full-blownRomanticism. Yet Goethe himself soon outgrew this sensibility and remarked thatby the time he had completed Werther, he experienced a sense of freedom anddeliverance which allowed him, more or less, to grow up. Goethe wasn’t lackingunsuccessful love affairs, but in writing Werther he recognized that, unpleasantand disappointing as they were, they weren’t as devastating as many believed. Inlater years, commenting on the fate of his hero, Goethe remarked: “I was neversuch a fool as Werther.” Women are delightful and love rapturous, but neither,Goethe implies, are worth killing yourself over.The novel, which has come to be seen as the first great example of‘confessional’ literature, is based on two real life incidents: Goethe’s ownbrief unrequited loved for Charlotte Buff, who was already engaged to anotherman; and the actual suicide of Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, an acquaintance ofGoethe’s who killed himself over his love for a married woman.In 1772, Goethe, who had already earned some notoriety as the author of thedrama Götz von Berlichingen, arrived in the small town of Wetzlar, nearFrankfurt, sent there by his father to make contacts and find a career forhimself. The twenty-three year old poet and playwright preferred spending hisdays reading Homer or Pindar and following his interests wherever they may lead.One place they led to was a ball held at Volpertshausen, a small village not farfrom Wetzlar. There he met and promptly became enchanted with Charlotte Buff.Nineteen, lively and “physically attractive in a rather conventional style,”1Charlotte captivated Goethe and the next day he called on her family home.Charlotte’s father was the administrator for a wealthy aristocratic societycalled the Order of the Teutonic Nights; the social connections, grandfarmhouse, and mixture of sophisticated and rural character appealed to Goethe,and this made the already alluring Charlotte even more desirable. Yet Goethesoon discovered another had got there first. Charlotte was engaged to JohannChristian Kestner, a serious minded thirty-one year old who, like Goethe, wasattached to the Imperial Court. Unlike Goethe, Kestner pursued his careeroptions with greater purpose; hence it was that after spending many hoursdrafting legal papers, he would show up at Charlotte’s home and discover thatGoethe had already spent much of the afternoon with her.Kestner, who was as amused as he was annoyed at Goethe’s puppy love, knew thepoet was no real threat. Charlotte was a sensible young woman who realized thatGoethe could spend time with her being charming because he had little else todo; she also recognized that Kestner’s absence was the cause of providing thetwo of them with the wherewithal to get married and have a life together.Kestner, in fact, displayed the virtues of maturity, tolerance and patience thatGoethe himself would extol in later years. Unlike many jealous lovers, Kestnercould speak highly of Goethe. Writing to a friend, Kestner spoke of Goethe as “aman of many talents … a true genius and a man of character.” Although Kestnerrecognized that Goethe was “altogether a man of violent emotions,” he also sawthat he exhibited “considerable self-control,” a virtue Goethe later foundlacking in the Romantics that followed him. Goethe took to Kestner as well,commenting on his “calm and even behaviour, clarity of opinions, and firmness inaction and speech.”2The three became good friends, not quite forming a Jules et Jim ménage, butestablishing for a time something of a unit. Nevertheless, knowing well that shewas already engaged, Goethe fell in love with Charlotte. His devotion andubiquity at times irritated Kestner, whose work often drew him away. Writing inhis diary, Kestner complained of Goethe that “however much of a philosopher heis, and however well-disposed he may be towards me, he does not care to see mecoming to pass my time in pleasures with my girl.” Understandably, although hewas “well-disposed towards him,” Kestner admitted that he did “not like to findhim alone with my girl, entertaining her.”3 Yet for the most part Kestnertolerated Goethe’s attentions, and Charlotte herself never encouraged Goethe tobelieve they could be anything more than friends.Looking at the affair now, it seems clear that Goethe was probably more in lovewith being in love than he was with Charlotte. In any case, she was too sensiblea woman to make him happy. The practical, orderly virtues he admired in herwouldn’t have mixed well with his poetic temperament, and she herself wanted adependable mate, a ‘good earner’, which at that point Goethe wasn’t. What Goethereally wanted was for the situation to continue indefinitely. Consummating hisdesire in some act of betrayal would only make things sordid. Goethe was noseducer, at least not in this instance; the idea of the beloved, and theenchanting glow contemplating her gave to the world, was what he wanted. Morethan likely he already knew the truth of what his friend Johann Heinrich Mercktold him: that if Charlotte broke off her engagement to Kestner in order tomarry him, Goethe would head for the hills, a scenario he had already acted outon more than one occasion. Like the Romantics that followed him, the youngGoethe “sought to make permanent the fleeting experience of falling in love.”4The practical realities of human relationships would only be a bother.Such ecstasy, however, is by definition short-lived, and Charlotte finallybrought an end to the daydream. She gently but categorically let Goethe knowthat anything deeper than friendship was impossible between them. After fourmonths of worshipping her, Goethe finally got the message, and left. Charlottecried when she read his farewell note, yet he and Kestner were sooncorresponding. In Koblenz, Goethe met up with Merck, and was introduced toMaximiliane von La Roche, the sixteen-year-old daughter of the authoress Sophievon La Roche. Not surprisingly, he promptly became enchanted with her too. InDichtung und Warheit (“Poetry and Truth”) Goethe remarks that, “It is verypleasant if a new passion awakens within us before the old one has quite fadedaway.” Fickle, perhaps, but his interest in Maximiliane weaned him off hisdreams of Charlotte. Maximiliane, too, disappointed him; she married a merchantinstead. But by then unrequited love was only one more of life’s continuouslessons.Karl Wilhelm Jerusalem, an acquaintance of Goethe, Kestner and Charlotte, was aless robust soul than Goethe, and when it became clear that his passion for themarried Elizabeth Herd would go unfulfilled, he chose a more drastic option. Onthe night of 29 October 1772, little more than a month after Goethe had leftWetzlar, Jerusalem shot himself with a pistol he had borrowed from Kestner. It’sa truism that life imitates art, but in Jerusalem’s case the parallel isstriking.Jerusalem was among a group of people that Goethe knew in Wetzlar, but althoughthey had studied law in Leipzig at the same time, they were never close.Jerusalem had a reputation as an agreeable and dependable character; the famouswriter Gottfried Lessing knew him and thought highly of him, and while notengaged as a secretary to the ambassador of Braunschweig, Jerusalem occupiedhimself with philosophy, poetry and painting. Unlike Kestner, Jerusalem had alow opinion of Goethe, calling him a “fop” and a “scribbler”. In Dichtung undWarheit, Goethe describes Jerusalem as polite and gentle, and pointed out hisappearance, remarking on his blue frock-coat, buff leather waistcoat, andbreeches – attire that would become very popular in years to come.Jerusalem had a reputation for being eccentric. Kestner speaks of his habit oflong walks in the moonlight, his taste for solitude and tendency to brood, andthe social snub these character traits had cost him. He had a penchant fordrawings of deserted landscapes and had written an essay defending suicide, butthe most memorable feature about Jerusalem was his doomed love for the marriedElizabeth Herd. Apparently Herd did little to encourage Jerusalem’s affections,and when he announced his love to her, she begged her husband to forbidJerusalem entry to their home. Soon after Jerusalem wrote to Kestner, saying hewas about to take a long journey, and asking for the loan of Kestner’s pistols,a not unusual precaution at the time. Kestner wasn’t suspicious and didn’t guessthe use his loan would be put to. After setting his papers in order and makingarrangements, Jerusalem spent the evening at his home, in front of a fire and ajug of wine, having told his servant to be prepared for an early departure.Then, some time between midnight and one am, Jerusalem shot himself withKestner’s pistol, sitting in his chair, dressed in his buff waistcoat, boots,and blue frock-coat. When his servant found him the next morning, he was stillalive. A great deal of blood stained the floor; Jerusalem had apparently draggedhimself across the room to the window. A doctor was called but it was no use.When Kestner heard the news he rushed to Jerusalem’s rooms, realizing the realreason for the loan of the pistols. By noon Jerusalem was dead and he was buriedthat night. Goethe heard the story from Kestner and wrote back, telling of hismeeting Jerusalem once in the moonlight and remarking on the young man’sloneliness. Taking his own experience with Charlotte, and Jerusalem’s sad death,Goethe brought the two together and created a classic of tragic Romanticism.When Goethe’s Die Leiden des jungen Werther appeared in 1774, two years afterJerusalem’s suicide, it was an immediate success. It told the tale of apassionate, poetic, idealistic young man, his ill-fated love for a womanbetrothed to another, and his tragic suicide when that love was unrequited. Itwas clear the story was based partly on Goethe’s own love for Charlotte Buff,and partly on Jerusalem’s sad end. The fact that Werther’s suicide was only oneamong several indications – albeit the most drastic – that his idealistictemperament was ill-suited for coming to grips with life, went practicallyunnoticed. Understandably, the fact that it was based on a real life suicideovershadowed everything else. Kestner and Charlotte were not entirely pleasedabout their inclusion in the book, and the notoriety they earned from it annoyedthem. The character ‘Albert’ (based on Kestner) became synonymous with aphilistine sensibility, and to be called ‘an Albert’ was considered an insult.‘Lotte’ (Charlotte) was suspected of being Goethe’s mistress, which she neverwas, and was the subject of abuse when her virtue became known. In a letter to afriend, Kestner pointed out that in the first half of the book, Werther isGoethe; in the second half, he is Jerusalem. Kestner made clear that althoughsome of the incidents had a basis in their relationship with Goethe, many werepure invention. But to the general reading public, none of this mattered. Whatstruck their imaginations was that the suicide was based on a ‘real’ character,and the strange triple entity of Werther – Jerusalem – Goethe became anovernight sensation. The fact that practically all of the novel’s readersmisunderstood Goethe’s intent was ignored.Within a few months of the novel’s publication, Europe was in the grip ofWerthermania, and Goethe became the most famous German writer in the world. Asoften happens with this kind of early success, Goethe spent much of hissubsequent career trying to show he was more than ‘the author of Werther’; evenhis masterpiece Faust, which is a classic on a par with Shakespeare and Dante,was less known in his lifetime. The ‘Werther costume’ – blue coat, buffwaistcoat, breeches and riding boots – became de rigueur among the young set.There was a Werther tea, a Werther cologne, young people took to taking longwalks in the woods, reciting Homer and Ossian (one of Werther’s favouritepoets), and torchlight processions made their way to Jerusalem’s grave. Pilgrimsfrom all over Europe flocked to the place, and the site was included in thetravel guides of the time. Werther style poems, plays and novels were bought andread as fast as they could be published, most of an inferior literary qualitywhich, as can be imagined, hardly mattered. There were Werther fireworks,Werther wax figures, Werther songs, Werther porcelain, and Werther jewellery.Questions posed by the novel were hotly debated: should Lotte have continued tosee Werther after she and Albert were married? Romantic displays of solidaritywith Werther were common. A group of Englishmen toasted Werther over Jerusalem’sgrave, drew their daggers, and made speeches, but evidence for the many Werthercopy-cat suicides that remain part of the novel’s myth is scant. As MichaelHulse remarks, although there are a few deaths linked to the book (and these infact were women), reports of a ‘suicide epidemic’ are exaggerated and “the youngmen of Europe contented themselves with dressing in blue frock-coats and buffwaistcoats, and sensibly preferred not to pull the trigger.”5 But if Wertherdidn’t send a generation to an early grave, as has been reported, it’spopularity was dangerous in another, less drastic way. It was less as anendorsement of suicide, than in the way its many readers misunderstood Goethe’smessage, that the book was a danger. That the book was nevertheless banned inLeipzig, and that a Danish translation was aborted did little to stop the spreadof the Romantic sensibility that Goethe had purged himself of by writing thebook.From his creator’s point of view, that Werther was a fool to commit suicide overa woman is clear, but that is not the extent of his foolishness. Goethe’syounger contemporary Heinrich Heine pointed out that the social issues raised inthe novel were as important as the romantic ones, and that if the book had beenpublished in the 1800s, this would have been recognized. Werther’s problem –which we can assume was Jerusalem’s as well, and indeed Goethe’s at one point –was that he did not ‘fit’ into society. He is intelligent, idealistic, poetic:valuable traits all, but not ones that guaranteed that he would be judged as anequal by his social betters. Lotte’s rejection of his love is mirrored by therejection he receives by the aristocratic society he encounters during histenure as secretary to an ambassador, a position taken so that he could masterhis feelings toward Lotte. The ambassador himself he finds difficult to take.Werther finds him “extremely trying,” “the most punctilious oaf imaginable,doing everything step by step, meticulous as a maiden aunt.”6 Werther can’tunderstand why he must “despair of my own powers, my own gifts, when others withpaltry abilities and talents go showing off, smugly self-satisfied.”7 “Whatpeople these are, whose entire souls are occupied with protocol and ceremony,who devote their devious creative energies, for years on end, to moving oneplace higher up at table!”8 Werther’s own intelligence and energy is often toovital to suppress, and he frequently contradicts or corrects his employer,behaviour that earns him rebuke and the admonition to control his“hypersensitivity”, and the advice that he must learn to “moderate it and divertit into areas where it can be put to proper use and produce its rightfulpowerful effect.”9Werther tries to abide by these counsels, but something happens that makes himthrow his position over. A count who appreciates his talents and is fond of himinvites him to dine on the same evening that he held a regular soirée with hisfellow nobles. Werther did not know that he, as a subordinate, should not bepresent, and so he lingered, although the turned up noses of the aristocratswere enough to make him flee. Then a young woman, Miss B., whom he had got toknow and whom he felt had “retained a very natural manner amidst this inflexiblelife” and who accepted his request to call on her, arrived. Although his “heartalways feels freer” the moment he sees her, he soon realizes that she was not as‘natural’ with him then as she had been. “Can she too be like the rest of them?”he asks. Gradually the room fills and his presence becomes an issue. Eventuallyand apologetically, because he does truly like him, the count has to ask him toleave. Werther makes his exit, and drives to a hill to “watch the sun set andread that magnificent book in Homer where Odysseus enjoys the hospitality of theexcellent swineherd.”10 Later he discovers that his faux pas is the talk of thetown, and he hears from Miss B. that she had been warned against keeping up anacquaintance with him. The idea that he is being talked about enrages him. “Iwish someone would have the courage to mock me to my face, so that I mightthrust my sword through his body …” But thoughts of suicide are not far behindeither. “I have snatched up a knife a hundred times, meaning to relieve mysorely beset heart …” Like the “noble breed of horses that instinctively biteopen a vein when they are exhausted and feverish,” Werther too is “tempted toopen a vein and so find eternal freedom.”11But this humiliation is only the last in a series of unendurable conditions forWerther. “There is not a single instant when the heart is full,” he cries, “notone single hour of bliss!” In the evenings he resolves “to enjoy the next day’ssunrise, but I cannot quit my bed;” during the day “I look forward to thedelights of moonlight, and then I stay in my room. I do not quite know why Irise or why I go to bed.”12Werther’s problem, however, is not that of social snobbery, or of theimpossibility of having Lotte. It is more than this. As John Armstrong pointsout in his book Love, Life, Goethe, Werther’s experience with Lotte, and withMiss B and the count, “seems to suggest something terrible about life.” Werther“regards love as sacred – as the most important emotion. However, there is noguarantee that love, however, ardent, will be returned: that the world will meetit and reward it. He feels as if the most valuable thing that he has is uselessin the world as it is. Existence is perverse.”13That “the race is not given to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neitheryet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour tomen of skill; but time and chance happen to them all,” as Ecclesiastes pointedout long ago, remarking on a clear design fault in life, is something Wertherhas difficulty accepting.Lotte’s attempt to convince Werther that she is not the only woman in the world,that his talents, abilities and capacity for love will certainly find a placefor him, are fruitless. Werther, Armstrong tells us, is on the road to ruin “notbecause of the faults of the world, but because of some flaw in his innercondition.”14 Werther is discovering the truth of Schopenhauer’s belief: thatexistence is an absurd game, and that desire only breeds unhappiness. Werther’sproblem is that, as far as he can see, his deep feelings and longings can neverbe fulfilled in the world as it is. Goethe, who was no stranger to deep feelingsand yearnings – indeed, in many ways he taught Europe how to have these –realised that such unappeasable desires can only weaken one for life, unless onedevelops the discipline to face life on its own terms. Like most of us, Goethefaced disappointment and humiliation, but he was strong enough to grow beyondthe childish desire to knock over the chess board if the game wasn’t going hisway. Werther is unable to do this. He refuses to grow up. Goethe is not sayingwe should jettison our feelings, our idealism and dreams and find a good job inorder to get on in the world. But he is saying that our dreams and idealism areuseless unless we can learn how to fulfil them in the world. Having writtenWerther, Goethe left the kind of rash immaturity that leads to romantic suicidebehind, and went on to become one of the greatest creative geniuses in history,turning his mind and vitality to a dozen things, from science to statesmanship.He turned his dreams into reality, rather than letting reality be destroyed byhis dreams.Unfortunately, the damage was done, and Europe (and somewhat later, America)witnessed a rash of romantic death worship. That poets seemed not made for thisworld was evidenced by the early deaths of Keats, Shelley, Byron, Poe,Baudelaire and dozens of other 19th century figures. Probably the most iconic‘real life’ Romantic suicide – although, as we shall see, there is some doubt itwas a suicide at all – was the death at seventeen of the boy poet ThomasChatterton. That life seemed a “dim vast vale of tears,” and the poet destinedto “cease upon the midnight with no pain” – or at least to want to – became partof the Romantic’s job description. Thomas Lovell Beddoes’ near-pathologicaldeath obsession – which we will look at in more detail further on – is perhapsthe most unrelenting expression of a theme that dominated the culturalconsciousness in the west for decades, reaching into the twentieth century, andlate Romantics like the composer Gustav Mahler, whose Das Lied von der Erde is asumptuous, seductive farewell to life, and the poet Rilke, whose Duino Elegiescelebrates death not as a end, but as the ‘other side’ of being. The poet manquéHarry Crosby carried this idea to kitschy extremes, but for the most part thetwentieth and twenty-first centuries have seen death on such massive scales –wars, genocides, natural disasters – that aside from adolescent excursions inthe garb of ‘goth’ or ‘death’ rock, the idea of ‘worshipping’ it no longerstrikes the imagination. Yet after the last gasp of tragic Romanticism in thedecay of the fin-de-siècle, the literary suicide took on a possibly even darkercharacter, as an expression of a grimly sardonic, stridently nihilistic ‘black’humour, a macabre comedy most characteristically associated with surrealism.Notes 1 John Armstrong Love, Life, Goethe (Penguin Books: London, 2006) p. 54. 2 Introduction to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe The Sorrows of Young Werther(Penguin Books: London, 1989) translated and introduction by Michael Hulse, p.6. 3 Ibid. p. 7. 4 Love, Life, Goethe p. 57. 5 Michael Hulse, Introduction to The Sorrows of Young Werther, p. 12. 6 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe The Sorrows of Young Werther p. 74. 7 Ibid. p. 73. 8 Ibid. p. 77. 9 Ibid. p. 79.10 Ibid. p. 82.11 Ibid. p. 83.12 Ibid. pp. 77–78.13 Love, Life, Goethe p. 6114 Ibid. p. 62."},{"pageContent":"THE SURREAL SUICIDE [table_of_contents.htm#ch4]Literary suicides seem to span all genres, including pulp, as the suicide at agethirty of Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan, King Kull and other brawnysword and sorcery heroes argues. (See the Suicidal Miscellany for Howard’s poem“Lines Written in the Realization that I Must Die”). But one literary movement,Surrealism, even more than existentialism, seems to have attracted an inordinatenumber of writers obsessed with self-destruction, individuals who either wroteabout suicide extensively, play-acted it, or, in more than one example, wentthrough with it. It can even be argued that Surrealism itself was founded on asuicide, although once again, there is some debate over whether the death inquestion was really a suicide or not.The term ‘Surrealism’ became part of our cultural vocabulary in 1917, coined inParis by the poet Guillaume Apollinaire in the programme notes for Erik Satie’sballet Parade, which featured choreography by Massine, a backdrop by Picasso, ascenario by Jean Cocteau, and a performance by Serge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes.The ‘new alliance of the arts’ that Apollinaire celebrated in the notes wasreally not that new – the idea of the Gesamtkunstwerk, or ‘total art work’, hadbeen a staple of Symbolist aesthetics decades before – but Satie’s score fortypewriter, propellers, sirens, Morse code and other forms of musique concreteprompted Apollinaire to call Parade a work of ‘Surrealism’.1 What exactly hemeant by this is unclear; the general idea, however, is that in Parade art haddone life, or reality, one better (’sur’ refers to a kind of addition, as in‘surplus’ or ‘surcharge’). Apollinaire had at first considered adopting‘Supernaturalism’ for this new trend in art, but this term was already in useand had already acquired a clutch of literary and philosophical interpretationswhich would only have confused matters. Apollinaire’s own stab at defining thenew term, Surrealism, is suggestive, but is hardly the stuff from whichrevolutions are made. “When man tried to imitate walking,” he wrote, “he createdthe wheel, which does not resemble a leg. He thus performed an act of Surrealismwithout realizing it.” New, creative and unusual at the time, ‘surreal’ has bynow become a clichéd term used to indicate anything ‘strange’ or ‘weird’ and hasreally lost most of its true meaning, as is also the case with ‘existential’ and‘romantic’. Its once shocking images and unlikely juxtapositions are run of themill, adorning everything from T-shirts to shopping bags, enjoying a ubiquitythe Surrealists themselves once sought, without, however, triggering theprofound transformation of life they hoped to achieve.The name most associated with Surrealism, however, is not that of Apollinaire,but of his one-time protégé, the poet André Breton. Appropriating the term fromhis master, who seemed not to appreciate the marketing value of a good ‘brand’,Breton became its spokesman, promulgator, ideological leader and notorious‘Black Pope’, ruthlessly excommunicating those who fell foul of his stringentaesthetic and political criteria. Yet although Breton became the name associatedworldwide with Surrealism, the ‘living face of Surrealism’, at least for Bretonhimself, was that of a character who could barely be called a literary figure atall. In the Second Manifesto of Surrealism, Breton made a pronouncement that,for good or bad, has become one of the most quoted examples of what something‘surreal’ would be like. “The simplest Surrealist act,” Breton declared,“consists of dashing down into the street, pistol in hand, and firing blindly,as fast as you can pull the trigger, into the crowd”2 – and with this in mind,one wonders if the proliferation of terrorism and ‘motiveless murders’ in thetwenty-first century indicates the victory of Surrealism after all … For all hisbellicose pamphleteering, however, Breton does not come across as a violent man,yet the trope of guns and suicide is something more than posture and rhetoric;at one Surrealist shindig, Breton wore a pair of pistols strapped to his head,and at the Dada festival of 1918, realizing they needed a real show-stopper toend their sketch S’il Vous Plait, Breton and the poet Philippe Soupault (withwhom Breton collaborated on the first work of ‘automatic writing’, The MagneticFields) decided to put their names in a hat, and which of the two was pickedwould close the show by blowing his brains out, a nod, perhaps, to ArthurCravan’s aborted public suicide a few years earlier.Breton’s fascination with guns and suicide can be traced to another earlysurrealist event, again involving Apollinaire. A few weeks after the success ofParade, Apollinaire’s play Les Mamelles de Tirésias (The Tits of Tiresias) wasperformed at the Conservatoire Renée-Maubel, a tiny theatre on the Rue del’Orient in Montmartre. The audience had to wait for hours for the play tobegin, and were hardly in the best of moods, and once it had started theirfrustration only increased at what they saw on stage. Soon into it, a riot brokeout, and the crowd, which included Matisse, George Braque, Modigliani, FerdinandLeger, Cocteau, Breton and others of the Parisian avant-garde, were, as onewitness put it, “howling wildly.” During the intermission the ruckus became evenworse, and Apollinaire himself mounted the stage to call for order. At thispoint Breton noticed a military officer in the front row, standing up and wavinga pistol, evidently about to open fire on the mob. Realizing who the ‘officer’was, Breton rushed to him, and prevented him from firing the gun; he evenmanaged to calm him enough to sit down and watch the rest of the show, which,they later both admitted, was something of a disappointment. Tiresias’ tits werenot a big hit, but the evening was nevertheless crucial for Breton. “Neverbefore, as I did on that evening,” he later said in an interview, “had Imeasured the depth of the gap that would separate the new generation from theone preceding it …”3 The figure that Breton had just prevented from carrying outan act of aesthetic homicide was very familiar to him. It was indeed his friend,Jacques Vaché, whom he had only recently met, yet who had, and would continue tohave, an enormous influence on Breton and, through him, on twentieth century artand culture. “If ever someone’s influence touched me to the core,” Breton saidof Vaché, “it was his.”4For us, inured to theatrical violence through years of performance art, the ideaof someone pulling a gun on an audience is no longer shocking. Yet what isreally strange – I was about to say ‘surreal’ – about the event is that no oneelse in the theatre that night seemed to have witnessed it. None of the dozensof reviews of the play made a mention of it. Vaché himself, who, it is true, wasnot a prolific writer – if a writer at all – never remarked on it in his lettersto Breton. Two of Breton’s biographers both suggest that the incident may havebeen invented, or at least that its importance may have been exaggerated byBreton.5 Then again, perhaps, as Breton himself would argue, such an eventneeded the illuminating eye of a poet, for its true significance to come tolight.Breton and Vaché met in Nantes, Vaché’s hometown, in February 1916, in themiddle of World War I. Breton, who was twenty, was there serving as a medicalauxiliary in the neurological centre; Vaché, twenty-one, was hospitalised with awound to his calf. Breton was struck by Vaché’s appearance, and in subsequentwritings, described him in terms that, to today’s sensibilities, suggest atleast a touch of homoeroticism, although Breton’s antipathy to homosexualitywould later become legendary. Breton spoke of Vaché as “an elegant young soldierwith flaming red hair,” and admits that he was immediately captivated by his“studied arrogance and otherworldly detachment.”6 As Ruth Brandon points out,Vaché was everything Breton wasn’t and yet yearned to be: “confident, cynical,stylish, where Breton was awkward, earnest, enthusiastic.”7 Enthusiasm inparticular was something for which Vaché had nothing but disdain, and this poseof nihilistic dandyism fascinated Breton.Vaché impressed Breton with his total indifference to practically everything,and his preoccupation with seemingly insignificant matters. Breton remarks onhow Vaché, who was supposed to be an art student, would spend a morning whileconvalescing arranging objects on a small table, devoting considerable attentionto the correct placement of photographs, flowers, paint pots and other items, ina kind of exercise in feng shui. Breton, who was devoted to poetry, spoke withVaché of his interests and heroes, yet Vaché dismissed nearly all of them,except for the work of Alfred Jarry, the creator of Ubu Roi and other blackcomedies, with whom he shared some things in common.8 Like Jarry, Vaché adoptedthe demeanour of the then stereotypical Englishman, perfectly dressed, sportinga cane and monocle, unruffled by anything; he even spoke with an English accentand claimed English descent (he did actually have Irish ancestry).9 Also likeJarry, he had a penchant for adopting disguises and striking disconcertingposes. Vaché would sign himself Harry James or Jean-Michael Strogoff, acharacter from Jules Verne. He would dress as an airman, a hussar, or a doctorand walk down a crowded street. If he saw you, he wouldn’t always acknowledgeyou, and might simply walk by, as if you were a stranger; when he was with youhe would often leave abruptly, without a word: he never said hello or goodbye.He told Breton that he wanted to create a military uniform that would bemistaken by either side as one of their own. He would introduce Breton to othersas the famous poet André Salmon, or by some other name, and once told Bretonthat his ambition was to “wear a red shirt, a red cravat and high boots – and tobelong to a pointless Chinese secret society in Australia.” Breton also noticedthat this “bitterly light-hearted poseur,”10 spent a great deal of time drawingsketches that looked like men’s fashion illustrations.Vaché’s attitude toward women was equally bizarre. He professed no interest inthem at all, except, perhaps, for “some mysterious, inscrutable little girls”who would nevertheless need to be killed off before they lost their charm. Vachédid live with a woman, Louise, and even shared a bed with her. But therelationship was platonic; Breton also noticed that when he visited Vaché,Louise was made to sit quietly, in a corner. The only attention Vaché showed herwas to kiss her hand after she had made them tea. Vaché was apparently fond ofBaudelaire’s remark apropos women: “Woman is natural, in other wordsabominable.” It doesn’t take much to find in this at least a suspicion ofhomosexuality. Breton’s own attitude toward women was as different as possible,nearly puritanical, seeing in them the embodiment of the poetic muse.All this may sound like fairly tame material, familiar to fans of Monty Pythonand other forms of ‘absurd’ theatre. But for Breton it was a revelation. “Thetime I spent with him at Nantes in 1916,” Breton wrote of Vaché, “seemed almostenchanted. I shall never forget it, and although I still meet people I am drawnto, I know I shall never abandon myself to anyone in quite that way again.”Remarks like these suggest that Breton was simply in love with Vaché, whetherthey were actual lovers or not, which seems doubtful. Vaché seems to have had onBreton the effect that Neal Cassady had on Jack Kerouac, as documented in On TheRoad: both seemed to be characters that embodied the ideas and attitude towardlife that both writers embraced. In Breton’s case, his attraction to Vaché isreminiscent of Valery Briusov’s predilection for ‘ecstatic types’ (see Agents ofSuicide in A Taxonomy of Suicide), individuals of a freer, less inhibitedcharacter; like Briusov, Breton had a stern temperament, and was known for his‘totalitarian’ personality. Opposites attract, and while for Breton Vaché’s goodfortune was to have produced nothing, the disciplined and determined Breton wenton to erect a formidable apparatus of philosophical, literary and politicalideas that influenced French culture for forty years.Aside from Vaché’s behaviour – which we could call ‘subversive’ or‘transgressive’ or simply annoying – what impressed Breton most about him washis idea of ‘umour’, a notion of what Breton later called ‘black humour’ andwhich certainly has its roots in Jarry’s Ubu plays, and which Breton gleanedthrough the letters he received from Vaché while they were separated during thewar. The essence of ‘umour’, as Mark Polizzotti puts it, is in its “dismissivewhatever”11, an attitude today enjoyed by readers of Michel Houellebecq. Vaché’sown attempt at a definition, while less succinct than Polizzotti’s, is equallydeadpan: umour for Vaché meant a recognition of “the theatrical (and joyless)futility of everything.” At twenty-one, Vaché had seen through it all, and, likethe Dadaists Breton was soon to encounter, he was prepared to accept nothing,trust no one, and ridicule everything. In this he was truly ahead of his time,and what was for Breton a manifestation of “joyful terrorism” (and not‘joyless’, as Vaché characterized it) is today pretty much taken as read.Yet even more than his umour or diverting antics, it was Vaché’s death that hadthe most profound impact on Breton.On 7 January 1919, Le Télégramme des Provinces de l’Ouest ran a headline thatread “Two Youths Dabble with Drugs,” and went on to report a “regrettableincident that brings tragedy to two of the most respected families inNantes …”12 One of those families was Vaché’s, and the regrettable incident wasthe death of Jacques Vaché and a “Paul B.” from an apparent overdose of opium.At around 6:00 p.m., the article continued, an American soldier named Woynow hadrushed from a second floor room at the Hotel de France in Nantes, demanding tosee the manager. Two young men, his friends, he said, had died in the room. Aphysician was called and on entering the room he found two men lying stretchedout on the bed, “undressed for sleep,” which, later reports explained, meantnaked. One of the bodies was cold – this was Paul Bonnet – the other, that ofVaché, was still warm. The doctor diagnosed an opium overdose and turned hisattentions to the warm body, which he was nevertheless unable to revive. He thentreated Woynow, who had by this time become ill with the drug as well. Thepolice later found a small container filled with the narcotic, a knife bearingremnants of it, an opium pipe, and “innumerable Egyptian cigarette butts” nearthe bed. The report continued that Vaché and Paul Bonnet – as well as Woynow, weassume – belonged to a group of “French and American ‘thrill-seekers’ ” who“frequented places of amusement,” and had apparently killed themselves inpursuit of “the high that this terrible drug brings.” A follow-up article asked,“Can’t these hare-brained youths understand that, in their quest for certainunhealthy sensations, they shouldn’t carelessly play around with a drug thatstupefies even when it doesn’t kill?” It also suggested that the factssurrounding the case indicate that they “could not have been experiencedsmokers.”13Vaché’s death may very well have been the most profound emotional event tohappen to Breton. He told the poet Jean Paulhan that it was “the most painfulevent of my life,” and that ever after he had to wear a “suit of armour” againstemotion.14 To another friend he wrote, “I cannot express here the pain that thenews of his death caused me, or the trouble I had getting over it.”15 All thisis understandable, but what Breton made of the death became something of anobsession. Although on the face of it, Vaché and his friend had succumbed to anunfortunate but not uncommon misuse of the drug, Breton became convinced thatthe deaths were intentional, that Vaché planned his suicide – and also theapparent murder of one, and attempted murder of another, of his companions. Itwas, Breton maintained, the crowning display of umour.Breton’s ‘evidence’ for this reading of Vaché’s death is indeed suggestive. Hequotes a remark Vaché was said to have made only hours before his overdose: “Iwill die when I want to die … But I’ll die with someone else. Dying alone is tooboring. Preferably with one of my very best friends …”16 If that was the case,then Vaché wasn’t reluctant to engage in murder in the cause of umour, and hethen joins the ranks of Harry Crosby, Heinrich von Kleist and Arthur Koestler,as a suicide who took others with him. In a letter to Breton’s friend, TheodoreFraenkel, Vaché wrote of “some funny murders” he wanted to tell him about, andof his dream of performing “some good well-felt Eccentricities, or some amusingdeception that would result in lots of deaths,” although it has to be admittedthat he thought of performing these “while wearing a very light athletic-styleform-fitting costume … with wonderful open-topped canvas shoes.”17 (Then again,no clothes at all is pretty close to a “very light form-fitting costume” …)Vaché’s penchant for the absurd non sequitur makes judging the cogency of theseremarks difficult; yet his letters leading up to the time of his death dodisplay a sense of crisis. While the war was on, Vaché could indulge hisnihilism with some justification; now that it had ended (he died shortly afterthe armistice) he seemed to succumb to a sense of aimlessness: “You see, I don’tknow where I am any longer,”18 he wrote to Breton from Brussels. Mention ofsuicide is made in the later letters, and there is a shrill anxiety in passageslike “ART IS STUPIDITY – Almost nothing is stupid – art must be funny and alittle tiresome … Everything is so funny, very funny, it’s a fact – Everythingis so funny! (and if we killed ourselves also, instead of merely going away?”)19He was at the end of his rope, but he still looked forward to “the ratheramusing things to do once I’m unchained and at liberty.”20 He had also toldBreton that he didn’t want to die in wartime – meaning that he didn’t want hisdeath to be as banal and uniform as those of thousands of other soldiers. He hadto, as Nietzsche advised, “die at the right time,” and although Vaché had littleuse for Apollinaire, the old master, he said, was at least “wise to stop intime,” remarking on Apollinaire’s death only a month earlier. Perhaps coming sosoon after Apollinaire’s death (two months separated them), Vaché’s death had tobe special for Breton – a conceit shared by many literary suicides. Yet, whetherVaché had achieved this or not, Breton was in no doubt; he was determined thatthe death of the man most important to him, whom he once described as “morebeautiful than a reed pipe,” would be special. His death was “admirable,” Bretondeclared in one of the four essays he wrote introducing Vaché’s letters, “inthat it could pass for accidental.”21 And his unfortunate friends’ ignorance ofthe power of the drug, allowed Vaché the opportunity to commit “one last‘humorous deception’ at their expense.” Again, if this was the case, then Bretonis close to applauding his friend for committing murder.Yet the evidence for an accidental overdose is just as suggestive. To beginwith, as Mark Polizzotti points out, there were originally four men in the roomwith Vaché, not two, and at least one of them was homosexual (the two othersleft early, one not interested in drugs, the other because he felt ill aftertaking the opium; he later had his stomach pumped: along with smoking opium,they also ate it.) The newspaper article which reported that Vaché and PaulBonnet were “undressed for sleep” cushions the fact that they were simply naked,early in the day, in an unheated room in January. When we remember Vaché’scurious relationship with Louise, and the fact that he found only “young girls”– who often have boyish figures – attractive, we can be excused for wondering ifsleep was the only thing on Vaché and Bonnet’s mind – at the same timerecognizing that opium is one of the least aphrodisiacal of drugs. And for allhis dandified nihilism, there is scant evidence that Vaché was a particularlyexperienced opium user, as Breton had suggested. As for his intention to killhimself and a few close friends, Woynow, one of the elect group, denied thatthere was anything in Vaché’s behaviour that day to indicate this, although ofcourse Vaché was adept at concealing his intentions, if he had any, under one ofhis adopted personae. But if Vaché planned to take a close friend with him, didhe really want to take four of them?Most likely these questions will never be answered, although Breton’s notoriousintolerance of homosexuality, coupled with his clear love of Vaché, suggest thathe suspected something more than umour went on in that cold hotel room in Nantesthat fateful January day. Perhaps in reaction to this, Breton created the mythof Vaché as an überdandy to counteract what could only strike him as sordidbanality.22 That Vaché himself was uncomfortable with the significance Bretonplaced on him can perhaps be felt in his last letter, when Vaché, “What do youwant of me – my dear friend? – UMOUR – my dear friend, André … this is notrivial matter,” and when he seems to pass on the burden of drawing out whateverimportance this might have to his “dear friend”: “I’m depending on you toprepare the way for this deceptive God, sneering slightly and terrible in anycase – You see, how funny it’ll be if this NEW SPIRIT breaks loose.”23*The new spirit did indeed break loose and, as may be expected, suicide was oneof its concerns. In December 1924 the first issue of La Révolution surréalisteappeared, a journal edited by Pierre Naville and Benjamin Péret. Towards thebeginning of the journal the editors had placed an announcement with an unusualintent.InquestYou live, you die. What has free will got to do with it? It seems you killyourself in the same way as you dream.This is no moral problem we are posing.IS SUICIDE A SOLUTION?The editors invited their readers to respond, and may have expected someremarkable replies, in keeping with the character of the inquiry – although noone, it seems, asked the obvious question: a solution to what? But what theyreceived was something else. The Symbolist poet Francis Jammes answered with aperhaps surprising indignation: “Only a wretch would ask such a question, and ifsome poor child were to kill him or herself, you would be the murderer.” And,being a Catholic, Jammes added: “The only resource open to you, should you havethe slightest conscience left, is to throw yourselves into a confessional.”Breton’s publisher, Léon Pierre-Quint, fared little better: “I can’t think of amore absurd question.” And Breton himself avoided any unequivocal response byciting the philosopher Théodore Jouffroy, who wrote that, “Suicide is a poorword; the one who kills is not identical to the one who is killed”24 The oneclearly positive reply came from a relatively recent addition to the surrealistranks, René Crevel. “A solution?” Crevel asked. “Yes,” he answered.“It is said,” Crevel continued, “that one commits suicide from love, fear orvenereal disease. Not so. Everyone is in love, or thinks they are. Suicide is amatter of conscious choice. Those who commit suicide are the ones who are notimbued with the quasi-universal cowardice of fighting against a certain feelingin the soul which is of such intensity that it has to be taken, until it isproved otherwise, for the truth. This is the only sensation that allows a personto embrace a solution that is clearly the fairest and most definitive solutionof all, suicide. There is no love or hate which is simply fair or definitive.But the respect – in spite of myself and notwithstanding a tyrannical moral orreligious upbringing – which I am bound to show to anyone who does nottimorously with-hold or restrain that impulse, that moral impulse, leads me toenvy more and more each of those persons whose anguish is so intense that theycan no longer accept life’s little games.”That Crevel believed, “Suicide is a matter of conscious choice” must haveenamoured him to Breton, and throughout their relationship, which was full ofcontradictions and crises, and which ended with Crevel’s own suicide at the ageof thirty-five in 1935, Breton was something of a father figure for Crevel (whowas only four years younger than Breton). That Crevel sought such figures andthat the question of suicide was associated with them, is rooted in the gruesomecircumstance of his own father’s suicide, when Crevel was fourteen. His father,a music-publisher, hanged himself, and René’s mother, an apparent sadist, intenton teaching the boy some lesson, forced him to look at the dangling body whileshe cursed it.25 Understandably, Crevel loathed his mother thereafter. The restof his life was punctuated by episodes of a similar traumatic character. Inanswer to a similar questionnaire posed by another avant-garde journal, LeDisque vert (edited by Henri Michaux and Franz Hellens), Crevel had written, “Isnot the fear of suicide the best remedy against suicide?” Perhaps Crevel didn’tfear it enough, or perhaps this is simply not true. Or perhaps Crevel was simplytrying to bolster his own defences against something that he may have felt wasinevitable, just as it is possible that his remark about suicides being free ofthe “quasi-universal cowardice” mistakenly associated with the taboo was a wayof refuting the hysterical abuse his mother threw at the defenceless corpse ofhis father.Crevel came to Breton’s attention when it became known that he was an adept atthe ‘sleeping fits’ that were for a time the centre of Surrealist attraction.With the poet Robert Desnos – with whom he vied for Breton’s attentions – Creveldeveloped a strange facility for passing into a trance and producing the kind of‘stream of unconsciousness’ verbiage that fascinated Breton, and which was thesubject of his and Philippe Soupault’s collaboration The Magnetic Fields. Creveldiscovered his talent for producing the ‘psychic automatisms’ by which Bretonlater defined Surrealism while attending a séance. Sitting around the tableholding hands, Crevel almost immediately nodded off and, as reported by theothers, produced some remarkable statements, of which he later had no memory.When Crevel heard that Breton was exploring dreams and other altered states ofconsciousness, he told him of his experience. Breton was intrigued, and for atime Crevel and Desnos ran a sort of contest to see who could fall into trancequickest and produce the most fascinating material.But poetic ‘channelling’ wasn’t the only attraction Crevel had for Breton. LikeJacques Vaché, Crevel was handsome, a beautiful boy with an angelic face ringedwith golden curls; Dali, with whom he also had a close relationship, describedCrevel’s looks as “the sullen, deaf, Beethovenesque, bad-angel face of a fernshoot.”26 Also like Vaché, and perhaps less attractive, Crevel was a drug user,more or less an addict, and bouts of heavy opium and cocaine use would alternatewith periods of detoxification, a routine that hardly helped the tuberculosis hesuffered from and which, just prior to his suicide, was diagnosed as incurable.Another trait he may have shared with Vaché was his homosexuality, which Bretoncould not have been ignorant of, but which Crevel, because of his devotion toBreton, was forced to hide as a kind of open secret. Crevel may really have beenbisexual, as he did have relationships with women, but it’s clear that, for thesake of his relationship with Breton, he pretended not to like men.Crevel’s sexual preference was enough to create inner conflict, given that hissurrogate father abhorred it. But there were other contradictions. Crevel was afervent Marxist and a believer in the proletarian revolution – as manymiddle-class people were – yet, like Jean Cocteau (another opium user), he was adarling of high society, and enjoyed rubbing elbows with the rich and famous. Hewas also the author of novels, a literary form that Breton in particularloathed. His political beliefs finally led him to reject the Surrealists, buthis devotion to Breton, and his attempts to reconcile it with his commitment tothe revolution, was in the end what killed him.Although Breton had embraced the revolution and, like other avant-garde poets –Mayakovsky, for example, about whom we will have more to say later on – he hadseen his work as a means of effecting political change, he grew disenchantedwith the communists and by the early Thirties, was an outspoken critic of Stalinand the show trials. Crevel had joined the French Communist Party in 1927, but,as with the rest of his life, his relations with it fluctuated. In 1933 he,along with Breton and the other Surrealists, was expelled from the party andfrom the Association of Revolutionary Writers and Artists, a group thatparticipated in agit-prop activities more or less sanctioned by the communists.For all their dedication to ‘the revolution’, most of the politicos exhibitedrather bourgeois tastes and found Surrealism too strange and subversive fortheir liking. Crevel had also published a novel, Les Pieds dans le plat(“Putting My Foot In It”), in which he made blatant reference to his, andothers, homosexuality, a candour unwelcome among the Stalinists, who were asbourgeois in their ideas about sex as they were in those about art. Bretonremained adamantly beyond the pale, but Crevel managed to get readmitted to theparty the next year.Although emotionally loyal to Breton, Crevel disagreed with him politically; hehad also disagreed with the tribunal Breton subjected Dali to over his unseemlyglorification of Hitler, whom, Dali insisted, should be consideredsurrealistically, and whom he referred to as the “edible-paranoid great man,”whose “soft eyes” and “curvaceous fanny” were “possessed of an irresistiblepoetic charm.”27 (Dali’s politics, at the best of times madcap, did turn towardfascism and he ended up a devout Francoist.) By this time Crevel had alsorealized that, given the increasing fascist threat, his most immediate loyaltymust be to the communists, who seemed to form the only real opposition toHitler, Dali’s appreciation of him notwithstanding. Yet although he withdrewfrom most Surrealist activities, he was loathe to let Breton go – if only toavoid suffering the fate of those who had gotten into the Black Pope’s bad books– and he lobbied hard for Breton to take part in the Congress of Writers inDefence of Culture organized by the party, to be held in Paris in June 1935.Crevel seemed to be making some headway, but, ironically, because of a chanceevent – something Breton prized highly – Crevel’s efforts in the end werepractically useless.Shortly before the Congress, Breton, his second wife Jacqueline Lamba, BenjaminPéret and some members of the Czech Surrealist group were out one evening, whenone of the Czechs saw the Soviet critic Ilya Ehrenburg leaving a café. Bretonhad never met Ehrenburg, although he was well known in Paris, but a year beforeBreton was enraged by a pamphlet Ehrenburg had written, denouncing Surrealismand the Surrealists as ‘pederasts’ and ‘dreamers’ among other things andsingling out Breton in particular. The Czechs pointed Ehrenburg out, and Bretonwent up to him and introduced himself by announcing that he had a bone to pickwith him. Ehrenburg feigned not to know the name ‘André Breton’, and, to refreshhis memory, Breton slapped him in the face, each time repeating one of theepithets from his pamphlet: “André Breton the pederast” (slap) “André Breton thedreamer” (slap), and so on. Then it was Péret’s turn. Ehrenburg merely coveredhis face with his hands and said, “You’ll be sorry for that.” He then promptlyreported the incident to his superiors and the idea of a Surrealist speaking atthe Congress – which would include major players like Gide, Thomas Mann, RobertMusil, Malraux, E. M. Forster, Brecht, Aldous Huxley among others – became anon-issue.Crevel was not ready to give up and he spent the forty-eight hours before theCongress trying to get the party to change its mind, and trying to get Breton tomake a conciliatory gesture. Neither injured party was ready to budge, and in alast chance effort, Crevel addressed a committee meeting. Ehrenburg merelyremarked that Breton had “acted like a cop,” and that seemed enough: none of theParisians wished to alienate the Russians, and were Breton allowed to speak,Ehrenburg assured them the Soviets would boycott the Congress, which wasunthinkable.28 Crevel was humiliated. He then went home, swallowed a massivedose of sedatives, turned on the stove and gassed himself.In looking for a trigger for Crevel’s suicide, we have several candidates: hisfailure to dissuade the communists to relent or to persuade Breton to apologize;his inability to reconcile his love for the Black Pope with his rejection of hispolitics; his repeated drug addictions; his homosexuality; the fact that on theday he committed suicide he had discovered that his tuberculosis, which hebelieved had been cured, had in actuality gotten worse and was spreading; hisrecent pitiful performance lecturing to workers who he realized saw him as “justa rich kid with problems, slumming;”29 or, underlining all the rest, what musthave been the gruesomely traumatic memory of his father’s death. Dali, who was aclose friend, hearing about the Congress debacle, realized Crevel needed somesupport, and telephoned him, only to receive what must have seemed like aparticularly surreal answer: an unfamiliar voice advised him to get a taxi andcome at once, as Crevel was dying. When Dali arrived, he found a fire engineparked in front of Crevel’s building, and firemen in his flat. “With thegluttony of a nursing baby,” Dali wrote, “René was sucking oxygen. I never sawanyone cling so desperately to life.”30 His attachment to it, sadly, was brief;he died in hospital that evening. Crevel’s note, tied to his wrist, speaks ofhis self-hatred. It read, “René Crevel. Please cremate me. Disgust.”31Although Crevel had called suicide a matter of “conscious choice,” it isn’tdifficult to see that his was the product of an inordinate number of personalcrises, compounded by desperation and a sense of personal failure. Even Breton,who had been accused in print of practically murdering Crevel by one of René’sCatholic friends, understood this, and in his defence spelled out the probablereasons, listed above, for Crevel’s death. Six years earlier, however, anotheryoung Surrealist who had taken his own life seemed to meet the Vaché standardwith greater accuracy. According to Tristan Tzara, Jacques Rigaut committedsuicide “after having exhausted all the reasons for living a man can offerhimself.”32 For Breton, Rigaut had “sentenced himself to death at about the ageof twenty and waited impatiently for ten years, ticking off the hours, forexactly the right moment to put an end to his existence. It was, in any case, afascinating human experience, to which he knew just how to give that peculiartragic-comic twist which was unique to himself.”33 One doesn’t want to denyBreton his insight into his friends’ lives and deaths, but it is interesting howoften they seem to coincide with his own personal mythology.Jacques Rigaut resembles Vaché in another way: his literary remains are veryslim, and what there are of them display an obsessive preoccupation withsuicide. This was something that was more or less applauded by those of hisfriends who enjoyed a greater literary girth. For Paul Eluard, “The weapon aimedat life by the suicide is always right. No rubble nor ruins shall be leftstanding after the will which burns and destroys everything has passed by. Butsuch an act leaves the strength of whoever has committed it intact. The regretat having been born and the need to die vanish with the world they have killed.”For Breton, “Jacques Rigaut … slips a revolver under his pillow every evening.Such is his way of expressing agreement with the generally held opinion that thenight will give you council, and of hoping to dispose of the malefactors within,in other words all conventional means of adaptation.” Yet for the successfulportrait painter Jacques-Emile Blanche, for whom Rigaut worked as a secretary,and who seemed to understand him better than his younger friends, “Theoreticsuicide, which was already all the fashion, and which was to become one of theleitmotifs of Surrealism, had left its funeral mark on him, even to hisaffectation of ‘accepting’ a life of the most conventional and futile sort.”34He was also for Blanche, “one of those wayward sons for whom a mother, a father,his sisters are everyday led to fear the worst.”35Like Vaché, Rigaut’s contribution to Dada, and later to Surrealism, was his“total world weariness and cynical humour,”36 a qualification that, however,could be applied to practically all of his compatriots. He once toldJacques-Émile Blanche that during the war he had “no feeling whatsoever as hesaw his dearest comrade drop at his side,” displaying a predilection for ‘umourthat no doubt would have met with Vaché’s approval. But to the more perceptive,Rigaut’s “haughty attitude,” which was “quite in fashion at the time in Dadacircles,” was merely “the absurd braggadocio of a mild and timid being.”37 Yetthis mild and timid being was obsessed with his own death.Although at times Rigaut’s take on suicide was equivocal – “There are no reasonsfor living, but there are also no reasons for dying either,” he wrote, “Life isnot worth the trouble of departing from it”38 – these hesitations are perhapsthe somewhat mandatory expressions of a truly total world-weariness, weary evenof itself. But on the whole, suicide was something he identified with deeply.“As long as I cannot overcome my taste for pleasure, I well know that I shall besusceptible to the intoxication of suicide.”39 “Try, if you can, to arrest a manwho travels with suicide in his buttonhole.”40 “Suicide should be a vocation.”41In a sketch published many years after his death, “The General Suicide Agency,”Rigaut is “pleased to announce to its clients that it can now GUARANTEE THEM ANINSTANTANEOUS DEATH,” a claim that promises to be attractive to those who putoff killing themselves “for fear of making a mess,”42 and an idea that RobertLouis Stevenson employed some years earlier (see “The Suicide Club” in ASuicidal Miscellany). In an untitled piece, Rigaut informs us that “The firsttime I killed myself it was to annoy my mistress.” The second time, he tells us,it was from laziness. And third time,I had just gone to bed after an evening on which my boredom had been no moreoverwhelming than any other night. I took the decision and, at the same time, Iclearly remember that I articulated the sole reason. Then, drat! I got up to goand look for the only weapon in the house, a little revolver that one of mygrandfathers had bought and which was loaded with bullets from the sameepoch … Lying down naked on my bed, I was naked in the room. It was cold.[Shades of Vaché!] I hurriedly buried myself under the blankets. I cocked thehammer, I could feel the cold of the steel in my mouth. At that moment I couldprobably feel my heart beating, just as I could feel it beating as I listened tothe whistle of a shell before it exploded, as if in the presence of somethingirrevocable but still unconsummated. I pressed the trigger, the hammer clicked,but the shot didn’t fire. I then laid the weapon on a small table … Ten minuteslater I was asleep … It goes without saying that I did not for an instantconsider firing a second shot.43Rigaut concludes by saying that, “The important thing was not whether I died ornot but that I had taken the decision to die.” It was a decision the fulfilmentof which came a decade later, although one wonders if at this point he hadalready begun the habit of making his decisions based on a throw of dice, amotif that would later be put to successful use by Luke Rhinehart, in his novelThe Dice Man. In the meantime, Rigaut engaged in what was increasingly thesurreal norm. After WWI, he worked, as mentioned, as a secretary forJacques-Émile Blanche. Then in 1924 he met a rich American divorcee – likeCrevel, he had an entrée into the world of money – and when she returned to NewYork, he followed her. They married, but it was not a success, and a year laterthey separated. Rigaut remained in New York where he lived in poverty and becameaddicted to alcohol and drugs, mostly heroin, again like Crevel. In 1928 hereturned to France, where he admitted himself to several detoxification clinics,hoping to kick his habit, but with little luck. We don’t know whether he threwhis dice or not, but on November 5, 1929, he finally came around to firing thatsecond shot, that he put on hold ten years earlier. In a clinic atChâtenay-Malabry, “after paying minute attention to his toilette, and carryingout all the necessary external adjustments demanded of such a departure”44(again the similarity to Vaché is striking), Rigaut placed a rubber sheet underhis body, lined up the trajectory of the bullet with a ruler, and, using apillow to muffle the sound, shot himself through the heart.Rigaut’s “affectation” of a “most conventional life,” which included doing hisbest not to leave a mess or to disturb his fellow patients, must rank as one ofthe most considerate suicides on record, perhaps topped only by theGerman-Jewish writer Egon Friedell who, facing arrest and deportation to a deathcamp, chose instead to throw himself out of a window, calling to the peoplebelow to “watch out.” Friedell belongs to the Political Suicides. They may ormay not have been a polite bunch, but as we will see in the next section, he wassadly not alone.Notes 1 Satie’s score, considered revolutionary at the time, owes much to anearlier and sadly little-known pioneer in the art of ‘noise composition’, theSymbolist and Futurist painter and ‘noisician’ Luigi Russolo.

Breton was, to be sure, not the only surrealist whoindulged in visions of violence. Salvador Dali once remarked, apropos of ananarchist bomb planted in a first class carriage of a train, that planting it ina third class one would have made a greater scandal. He went on to declare that,aside from its political and surreal value, blowing up the poor was a form ofsexual perversion for him, providing “erection, irresistible masturbatorydesires, [and] splendid wet dreams.” Quoted in Ruth Brandon Surreal Live: TheSurrealists (Macmillan: London, 1999) p. 395. 3 André Breton Conversations: The Autobiography of Surrealism (Paragon House:New York, 1993) p. 19. 4 Ibid. p. 17. 5 Mark Polizzotti Revolution of The Mind: The Life of André Breton(Bloomsbury: London, 1995) p. 61; Ruth Braddon Surreal Lives: The Surrealists(Macmillan: London, 1999) p. 11. 6 Mark Polizzotti, p. 38. 7 Ruth Brandon, p. 28. 8 The other literary figure that Vaché had something good to say about was,oddly enough, André Gide, whose Les Caves du Vatican was a favourite among theproto-surrealists. Gide’s hero, Lafcadio, is given to what Gide calls‘gratuitous acts,’ such as murdering a stranger on a train for no apparentreason, what we today would call a ‘motiveless’ killing. Lafcadio’s ‘gratuitousacts’ share much with the behaviour of Dostoyevsky’s Stavrogin, whose penchantfor performing ‘unnecessary’ acts of evil included rape and near murder.Although Gide maintained that Lafcadio was pure invention, Jean Cocteau claimedthat the character was based on the boxing Dadaist Arthur Cravan. Vaché, Cravanand Stavrogin are, of course, all examples of the literary suicide. For aninteresting treatment of the ‘gratuitous act’ and its relation to the‘motiveless crime’, see “The Passive Fallacy” in Colin Wilson Order of Assassins(Panther: St. Albans, 1975). 9 The attraction that the image of the perfectly dressed, restrainedEnglishman had on the early avant-garde warrants a study; along with Vaché andJarry, the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa also sported a bowler and other‘perfectly English’ attire.10 Ruth Brandon, p. 27.11 Mark Polizzotti, introduction to André Breton Anthology of Black Humour(City Lights: San Francisco, 1999). p.v.12 Jacques Vaché and André Breton War Letters (Atlas Press: London, 1993) p.56.13 Ibid. pp. 57–58.14 Quoted in Polizzotti p. 87.15 Ibid.16 Breton, Anthology of Black Humour p. 294.17 Vaché War Letters p. 50.18 Ibid. p. 54.19 Ibid. pp. 48–4920 Ibid. p. 53.21 Ibid. p. 20.22 At one of the many and interminable meetings of the Surrealist group chairedby Breton, in which sex was the topic of discussion, he once threatened to walkout if Man Ray, Louis Aragon and Raymond Queneau persisted in their “promotionof homosexuality. “I am absolutely opposed to continuing the discussion of thissubject …” Quoted in José Pierre ed.

Jouffroy, incidentally, is associated with the philosopherWilliam James’ own retreat from suicide and his recovery from what we are forcedto call ‘depression’. During a period of deep existential despair – brought onby his acknowledgement of the ostensible scientific ‘fact’ of determinism – inwhich James likened himself to a catatonic patient he treated in a mentalasylum, he pulled himself back from the brink of suicide through readingJouffroy, whose ‘proof’ of free will – the fact that he could think of one thingrather than another – was sufficient encouragement for James to fight back. “Myfirst act of free will,” James declared, “would be to believe in free will.”25 There is some suspicion that the suicide was prompted by his involvement in“some homosexual scandal.” See Edouard Roditi’s introduction to Crevel’s novelPutting My Foot in It (Dalkey Archive Press: Illinois, 1992.) p. xx.26 Salvador Dali, preface to René Crevel Difficult Death (North Point Press:San Francisco, 1986).

Word had got around that,against his wishes, his parents were to ensure that he received a properCatholic burial. Breton and Co. gathered at the cemetery, intent on disruptingthe proceedings. But in the end their vigil was unnecessary, as the parishpriest made clear that the church does not bury suicides.32 Quoted in Terry Hale, introduction to Jacques Rigaut Lord Patchogue & OtherTexts (Atlas Press: London, 1993) p. 7.33 Ibid. p. 8.34 Ibid. p. 6.35 From Jacques-Émile Blanche A Young Man of the Century quoted in 4 DadaSuicides p. 124.36 Ibid. p. 8.37 4 Dada Suicides p. 124–12638 Ibid. p. 120.39 Ibid. p. 122.40 Lord Patchogue & Other Texts p. 51.41 Ibid. p. 58.42 4 Dada Suicides p. 97.43 Ibid. pp. 122–123.44 André Breton Anthology of Black Humour p. 310."},{"pageContent":"THE POLITICAL SUICIDE [table_of_contents.htm#ch5]“In a situation with no escape, I have no other choice but to finish it all. Itis in a tiny village in the Pyrenees, where no one knows me, that my life mustcome to its end. I would ask you to pass on my thoughts to my friend Adorno andto explain to him the situation in which I have found myself. I no longer haveenough time to write all those letters I would dearly have written.”1Such are the last words reportedly written by the German-Jewish literary criticand philosopher of culture Walter Benjamin. Benjamin had penned them in PortBou, Spain, on the evening of 25 September 1940, presumably after he hadswallowed the overdose of morphine that, by the next day, would kill him. Thenote was intended for Henny Gurland, later the second wife of the psychologistErich Fromm; with her son Joseph, Benjamin, and a guide, Gurland was trying toescape the Nazis by fleeing France, crossing the Pyrenees into Spain, andreaching Lisbon, where they could board a ship for the United States.2 The“friend Adorno” is the neo-Marxist philosopher Theodore Adorno who, withhindsight, had the good sense to escape Europe before the tide of barbarismprovided by Hitler and his henchmen made that impossible. Benjamin too, had manychances to escape before fate led him to the small Catalan village on theMediterranean coast, just south of the French-Spanish border, where he took hislife. Yet, although friends and associates urged him to leave, Benjaminmaintained his position as “the last European,” assuring them that he was, “Likeone who keeps afloat on a shipwreck by climbing to the top of a mast that isalready crumbling. But from there he has a chance to give a signal leading tohis rescue.”3The recipient of this remark, the Kabbalist scholar Gershom Scholem, Benjamin’sfriend since 1915, had taken leave of what would become a very dark continentyears before, and he repeatedly urged Benjamin to join him in Palestine. ButBenjamin was never one to decide things quickly – he would, Scholem said, takeforever to make a move in chess, exhibiting a “reckless indecision rooted inchronic depression”4 – and one wonders if sheer vacillation was as much aninfluence on his reluctance to leave as was his determination to see things outto the end. Another possibility, one rarely voiced (as, since his ‘discovery’ inthe 1960s, Benjamin has become a major intellectual cult figure for the Left),is that his personality had a very strong self-destructive streak, as well asmore than a touch of narcissism. While the Europe around him sank into crueltyand madness, Benjamin may have enjoyed his status as a last, lingering agent ofreason and humanity.There was, too, in Benjamin an appreciation of the apocalyptic. Although cloakedin Marxist rhetoric, Benjamin’s philosophy was essentially religious, as Scholemwould ceaselessly argue contra Adorno and Brecht (another of Benjamin’sfriends), and his vision of history was messianic; he seemed to be awaiting somefinal, conclusive event, whether revolutionary or theological, which wouldrestore the fallen world to paradise. In an essay on “The DestructiveCharacter,” which, for all his obsessive mandarin courtesy and tact5, can applyto Benjamin himself, he says that such a temperament “knows only one watchword:make room; only one activity: clearing away.”6 Benjamin was a reader of theanarchist philosopher George Sorrell and, like the Surrealists, had a penchantfor violence. In torturously reasoned essays like “Critique of Violence” and his“Theologico-Political Fragment,” Benjamin leads the reader to see the need forthe “violence of divine intervention” and the necessity for “suddeneschatological change.”7 Eruptions, cataclysms, disasters fascinated Benjamin,and he liked to imagine himself as a sole surveyor, walking amidst their ruins;“solitude,” he once said, “appeared to me as the only fit state of man.”In one of his most frequently quoted essays, “Theses on the Philosophy ofHistory,” Benjamin describes history not as “a chain of events,” but as “asingle catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage.”8 Looking atBenjamin’s life, it’s tempting to turn the metaphor on its author, and to seehis choice of suicide as a final surrender to his inherent millenarianpersonality. As his biographer Momme Brodersen remarked, “The temptation to‘solve’ all his existential problems in one go by suicide had followed Benjaminthroughout his life.”9 How such a melancholy temperament, “born under the signof Saturn, the star of slowest revolution, the planet of detours and delays …”could align itself, however equivocally, with as superficial and shallowlyoptimistic a creed as Marxism, is only one of the many ironies in his shortlife.Benjamin’s flight from the Nazis, his doomed last days and suicide, have by nowpassed into the realm of myth. In 1968, during the brief explosion of thestudent revolutions, the Institute for German Studies in Frankfurt was renamedtemporarily the Walter Benjamin Institute, in honour of the post-humous hero ofthe New Left. In 1994, the Israeli artist Dani Karavans unveiled his memorial toBenjamin, “Passages,” an eerie flight of steps leading nowhere, cut into thestone of the cliff overlooking the Mediterranean near the cemetery whereBenjamin is believed to be buried, although exactly where his grave is remainsunknown.10 More recently, Benjamin’s last days have been fictionalised in JayParini’s moving novel Benjamin’s Crossing, in which the author takes poeticliberty and suggests that it was not the threat of arrest and the dead end of aconcentration camp that killed Benjamin; rather, “It was the world itself. Hecould no longer attach himself willingly to its bleak trajectory.”11Although during his lifetime Benjamin published few books and was virtuallyunknown – the bulk of his work appearing in newspapers and journals – and hisgreat opus the ‘Arcades Project’ remained unfinished, perhaps unfinishable,today practically everything he wrote has been preserved between two covers, andmost of this has been translated into other languages. A virtual ‘Benjaminindustry’ has grown up around his writings, producing hundreds of texts, most ofthem as obscure and esoteric as the original. Even the image of Benjamin – metalrim glasses, tousled hair, bushy moustache, hand at pensive chin sporting acigarette – has appeared on T-shirts and other popular paraphernalia. (The factthat, among other things, he wrote about hashish and popular culture has helpedspread his reputation to readers not usually given to messianic neo-Marxistcritiques of late-capitalism.) Yet, while much of Benjamin’s work still remainssomewhat impenetrable for the general reader, many of his more immediatelyavailable pronouncements on culture and society have not fared well against thefacts. In perhaps his most well known essay, “The Work of Art in the Age ofMechanical Reproduction,” Benjamin argued that technology – in his day thecinema and radio – would be put to use in the service of the ‘revolution’,dissipating the elitist ‘aura’ surrounding works of art, and allowing the massesa hitherto denied access to culture. Admittedly it was an idea shared by otherradical thinkers of the time, but one wonders how Benjamin would view theubiquitous I-pod or tally up the revolutionary potential of Big Brother? AldousHuxley, whom Benjamin quotes in the notes to his essay as an example of a‘non-progressive’ attitude toward the technological advances in popular culture,seems, in Brave New World and elsewhere, to have hit the nail on the head,perhaps heavy-handedly but certainly more accurately than Benjamin and the other‘radicals’ who envisioned the ‘masses’ ‘liberated’ by ‘mechanical reproduction’.As mentioned in the preceding chapter, the ‘revolutionary’ power of Surrealismadded up to a glut of by now barely noticeable images crowding postcard racksand poster shops, and the only liberation enjoyed by the masses seems to be thefreedom to purchase them.12It is perhaps a churlish thought, but one further wonders how pervasive‘Benjaminmania’ would be if its subject had taken the repeated advice of friendsand left his “crumbling mast” while he still had a chance and not continued onto an end that those closest to him, like Scholem, believed he was headingtoward well in advance of Port Bou? I have read and continue to read Benjaminwith much profit and sympathise with his plight, but there is something annoyingabout a man who refuses to leave a burning building, and at each suggestion todo so replies, “Yes, in a few minutes, after I finish this paragraph …”13Whatever the intrinsic value of his work, and of course this is substantial, thecachet of being a martyr to the cause of radical politics, critical thinking,modernity and ‘otherness’ – the sacrificial victim of an unequivocal fascism –cannot have hurt the cult that has mushroomed around Benjamin since his death.As Peter Demetz ironically remarks, “for the last seven years of his life,Walter Benjamin was condemned to a way of life closely resembling that of theémigré extras in Rick’s Café in Casablanca …”14 Romantic to us, perhaps, but itmust have been hell for Benjamin.Although Benjamin was not the only German writer to be led to suicide by thetriumph of Nazism – Stefan Zweig and Klaus Mann are among some of the others –his death has become something of an archetype of the political literarysuicide. The facts of his death seem to be the following. When it became cleareven to Benjamin that he could no longer remain in France – having exiledhimself there from Germany when the Nazis came to power – he decided to try toreach Lisbon where he would be able to use exit visas for the United Statesprovided by Max Horkheimer, Adorno’s colleague at the Institute for SocialResearch, which had relocated from Frankfurt to New York, and from whom Benjaminhad been receiving a barely liveable monthly stipend. Benjamin had alreadyendured being corralled with other German refugees at the Stade Colombe in Parisin September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, and England and France declaredwar on the Third Reich. Although like most other refugees Benjamin wasunambiguously anti-Nazi, the French authorities made no such distinctions, andannounced that all Germans, Austrians, Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians betweenthe ages of 17 and 50 were to be interned as potential ‘enemies of France’15.Along with the thousands of others who crowded into the football stadium,Benjamin lived for ten days in appalling conditions, sleeping on straw withoutblankets, eating nothing but cheap liver paté, with no facilities for washing orbathing. He was then sent to an internment camp at Nevers, a small town on theroute between Paris and Lyon. The French, who were themselves taken by surpriseby the sudden turn of events, made little or no provisions for their prisoners,and Benjamin, who was inordinately impractical (he blamed his mother for his“inability even today to make a cup of coffee”)16 had to fend for himself. Hehad the rare good fortune, however, of meeting a young man who was a reader ofhis work, and who gladly took on the task of taking care of the older writer(although only 47, Benjamin had the appearance and deportment of someone mucholder) and becoming, more or less, his servant (even in prison, Benjaminretained the habits of his upper middle-class background). He was finallyreleased from the camp after more than a month through the efforts of the FrenchPEN Club.Back in Paris, the reality of the situation finally hit Benjamin; yet he triedto continue work on his interminable ‘Arcades Project’, a practicallyindefinable study of the philosophical, social and historical significance ofthe Paris arcades (a similar work today might have the shopping mall as itsfocus). Although there is some controversy about this, it’s believed that thebulky suitcase Benjamin lugged with him from Paris to the Pyrenées contained amanuscript of his gigantic fragment, and he’s said to have told his companionsthat it was more important that the suitcase got to America than that he did.17After Benjamin’s death, the suitcase was confiscated by the police; its contentswere later scattered or destroyed. What exactly the manuscript he carried in itwas, remains unknown.When Hitler’s army crossed the border and headed toward Paris, the city emptied,its fleeing inhabitants adding to the millions who were already heading southfrom Belgium and northern France. Overweight, inept, exhausted, and unhealthy(he suffered from a heart complaint), Benjamin joined the mass exodus. Beforemarching south, Benjamin managed to put the bulk of his papers in safekeeping,giving a collection of notes for the ‘Arcades Project’ to the renegadeSurrealist Georges Bataille, who hid them in the Bibliothèque Nationale, wherehe worked as a librarian. What he couldn’t take with him was confiscated by theGestapo when they raided his flat. At Lourdes he waited throughout the summerfor the entry permit to the United States; then, in late August, he went toMarseilles to collect the emergency visa Horkheimer had arranged for him. Notsurprisingly, Benjamin couldn’t gather all the papers he needed to leave Francelegally, and he uncharacteristically quickly decided to cross the border intoSpain without them. It was a wise decision: Pétain’s government soon agreed tohand over all emigrants found in Vichy France to the Nazis as well.At first light on 26 September 1940, Lisa Fittko, a guide not entirely familiarwith the terrain, set out from Banylus-sur-Mer with Henny Gurland and her son,to cross the mountains into Spain. The previous day Benjamin had taken part in ahiking tour; when the rest of the group returned, he stayed behind, spending thenight in the open air on the mountain. That morning the others collected him,and together they headed toward the village of Port Bou. Although Benjamin’shealth required frequent stops, the journey went smoothly, and the route thegroup took had recently been taken by Heinrich Mann, his wife, Alma Mahler andFranz Werfel. (One wonders if today it’s marked as the ‘escaping intellectuals’hiking trail?) By the afternoon they reached their goal, and from Port Bou theyhoped to journey to Lisbon by train, and from there to New York.But bad luck – something that Hannah Arendt claimed “was very prominent inBenjamin’s life”18 – was waiting for “the last European.” On announcingthemselves to the Spanish police, the group were told that the transit visaswhich until then were valid, were no longer so, having been made null and voidovernight. All refugees from France, they were informed, were to be sent back.Benjamin knew what this meant and not surprisingly he decided to forego thepleasure. Benjamin had written that, “The destructive character lives from thefeeling, not that life is worth living, but that suicide is not worth thetrouble,”19 a sentiment echoed by many throughout this book. On that afternoon,after a long, exhausting and apparently fruitless journey to freedom, he seemedto decide it was worth the trouble after all. That night Benjamin is thought tohave swallowed an overdose of morphine tablets, a supply of which he had carriedwith him for many years. He had in fact given Arthur Koestler, who himself wason the run, some of his stash when they met in Marseilles, just beforeBenjamin’s last journey. (Koestler was Benjamin’s neighbour in Paris, and thetwo were members of a weekly poker group – Benjamin had a weakness for gambling.Benjamin asked Koestler if he “had anything to take” in case “things wentwrong;” when Koestler said he hadn’t, Benjamin gave him half of his own supply;Koestler remarks that Benjamin did this reluctantly, unsure if what was leftwould do the trick.)20It’s unclear whether the morphine alone killed Benjamin, or whether his deathwas a result of the combination of exertion, the effects of the drugs, and hisweak heart. Or again, whether he actually took the drug at all. Or, yet again,whether what he took was morphine or some generic sedative. The exact time, too,of his death is also uncertain. What is known is that the next day, when thepolice came to escort Benjamin and the others to the French border, theydiscovered that he was dead. In a cruel display of irony, the police thendecided to forget the new regulations, and allowed Henny Gurland and her son tocarry on with their journey. It may have been that their orders had again beenchanged, or perhaps they were mistaken about them in the first place. Again, ashas been suggested, the shock of Benjamin’s death may have moved the guards andthey may have allowed his companions to go because of this. If this was thecase, and if Benjamin did commit suicide, then his death is a rare example ofsomething good emerging from someone’s self-destruction.That the myth that has grown up around Benjamin’s death may be rooted in muddleand sheer bad luck is possible, as apparently a great deal in his life was. YetGershom Scholem had no doubts that his long time friend had taken his life.Suicide was not something foreign to him. At the outbreak of WWI, Benjamin’sclosest friend, the poet Fritz Heinle, and his fiancée Rika Seligson, gassedthemselves. Fritz’s brother, Wolf, decided to follow suit, and, as MommeBrodersen explains, neither Benjamin nor any of his friends felt compelled toprevent him. As with Jacques Vaché, the war had provoked a kind of violentnihilism in Benjamin’s peers: “Those close to [Wolf] had adopted the samegesture, the same smile (of being over and above everything) and the samephysical movements as he.”21 Scholem gives additional evidence that suicide wasan option open to Benjamin, whether he was escaping from the Nazis or not.Diaries from 1931 show that Benjamin was not only a destructive, but aself-destructive character. Scholem speaks of Benjamin’s “increasing readinessto take his own life.” “This was probably due […] to his ‘general battle fatigueon the economic front’ and his feeling that basically he had lived his life inthe fulfilment of his greatest desires.”22 A later diary of the same year wasdated “from the seventh of August nineteen hundred and thirty-one to the day ofdeath,” and began, “This diary does not promise to be long.”23Although both the general social and political situation, as well as Benjamin’sown personal economic prospects, were bleak (throughout his career as a writer,Benjamin pretty much lived in poverty), another factor, not mentioned in otheraccounts, may have been in play. By this time Benjamin had read with greatinterest Hesse’s Steppenwolf – indeed, his experiments with hashish wereprompted by the drug experiences depicted in the book – and the idea of suicide,latent in Benjamin, may have been stimulated by the novel.24 A year later, in1932, in Nice, Benjamin again considered suicide, this time occasioned by hisfortieth birthday; he made elaborate plans to carry it out, and wrote letters offarewell, but then suddenly abandoned the idea. On yet another occasion he wroteto Scholem, telling him of an evening he spent, drinking a glass of wine,waiting for a guest to join him. The ‘guest’, Scholem surmised, was death.Summing up Benjamin’s situation, Scholem wrote: “After all I have told here itis evident that Walter repeatedly reckoned with the possibility of his suicideand prepared for it. He was convinced that another war would mean a gas war andbring with it the end of civilization. Thus what finally happened after hecrossed the Spanish border was not a surprising irrational act but something hehad prepared inwardly for. Despite all the astonishing patience he displayed inthe years after 1933 […] he was not tough enough for the events of 1940.”25*Mention of Benjamin’s fear of “gas war” which would “bring with it the end ofcivilization,” reminds us of another literary suicide who “was not tough enoughfor the events of 1940,” although his own death anticipated Benjamin’s by ayear. Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz – otherwise known as Witkacy, a name he tookto distinguish himself from his father, a well known art critic, painter andauthor – was perhaps the most important figure of the Polish avant-garde in theearly twentieth century, although at the time of his death on 18 September 1939he was little known outside of a small circle of friends and other artists. Asfearful of the spread of western capitalism as he was of the rise of communism –both ideologies, he believed, spelled doom for the individual – on hearing thatthe Russian army had crossed the border into Poland (a result of the infamousnon-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin), Witkacy took an overdose ofveronal and slit his wrists. His mistress tried to accompany him in death byalso taking an overdose, but she survived.A polymath, Witkacy applied himself to a dizzying number of disciplines,producing influential work in painting, theatre, and the novel; he also wroteimportant theoretical essays on aesthetics, most of them focusing on the problemof “Pure Form.” The novel, however, for Witkacy wasn’t an art form; it was a“sack” into which the writer could throw whatever interested him, and probablyhis most famous work in the genre, Insatiability, is a good example of histheory put into practice. An account of a young Pole’s adventures during theimminent breakdown of western civilization following an invasion by a CommunistChina (it was written in 1927, well in advance of Mao), it’s been described byCzeslaw Milosz as being “a study of decay: mad, dissonant music; eroticperversion; widespread use of narcotics; dispossessed thinking; falseconversions to Catholicism; and complex psychopathic personalities.”26 For areader used to the straightforward narrative of the realistic novel, Witkacy’sown authorial self in Insatiability can at times fall under this last category.Among many other things (Witkacy’s novels tend to be rather large ‘sacks’) inInsatiability, Witkacy blended scenes of violent eroticism with critiques ofEdmund Husserl, Rudolph Carnap and other contemporary philosophers. Husserl andCarnap were targets for Witkacy because he was a philosopher himself, oneobsessed with “the mystery of existence;” his main work in this area is Conceptsand Theorems Implied by the Concept of Being. He dedicated his life toconfronting the primal questions: “Why am I this and not any other being? Inthis place of infinite space and at this moment of infinite time? In this groupof beings, on this planet? Why indeed do I exist? I could have not existed atall;” queries that place him firmly in the existentialist camp, although Witkacywas plumbing these uncomfortable depths years before they became fashionable onthe Left Bank. Along with these main lines of work, Witkacy threw himself intoseveral other areas of exploration. He experimented with and wrote about avariety of drugs: peyote, morphine, cocaine, ether, nicotine and alcohol; in the1920s, there were scandalous reports of drug and alcohol ridden ‘orgies’ takingplace among his associates. After the suicide of his fiancée in 1914, just afterhis twenty-ninth birthday, in an attempt to get over his depression, heaccompanied the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski on his first scientificexpedition to Australia and the South Seas. As a young man he cultivated thefriendship of fellow artists like Karol Szymanowski,27 Arthur Rubenstein, andSholem Asch; later his circle included Bruno Schulz, Witold Gombrowicz andTadeus Micin´ski.Yet although Witkacy shares being a political suicide with Benjamin, theircharacters are as unlike each other as can be imagined. Where Benjamin lackedspontaneity, even, perhaps, a personality – Adorno said of him that “there wassomething almost incorporeal about him … he seemed alienated from his ownphysis … he seems hardly to have been a person at all …”28 – Witkacy was a‘multiple personality’, an instinctive and incessant self-dramatist whodisconcertingly adopted numerous poses, guises and costumes in order to shockhis acquaintances into a more vivid appreciation of life’s ‘strangeness’.Although Witkacy’s role-playing has echoes of Jacques Vaché, and his need toadopt different identities – based on a fundamentally weak self image – canremind us of Fernando Pessoa’s numerous ‘heteronyms’, there was something moreserious behind these tactics, a concern with human psychology that suggests morea parallel with the psycho-drama of the enigmatic Armenian esoteric teacher G.I.Gurdjieff, than with the narcissistic self-absorption of Vaché.29Witkacy would ring a doorbell, then crouch down on all fours before it opened,in order to see the reaction to this. He wore cowboy hats and phosphorescentties. While in conversation, he would suddenly turn away for a moment; when heturned back, his eyes would be covered with two halved ping-pong balls, theircentres pierced so he could see through them. He had a talent for mimicry andwould impersonate his acquaintances, often acting out elaborate scenes betweenthem. He would gather a crowd of ‘odd’ visitors and then turn up with them at astranger’s door. On one occasion he cajoled the poet Aleksander Wat intopretending to be an Italian aristocrat; during the course of the evening, Watdrank so much that he eventually became convinced that he was Italian, ran amok,and had to be restrained. At social gatherings Witkacy would give his friendsvarious roles they were to perform, and he would scold them vigorously if theyfailed to take them seriously. He would see visitors in bed, in his nightclothes, but on occasion naked. During a conversation he would suddenly adoptthe role of a drunk, or a policeman. At a restaurant he would order a cutlet andwhen it arrived slip it into his wallet. He also had a touch ofobsessive-compulsive disorder, and would wash his hands several times a day, aritual probably prompted by a fear of venereal disease which began after a visitto a prostitute in his youth. Yet, along with displaying Witkacy’s knack forabsurdist comedy and existential psycho-drama, these antics indicated somethingelse as well. “From periodical, most acute, ghastly fits of spleen” one friendremembered, “Witkacy switched to violent outbursts of biological robustness.”30It wouldn’t be surprising if Witkacy’s penchant for constant novelty grew out ofa need to fend off some deeper sense of emptiness. The philosopher RomanIngarden said of him: “He was a man full of shyness and anxiety as to theessential value of his own artistic and scholarly achievements. He alsofrequently occupied beforehand and totally unnecessarily an aggressive-defensiveposition … In company he often behaved in an extravagant way in order to coverup for his discomfort and to overcome shyness … He could sense in himself somedeficiency, some distressing void in the final core of his personality …”31 Andnot everyone was amused by his behaviour. The novelist Witold Gombrowicz, whosaid of Insatiability that it had demolished the genre of the novel itself “in amanner far exceeding the ruthlessness of a Virginia Woolf, James Joyce or FranzKafka,” found Witkacy’s ‘theatre’ annoying. “From the first moment, Witkacytired and bored me – he could never relax, was always tense, badgering himselfand others with his constant theatricals, the urge to make an impression andfocus everyone’s attention on himself, always toying with people cruelly andpainfully.”32 Gombrowicz recognized that there was something “truly dramatic” toWitkacy’s ‘games’. Yet “one got the impression that something remarkable wasbecoming distorted and pushed to the bottom of painful tomfoolery.” Gombrowiczcame to the conclusion that in Poland “superiority and inferiority are incapableof co-existing and instead plunge one another into farce.”33Gombrowicz’s recognition of “the urge to make an impression” seems accurate, andcan be seen in Witkacy’s fascination with being photographed, a trait he sharedwith the Japanese novelist – and fellow literary suicide – Yukio Mishima. Yet inpractically every photograph I’ve seen of Witkacy, he is in costume, or in a‘role’ and in some way ‘acting out’, and the effect, after a time, is wearying.A well known photograph of Witkacy, Multiplied Self-portrait reflected inMirrors, has him in his army uniform – he was in the Russian army during WWI –facing a corner where two large mirrors connect. The viewer then sees fourimages of Witkacy – two profiles and two full faces – but, with his back to theviewer, Witkacy’s own face is hidden. His painting is also full of manyself-portraits, most of them with ‘piercing’ eyes. Where is Witkacy? It seemsclear that he himself didn’t know.34 Linked to this compulsion – the termdoesn’t seem an exaggeration – is Witkacy’s professed need for other people,that is, an audience. In his drama The Mother he writes, “I am like some highlycharged missile that is laying calmly in a meadow. But so far there has been nocannon and no one to launch me. And I cannot do it by myself – I have to havepeople.”35Such self-obsession born of a tenuous ego not uncommonly prompts an attractionto suicide. At an early age, Witkacy developed a strange, near schizophrenicdetachment from himself. He saw his own life and existence as an object ofstudy. As a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Cracow, he told his friendsthat he “would like to take a look at myself during my death, when full freedomis reached for interpretation of pure aesthetic experiences dissolved into one!I imagine the loss of the proportions of my body and the growing devastation ofmy consciousness. It must be very exciting. Perhaps someday I shall be able, atleast for a minute, to imitate the work of death.”36 Unlike Thomas LovellBeddoes – see ‘Ten Suicides’ – who developed a fascination with the dead body,Witkacy’s obsession seemed to be with the actual process of dying. This kind ofself-obsession can also prompt profound feelings of dissociation. In 1913, whilehis father, with whom he had a long and difficult relationship, was ill, Witkacylived with his mother at the boarding house she ran to supplement her incomefrom music lessons. Witkacy felt a deep self-contempt, considering himself aparasite – he was twenty-eight and not earning any money; during most of hislife he was dependent on his family – which resulted in a kind of ‘other self’or Doppelgänger taking over his identity. He suffered hallucinations andhysterical fits and sought treatment from the first Polish Freudianpsychiatrist. This crisis came to a head in early 1914, when, as mentioned, hisfiancée killed herself, presumably over an affair with the composer Szymanowski.Madness, death and suicide not surprisingly became central themes in Witkacy’swork.The trigger for Witkacy’s actual suicide, however, was something other than hislong fascination with death. As mentioned, Insatiability depicts the imminentbreakdown of western civilization; as such, it’s been described as “a metaphorof total suicide.”37 Predating Huxley and Orwell and written in the same yearthat Yevgeny Zamyatin’s We was first published in its original Russian,38Insatiability gives a demonic form to Witkacy’s long felt apprehension about acoming European catastrophe, a socio-political cataclysm that would result in“the ultimate metamorphosis of mankind into a collectivised, technologized, andasexual beehive.”39 Witkacy had long feared that modern man was moving toward atechnologically propelled totalitarian society, in which the individual –specifically, individuals like himself, artistic, philosophical, and out of theordinary – would become obsolete. As war clouds gathered once again over Europe,and the rise of both Fascism and Communism seemed to insure the collapse ofwestern democracy (about which Witkacy held no illusions), Witkacy’s ownpersonal depression and sense of failure combined to create an atmosphere ofimminent doom. He had no money, his work had received repeated criticalrejection, and his relationships with women were less than successful. By thelate thirties, Witkacy had stopped writing plays and had practically given uppainting, and had devoted himself almost solely to philosophy, beginning a longcorrespondence with the philosopher Hans Cornelius. Friends detected in him agrowing gloom, and a return of his fascination with suicide. He spoke of it as a“necessity.” “There is much I could endure,” he told a friend, “but I couldnever stand to be tortured … What awaits us in the near future is one enormousconcentration camp.”40To another friend he declared, shortly before committing suicide:You have no idea what a hell awaits this world … a hell very few willsurvive … Not a single stone will be left standing of our generation or ourage… . We are the new Atlantis which is being inundated by a ferocious flood,along with all our theories with which we tried unsuccessfully to subdue lifeand to plumb its mysterious mechanism; with our hysterical catastrophism, asrefined and heady as that whole decadent epoch of ours searching in vain for itscompass, a cursed epoch … I feel as if I, too, am nearing the end, along withthat epoch – I, who was always obsessed by a frantic desire to suck all themagic out of life and to discover its mystery, to transcend its laws andpenetrate its most essential meaning.41To another friend, Witkacy wrote: “I often think about suicide – that it’s goingto be necessary to bring my life to an end a bit earlier that way, out of asense of honour, so as not to live to see my own total comedown.”42His “total comedown” was avoided by the outbreak of WWII. Witkacy was in Warsawon 1 September 1939 when Germany invaded Poland. He had volunteered for militaryservice, but was rejected because of his age (fifty-four) and deterioratinghealth (like Benjamin, his heart was bad; he was also going deaf). So, likethousands of others, he joined the refugees fleeing to the eastern provinces,where it was hoped that a second front could be established. When the Germansbombed Brzes´c´, Witkacy and his lover Czeslawa Korzeniowska set out on footinto the Polish countryside, carrying knapsacks packed with food and clothing.Again like Benjamin, Witkacy was not really up to the journey; his legs werebad, and the couple had to make frequent stops. In the village of Jeziory hereached the end of his road. With the Nazis approaching from the west, Witkacyheard the news that on 17 September, the Russians had invaded from the east,intent on regaining land lost under the Tsar. Witkacy must have wished hisprophetic powers were less acute.Realizing there was nowhere to turn, Witkacy decided to end his life. Czeslawa’sdiary recounts that they went to the woods, and sat down under an oak. Witkacythen began to take ephedrine tablets, his experience with drugs being put to agrisly use. He intended to slash his wrist, and the ephedrine would help hisblood flow faster. Czeslawa was determined to join him, and the two drank amixture of luminal and cybalgine, then said goodbye. Witkacy slit his wrist but,like Seneca’s, the blood didn’t flow. He then tried a varicose vein in his leg,but this also didn’t work. As Czeslawa began to drift off, Witkacy told her towake up, and to not leave him alone. He then thought better of it and said,“Once you fall asleep, I’ll cut my throat.” He told her the name of the vein heintended to cut, and that if “you knew how to do it right, everything would gosmoothly” – which suggests that he had done some research on the matter. WhenCzeslawa woke the next morning, Witkacy’s body was lying next to her; she saidhis face had a look of relief, “a relaxing after a great fatigue.” Ironically,she was seeing double and once again Witkacy’s Doppelgänger had made anappearance. After feeble attempts to bury Witkacy, hampered by hersemi-consciousness, Czeslawa gave up. She was discovered, along with Witkacy’sbody, the next day.*Both Benjamin and Witkacy were destroyed by the totalitarian regimes they triedto escape, in Benjamin’s case the Nazis, in Witkacy’s both the Nazis and theSoviets. The case of the Russian Futurist poet Vladimir Mayakovsky differs fromboth in that his suicide was brought on at least in part by a regime he embracedand had even helped to put into power. Supplementing his own self-destructivetendencies with revolutionary fervour, Mayakovsky’s tragedy is that he was anexample of the successful revolution’s first rule of thumb: eradicate all otherrevolutionaries.Like Witkacy, Mayakovsky had a flair for the theatrical, a personality traitthat began at birth: he was born on his father’s birthday, 7 July 1893,something that delighted the family and seemed to mark him for some specialdestiny. Vladimir’s father was a hard working, good humoured forest ranger, aman who loved children and animals. He was a large man with a booming voice, andMayakovsky inherited both of these characteristics from him. It’s possible thathe also inherited something less welcome from his father. Just before Vladimir’sthirteenth birthday, his father died suddenly of septicaemia, from a pin prickon his finger that had become infected, and it’s believed that Mayakovsky’slater hypochondria and extreme fastidiousness stemmed from this incident; likeWitkacy, Mayakovsky developed a compulsion about hand washing. From an earlyage, Mayakovsky had been separated from his father and siblings because of alack of schools in their remote home village of Bagdadi (now renamed Mayakovski)in Georgia, near the town of Kutaisi; Vladimir had to be sent elsewhere for hiseducation, while his father remained in the forest. The possibility of livingtogether as a family again seemed imminent when the tragedy struck, and oneoutcome was that Mayakovsky was now the only male in the family (he had twosisters) and the responsibilities that accompanied this weighed on him. Thefamily’s financial prospects looked bleak; given that his father died before hehad reached fifty, his dependents weren’t entitled to a full pension, and theywere faced with having to support themselves on ten roubles a month. It’s fromthis time that “the famous Mayakovsky frown” first appeared. If photographs ofWitkacy give the impression of an almost infinitely pliable face, Mayakovksypresents the polar opposite. As A.D. P. Briggs remarks, “Almost every adultphotograph shows the poet with a severe expression, looking defensive,embarrassed, hostile, annoyed or merely preoccupied, but always serious mindedand unrelaxed. […] It was after the death of his father that Mayakovsky,otherwise a manly and handsome figure, first adopted the look of unremittingmoroseness by which he is now known.”43Like most poets, Mayakovsky was precocious. He taught himself to read at anearly age, enjoyed playing word games and displayed a remarkable memory; he wasoften asked by his father to recite some of his favourite poems. Theseperformances were characterized by a strong sense of rhyme and rhythm,characteristics that would become a part of Mayakovsky’s later popular readings.Being the son of a forest ranger might suggest that Vladimir was predestined tobe a nature poet, but something happened at the age of seven that led to verydifferent results. Accompanying his father on his rounds, they came across arivet factory in a ravine. Vladimir was astounded by the electric lightsilluminating the site. For the young boy it seemed that night had been banishedand daylight was now available on demand. Man had improved on nature and was nolonger its slave; machines, not nature, captured his imagination. A laterincident cemented Mayakovsky’s growing passion for the modern. In school, alarge portion of the tsarist curriculum involved readings from the scriptures,and Mayakovsky was surreptitiously tested on his biblical acumen by being askedthe meaning of the word oko, an archaic Church Slavonic equivalent of the modernRussia word for ‘eye’, glaz. In Georgian, however, it means ‘pound’ and this iswhat Vladimir answered. The incident stuck with him, and in an autobiographicalsketch he remarked, “So I immediately detested everything ancient, everythingchurchy, and everything Slavonic. Perhaps that was where my Futurism, my atheismand my internationalism came from.”44 Although resolutely anti-church andanti-religion, Mayakovsky’s poetry is full of references to God, some of themeerily prescient; in his poem “Man,” he ascends to heaven, where he soon becomesbored and returns to earth, only to discover that a thousand years earlier hehad shot himself.Mayakovsky’s rejection of everything ancient was given another prod in 1905 whenVladimir became involved in revolutionary activities. In Kutaisi, where he wasgoing to school and living with his mother, Mayakovsky was infected with therevolutionary spirit; he took to reading subversive literature and attendingunderground anti-tsarist discussion groups, happy to be accepted as an equal bythe older boys and adults. He passed around leaflets, put up posters and enjoyedsinging the Marseillaise. The posters and leaflets had a pro-found effect, asmany of them combined politics and poetry, something that Mayakovsky would soondo himself.A few months after his father’s death, his mother borrowed money from friendsand moved the family to Moscow. Here they didn’t escape poverty, but at leastthey were together – Vladimir’s sister Lyudmila had been studying there already.Mayakovsky’s struggle to survive strengthened his solidarity with the poor andquickened his disgust with the old regime. He was ecstatic about the move.Everything about the big city enchanted him; compared to the trams, cinemas,huge buildings and electric lights, nature was boring and slow, an appreciationforgotten by today’s ‘back to nature’ sensibility. Mayakovsky met morerevolutionary types and his increasing commitment to a new regime was validatedby getting himself arrested three times, once for participating in a prisonbreak, in which his whole family took part; his sisters and mother shared hisanti-tsarist sentiments. Although only fifteen, he spent several months in jail,part of this in solitary confinement, and the experience affected him deeply.For one thing it effectively ended his career as a revolutionary activist: hewas now known to the police and as a marked man was of no use to theunderground. The loneliness and insecurity of a prison cell would haunt him inlater years, yet his experience behind bars also suggested that there might bebetter ways of dragging Mother Russia into the modern world.One benefit was that in prison he had the leisure to devote himself to reading.As a boy he exhibited a talent for art and while behind bars he was allowed topaint, read and write as he desired. He read the Symbolists Andrei Bely andValery Briusov, but wasn’t impressed. He then tackled ‘world classics’ likeShakespeare and Byron. He was halfway through Anna Karenina when he wasreleased, and never bothered to finish it. Mayakovsky’s attitude toward literary‘greats’ is summed up in his remark that he had “no idea how the Kareninbusiness turned out.” Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and the rest were part of thecorrupt old world and he had come to do away with all that.Mayakovsky’s ‘futurism’ received its final confirmation at Moscow’s School ofPainting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he met an older student to whom hetook an immediate dislike. David Burlyuk was eleven years Mayakovsky’s senior,and in some ways he was Jacques Vaché to Mayakovsky’s Breton. Mayakovskyrestrained his headstrong personality in order to benefit from his lessons,exhibiting a talent for self-subduing that would later prove a kind of suicidein itself. Burlyuk had no such inhibitions: he was a dandy who wore pretentiousfrock-coats and lorgnettes and sang to himself as he walked. Mutual disregardblossomed into inevitable friendship when the two discovered each other walkingout of a Rachmaninov concert, bored to tears. Laughing, they spent the rest ofthe evening discussing how tedious everything in the art, literature and musicof the time was and how it was up to them to do something about it.Like the Dadaists, Italian Futurists, Surrealists and many other aestheticmovements of the early twentieth century, the Russian Futurists rejectedpractically everything that came before them, although perhaps because of theRussian temperament, which is given to exaggeration, they did so with a peculiarvehemence. The Russian Futurists – which, along with Mayakovsky and Burlyuk (whowas more of an impresario and promoter than an artist) included the poetsVassily Kamensky and Velimir Khlebnikov – did their best to draw attention tothemselves by dressing outlandishly and making outrageous statements. They worespoons in their button holes, painted on their faces, and gave poetry readingswith a grand piano suspended over their heads. Burlyuk once hired fifty youngboys to run through the street shouting, “The Futurists are coming.” (Along withTristan Tzara, Dali and, much later, Andy Warhol, Burlyuk understood that modernart was as much about publicity as it was about the art itself.) Mayakovskyhimself stood out in his famous yellow blouse (made by his mother), greenovercoat and top hat, over six feet tall and booming challenges like, “The pastsuffocates us. The Academy and Pushkin are more incomprehensible thanhieroglyphics. Throw Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, etc. overboard from thesteamship of modernity.” One gets an idea of their aesthetic programme from thetitle of an early anthology of Futurist poetry, A Slap in the Face of PublicTaste.Mayakovsky is one of the most vain modern poets; the personal pronoun “I”appears almost relentlessly in his poetry, and perhaps his best known poem, “ACloud in Trousers,” contains lines like “Glorify me!/ I’m beyond comparison withthe great/ I above every created thing place nihil.” An early work of this time,Vladimir Mayakovsky: A Tragedy, in which Mayakovsky portrays himself as acreature of supreme integrity and loftiness, gives an idea of what was in storefor him. It’s full of posturing and hunger for attention, but it also suggestsloneliness and self-pity, as well as suicidal feelings: at one point he tellsthe reader that he will lay down on a railroad track, and “the wheel of thelocomotive will embrace my neck.”. One biographer called the work “a celebrationof his genius as a poet, and the apotheosis of the Poet offering himself as asacrifice for the sufferings of all mankind.”45Unlike Benjamin and Witkacy, Mayakovsky quickly enjoyed what many writersdesire: early success. Yet it came with the usual price. In St. Petersburg hegave a reading at the infamous Stray Dog Café; the applause was loud andgratifying and a journalist for Theatre Review wrote of a “Mr. Mayakovsky whoread several of his poems in which the audience immediately sensed a greatgenuine gift of poetry.”46 Future reviewers agreed. Although the Futurists wereoften incomprehensible, and generally provoked their audiences, Mayakovsky had aknack of speaking directly to his listeners, and the stentorian voice andpowerful frame made an immediate impression. He quickly became something of acelebrity, his good looks and evident strength easily attracting women. But theattention soon turned into a habit, and when he didn’t receive it, he grewpetulant. His brief affairs were also less than satisfying. As with Witkacy,there were two Mayakovskys: one loud, aggressive, and boorish, demandingattention and often being insulting when he got it; the other a sensitive,lonely, insecure young man, who adopted his swaggering pose as a kind ofprotective colouring. Childhood feelings of being unloved – brought on, nodoubt, by the long separations – and memories of his months in prison, added tohis emotional confusion. Mayakovsky’s hunger for love was abated for a time bymeeting Elsa Brik, who later married the Surrealist Louis Aragon. The two becamelovers, but it was Lili Brik, Elsa’s sister, who became the love of Mayakovsky’slife. Lili was married to an older man, the scholar and critic Osip Brik, butthis didn’t stop her and Mayakovsky from becoming lovers. Osip Brik evidentlyhad a very modern outlook on relationships; for the rest of Mayakovksy’s life,the three lived in an on-again, off-again ménage à trois. Brik also becameMayakovsky’s publisher.Yet even his love for Lili Brik didn’t provide emotional security. In a poeminspired by, written for and first read to her, “The Backbone Flute,” Mayakovskyexhibits an attraction to suicide that will turn up more frequently in laterpoems. “More and more often I think” he writes, “Wouldn’t it perhaps be best/Toput the full-stop of a bullet/At the end of me?/Today I – just in case – amgiving my farewell concert.” (Later, in “Man,” already mentioned, Mayakovskycries, “Chemist let me take/My soul/With no pain/Out into infinite space,” butis denied extinction and must suffer a kind of Christ-like fate.)With the outbreak of WWI, Mayakovsky volunteered for service, even though as theonly male in his family he was exempt. His political youth, however, branded him‘unreliable’, and he spent the war years as a draughtsman for the PetrogradMilitary Automobile School. Then came the revolution, and Mayakovsky threwhimself into it body and soul. He wrote poems supporting the Bolsheviks andworked for ROSTA, the Russian Telegraph Agency, where he designed pro-communistposters, wrote propaganda, political verse, children’s poetry, plays andorganized events and agitprop ‘happenings’, drawing on his experience as aFuturist. Most of his avant-garde companions didn’t make the transition sosmoothly; many had fled, some were silenced or suffered tragic fates, likeMayakovsky’s fellow poet Velimir Khlebnikov, who starved to death whilewandering the country, famously sleeping on a pillowcase stuffed with hismanuscripts. Lenin and the Bolsheviks disliked modern art in general andFuturism in particular; the only future they had in mind was one in which theycalled the shots, and artists like Kandinsky and Chagall quickly got the messageand left for Europe. Mayakovsky, however, believed in the revolution and wouldcut his cloth to suit its needs. He would soon jettison the egoism of his earlywork and convince himself that true poetry must serve the needs of the state. Ina kind of psychological suicide he “changed his own character,” and agreed withthe Bolsheviks that “this was no time for individualism or for writing pieceswhich could be called unintelligible,” so “he ruthlessly suppressed thosetendencies within himself and gave his all to the young state.” In Mayakovsky’sown words, “I mastered myself/Stepping on the throat of my own song,” lines,ironically, from a poem called “At the Top of My Voice.”But for a brief while, it seemed that political and poetic revolutions couldwork hand in hand. In 1922, Mayakovsky travelled to Berlin and Paris, and metwith poets, artists and fellow travellers, among them Picasso and Leger.Returning to Russia, with Osip Brik he started two magazines, LEF and the NewLEF; the idea was to corral all the Futurists, Formalists, Constructivists andother ‘new’ movements into a single cultural front, the Left Front of Art. Itseemed that, as the Surrealists would try to do in the next decade, the forcesof modernism could serve the aims of the new proletariat regime. But thishoneymoon would be brief, and neither magazine lasted long; ironically, one oftheir main theoretical positions was that a proletarian society had no need ofpoetry – at the same time as Mayakovsky was filling its pages with the stuff.During this time Mayakovsky made a film adaptation of Jack London’s Martin Edin,whose hero commits suicide. Called Not Born For Money, Mayakovsky played thelead. In it, he fakes a suicide to escape a false life, and becomes a worker. Agun used in the film would appear again later on in his life, sadly as somethingmore than a prop.Working in Lunacharsky’s ministry, Mayakovsky became the poet of the revolution,but even with this official imprimatur, his position was always tentative. In1924 he composed an elegy on the death of Lenin, which made him famousthroughout Russia. He travelled again, this time to the United States, Mexicoand Cuba – his popularity, as well as Osip Brik’s connections, grantedMayakovsky extraordinary liberties, and no doubt the Bolsheviks saw theadvantages of sending their premiere poet on a public relations jaunt. Hisrelations with Lili Brik began to break down – he had fathered a child in Parisand was in love with a much younger woman, and she also took other lovers – butwhen he heard of the suicide of the poet Sergei Yesenin, he criticised him forhis narcissism. Yesenin, a popular poet, who was married for a time to IsadoraDuncan, was an alcoholic and drug addict; in 1925 he slashed his wrists in aLeningrad hotel, wrote farewell poems with his blood, then hanged himself.Yesenin’s last poem ended with the lines, “In this life, there’s nothing newabout dying/ But, of course, there’s nothing newer about living.” Mayakovskywrote a rebuttal, changing Yesenin’s last words: “In this life/ There’s nothinghard about dying -/ To make a life/ Is considerably harder.”Yet, Mayakovsky, who seemed on top of the world, was not long to follow. Eventhough he forced his poetry to toe the party line, in the atmosphere of the late1920s, he fell increasingly under scrutiny, and his work was criticized as beingstill too ‘formal’ and ‘unintelligible’ for the common man. Party hacks accusedhim of individualism, self-glorification and insincerity. His play The Bedbugwas heavily criticized, and another, The Bathhouse, was a flop; this wasunderstandable, as both were satires on the new ruling elite. Mayakovsky’sproblem was that he was unable to stop being revolutionary, and this wasdangerous, especially after the revolution had finally inaugurated the newdictatorship of the proletariat. The party could use him, but once it hadachieved its goal, he had to fall in line, like everyone else. No matter howmuch he tried to do this, Mayakovksy was too intelligent and honest not torecognize that the ‘revolution’ he had helped to make a reality, had onlychanged one set of masters for another. That he had prostituted his genius tohacks with a fraction of his talent, for whatever noble cause, could not haveescaped him.By the late 20s, Mayakovsky’s health began to suffer, and his depressionsreturned. Although he still kept a room at the Brik’s apartment, he and Liliwere no longer lovers, and his infatuation with the much younger TatianaYakovleva, a White Russian whom he had met and fallen in love with in Paris,ended sadly when he learned that she had married, while he was stuck in Russia,for the first time denied a travel permit. When a major exhibition, “TwentyYears of Work,” devoted to his life and writings was panned, or worse, ignored,by the party critics, Mayakovsky took it badly. Earlier he had performed an actof deadening self-abnegation by joining the Committee of Proletarian Writers(RAPP), a group that had opposed his earlier attempts with LEF. He did this,presumably, to end the isolation he had more and more been subjected to, but itdid no good. The Committee quickly reorganized itself into an inner core ofhardliners, and an appendage group, made of Mayakovsky and a few other ‘minor’writers.In early 1930, Mayakovsky’s depression grew, and his health got worse. The Brikshad left Moscow for an extended stay in London. Although he and Lili were nolonger lovers, he depended on her and Osip, and this was the first time both hadleft him alone in the apartment. His readings and lectures went badly, and inMarch he was admitted to hospital suffering from a nervous breakdown, but intruth he was simply exhausted. When he left after a short stay, friends noticedthat he looked haggard and distracted. He sent telegrams to Lili, complainingthat she didn’t write to him often enough; she replied, suggesting he find a“new text” for his telegrams. On 11 April, a week before the Briks were toreturn, Mayakovsky missed a lecture, something he hadn’t done before.Mayakovsky knew what was coming and tried to be with friends, but no one seemedto understand the state he was in; at one point he tried to telephone his friendfrom LEF, Nikoloa Aseyev, but was told he wasn’t at home. “Well, it means thatnothing can be done,” he said and hung up. Other friends weren’t able to meethim either, and things were not going well between him and his latestgirlfriend, the actress Nora Polonskaya. She was again much younger thanMayakovsky, and he had argued with her, jealous over her young friends.On 14 April, after spending the evening at a disastrous party, Nora andMayakovsky argued again. He demanded she stay with him, but she insisted ongoing to a rehearsal. At 10:00 a.m. she finally managed to leave the small roomMayakovsky used as a studio in Lyubyansky Passage. She took a few steps down thehall then heard a shot. When she turned back and opened the door, the room wasfull of blood. Mayakovsky had kept the pistol he had used as a prop in Not BornFor Money. It was loaded with one bullet. He had put barrel against his heartand fired. On his desk was a letter. It read:“To All of You: Don’t blame anyone for my death, and please don’t gossip aboutit. The deceased hate gossip. Mama, sisters, comrades, forgive me. This is not agood method (I don’t advise others to do it), but for me there’s no other wayout. Lili, love me. Comrade Government, my family consists of Lili Brik, Mama,my sisters, and Veronica Vitoldovna Polonskaya [Nora]. If you can provide adecent life for them, thank you.”“The incident is closed,” Mayakovsky continued. “Love’s boat/ smashed on theeveryday./ Life and I are quits/ And there’s no point/ In counting over mutualhurts, harms, and slights. Best of luck to you all!”Notes 1 Quoted in The Complete Correspondence 1928–1940 Walter Benjamin – TheodoreWiesengrund Adorno editor Henri Lowitz; translator Nicholas Walker (PolityPress: 1999) p. 342. 2 No copy of the note exists; it was presumably destroyed by Henny Gurlandduring her journey to Lisbon, in fear, perhaps, that if found it would somehowcompromise her. But on her arrival in New York, at Adorno’s request she gave hima verbatim account of it. 3 Walter Benjamin, letter to Gershom Scholem, 17 April 1931. 4 Lee Siegel, Introduction to Gershom Scholem Walter Benjamin The Story of aFriendship (New York Review Books: New York, 2001) p. ix. 5 Adorno remarked of Benjamin’s character that he was “so completely themedium of his work […] that anything one might call ‘immediacy of life’ wasrefracted … his private demeanour approached the ritualistic.” In On WalterBenjamin ed.

The memorial,although subject to the ravages of time and vandals (local teenagers makingtheir own mark on history), is a fitting tribute to Benjamin, its sheer descentto the waters below eerily embodying Benjamin’s own aimless and endlesswanderings and fruitless bid for escape. In the cemetery, overlooking theMediterranean, there is a grave with a plaque marked with his name, yet hisremains aren’t buried there. In his book on Benjamin, Gershom Scholem wrylycomments that the grave is “an invention of the cemetery attendants, who inconsideration of the number of inquiries wanted to assure themselves of a tip.”He agrees with Hannah Arendt’s remark that “the spot is beautiful,” butconsiders the grave “apocryphal.” I can concur that, as Arendt says, “It is byfar one of the most fantastic and most beautiful spots I have seen in my life,”but during my visit I had no occasion to proffer anyone a tip. (Gershom ScholemWalter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship [Faber & Faber: London, 1982] p.226.)11 Jay Parini Benjamin’s Crossing (Anchor Books: London, 1998) p. 280.12 Huxley, too, is in the ranks of the literary suicides. His own youth wassaddened by the suicide of his brother Trevenen, after he failed to meet thehigh standards of achievement set by the Huxley clan; Huxley based the suicideof Brian Foxe in Eyeless in Gaza on his brother’s death. And Brave New Worlditself famously closes with the suicide by hanging of John the Savage,confronted with the choice between a primitive life on an Indian reservation, orthe living death of conformity to the modern totalitarian state.13 It may be mixing subjects here, but this analogy makes me wonder if EliasCanetti had Benjamin at all in mind when writing of the bibliomaniac Peter Kienin his Auto-da-Fé, who, as mentioned earlier, burns himself to death amidstheaps of his collection. Benjamin was an obsessive bibliophile, and made a pointof never reading many of the books in his library. Gershom Scholem admitted tobeing annoyed at the attention Benjamin would pay to bindings and other fetishesof the collector. “The enthusiasm with which he was capable of discussingbindings, paper and typefaces … frequently got on my nerves … I deny thatmetaphysically legitimate insights can arise from this way of evaluating bookson the basis of their bindings and paper.” (Scholem, p. 71.)14 Peter Demetz, Introduction, Reflections p. xiii.15 One of his fellow inmates was Arthur Koestler who, much later, was anotherliterary suicide.16 Walter Benjamin Reflections p. 4.17 Elsewhere I have remarked that Benjamin’s suitcase and Pessoa’s chest, whichcontained, among many others, the fragments that constitute his Book ofDisquietude, and which today is still not completely exhausted, strike me aswarranting a comparative study. Another item would be the pillow case belongingto the Russian Cubo-Futurist poet Velimir Khlebnikov, in which he supposedlystuffed his numerous manuscripts and on which he allegedly slept during his lastdays, wandering through the chaos of the revolution.18 Hannah Arendt, Introduction to Walter Benjamin Illuminations p. 11.19 Walter Benjamin Reflections p. 303.20 As in many cases discussed in this book, speculation and uncertaintysurround Benjamin’s last hours. For a detailed account, see Momme Brodersen’sWalter Benjamin: A Biography pp. 250–262, which I have drawn upon for thischapter.21 Erwin Loewenson, quoted in Momme Brodersen, Walter Benjamin: A Biography p.7022 Gershom Scholem, Walter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship (Faber & Faber:London, 1982) p. 178.23 Ibid. p. 17924 Hesse in fact was one of the few well known literary figures of the time whopraised Benjamin’s work; at one point, he even tried to help him publish one ofhis books. This should be kept in mind by leftist critics who often target Hesseas a proto-Nazi because of novels like Journey to the East and The Glass BeadGame, both of which employ the device of an esoteric, hierarchical spiritualsociety, a mark, for the politically correct and ideologically blind, of Hesse’sincipient ‘fascism’.25 Ibid. p. 224.26 Czeslaw Milosz, Introduction to Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz Insatiability(Quartet: London, 1985) p. viii.27 It’s been suggested that Jadwiga Janczewska, Witkacy’s fiancée, committedsuicide after an affair with Szymanowski.28 Quoted in Gary Smith, ed. On Walter Benjamin.29 For more on Gurdjieff see my In Search of P.D. Ouspensky (Quest: Wheaton,Illinois, 2004).30 Jerzy Eugeniusz Plomien´ski, quoted in Anna Micin´ska Stanislaw IgnacyWitkiewicz: Life and Work (Interpress Publishers: Warsaw, 1990) p. 288.31 Ibid. p. 110.32 Ibid. p. 292.33 Ibid. p. 294. Others shared Gombrowicz’s feelings. The philosopher,mathematician and painter Leon Chwistek, a friend of Witkacy from childhood,remarked: “He is a degenerate individual, equally removed from true art as fromlife, a perpetual embryo crazed by megalomania.” Bronislaw Mailnowski, whomaintained a rocky relationship with Witkacy throughout his life, said: “Irespect his art and admire his intelligence and worship his individuality, but Icannot stand his character.” Quoted in The Witkiewicz Reader ed. Daniel Gerould(Quartet Books: London, 1993) p. 341.34 Witkacy seems a good example of the type of individual who has a constantneed for something to be ‘happening’ around him, who throws his own life andthose of his friends and acquaintances into constant disarray in order to keepat bay some feeling of stagnancy. Again, the parallel with Gurdjieff issuggestive. Both Witkacy and Gurdjieff seemed to have a need to have peoplearound them and to constantly control their actions and reactions by indulgingin some form of ‘theatre’. For most of his career, Gurdjieff had a retinue ofstudents whom he would submit to a variety of physical and psychologicalexercises, aimed at producing in them a sense of ‘wakefulness’. Yet one can askhow much these tactics were to the students’ benefit, and how much theysatisfied a need in the teacher. Another character who falls into this category,although one less ‘serious’ than Gurdjieff, is the ‘magician’ Aleister Crowley,who adopted numerous alter egos and who seemed intent on having as muchattention as possible paid to him and his exploits. For more on Crowley see myDedalus Book of the Occult: A Dark Muse (2003).35 Anna Micin´ska, p. 157.36 Quoted in Witkacy, Daniel Gerould (University of Washington Press: Seattle,1981) p. 4.37 Louis Iribane, Introduction to Insatiability (University of Illinois press:Chicago, 1977) p. xxxix.38 The Russian novelist and essayist Yevgeny Zamyatin is credited with beingthe creator of the anti-utopian novel, a genre that, by the second half of thetwentieth century, had become a mainstay of science fiction and ‘speculative’literature. We, written in 1924, was first published in an English translationin the United States; a Russian edition was published in Prague in 1927.Although circulated in manuscript form, it was never published in the SovietUnion.39 Louis Iribane, p. xxix.40 Ibid. p. xxiii.41 Ibid. p. vii. Witkacy’s apprehensions about a coming totalitarian regimehave been traced to his experiences in Russia during the Bolshevik revolution.Poland was under Russian rule in WWI, and when Witkacy joined the army he wasmade an officer in the elite tsarist guards. Although he had had his life sparedduring the coup, he lived in constant fear of reprisal, as the tsarist guardswere known for their brutality. Another incident made a powerful impression onhim. On his return to Poland from Russia, Witkacy is said to have witnessed thesenseless murder of his friend and mentor, the Symbolist poet Tadeus Micin´ski,who was mistaken for a tsarist general and attacked by a mob. Some accountsconsider this traumatic experience apocryphal.42 Quoted in Witkacy, Daniel Gerould p. 19.43 A.D.P. Briggs Vladimir Mayakovsky: A Tragedy (Willem A. Meeuws: Oxford,1979) p. 12.

Ouspensky."},{"pageContent":"THE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE SUICIDE [table_of_contents.htm#ch6]In a grimly fascinating book, Let Me Finish, the German academic Udo Grashoffput together an anthology of suicide notes, gathered from police records.Reading these, it’s difficult to argue with A. Alvarez’s assessment, quotedearlier, of the “shabby, confused, agonized crisis which is the common realityof suicide.” The notes Grashoff collected suggest that the motivation for mostsuicides fall within a fairly limited purview: unrequited love, debt, shame,sickness, an intolerable domestic situation. They also confirm that the onlything to come of most suicides is a nasty mess for someone else to clean up. Yetone note in particular expresses a sentiment shared, I think, by the subjects ofthis chapter. In her last words, a young woman, intent on ending her life,debated with her friends and countered the arguments she believed they wouldmake in order to stop her. She agreed with them that killing herself would“accomplish nothing.” But this, she explained, was precisely the point. That wasexactly what she wanted to accomplish: nothingness. Death offered the onlyaccess to the oblivion she desired. The cessation of existence was her goal andin the end she reached it. The pain of ‘being’ was simply too great for her tobear and suicide was the only way to avoid it.Such psychic pain is of course associated with depression. As William Styronwrites in his account of his own depression, “mysteriously and in ways that aretotally remote from normal experience, the grey drizzle of horror induced bydepression takes on the quality of physical pain. But it is not an immediatelyidentifiable pain, like that of a broken limb. It may be more accurate to saythat despair, owing to some evil trick played upon the sick brain by theinhabiting psyche, comes to resemble the diabolical discomfort of beingimprisoned in a fiercely overheated room. And because no breeze stirs thiscauldron, because there is no escape from the smothering confinement, it isentirely natural that the victim begins to think ceaselessly of oblivion.”1Styron remarks that in his case, the pain was “most closely connected todrowning or suffocation,” and he goes on to comment that William James, whobattled depression for many years, hit the mark when he wrote in The Varietiesof Religious Experience that, “It is a positive and active anguish, a sort ofpsychical neuralgia wholly unknown to normal life.”2 James continues: “Suchanguish may partake of various characters, having sometimes more the quality ofloathing; sometimes that of irritation and exasperation; or again ofself-mistrust and self-despair; or of suspicion, anxiety, trepidation, fear.”3As defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder IVpublished by the American Psychiatric Association, depression is “a disorder ofmood, characterized by sadness and loss of interest in usually satisfyingactivities, a negative view of the self, hopelessness, passivity,indecisiveness, suicidal intentions, loss of appetite, weight loss, sleepdisturbances, and other physical symptoms.” For Kay Redfield Jamison, whose ownaccount of her manic-depressive illness, An Unquiet Mind, was a bestseller,“Manic-depression, or bipolar illness encompasses a wide range of mood disordersand temperaments.” “Occasionally,” she writes, “these changes reflect only atransient shift in mood or a recognizable and limited reaction to a lifesituation. When energy is profoundly dissipated, the ability to think is clearlyeroded, and the capacity to actively engage in the efforts and pleasures of lifeis fundamentally altered, then depression becomes an illness, rather than atemporary or existential state.”4 A less specific account, embedded among thedozens he culled from a variety of sources, was offered by Robert Burton almostfour hundred years ago, in The Anatomy of Melancholy. Melancholy, Burton writes,is, “A kind of dotage without a fever, having for his ordinary companions fearand sadness, without any apparent occasion.” And with a succinctness rare forBurton, he went on to boil the malady down to a single characteristic, callingit “an anguish of the mind.”That the writers I look at in this chapter – Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath andAnne Sexton – suffered such an anguish, is clear from the accounts of theirlives.A reader may wonder at the wisdom of selecting three women writers as thesubjects of a chapter on manic-depressive suicides. Although men clearly sufferfrom it as well, according to one authority, “major depressive illness is morelikely to affect women”5 than it is men; why this is the case still remainsunclear. Yet there’s another reason I’ve grouped these writers together. In thecases of Woolf, Plath, and Sexton, their depression and their writing werepowerfully linked, so much so that one almost wants to say that if they weren’tdepressives, they might not have been writers, and vice versa. Virginia Woolfinvested so much importance in her writing that even the mere possibility of abad review was enough to plunge her into despair. In the case of Sylvia Plath,it’s arguable that her reputation as a significant writer stems at least in partfrom the fact that she killed herself. And Anne Sexton is one of the fewexamples of a poet who discovered herself as a writer through using writing as atherapy to overcome her depression. In all three cases, writing, and theindividual’s mental and emotional state, her very self, were in a strange andultimately final relationship with her death. About her friend Sylvia Plath,with whom she swapped stories of failed suicide attempts, Anne Sexton remarkedthat “she had the suicide inside her. As I do. As many of us do. But, if we’relucky, we don’t get away with it and something or someone forces us to live.”6Sexton herself was ‘lucky’ several times, as were Plath and Woolf; all threemade many attempts to end their lives, and failed at them all – until, ofcourse, their final attempts.In The Dynamics of Creation, the psychologist Anthony Storr examines thepsychological motivations at work behind creativity. Chapter titles like“Creativity as Wish-Fulfilment,” “Creativity and the Schizoid Character,” and“Creativity and the Obsessional Character,” may be off-putting, but unlike manypsychoanalytic approaches, his book avoids the reductionism and outrightabsurdity often associated with Freudian accounts of art and artists; it alsohas the merit of being well written. Of the manic-depressive temperament, Storrwrites that “his principal concern is […] to protect himself from the danger ofloss of self-esteem; but unlike the schizoid person [who needs to detach himselffrom others], his self-esteem is much more dependent upon a ‘good’ relation withothers. Like the schizoid person, he fears other people in some ways; but it isnot so much the fear of attack or being overwhelmed, as the fear of withdrawalof love and approval.”7 Storr continues: “one could say that normal peoplebecome conditioned by receiving enough love as small children to expect thatothers will give them approval, and thus proceed through life with confidence.People who remain in the depressive position have no such built-in confidence.They remain as vulnerable to outside opinion as a baby is vulnerable to thewithdrawal of the breast. Indeed, for such people, the good opinion of others isas vital to their well-being as milk is to the infant. Rejection and disapprovalare a matter of life and death; for unless supplies of approval are forthcomingfrom outside, they relapse into a state of depression in which self-esteem sinksso low, and rage becomes so uncontrollable, that suicide becomes a realpossibility.”8Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf all meet Storr’s criteria. Afterone of Sexton’s fits, which could include violence, random behaviour, andinfidelity, she would often seek forgiveness and approval from herlong-suffering husband; lying beside him as she did beside her great aunt as achild, her husband soothed her by stroking her back and saying, “That’s my goodgirl.” According to her friend and fellow poet Maxine Kumin, “Anne always hadthe notion that she was the most under-loved person in the universe. There couldnever be enough proof that she was loved.”9According to an account left by her neighbour – “the last person to see SylviaPlath alive” – and who was himself poisoned by the gas she used to kill herself,Sylvia Plath gave the impression of being inept at the basic practicalities oflife, and was always in need of help, yet “she tended to be a self-centredperson, not letting herself become involved with other people’s problems. […]The world revolved around her,” something her neighbour had observed “in othercreative people.”10And according to her biographer Mitchell Leaska, Virginia Woolf “needed the careand protection of someone whose devotion was unquestioned.”11 By all accountsshe received exactly that from her husband Leonard Woolf, with whom it isdoubtful she had sexual relations, but who ministered to her emotional,psychological and medical needs through a long, demanding and heartbreakingrelationship. All three women needed continuous helpings of unconditional love.In some cases they received this; in others not. But even in the case ofVirginia Woolf, who had the at times saintly Leonard to look after her, love andcare wasn’t enough, and when the final descent came, she chose to kill herself,rather than face madness. Would Anne Sexton and Sylvia Plath not have followedher in suicide if they had received sufficient love? According to Anthony Storr,“the person of the depressive temperament behaves as if he were insatiable; asif he had never had enough.” And he concludes, “It is reasonable to assume thatthis is in fact the case.”12 Sadly, reading the lives of these tragiccharacters, one comes away feeling that all the love in the world would not havebeen enough to fill the hole in their psyches.Virginia Woolf was born into a family and environment that practically ensuredshe would become a writer; it also ensured that, like the children of otherfamous parents, she would have to struggle to overcome a sense of beingover-shadowed by them. Her mother, Julia Jackson Stephen, had previously beenmarried to Herbert Duckworth, of the publishing family, and was descended froman attendant of Marie Antoinette; she was also related to a group of sisters,renowned for their beauty, who modelled for many of the pre-Raphaelite paintersand photographers. Her father, Sir Leslie Stephen, was a respected literarycritic, and founder of the Dictionary of National Biography. Virginia’s home inHyde Park Gate, London, was a centre for late Victorian intellectual life; HenryJames, George Eliot, George Henry Lewes, and James Russell Lowell, were amongsome of the distinguished visitors, and this early familiarity with literary andscholarly people more than likely primed Virginia for her later celebrity aspart of the Bloomsbury set.It was a crowded house at Hyde Park Gate. Both parents had been widowed, andVirginia’s siblings included children from three marriages: Julia’s childrenfrom her first marriage, George, Stella and Gerald; Leslie’s daughter Laura (whowas mentally unstable and lived with the family until she was institutionalisedin 1891); and Leslie and Julia’s own other children, Vanessa, Thoby, and Adrian.Along with children the house was also crowded with books. Unlike her brothers,who received formal education, Virginia did not (a common practice at the time),but she made up for this by her prodigious and at times obsessive reading,devouring the better part of her father’s huge library; like many sensitive,introverted children, what Virginia lacked in life she made up for in the worldof her imagination. Although Virginia had to compete with her siblings for hermother’s attentions, her father recognized her talent and encouraged her, and hedeclared early on that she was destined to make her living “writing articles.”The death of her mother from influenza in 1895, when Virginia was thirteen, wasdescribed by her as “the greatest disaster that could happen;” it led to thefirst of her many breakdowns, which were usually characterized by severe moodfluctuations, nervous irritability and paralysing melancholy, and often requiredmedical attention and institutionalisation. Yet the early and recurrent sexualabuse that she and her sister Vanessa were subjected to by her olderhalf-brothers George and Gerald – revealed to a correspondent only late in life– more than likely triggered the moods of self-loathing and low self-esteem thatwould characterize her later depressive states.13 George, who was fourteen whenVirginia was born, took to ‘fondling’ her when she was six, and apparentlycontinued the practice until her late teens, camouflaging his furtive caresseswith inordinate displays of brotherly affection. Although there is some debateover whether her marriage to Leonard Woolf was ever consummated – there is someindication in her diaries that it may have been, but the general belief is thatit was not – Virginia’s erotic predilection for women – as in her famous affairwith Vita Sackville-West – is well documented and more than likely had its rootsin her early mauling by her half-brothers. That the Bloomsbury crowd was notedfor its sexual irregularities was no doubt also an encouragement in thisdirection.Her mother’s death plunged Leslie Stephen into a prolonged and effusivemourning; Julia was not yet fifty and Leslie couldn’t come to terms with losinga wife a second time. The sight of her father reduced to tears and comforted byher sisters no doubt severely affected Virginia, who desperately craved his loveand attention; she also secretly felt guilty over the fact that she had favouredhim over her mother, with whom she felt she had competed for his affection. Herown relations with her mother had been difficult; deeply attached to herapproval, she would fly into rages if she felt she was being slighted; for herpart, Julia was sparing in the attention Virginia desperately craved, and washerself subject to dark, unresponsive moods. The family knew of ‘Ginny’s’mood-swings, but accepted them as part of the family dynamic; the idea that shewas somehow emotionally or mentally disturbed was unacceptable to them – again,something common at the time. Her half-sister Stella, who became for Virginia asecond mother, took over the reigns of the family, and was her step-father’scomforter. Sadly, the emotional security provided by Stella was pulled out fromunder Virginia first by Stella’s marriage, and then more severely by hersuccumbing to a sudden fever just after her honeymoon, only two years after hermother’s death. In 1904, when Leslie Stephen died, Virginia had another, morecatastrophic nervous collapse. It was also then that she made her first suicideattempt and was briefly institutionalised, a pattern that would repeat itself atdifferent intervals throughout her life.14With the death of their father, Vanessa, Adrian, Thoby and Virginia sold thehouse at Hyde Park Gate and moved to Bloomsbury, no doubt to exorcise painfulmemories (and the unwanted attentions of their half-brothers). They bought ahouse on Gordon Square, and in many ways recreated the atmosphere of their firsthome. At Cambridge, Thoby (who died of typhoid in 1906) had met Lytton Strachey,Clive Bell, Maynard Keynes and, most importantly, Leonard Woolf. Thoby began tohold regular ‘Thursday evenings’ at home, when he would gather with his friends,a tradition that first Vanessa, then Virginia would carry on after his death; itwas out of these weekly meetings that the famous ‘Bloomsbury group’ wouldemerge. Virginia had begun writing and publishing book reviews for The TimesLiterary Supplement, a journal she would be associated with for many years.Vanessa would marry Clive Bell, and Leonard Woolf, who had joined the CeylonCivil Service and had returned to London on leave, met Virginia and soon decidedhe wanted to marry her. At first hesitant, Virginia finally agreed. They weremarried in August, 1912, and were determined to earn their living throughwriting. Less than a year later Virginia suffered another nervous breakdown,plunged into madness and made another attempt to kill herself.Virginia had by this time started to write novels. She had started The VoyageOut (originally titled Melymbrosia) in 1908, and had finished it by 1913. Buther breakdown following her marriage meant the book wouldn’t be published until1915. Her second novel, Night and Day, soon followed. Both were conventionalworks; the ‘experimental’ novels she is most known for today – Mrs. Dalloway,The Waves, Orlando – were a decade away. But as with Sylvia Plath and AnneSexton, Virginia increasingly came to associate writing with her own sense ofself. Her self-esteem, her worth as person, became anchored in her work as awriter. In later life, finishing a book would bring her close to suicide: whenfinishing The Years she wrote, “That’s the end of the book. I looked up pastdiaries … and found the same misery after Waves after Lighthouse. I was, Iremember, nearer suicide, seriously, than since 1913 …”15 Delivering the finaldraft would leave her feeling vulnerable and exposed, certain that her workwould be recognized as worthless and herself as a fake, and she would agonizeover changes she should have made. The slightest possibility of error inducedintense feelings of self-revulsion, which she would project on to others. Duringone of these states, after meeting an acquaintance, she wrote in her diary, “Ican imagine […] how she (Mrs. Sydney Waterlow) cursed that dreadful slutVirginia Woolf.”On another occasion, hearing that the acerbic artist and novelist Wyndham Lewis,who was no friend of Bloomsbury,16 had written about her in his book Men WithoutArt, which includes pungent criticisms of Hemingway, Faulker, and Eliot, Woolfslipped into a paralysing state of anxiety. She couldn’t bring herself to readLewis’ remarks, which, admittedly, are written in some of his most waspish tonesand include the assessment that “she is taken seriously by no one any longertoday.” (The book was published in 1934, after her ‘stream-of-consciousness’novels had been published.) “Why then,” she writes, “do I shrink from readingW.L.? Why am I sensitive? I think vanity: I dislike the thought of being laughedat: of the glow of satisfaction that A., B. and C. will get from hearing V.W.demolished: also it will strengthen further attacks: perhaps I feel uncertain ofmy own gifts … What I shall do is craftily to gather the nature of theindictment from talk and reviews; and in a year perhaps, when my book is out[The Years], I shall read it.” She then makes an admission of a masochisticpleasure in feeling this way. “Already I am feeling the calm that always comesto me with abuse: my back is against the wall … and then there is the queerdisreputable pleasure in being a figure, a martyr.” The paralysis continues, asdoes the masochism, “When will my brain revive? In 10 days I think … and thenthere is the odd pleasure of being abused and the feeling of being dismissedinto obscurity is also pleasant and salutary.” Yet the real goal is thenothingness, a self-erasure more complete than mere obscurity: “I mind being inthe light again, just as I was sinking into popular obscurity … I don’t thinkthis attack will last more than two days … And how many sudden shoots intonothingness open before me … if only for a time I could completely forgetmyself, my reviews, my fame, and sink in the scale …”17Woolf’s insecurity about her work seems excessive, but a milder form of it isn’tunusual in most writers. All writers have second thoughts about a work, and it’scommon to feel insecure when presenting your efforts to an often insensitivepublic. To expose yourself to criticism takes some courage, and in order toactualise what talent they have, writers need an enormous amount ofself-confidence and self-belief, as well as an ego sufficiently strong to quietthe doubts that plague them. And if, as seems likely, having your work acceptedis a means of gaining approval, it’s understandable that, as Anthony Storrpoints out, some writers become addicted to this. “Some writers,” he writes,“are so driven to produce short works in rapid succession that they never dothemselves justice. The immediate rewards of journalism are seductive in thisrespect. Seeing yourself in print every week, or even every day, is immenselyreassuring to some characters.”18But although “many journalists cannot face the long period without rewarddemanded by writing a novel”19 – or a book, for that matter – Virginia wasn’tone of these. She was no beginner. She did devote herself to producing longer,more serious work than book reviews and articles; by the time she became atarget for Wyndham Lewis’ criticisms (which, on the whole, I find accurate) shehad already published several novels, an important feminist essay (A Room ofOne’s Own) and been applauded as a serious exponent of literary modernism. Buteven this wasn’t enough to confirm her self-belief. After each book, the propsholding her up would fall away, and she would drop into a terrifying anddebilitating madness. As her biographer writes “without writing Virginia’s worldbecame unreal, menacing, and she herself reduced once more to a state ofhelpless passivity.”20It’s no wonder then that she kept a journal for decades: the act of writingitself, although not foolproof, could at times keep the madness at bay. Thedanger with this, as with many obsessive journal writers, is that life then isno longer something to be lived; it becomes a source of material for writing –when, that is, it isn’t too overwhelming and threatening. But that life wasoften overwhelming and threatening for Virginia is clear from her journals.Although even to the end she followed the journalist’s credo to, “Observeperpetually. Observe the oncome of age. Observe greed. Observe my owndespondency. By that means it becomes serviceable … I will go down with mycolours flying … Occupation is essential”, it was precisely this acuteobservation that at times pulled her under. It was through this “inexplicablesusceptibility to some impressions,” she wrote, “that I approach madness.”21Once, looking at a house to rent, she observed with disgust that the rooms were“rank with the smell of meat and human beings.” Other people struck her asparticularly offensive, “I begin to loathe my kind,” she wrote, “principallyfrom looking at their faces in the tube. Really, raw red and silver herringsgive me more pleasure to look upon.” Although when the illness was upon her shewould deny that anything was wrong and would often refuse treatment, in herlucid moments she could recognize that things were not right. “She would discussher illness,” Leonard Woolf wrote. “She would recognize that she had been mad,that she had had delusions, heard voices which did not exist, lived for weeks ina nightmare world of frenzy, despair, violence.”It was in one of these lucid times that, feeling the darkness approaching againand no longer having the strength or the motivation to face it (her reputation,she felt, had diminished, as did her income from her books; after WWII it woulddecline sharply) she decided to follow one of those “shoots into nothingness”whose appearance comforted her. Leaving Leonard what must rank as one of themost heartbreaking farewells (“You have given me the greatest possiblehappiness,” she told him. “You have been in every way all that anyone could be.I don’t think two people could have been happier till this terrible diseasecame …”), on 28 March 1941, after filling her pockets with stones, Virginiawalked into the river Ouse, near their home, Monks House, in the village ofRodmell in Sussex, and drowned herself.On the night of Sunday 11 February 1963, after leaving them glasses of milk andslices of bread for breakfast, although they were too young to feed themselves,Sylvia Plath opened the window of her children’s room in her maisonette at 23Fitzroy Road, in the Primrose Hill area of North London.22 Then she carefullysealed off her kitchen door on the floor below with towels and adhesive tape,left a note on the pram to call her doctor, laid out a cloth for a pillow,turned on the gas, and put her head deep inside the oven. When an au pair whohad come to help with the children arrived the next morning, she heard themcrying, but was unable to get into the house. Eventually, with the help of abuilder, the door was forced. Immediately they smelled the gas. The childrenwere shivering but unharmed; London then was in the grip of the coldest winterin 150 years and the house was barely heated.23 They then opened the kitchenwindow, turned off the gas, and pulled Sylvia into the living room, where thenurse tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. It was too late. Sylvia was dead;according to the doctor at University College Hospital, who examined her body,she had died at around 8:00 am, although an earlier examination at the scenesuggested her death had occurred sometime between 4:00 and 6:00 am. TrevorThomas, who lived below her and was the last person to see her alive, claimedthat at around 12:30 am he had seen her in the hallway of the house, “with herhead raised with a kind of seraphic expression on her face.” When he asked ifshe was well, she replied, “I’m just having a marvellous dream, a most wonderfulvision.” If this was so, then she must have finally decided to go through withit not long after Thomas spoke with her.There’s some speculation that Plath didn’t really want to die that night, that,as in many attempted suicides, she really wanted to be saved. Most of theevidence suggests otherwise, but the uncertainty that still hovers around thefacts of her death24 is emblematic of the ambiguity surrounding her life as awhole, especially her marriage to Ted Hughes and Hughes’ responsibility, if any,for her death. So much mystery, so many conflicting stories, and so much controlover the ‘official’ account, first by Ted Hughes himself, and then by the Hughesestate, has accreted around Sylvia Plath’s death that in 1993 Janet Malcolmpublished a book specifically about the difficulty of writing a biography ofPlath.25 Malcolm was prompted to write her book – an essay on the perils ofbiography – after reading her friend Anne Stevenson’s ‘authorized’ biography ofPlath, Bitter Fame; authorized, that is, by Olwyn Hughes, Ted Hughes’ sister,who hated Plath but who strangely had control of her literary estate.Stevenson’s book received bad reviews, precisely because it was written in closeassociation with Olwyn Hughes, so close that she practically was credited as itsco-author. Not surprisingly, it presented the official Hughes’ view regardingPlath and Hughes, and was seen as little more than propaganda for thepro-Hughes, anti-Plath camp.26On the other side of the debate is a book like Ronald Hayman’s excellent TheDeath and Life of Sylvia Plath which, because he raised points that clashed withthe official accounts, could not quote from Plath’s and Hughes’ work, outside ofwhat is permitted by ‘fair usage’. Hughes argued at different times that hisactions were motivated by a desire to protect Sylvia’s memory, their children’sfeelings, and his own privacy, but given that the lost diaries are indeed lost(or destroyed), we really have very little to go by to know how satisfying anexplanation this is.Sylvia Plath was born on 27 October 1932 in Boston, Massachusetts. For the firstpart of her short life she seemed the kind of girl that her classmates wouldchoose as “most likely to succeed.” By the time she was twenty, she was a topstudent, an editor and columnist for local journals, and had published shortstories in popular girls’ magazines like Seventeen as well as more weightypublications like the Christian Science Monitor. She won a scholarship to SmithCollege, an exclusive all-girl school, and also a competition to be a guesteditor for Mademoiselle, which had recently published her prize-winning story“Sunday at the Mintons.” Later achievements included a Fullbright scholarship toCambridge. Yet, beneath the sparkling surface, things were not so bubbly.When Sylvia was eight, her father died. Otto Plath was a lecturer in entomologyat Boston University, and his book, Bumblebees and their Ways was highlyregarded. Otto was, by the standards of the time, old for a father; he wasforty-six when Sylvia was born, and when Sylvia’s brother Warren arrived he wasfifty-one. Sylvia’s mother, Aurelia, was twenty-five when Sylvia was born andhad been Otto’s student; she had a great love of literature and showed promisein it herself, but after her marriage devoted herself exclusively to Otto’sneeds, becoming his wife as well as his secretary. Sylvia loved her father andunderstandably desired his praise. And although Otto was an obsessiveworkaholic, a dominating type who despised small talk, vague ideas and sloppythinking,27 Sylvia was his favourite and until his illness she didn’t feel anylack of the approval she needed from him. But then things changed.In 1936, just before her brother was born, Otto developed a form of diabetes. Ifhe had it treated then, it wouldn’t have been fatal. Otto, however, had contemptfor conventional medicine and had made his own diagnosis. He refused to see adoctor, and over the next four years his condition deteriorated; at the sametime he kept up a gruelling work schedule. As Ronald Hayman points out, bothSylvia’s parents exhibited an inordinate self-discipline, rooted in a kind ofmasochism. In Aurelia’s case, its form was self-sacrifice, first of her ownpossibilities as a writer to Otto, then of her own pleasure, denying herselfsimple comforts in order to provide Sylvia and Warren with a good future. Inlater years, Sylvia would refer to her as a “martyr,” and in accounts of her ownattempts to excel and be a good wife and mother, it isn’t difficult to find afamily resemblance.As Otto’s condition worsened, and his work load increased, Sylvia felt himmoving away from her. He had less patience with her and seemed less interestedin her attempts to entertain him and win his favour. Her mother kept thechildren from pestering their increasingly irritable and suffering father, whooften exploded in rage and pain at the muscle spasms gripping his leg. ByOctober 1940, it was clear something was really wrong. One morning Otto stubbedhis little toe; that evening it and the rest of his foot had turned black; redstreaks shot up toward his ankle. His leg had turned gangrenous and had to beamputated. The surgeon asked, “How could such a brilliant man be so stupid.”Aurelia may have asked this herself. Less than six months later he was dead.Like many young children, Sylvia felt that her father’s withdrawal must havebeen her fault; if he spent less time with her, she must be to blame. After hisdeath, and in the months approaching her own, the seat of blame had shifted. AsA. Alvarez writes of the poetry of her last days, “She seem convinced, in theselast poems, that the root of her suffering was the death of her father, whom sheloved, who abandoned her, and who dragged her after him into death.” Eventuallyshe would come to see both her mother and herself as responsible for his death.And although, as Ronald Hayman comments, Otto Plath didn’t quite kill himself,he did set a suicidal example, following the dictates of his obstinacy ratherthan the indications of his health. In her relationships with men, the loss ofher father drove Sylvia to an obsessive need to be in her lover’s or husband’scompany practically all the time.Although Sylvia had fantasized about her own death soon after her father’s,fantasies that would dominate her poetry and her autobiographical novel The BellJar, the first visible sign of them becoming a reality occurred in 1953. Duringa skiing trip with a boyfriend she had decided she didn’t want to marry, shefractured a fibula attempting a run that, for an inexperienced skier likeherself, was ‘suicidal’; the incident turns up in The Bell Jar. This ‘accident’came just before she took up her guest editorship at Mademoiselle. It may havebeen a test run for the real thing, a few months later; or, as a story she toldof her near drowning at two suggests, it may have been the surfacing of an urgethat had been with her from birth. At the beach when a toddler, she said thatshe found herself crawling straight for the water; her mother snatched her justas her head pierced the “wall of green.” Other test runs turn up in her life. In1962, a year before her suicide, she ‘accidentally’ sliced off the tip of herthumb; not long after she drove her car off the road in an attempt, she said, tokill herself. But just two months after she had spent four weeks in New Yorkguest-editing Mademoiselle, enjoying the kind of approval only real talent couldattract (its one thing to have your parents’ approval, quite another that of anupmarket, sophisticated glossy magazine), Sylvia took a shot at the real thing.After disappearing for days, sparking a search by police, neighbours and eventhe boy scouts, and triggering headlines like BEAUTIFUL SMITH GIRL MISSING ATWELLESLEY, she was finally found hiding in a crawlspace in the basement. She hadtaken an overdose of sleeping pills; when they found her she was more dead thanalive. This too found a place in The Bell Jar.The sleeping pills were part of a regime started by a psychiatrist Sylvia hadseen recently, recommended by her family doctor after Sylvia showed signs ofdepression. Her month at Mademoiselle by most accounts was successful, althoughSylvia herself found much to criticize about her performance; she always foundsomething lacking in her talents, even when they were being applauded by others.At the end of her month in New York, for example, she had felt such self-disgustthat she threw her new, expensive clothes, bought for her trip, out of the hotelwindow. Before leaving she had applied for a place in a writing course given byFrank O’ Connor; on her return she found she hadn’t been accepted. Thedisappointment was devastating and her self-deprecation increased.Like Virginia Woolf an obsessive diarist, she confided in her notebook: “You’vefailed to equip yourself adequately to face the world. You’re spoiled, babyish,frightened. You must be more honest, more decisive, more constructive. You’renot taking advantage of your freedom because you’re incapable of deciding whereyou want to go. You’re a hypocrite, plunged so deeply into your privatewhirlpool of negativism that the simplest actions become forbidding. When yousee people who are married or happy or active, you feel frightened andlethargic. You don’t even want to cope. You big baby! You just want to creepback into the womb or retreat into a masochistic hell of jealously and fear.Don’t you see how selfish and self-indulgent it is to go on thinking aboutrazors and suicide and self-inflicted wounds? Start writing. Be glad for otherpeople and make them happy. Go out and do something. It isn’t your room that’s aprison, it’s yourself.”This last remark is an echo of Hesse’s Steppenwolf, his realization that what heseeks liberation from are the limits of his own personality. And although inthis passage, Sylvia knows – as she more than likely did throughout – thatsuicide is no answer, like Harry Haller, she pursued it all the same.Sleepless nights, horrible fantasies of killing her mother, shame over beingunable to maintain the discipline and demanding work-schedule she had setherself – now geared toward winning Aurelia’s approval – failure with men and inher friendships: all this and more harangued her guilty conscience. When hermother noticed fresh gashes on her legs, Sylvia admitted to self-harming. Then,gripping her mother’s hand, she burst out: “Oh mother, the world is so rotten. Iwant to die. Let’s die together.”The electro-convulsive therapy the psychiatrist prescribed did as much good forSylvia as it did for Ernest Hemingway. But her mother, remembering Otto’s deadlystubbornness, this time made the opposite mistake, and decided against a secondopinion; the fact that she couldn’t afford another doctor’s fees was also aconsideration. This was more material for The Bell Jar. Earlier, while in NewYork, Sylvia had become obsessed with the execution by electrocution of the‘atomic spies’, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Now she knew what they must havefelt. It’s difficult to assess the effect on her already troubled psyche. Notonly must the ordeal have been repeatedly horrifying and dehumanising. It washer mother who had put her into the hands of her torturer. She was put intopsychiatric care at McLean Hospital, and the treatment seemed to work, but thiswas only on the surface; the urge was still there. Like Jacques Rigaut, Sylviasimply put her suicidal intentions on hold for ten years; eventually she’d getaround to it.Sylvia’s treatment was successful enough that in 1955 she graduated from Smithsumma cum laude; the same year one of her poems won another award, and she alsostarted her classes at Cambridge. In February 1956 she met another young poet,Ted Hughes, at a Cambridge party. Four months later, on 16 June, ‘Bloomsday’(the single day making up Joyce’s Ulysses) they were married. For Sylvia, Hugheswas “the best possible man to replace the father whose death had robbed her … ofthe man who could have been trusted never to withdraw his love.”28 Hughes washandsome, tall, strong, athletic, creative, competent, and successful, both as apoet and as a lover; tales of his seductions and affairs were plentiful. Theattraction was immediate. After spying him at the party, Sylvia said he was theonly man there big enough for her. They talked for a while, then Hughes rippedoff her hairband and kissed her violently. She responded by biting Hughes on thecheek, drawing blood. Aggression was an ingredient in their relationship fromthe start. Although Plath gave the impression of a serious, sensible girl,sophisticated and poised, below the surface was a deep, insatiable hunger.Hughes, she thought, might be able to satisfy it.For a while the marriage worked. They travelled, first to Spain, then to meethis parents in Yorkshire. Sylvia took her final exams for her degree. In August1957 they went to America, vacationing in Cape Cod, Maine. In September shebegan teaching at Smith College. But by May 1958, after less than two years ofmarriage, the first signs of a rupture appeared; they quarrelled after Sylviahad found Ted with a girl. The pit of insecurity started to open. The majorevent of that year, however, was the seminar given by the poet Robert Lowell,himself a sufferer of manic-depression, that Sylvia attended and where she metand became friends with Anne Sexton. It was after this that her poetry took on anew urgency and depth. It was then that she also decided to resume the analysisshe had broken off when she left for Cambridge.In 1959, Sylvia became pregnant. After travelling through the states andspending time at a writers’ colony, they returned to England. Their first child,Frieda, was born on 1 April 1960, in London, where they settled. Later thatyear, her first collection of poems, The Colossus was published; reviews weremodest, but respectful. In 1961 she began work on what would become The BellJar; soon after, however, her second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. ThatAugust they moved to Court Green, in Devon. In January 1962, Nicholas, theirsecond child, was born.In June that year, the womb that Sylvia had wanted to creep back into almost tenyears earlier had started to attract her again. This is when she purposely droveher car off the road. Perhaps she was subconsciously aware that the man shecould trust to never withdraw his love was doing precisely that. In July shediscovered that Hughes was having an affair with Assia Wevill, the wife ofanother poet.29 Hughes himself was feeling constrained by Sylvia’spossessiveness. In September they separated and in December, at the start of oneof the worst winters in memory, Sylvia and the children moved into 23 FitzroyRoad.It was hard. Sylvia did her best. But the children were demanding, the flat wasbarely furnished, she had very few friends and it was very, very cold. On top ofthis, the man who was supposed to be there for her, as her father had been, hadabandoned her, as her father had. She tortured herself, thinking of the fun heand Assia were having, while she was here, in a half-empty, freezing house,alone with the children. She tried. She set herself an impossible work schedule,as she had done before. She would paint, repair, put the house in order, takecare of Frieda and Nicholas, and write. But it didn’t work out that way. Shecouldn’t find the time. She had an au pair, but she didn’t last. One friend shedid have was A. Alvarez, who met her and Hughes in 1960, and who remembers thatChristmas Eve in 1962 when she asked him to come by for dinner and to hear someof her new poems. They had a lot in common. They were both poets and they hadboth attempted suicide. And not so long ago he had been through a divorce.Alvarez had already been invited to a friend’s for dinner but it must have beenclear to him that she was terribly lonely, so he said he would come for a drink.When he did he was surprised. She seemed different. He had never seen her sostrained. He listened to her poems in the cold, bare flat, and the proximity ofdeath was palpable. He thought she was in some kind of ‘borderline psychotic’state, but because he was dealing with his own depression, the responsibility ofdealing with hers too wasn’t appealing. He stayed for a while, then left,knowing he had “let her down, in some final and unforgivable way.”Some other friends were Jillian and Gerry Becker, a South African couple wholived in Islington. Sylvia and the children stayed with them the weekend beforeshe killed herself. Jillian remembers her alternately talking calmly and raving.At times she was lively and rational; at others, depressed and bewildered.Although she felt that she had been overshadowed by Hughes’ more prominentsuccess, things were going well for her, she had commissions and had beeninvited to broadcast. But she couldn’t get over Ted’s betrayal, and hersedatives, stimulants and other medication couldn’t have helped her mood. Shewas expected to stay until Monday morning, when she would leave early, in timeto be at the house when the new au pair arrived. But that Sunday she changed hermind and, convincing them she was fine, she returned home.One other friend was Trevor Thomas, although at first he didn’t take to her. Shewas a bad neighbour, leaving her pram blocking the hallway, filling up hisrubbish bin instead of buying her own. But he was beginning to like her betterand soon realized she was in a bad way and needed help. One evening she had runghis bell and when he answered was in tears. “I’m going to die,” she told him.“Who will take care of the children?” Then she went off into a fit about Hughesand the Scarlet Woman, the Jezebel who had taken him away from her. She wasresponsible for all this. She was to blame. They were so happy until shearrived. Her husband was a famous poet, but she was a poet too and she should becelebrating: her book (The Bell Jar) had just been published (under thepseudonym Victoria Lucas) and had got good reviews. But he had left her with thechildren and no money and no help and had gone off with that woman. It was allher fault. His too …Thomas didn’t quite understand but it was clear she was upset and was indistress. But when he saw her the next morning she apologized for being sosilly. Nothing was wrong. She was fine. Everything was all right.What she didn’t tell him was that she would get back at them, both of them. Herten years were up. And that Sunday, when she returned from the Beckers, she did.By the time Anne Sexton met Sylvia Plath at Robert Lowell’s poetry seminar, shehad already tried to kill herself three times. By the time of her death bycarbon monoxide poisoning, sitting in her car in her garage, after having lunchwith a friend, she, like Plath, had acquired some considerable accolades: aPulitzer Prize for her book Live or Die, honorary doctorates as well as a fullprofessorship – although she lacked any academic training – a Fellowship of theRoyal Society of Literature, as well as ones from the American Academy of Artsand Letters and the Guggenheim Foundation. She had been nominated for theNational Book Award, had received several scholarships and grants and had wonliterary prizes. She had even formed a rock band30. All this however did littleto dent her basic lack of self-esteem. When asked by her therapist at theirfirst session what she thought she might be good at, she replied that the onlything she might be good at was being a prostitute; that way she might be able tohelp men feel sexually powerful. “It is difficult,” her therapist wrote, “tocommunicate fully how pervasive Anne’s profound lack of self-worth was and howtotally unable she was to think of any positive abilities or qualities withinherself.”31 Like Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton received moreobjective confirmation of her own talent and abilities than most people do. Yet,like them, she had a kind of inner vacuum, a perpetual emptiness that suckedaway any approval as soon as it was granted.Sexton’s trouble, her therapist concluded, was her “total inability to live thelife she believed was demanded of her. She felt helpless, unable to function aswife or mother …”32 She came of age in post-WWII America, when women weresupposed to be content with marriage, children and domesticity: the house,garage and 2.5 kids. Given this, its understandable that Sexton has become animportant figure for feminists, and that her career, spanning the ‘swingingsixties’, would make her for a time something of a counter-cultural figure; acommon remark about her is that she was read by people who didn’t usually likepoetry, but felt her voice ‘spoke’ to them. Sexton’s first doctor diagnosed hercondition as ‘postpartum depression’, following the birth of her second child,but she had already sought therapy before this, troubled by her infidelitieswhile her husband was in the army during the Korean War. From the beginning,sex, often incest, was a central ingredient in Sexton’s problems. She confessedto an incident of incest with her daughter, and her childhood relationship withher great-aunt Nana, with whom she would ‘cuddle’ while ignored by her parents,and for whose death she felt responsible, may have included an element ofincest. It’s also possible that she was sexually abused by her parents. She hadmany lovers and affairs, including one with one of her psychiatrists and alsopossibly with Sylvia Plath, and seemed to seek emotional security in sexualrelationships. Her actual condition, although often described as bipolar ormanic-depressive, seemed to defy definition; according to her therapist, sheexhibited “a mental disorder that eluded diagnosis or cure.” Symptoms includedtrance states, manic and sometimes violent behaviour, dread of leaving herhouse, dread at being left alone, especially with her children, multiplepersonalities, memory loss, faulty memory (or outright lying), compulsiveinfidelity, and an inclination toward and fascination with suicide.At bottom though, Sexton comes across as someone, like Virginia Woolf, who“needed the care and protection of someone whose devotion was unquestioned.” Asher biographer remarked, once her madness was out in the open, “she took on therole of patient, which she did not abandon for the rest of her life.”33 Not onlyher doctors, but her family, friends, and acquaintances were all drawn into theimpossible and unrewarding task of saving her.Sexton’s symptoms began with her becoming a mother. Although in her last days,Sylvia Plath found taking care of her children a burden and a prison, she hadbeen abandoned with them by Hughes in a cold, empty house; when their marriagewas going well, she loved being a mother. Not so Anne Sexton. Sexton lackedSylvia’s determination to excel, and her application to practical tasks. (LikeVirginia Woolf, with whom she felt a connection, Sylvia used domestic chores tofight off her fears; in her last journal entry, Woolf comments on the virtues ofcooking haddock and sausages.) Sexton was hopelessly undomestic. She feltinadequate in everything, especially when her husband was away on one of hismany business trips. On one occasion, on a day when he had driven eight hundredmiles, he called and asked her to put potatoes in the oven; he would fix therest of dinner when he got home, as he usually did. When he returned, hediscovered the potatoes were where he had left them. When he asked why shehadn’t put them in the oven, she replied that she didn’t know how. Helplessnessis often a ploy for drawing attention and care, and whether or not Sexton wasreally as inept as she appeared, her impracticality, reminiscent of WalterBenjamin’s, had the desired effect.Six months after entering treatment for her ‘postpartum depression’, Sexton’scondition worsened. She experienced a morbid fear of being alone with herbabies. It began when she returned late from a party; her husband was away and aneighbour had offered to baby-sit. Joy, her second daughter, had croup, and whenSexton returned she was choking; it was clear she couldn’t breath. Sexton turnedon the hot shower and held Joy in the bathroom all night, hoping the steam wouldhelp. After that she had a terrible fear that the children would die. Nowwhenever her husband went away, she went through terrific agonies. She wouldn’teat, and she would cry ceaselessly. Only when he returned did her symptoms stop.These fears turned into attacks of rage against the children. She would seizeLinda, her two-year old, and slap her. Once, when she found Linda playing withher excrement, she picked her up and threw her across the room. After this shebecame afraid that she would kill them. Her family stepped in, taking care ofthe children while her husband was away, hiring a woman to do the chores, evenpaying her psychiatric bills. It didn’t help. One night near the anniversary ofher great aunt’s death, Sexton fell into a deep depression. She took a portraitof Nana and the diary she kept when the family had finally decided to put her ina nursing home. Then she took the bottle of sleeping pills her doctor had givenher and went to the back porch. She sat there, the pills in one hand, theportrait in another, thinking it over. The idea that she would let her doctordown if she killed herself made her hesitate. Her husband woke up, found hersitting there in the dark, and called her psychiatrist. Sexton said she wantedto get to the place where Nana was; as with Sylvia, the womb was inviting her tocrawl back inside.Sexton was hospitalised for three weeks; her sister took Linda, and Joy livedwith her grandmother; Sexton was separated from her children for the next threeyears. In November 1956, the day before her twenty-eighth birthday, Sexton madeanother suicide attempt. She took an overdose of barbiturates, Nembutal, whichshe later called her ‘kill-me pills’. She would carry a supply of them in herhandbag ever after, ready at any time to join Nana; for a backup, she also had arazor. When she felt she was drifting off, she phoned her mother-in-law. Thefailed attempt resulted in a stay at Glenside, a forbidding mental institution,grim and depressing compared to the first clinic she had stayed at. At thispoint she and her family accepted that she was officially ‘sick’, possiblyinsane. Sexton explained: “I was trying my damnedest to lead a conventionallife, for that was how I was brought up, and it was what my husband wanted ofme. But one can’t build little white picket fences to keep nightmares out. Thesurface cracked when I was about twenty-eight. I had a psychotic breakdown andtried to kill myself.” The notion of the ‘desperate housewife’ is by now acliché, but Sexton seems to have invented the role.It’s tempting to suspect she took extreme steps to avoid her unwantedresponsibilities. “My feeling for my children,” she wrote, “does not surpass mydesire to be free of their demands on my emotions.” And even her first doctorexpressed doubts that she had a true organically based depression. Butbreakdowns on both sides of the family history suggest some inheritedpredisposition, as do the severity of her symptoms: radical mood shifts,anorexia, insomnia, suicidal impulses, wild rages.Anne may have sunk into complete madness, or she may have killed herself muchearlier than she did, if not for a suggestion by her therapist. Anne seemed tohave reserves of energy, but, like Dostoyevsky’s Stavrogin, had no idea what todo with them. She talked about walking from room to room, thinking of somethingto do, feeling like a caged animal, feeling “this almost terrible energy in me.”She had to fight not to masturbate all day, and twined her hair into knots asshe read a magazine. She made the beds, cleaned the bathroom, baked cookies, butit was all ‘displacement activity’, even the masturbation, although sex isn’tthat far removed from creative work. Her feelings of inadequacy were rooted inthe lack of attention she received from her mother, a lack she was now passingon to her own children. Her obsession with Nana was understandable: she was theone source of approval, a position that was now occupied by her husband. WhatAnne needed was to find some means of feeling capable herself. When she told hertherapist that the only thing she could be good at was prostitution, hedisagreed. His diagnostic tests showed she had a great deal of unrealisedpotential. Why don’t you write about your feelings, your experiences, he asked.If nothing else, it might help other people facing similar problems.Soon after Anne began to bring her doctor her poems. He was impressed. They werepolished, accomplished, and showed surprising technical mastery. She had finallyfound something she was good at.By 1960, her collection To Bedlam and Part Way Back was published to goodreviews. The seminar with Robert Lowell and the other poetry workshops sheattended had paid off, although she was too frightened to make the telephonecalls to ask to join them, and had to get a friend to do it. Throughout the restof her life, Sexton did practically nothing by or for herself, except write andgive her poetry performances. These were more of an entertainment than atraditional poetry reading, and were not always to the cognoscenti’s liking: atone event, an academic asked, “How about more Anne Sexton and less PhyllisDiller,” the name of a popular comedienne of the time. She refused or was unableto do the simplest things, like go shopping, unless accompanied by a closefriend. The only activities she could manage were her doctor’s appointments, andthose with her hairdresser. (Sexton always managed to keep her appearanceelegant, and in her early years had been a model.). Any other need to leave herhouse threw her into a panic. She once agonised for weeks over the need to getthe children some new shoes.She became associated with the ‘confessional’ school of poetry; as herbiographer wrote “all that was ‘sick’ or ‘hysterical’ about her behaviour inday-to-day life could be turned into something valuable through the act ofwriting poetry.”34 Understandably, her central theme was death. Her poems hadtitles like “Godfather Death,” “The Death of Fathers,” “For Mr. Death Who Standswith His Door Open,” “The Death Baby.” Her last book published in her lifetimewas The Death Notebooks. The posthumously published The Awful Rowing Toward God,which showed her later, more religious pursuits, suggests the tension and strainof her experience; this, however, was less popular with her readers.As the sixties moved on Sexton’s achievements accrued, and she moved away fromstrictly ‘confessional’ verse to cultural criticism. She lived a kind of doublelife. A public figure, publishing books, accepting awards, receivingdistinctions, on one hand; on the other, her intractable self-hatred led torepeated breakdowns, suicide attempts and the inevitable hospitalisation. Herdependencies and neuroses increased. Among others she developed an obsessionwith constipation, and wouldn’t travel without a supply of laxatives. InDetroit, after a performance, she discovered she’d ran out, and asked a friendto find some. The friend refused; Sexton got a cab and at midnight prowled thestreets, looking for an open pharmacy. Other, more necessary medications becamea routine. Like many performers, she developed a stage persona that contrastedsharply with her ‘real’ self. Confident, glamorous, commanding before anaudience, in the dressing-room she was a wreck, dependent on alcohol to inducethe manic mood necessary for her act. Heavy drinking had always been part of heradult life and in the end would lead to her final depression. Some of her ‘fans’also noticed another duality. While on stage, Anne could speak about the‘truths’ of human relations, the insights that made her poetry so meaningful toher readers. Yet in her own life, she was unable to make much use of these.Throughout her rising success, and repeated breakdowns and suicide attempts, herhusband and children tried to cope, but the situation was unstable and at timesexploded into violence, followed by forgiveness and reassurance. Yet Sexton’sinfidelities were a regular part of their marriage, and in 1973, she asked for adivorce. Their break-up precipitated her final decline. Her daughters, now youngwomen, found it difficult to handle their unpredictable mother, and many friendshad been used up, their supply of affection and concern gone. Increasingly,Sexton depended on drink and affairs to keep her going, but her health hadvisibly declined. Of Ernest Hemingway’s suicide she said “to shoot himself witha gun in the mouth is the greatest act of courage I can think of.” Her friendSylvia’s death fascinated her. They were, she had felt, in a kind ofcompetition, and Sylvia had got there first. “I’m so fascinated with Sylvia’sdeath: the idea of dying perfect, certainly not mutilated … Sleeping Beautyremained perfect …” It was time to join her.Divorced, living alone, estranged from friends and family, she had been emptiedby her misery, and her alcoholism had deadened her creativity. Her suicide,though not unexpected, was a surprise. There was no note, no warning. After afinal lunch with her long time friend Maxine Kumin, at which she seemed normal,at least for her, Anne Sexton got into her car in her garage and turned on theignition. The radio was playing. It was the act, her therapist wrote, “of alonely and despairing alcoholic.”35 In a tribute to her in the New York Times,Erica Jong wrote, “Anne Sexton killed herself because it is too painful to livein this world without numbness, and she had no numbness at all.”36Notes 1 William Styron Darkness Visible (Picador: London, 1991) p. 50. 2 Ibid. p. 17. 3 William James The Varieties of Religious Experience (Collier Books: NewYork, 1977) p. 129. 4 Kay Redfield Jamison Touched by Fire (Free Press Paperbacks: New York,1993) p. 13, 17 5 Ibid. p. 17. 6 Quoted in Carolina King Barnard Hall Anne Sexton (Twayne Publications:Boston, 1989) p. 7. 7 Anthony Storr The Dynamics of Creation (Atheneum: New York, 1972) p. 75 8 Ibid. p. 76. 9 Quoted in Diane Wood Middlebrook Anne Sexton: A Biography (Virago Press:London, 1991) p. 259.10 Trevor Thomas Sylvia Plath: Last Encounters (privately printed, Bedford,England, 1989) p. 4.11 Mitchell Leaska Granite and Rainbow: The Hidden Life of Virginia Woolf(Picador: London, 1998) p. 179.12 Storr p. 82.13 Kay Redfield Jamison points out that depression ran in Virginia Woolf’sfamily. “Her grandfather, mother, sister, brother and niece all suffered fromrecurrent depressions, her father and another brother were cyclothymic [a milderform of the ailment], and her cousin James, who had been institutionalised formania and depression, died of acute mania.” (Jamison, p. 225). Clearly, there isevidence to suggest that manic-depression and other mental and emotionaldisorders can be inherited. It is also highly possible that such inheritedtraits remain latent unless released by a ‘trigger’, which in Virginia’s caseseemed the death of her mother and the incestuous attentions of herstep-brothers.14 Although Virginia Woolf has been retroactively diagnosed as having bipolar(manic-depressive) illness, some of her symptoms seem to suggest similarities toschizophrenia. On a disastrous Italian holiday, she heard voices ordering her todo “all kinds of wild things,” King Edward spouting obscenities, and the birdssinging in Greek. Other symptoms included violence, incessant talking ending ingibberish, coma, anorexic body image, delusions, fear of being seen in public,and the belief that strangers were talking about her.15 Virginia Woolf A Writer’s Diary ed. Leonard Woolf, (The Hogarth Press:London, 1953) p. 229.16 As his satiric novel attacking the clique, The Apes of God, made clear.17 Woolf, A Writer’s Diary pp. 228–231.18 Storr, pp. 78–79.19 Ibid. p. 79.20 Leaska, p. 433.21 Quoted in Herbert Marder The Measure of Life: Virginia Woolf’s Last Years(Cornell University Press: 2000) p. 55.22 There is a blue plaque on the house, announcing, understandably, not thatPlath killed herself there, but that W. B. Yeats had lived there. Plath, wholived for a time in nearby Chalcot Square (this house does have a blue plaquenoting that fact) came across the house by chance, saw that flats in it were tolet, and quickly arranged a five-year lease, of which Hughes paid a year’s rentin advance. Later, Plath opened a volume of Yeats at random, half-hoping forsome kind of sign. The passage she found read, “Get wine and food to give youstrength and courage and I will get the house ready,” which she took to mean shehad made the right decision. Like Plath, Trevor Thomas, who himself had comeacross the house first and wanted the maisonette that Plath, he felt, stole fromhim (he wound up renting the garden flat below), was also attracted to the ideaof living in a house that Yeats had inhabited, because of his interest in theoccult, something, as is well known, Yeats was devoted to. In his memoirmentioned above (n. 10), Thomas speculates some vague connection between Yeats’occult interest and Plath’s sad end. Yet, as Yeats lived in the house as a childand only briefly, he could hardly be responsible for the “forces for good andevil” that “may have been evoked in the séances possibly held in No. 23 FitzroyRoad,” the effects of which, Thomas hints, “linger on and affect others there.”Yeats’ mother, who also lived in the house, was, it is true, a believer inghosts and fairies, but not, as far as we know, a practitioner of black magic,nor, for that matter, was Yeats.23 The bedrooms were in the upper part of the house, and as the coal gas usedin the oven is heavier than air, and so sinks, the children were free of danger.Not so Trevor Thomas, who lived below her. He inhaled the fumes as he slept,woke up sick very late that day, and was later diagnosed with carbon monoxidepoisoning.24 For example, the autopsy report states that she died on 11/2/63, but thather body was examined on 10/2/63.25 Janet Malcolm The Silent Woman: Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes (Granta Books:London, 2005). Highly recommended. Although the personal and literarycomplications and cover-ups that Malcolm untangles arose after Plath’s death,and are slightly tangential to my purposes here, some indication of what isinvolved can be gleaned from the fact that Hughes destroyed (or lost ormisplaced – both were offered at different times as explanations for whathappened to them) Plath’s last journals, even though, like Woolf, she was anobsessive diarist and clearly these last volumes would be of value inunderstanding her motivations and state of mind leading up to her suicide.Likewise unusual is the fact that Hughes, and later Olwyn Hughes, gainedcomplete control over Plath’s letters, even those written to her mother andwhich were already in her possession. When Aurelia Plath wished to publish acollection of her daughter’s letters, she had to seek permission from the Hughesestate; not surprisingly, the letters published were subject to the samerestrictions as was Anne Stevenson’s biography. Mrs. Plath was also deniedpermission to read the last letter Sylvia wrote to her, only hours before shekilled herself – at least she was strongly advised not to, and accepted this. Hughes also took legal action against both Trevor Thomas, stopping thecirculation of his privately printed memoir of Plath’s last days, as well asforcing him to retract a statement about a party being held at 23 Fitzroy Roadon the evening Plath killed herself at which bongo drums were played; and A.Alvarez, for publishing the first chapter of his book, The Savage God, in TheObserver under the title “Sylvia Plath’s Road to Suicide;” Hughes subsequentlytried to stop publication of the book, which gives an account of Alvarez’sfriendship with Plath in the weeks leading up to her death. Hughes changed theselection of her poems made by Plath herself for her collection Ariel, publishedposthumously; he retained only twenty-seven of her original forty-one poems; thepoems excised make uncomfortable suggestions about their relationship. Strangest of all, as already mentioned, Hughes placed Plath’s literaryestate into the hands of his sister Olwyn, who disliked Plath, and who had aninordinate influence over Hughes himself. Hughes, like Yeats, was a keen studentof the occult, initiated into the dark arts by Olwyn, who was a devotee ofastrology and other magical pursuits. After Sylvia’s death, Hughes remarked, “Itwas a fight to the death. One of us had to die,” implying that some kind ofcontest of wills was involved in their relationship, and he was concerned thatSylvia may have used black magic against him; there is a story that Sylvia hadonce skimmed a knife across the top of Hughes’ desk, collecting, among otherthings, his dandruff, fingernails and dead skin. Hughes was deeply interested inshamanism, and the ‘bongo drums’ Trevor Thomas reported hearing on the eveningof the day of Plath’s death, may have been a means of exorcising whateverunwanted influence of Plath that remained in the house.26 An idea of the Hughes’ take on Sylvia can be garnered by the fact that thefamily’s chief concern was over how the scandal of her suicide would affectTed’s reputation.27 Ronald Hayman points out that in order to prove that human behaviourconsisted almost completely of prejudices, Otto Plath would skin, cook and eat arat in front of his students.28 Ronald Hayman The Death and Life of Sylvia Plath (Sutton Publishing: PhoenixMill, 2003) p. 91.29 On 25 March 1969, Assia Wevill copied Sylvia Plath by gassing herself andher two year old daughter by Ted Hughes, Shura, in the kitchen of their flat.Although ‘with’ Assia at the time, Hughes was having an affair with yet anotherwoman, Brenda Hedden. Hughes himself remarked, “All the women I have anything todo with seem to die.” One wonders if he ever asked why that may have been. LikeFreud and Valery Briusov, Hughes seems to me to be one of my ‘agents ofsuicide’.30 Anne Sexton and Her Kind.31 Martin T.

On 25 November 1970, before aliterally captive audience, Mishima performed hara-kiri. His lover and discipleMasakatsu Morita, who would also attempt hara-kiri, after several attemptsfailed to decapitate Mishima as planned, leaving incomplete the kaishakunin partof the ritual, aimed to relieve the agony of disembowelment. Both received theirfinishing touches at the hands and sword of a third member of Mishima’sTatenokai (“Shield Society”), a kind of private army that Mishima hoped would bea model for a new, right-wing Japan, recapturing the samurai glories of old.That day Mishima and his followers had taken hostage an army general at aJieitai (self-defence forces) military base at Ichigaya. On threat of death,Mishima compelled the general to assemble the garrison, some 1,000 men. He thenaddressed them from the balcony, hoping to instil some of the patriotic andmilitary fervour that, along with his narcissism and strange sadomasochisticfantasies, had become a central part of his self-image. He called for a coupd’état, a rejection of the ‘Americanization’ of Japan that had begun followingWWII, and a reinstatement of the emperor. His harangues failed; the soldiersshouted abuse and obscenities. They had no interest in Mishima’s samurai dreams.As the abuse grew, Mishima shouted “Listen! Listen! Listen!” No one did, and bythis time police helicopters were drowning out both him and his hecklers.Humiliated, Mishima returned to the room where they held the general. He toreoff his jacket, revealing his naked torso. The general begged him to stop. “Iwas bound to do this,” Mishima replied. Then he knelt on the carpet, loosenedhis trousers, and grabbed the yoroidoshi, a foot-long, sharply pointed dagger.With his left hand he rubbed a spot on his lower left abdomen, then brought thepoint of the blade to its target. Behind him his lover Morita, shaking andsweating, raised his sword. Mishima shouted a final salute “Tenno Heika Banzai!”(Long live the Emperor!), then emptied his lungs. Taking one last breath, heexhaled powerfully and sent the dagger home. He made a deep horizontal cutacross his stomach; blood poured onto the floor. Completing the incisions, hisintestines exposed, he waited for Morita to end it. But as the shaking studenthesitated, Mishima collapsed, and the blow only dug deep into his shoulders. Twomore attempts failed to decapitate him. Finally, another follower, a student ofkendo (Japanese fencing), grabbed the sword and finished the job. When it wasMorita’s turn at disembowelment the panicky student did little more than scratchhimself. The kendo student again took charge and quickly dispatched him as well.Then Mishima’s followers untied the general and surrendered themselves to thepolice.Its tempting to allocate Mishima’s death to the Political Suicide category – aright-wing offering to balance Mayakovsky’s leftist sacrifice – and indeed itbelongs here to some degree, but Mishima’s politics were themselves anexpression of his deeper narcissistic and morbid sexual fantasy life. Mishima’sinterest in the samurai, the military and tradition have much more to do withhis fascination with death, blood and beautiful male bodies than with any realinsight or concern with politics. From his childhood, Mishima had a morbidfascination with “death and night and blood” and the gruesome debacle of hisgory death was something he had looked forward to for some time. His suicide wasmuch more an aesthetic than a political act.Some idea of Mishima’s psyche can be gleaned from the fact that his first orgasmwas occasioned by his discovery of a reproduction of a Renaissance painting ofSt. Sebastian, the Christian martyr, tied to a tree and shot with arrows. In hisearly autobiographical novel Confessions of a Mask he writes, “A remarkablyhandsome youth was bound naked to the trunk of a tree … Were it not for thearrows with their shafts deeply sunk into his left armpit and right side, hewould seem more a Roman athlete … The arrows have eaten into the tense,fragrant, youthful flesh, and are about to consume his body from within withflames of supreme agony and ecstasy.” The young Mishima unconsciously plays withhimself while gazing at this sight, and is surprised when his ‘toy’ “burstforth, bringing with it a blinding intoxication.” Years later, Mishima wouldfamously pose for a photograph recreating this treasured scene.As a child, Mishima was raised as a girl by his authoritarian and neuroticgrandmother, who kept him close to her side in her darkened sick room; he lateradmitted that he enjoyed being secluded with her, and like Mayakovsky andWitkacy, Mishima later developed hypochondria, specifically a food phobia.Returned to his parents at 12, he developed a semi-incestuous relationship withhis mother, and his father, a brutal military type, tried to root out anyincipient literary impulse he may have had. His favourite fairy tales were thosewhich ended in a gory death of the hero – “I was completely in love with anyyouth who was killed” – and he had a particular fascination with Hans ChristianAndersen’s “Rose-Elf,” whose hero is stabbed to death and decapitated whilekissing a rose given to him by his love. While playing with his schoolmates hediscovered a “force” within him, “bent … upon the complete disintegration of myinner balance … a compulsion toward suicide, that subtle and secret impulse.”During the war, as a teenager he worked at a kamikaze factory; realizing theplanes were designed to be destroyed, he was enchanted by the fact that thefactory was “dedicated to a monstrous nothingness.” As Japan was losing the war,with destruction all around, he felt “free.” “Everyday life had become a thingof unspeakable happiness. It was in death that I had discovered my real ‘life’saim’.” These early images and thrills had a profound effect on Mishima, and hishuge literary output, only a small fraction of which has been translated intoEnglish, can be seen as an attempt at working out the implications of theseyouthful experiences.Suicide among Japanese writers is not uncommon. Osama Dazai, with whom Mishimawas for a time in a kind of competition, and with whom he shared remarkablesimilarities, drowned himself and his mistress in 1948. Yasunari Kawabata,Mishima’s mentor, and the first Japanese author to win the Nobel Prize forliterature, gassed himself 18 months after Mishima’s suicide. The list goes on.1Yet, as Henry Scott Stokes’ brilliant biography of Mishima makes clear, “Mishimaendlessly rehearsed his own death.”2 In 1960 he wrote a story, “Patriotism,”which glorifies hara-kiri. Five years later, he turned the story into a film, inwhich he took the part of an army lieutenant who disembowels himself, remindingus of Mayakovsky’s part in the film Not Born for Money, a striking parallel. Inhis novel Runaway Horses, the protagonist, a right-wing terrorist, killshimself. And in the film Hitogiri, Mishima took the part of a man who slicesopen his stomach. The bloody scene in the Jietai headquarters that late Novembermorning was something Mishima had practised quite a bit.Like Witkacy, an irredeemable self-dramatiser, Mishima adopted many roles: ayakuza gangster, cross-dressing stage magician, body builder, family man,leather-jacketed motorcyclist. He was addicted to seeing images of himself, asthe book of photographs of him posing in the nude on the seashore, or with awhite rose in his mouth, Torture by Roses, suggests. All these examples of hisinherent exhibitionism damaged his literary reputation, and are indications ofhis basic lack of identity. But the role he embraced more than others was thatof the soldier. This was prompted by guilt over his avoiding military serviceduring the war by telling the army doctor he was tubercular; Mishima seemed towallow in masochistic shame over this, and it gave justification for hiseventual self-martyrdom. He was also ashamed of his weak, short body and sicklychildhood, and in his thirties devoted himself to physical fitness, a disciplinehe continued to his death. But unlike the German novelist Ernst Jünger, adecorated war hero, Mishima’s militarism was another expression of his fantasylife. The gruesome end of this particular fantasy was preceded by other gorydisplays. Initiation into his Tatenokai included drinking blood gathered fromthe cut fingers of the initiates, which Mishima flavoured with salt and passedaround in a cup. Mishima’s fascist tendencies, ill-judged humour anddetermination to tempt his critics came together in one of his last plays, MyFriend Hitler. One recognizes that the English initials of his “Shield Society”are SS.Most of Mishima’s novels have an underlying sadism. In The Sailor Who Fell fromGrace with the Sea, schoolboys murder one of their mothers’ lovers. In Temple ofthe Golden Pavilion, a monk burns down a temple because of its beauty. InKyoko’s House, a narcissistic actor commits suicide with his mistress. In Thirstfor Love, a widow falls in love with a young farm boy but kills him when hereturns her interest. There is also a fundamental pointlessness. In the play TheDamask Drum, the drum in question makes no sound when hit, a typical symbol. Theessential emptiness and nihilism of Mishima’s work is often obscured by thejewelled language, reminiscent in many ways of another sadistic nihilist, ValeryBriusov (see Agents of Suicide). At the time of his suicide, he had completed avast tetralogy, The Sea of Fertility, which has reincarnation as its theme, anattempt to infuse his work with something more than “night and blood and death.”But the characters involved in this saga of sixty years of Japanese history, arecaught in the same pointlessness of his earlier works. Kiyoaki, the centralcharacter, is only certain of his love for Lady Satoko when she gets engaged tosomeone else; he then seduces her and makes her pregnant, which forces her toenter a monastery, where he can never see her. Similar predicaments await him infuture incarnations, including that of the right-wing terrorist who killshimself in Runaway Horses. Like many morbid romantics, Mishima believed the onlylove worth having is an unattainable one. A better title might have been The Seaof Futility.Mishima’s fantasy of a new samurai age had nothing to do with politics, but washis attempt to impose his obsessions on reality, an attempt he more than likelyknew would fail. As one writer put it, it was “rather as if Tolkien hadorganised a plot to overthrow Queen Elizabeth and put Gandalf on the throne ofEngland.”3 That this fantasy included real blood and death is an expression ofhis capacity to compel others to share his solipsistic vision; it doesn’t takemuch to realize that, like many aesthetic suicides, Mishima had a strong beliefthat he was really the only person in the world, or at least that hissubjectivity, his needs and appetites, were more real than anything else. Whilethis may make for a powerful asset in writing, it leads to a dangerous disregardfor other people, or at least to a tendency to see them as actors in your tale.The Japanese public, however, who had hailed Mishima as one of their greats inthe 1950s, were embarrassed by his posturing and camp antics, such as starringin a trashy gangster film, and even singing the title song. By the time of hissuicide, the general reaction was mild disgust, or an echoing of the response hereceived at the hands of his captive audience.HARRY CROSBYLike Mishima, the poet manqué Harry Crosby enjoyed an elaborate fantasy life,which culminated in a dual suicide on 10 December 1929, at a friend’s studio inthe Hotel des Artistes in New York City. There is, however, some speculationthat Josephine Bigelow, the recently married woman he was having an affair with,wasn’t as keen on ending her life as he was. For Malcolm Cowley, who knew Crosbyin the Paris of the ‘Lost Generation,’ his suicide “was the last term of asyllogism: it was like the signature to a second-rate but honest and excitingpoem.”4 And like Mishima, Crosby is a good example of the aesthetic suicide’sdisinterest in other people. For Cowley, Crosby was “self-centred without beingintrospective, and devoted to his friends without being sympathetic.” The son ofone of the richest banking families in Boston and the nephew of the financierJ.P. Morgan, Crosby had a considerable inheritance, which he had no qualms aboutexploiting in his pursuit of excess; as his biography makes clear, Harry“appreciated waste,” a sentiment he shares with the renegade surrealist andfriend of Walter Benjamin, Georges Bataille5. Reckless, indifferent toconsequences, and with a “talent for carelessness,” Crosby is today seen by someas a great ‘transgressive’; most readers, however, will simply recognize aspoilt narcissist.Along with the usual retinue of extravagance enjoyed by rich kids everywhere –drink, drugs, sex, fast cars, fascinating hangers-on, including some of theliterary greats of the time – Harry’s peculiar delight was the contemplation ofdeath, his own, which he associated with and built up into a personal mythologyof sun worship, patched together from as many sources as he could find. “Iponder death more frequently than I do any other subject,” he wrote, “even inthe most joyous and flourishing moments of my life.”6 Although his poetryreceived some half-hearted applause from his more esteemed acquaintances –Lawrence, Eliot and Pound all contributed appreciations of his work to aposthumous collection, Torchbearer, admittedly commissioned and published by hisown press, Black Sun – his poems are really one long suicide note. If he hadn’tshot himself and his mistress, he would probably be less known today than he is;even his biographer Geoffrey Wolff admitted that were it not for his suicide, hewouldn’t have written a book about him.Again like Mishima, fantasies of his death were sexually stimulating. “Mutualsuicide,” he believed, was “the most sublime of couplings.”7 From the age oftwenty-two, he repeatedly announced his intention to kill himself, and he hadlong planned to achieve la grande mort with his wife Caresse, preferably byflying a plane into the sun on the day he had chosen to cash in his and herchips: 31 October 1942. In the end, however, two days after a party given forhim and Caresse by the poet Hart Crane – who would himself commit suicide twoyears later – and whose guests included William Carlos Williams, e.e.cummingsand Cowley, he took his leave with another woman. While it is true that he madesuicide pacts with practically every woman he was involved with, and these weremany, why he decided to do it ahead of schedule remains a mystery. The event,which made the headlines, inspired cummings. “2 boston dolls;” he wrote, “foundwith holes in each other’s lullaby”Harry’s fascination with death began in WWI, when he served as an ambulancedriver. On 22 November 1917, during the second battle of Verdun, after heavyshelling had destroyed his vehicle, he was amazed to find himself still alive.His good fortune shifted into guilt and afterward he commemorated the death ofhis fellow driver Andrew Davis Weld each year, on his ‘death day’. As hisbiographer wrote, “he formed his closest and most enduring friendship with acorpse …”8 Harry swore that if he should “escape this peril” he would “everafter lead a virtuous, uncomplaining life.”9 Like many such near-deathresolutions, it came to naught.Harry continued to make similar grand resolves to change his life, which weregenerally forgotten the next day, and he invariably returned to indulging inevery excess he could think of. These were considerable. He took to wearing allblack, painted his fingernails black, and wore a black cloth carnation. On atrip to North Africa, he had a cross tattooed on the sole of one foot, and apagan sun symbol on the other.10 He became a devotee of Poe, Baudelaire andother morbid, decadent writers. Drink became a particularly favourite pastimeand Harry developed an amazing capacity for intoxication; later this includedother de rigueur items like opium, absinthe and hashish. His capacity forrevelry was legendary. He would throw lavish dinner parties in his bed, oftenending with everyone in the bath. He arranged carriage races in the streets ofParis. Inheriting a huge collection of rare books, he gave them away afterreading them, sometimes pencilling in ridiculously low prices and slipping theminto bookstalls along the Seine. Like the equally excessive Aleister Crowley,Crosby developed a unique signature, attaching the image of a black sun to hisname.11 An insight into his attitude toward life can be gleaned from thistelegram, sent to his outraged Back Bay, Boston parents: PLEASE SELL $10,000WORTH OF STOCK WE HAVE DECIDED TO LIVE A MAD AND EXTRAVAGANT LIFE. He did.Again like Crowley, Crosby never grew out of an adolescent desire to shock thefolks back home. His attack on Boston provincialism began with his marriage tothe older Mary Phelps (“Polly”) Jacobs, later re-christened Caresse. She wasalready married and when Crosby fell in love with her, he threatened suicideunless she left her husband. She did and their subsequent marriage outraged bothfamilies. The couple didn’t care, as two days after their wedding they leftBoston for Paris.For a time Crosby worked at his uncle’s bank, but the financial life bored him,and, fascinated by the bohemians of Montparnasse, he soon quit, announcing hisplan to become a poet. Along with writing highly derivative decadent verse, thisincluded pursuing Rimbaud’s “systematic derangement of the senses” withalacrity. As Malcolm Cowley writes, “he had set himself the goal of going crazyin order to become a genius.”12In 1927 Harry and Caresse started the Black Sun Press. Originally titledÉditions Narcisse, an apt name for a vanity press, along with their own works,Black Sun went on to publish some of the most important writers of the time, andit is this, with his suicide, that has established Crosby in literary history.D.H. Lawrence, Archibald MacLeish, James Joyce, Kay Boyle (friend of RenéCrevel), and Hart Crane are some of the names associated with Black Sun, whichspecialized in producing lavish and highly collectible editions.13 Yet Harrywasn’t satisfied with simply enabling other writers to produce beautiful work.He was determined to be a poet himself, and although his autobiographicaljournal, Shadows of the Sun, displays neither an acute observation of the outerworld, nor any profound insight into his inner one, Crosby applied himself tothe task with tenacity. Again like Crowley, he ‘willed’ himself to become apoet, and while his work lacks any sign of natural talent, the sheer doggednessis at times admirable. Like Aldous Huxley, he read through the encyclopaedia, inorder to “become an intellectual;” unlike Huxley though, the learning wassuperficial.Although Harry moved from his earlier fin-de-siècle obsessions into a kind ofmodernism – he was associated with the avant-garde literary magazine Transitions– his fascinations remained the same. In “Lit de Mort” he writes: “I shall diewithin my lady’s arms/And from her mouth drink down the purple wine/And trembleat the touch of naked charms/With silver fingers seeking to entwine./ My dyingwords shall be a lover’s sighs/Beyond the last faint rhythm of her thighs.”14 Alater poem, “Assassin,” which Wolff describes as “a sometimes brutal, sometimessuicidal, sometimes visionary poem of more than a hundred lines,” begins “TheMad Queen commands: Murder the sterility and hypocrisy of the world, destroy theweak and insignificant, do violence to the multitude in order that a new strongworld shall arise to worship the Mad Queen, Goddess of the Sun.”15 Further on,“the mirror crashes against my face and bursts into a thousand suns” and “Icrash out through the window, naked, wide-spread upon a Heliosaurus … and plungeit into the ink-pot of the Black Sun …”Although the influence of Rimbaud is clear, and the dying fall of Dowson hasbeen jettisoned, Crosby is fixed on the same point. As Wolff says, “Assassin” is“less a poem than a testament, and its art is almost overwhelmed by itspathology.” One last quotation seems to clinch this. “I the Assassin chosen bythe Mad Queen I the Murderer of the World shall in my fury murder myself. Ishall cut out my heart take it into my joined hands and walk towards the sunwithout stopping until I fall down dead.”How he could continue walking once his heart had been cut out is unclear, butits doubtful Crosby ever considered making sense. In another poem “Sun-Death,”(later titled “Hail Death!”), Harry name checks great suicides of the past:Socrates, Sappho, Cleopatra, Jesus, Van Gogh and others, and repeats Nietzsche’sinjunction to “die at the right time.” The right time, according to Harry, waswhen “your soul and your body, your spirit and your senses are concentrated, arereduced to a pin-point, … the point of finality, irrevocable as the sun …” Onlythen can we “penetrate into the cavern of the sombre Slave-Girl of Death,” and“enjoy explosion” with her. And he warns against the stupid death of thePhilistines, which can be nothing more than a whimper, and whose bodies andsouls are “dumped unceremoniously into the world’s latrine …”16How running off to a friend’s studio in New York’s Hotel des Artistes with anewly married woman qualified as his “point of finality, irrevocable as thesun,” remains an open question. A few days before his death he had invitedCaresse to jump with him from the twenty-seventh floor of the Savoy-Plaza Hotel.She declined. Although she may have agreed to fly a plane into the sun in lateOctober 1942, that was more than a decade away. Caresse, like Harry, had manyother lovers and perhaps she was enjoying them too much to want to call itquits. Josephine Bigelow, however, seemed mad on the idea, although how muchthis was sincere and how much it was morbid pillow talk is unclear. They wereextravagant people and they said extravagant things. A poem from her to Harryrelates their shared delights: orchids, caviar, champagne, the number 13, thecolour black. It also said what she knew Harry wanted to hear: “Death is ourmarriage.” At the time Harry was in love with at least four women: Caresse,Josephine, and two others, Constance Coolidge, otherwise known as the Comtessede Jumilhac, and a woman he called the Sorceress. But then Harry was always inlove with someone.He had bought an automatic a year earlier, had a sun engraved on it and took tocarrying it. While Caresse, Harry’s mother and his uncle J.P. Morgan waited forHarry to arrive at Morgan’s townhouse for lunch, he and Josephine had otherplans. When he didn’t turn up, J.P. was miffed and Caresse concerned. Later, atdinner with Hart Crane, there was still no word, and Caresse, knowing of Harry’sfrequent rendezvous’ at his friend’s studio, telephoned the friend and asked ifhe would see if Harry was there. The friend knew he was; he had let Harry andJosephine in earlier that day, and he agreed to go and tell Harry to get intouch. When he arrived the door was bolted from the inside; when he knocked, noone answered. Eventually the building superintendent used an axe. Inside, theydiscovered Harry and Josephine fully clothed in bed. A fresh bullet hole was inhis right temple, another was in Josephine’s left temple. In Harry’s hand wasthe Belgian automatic, engraved with the sun. A doctor who examined the bodiessaid that Harry had lived for two hours after Josephine. He had shot her, then,two hours later, shot himself.Accounts of their relationship differ. For some they were desperately in love;for others, she was a nuisance Harry was eager to get rid off. For still others,especially Josephine’s husband, she was happily married and the idea that shewas serious about suicide was absurd; it was clear Harry had murdered her. Whatexactly happened is still uncertain. Perhaps, dared to do it, he acted onimpulse, produced the pistol, and followed through. Then, realizing he would becharged with murder, he decided that after all, now was the right time to die.There was no suicide note, except, of course, his poems, and this disappointedthe press and the police. The tabloids had a field day in any case, but lessthan a week later the deaths were old news and were forgotten. As Geoffrey Wolffwrites: “Harry’s shot was not heard round the world, nor did its bangreverberate beyond the merest instant.”17GEORG TRAKLOn 2 November 1914, in a Cracow hospital in the early days of WWI, the Austrianpoet Georg Trakl injected an intentional overdose of cocaine, after earlierbeing prevented from blowing his brains out.18 Traumatised by the carnage on theeastern front, by his drug addiction and by life in general, Trakl fell into acoma and died the next day. Three days later, the philosopher LudwigWittgenstein, who had anonymously given a large part of his inheritance to Trakl(another recipient was the poet Rilke), responding to a request to visit him inhospital, arrived only to find Trakl’s grave. It was perhaps provident thatTrakl and Wittgenstein did not meet. Constitutionally incapable of handling anyresponsibility, even one as cheering as accepting a large sum gratis, whenattempting to draw on the money Wittgenstein had given him, Trakl had run out ofthe bank in a panic, unable to deal with his windfall.The shyest of men, on trains Trakl preferred to stand in the corridor, ratherthan share a compartment with a stranger, and for much of his time he led aferal, vagabond existence, choosing to sleep in the woods around Innsbruck,rather than face contact with a landlord. In a letter to his friend KarlHeinrich, a year before his death, Trakl wrote: “I do not have easy days at homenow and I drift between fear and helplessness in sunny rooms where it isunspeakably cold. Strange shudders of transformation, bodily experienced to thepoint of vulnerability, visions of mysteries until the certainty of having died,ecstasies to the point of stony petrifaction, and a continuation of dreaming saddreams.” To another friend he wrote, “It seems to me that I wander around dailylike a vagabond, at times in the forests which are already turning red and wheremarksmen harass the wild life to death; or I explore disconsolate streets in thebleak areas of town, or simply lounge around and watch the seagulls …”Dissolution, death, decay, madness, loneliness, and fear are some of thestandard themes in Trakl’s dark, sombre verse. As one critic put it, Trakl’slife displayed the trajectory of a “progressively deteriorating personality,”and his death was the “culmination of a grimly logical pattern.”19Georg Trakl was born in Salzburg on 3 February 1887, the fifth of seven childrenof a successful ironmonger. Although brought up in a prosperous, bourgeoisfamily, Georg’s childhood had its share of dissonances. His mother was Catholic,his father Protestant, and in his early years Georg went to a Catholic school inthe morning, and received instruction in the Protestant faith in the afternoon.Neither of his parents had much time for him. His father, who was fifty whenGeorg was born, paid him little attention, especially in later life, when hemight have benefited by his intervention. His mother, who suffered fromdepression and took opium to relieve the strain, spent most of her time lockedin her rooms, caring for her antiques. Georg’s strongest bond was with hissister Grete, and there’s reason to believe their relationship was incestuous.She too, like her brother, became addicted to drugs at an early age, and likehim she also committed suicide, shooting herself at a party in Berlin threeyears after Georg’s death. There’s little evidence Trakl had an emotionalrelationship with any woman beside Grete. He hated his mother, and at one pointconfessed that he could strangle her. His other contact with women came from hisvisits to brothels, and he is said for a time to have maintained a platonicrelationship with an aged prostitute who would listen to him talk.It’s possible the suicidal impulse that ended his life appeared early on. As achild he’s said to have thrown himself in front of a frightened horse, and tohave stepped in front of a moving train. On another occasion, this deathinstinct resulted in a darkly comic incident. Sometime between the age of fiveand eight, Trakl walked into a pond until it was over his head. He was onlysaved because someone saw his hat floating on the surface. Apocryphal or not,this image seems to convey some essence of Trakl’s brief and failure-proneexistence. With Walter Benjamin and Anne Sexton, Trakl comes across as a masterof ineptitude. A poor student, he had to repeat classes, and eventually had toleave school, failing to complete his courses at the Gymnasium. Poor academicresults are not unusual in poets, but in Trakl’s case the tendency was amplifiedby the drug habits he picked up in his teens. By fifteen he carried a flask ofchloroform, and was dipping his cigarettes in an opium solution. This earlyindulgence later led to continuous use of morphine, veronal and the cocaine thateventually killed him. Alcohol, too, became a frequent crutch, and Trakl oncedescribed his life as “days of delirious drunkenness and criminal melancholy.”20There’s a story of Trakl’s parents coming home one afternoon and finding Georglaid out on the sofa, stoned; on a later occasion, he slept outside overnight inthe winter, drunkenly insensate to the cold and snow.Like Anne Sexton, aside from poetry, there was very little Trakl was good at. Asthe poet Jeremy Reed remarked, Trakl was reluctant “to accept responsibility forliving.” “Unable to commit himself to life, and constantly delaying the process,[Trakl] reverted psychologically to states supported by primal, mythicconsciousness.”21 A kind of poetic Peter Pan, Trakl was sent into a panic by anyneed to deal with the necessities of life. His poetry, Reed writes, “anticipatedapocalyptic catastrophe on an inner plane, but he was little physicallyqualified to deal with the reality.”22Trakl was probably introduced to drugs by a pharmacist’s son, who pilfered themfrom his father’s supplies. Failing to complete his schooling, Trakl hit on theidea of apprenticing himself to a pharmacy, thereby insuring a steady sourcewhile incidentally learning how to make a living. (Throughout Trakl’s briefmature life – if we can call it that – the need for money to buy drugs was aconstant concern.) In 1905 he began his three-year term at the White Eaglepharmacy in Salzburg. Around this time he became friends with a local bohemian,Gustav Streicher, a playwright who seems to have put Trakl on the road tobecoming a poète maudit. Streicher encouraged him to write, and Trakl producedtwo plays. Both were performed, but received bad reviews. Trakl also had hisfirst work published in a Salzburg newspaper, a piece of impressionistic prose,lost to us now. By this time he was looking the part of the Rimbaudesque bad boy– long hair, sideburns, unkempt dress – drinking and smoking almostcontinuously. A friend at the time described him as “sullen, testy, arrogant,self-conscious and tired of life.”23 He announced that he had decided to killhimself so frequently, that one exasperated friend replied, “Please, not while Iam with you.”Finishing his apprenticeship, to complete his training Trakl entered theUniversity of Vienna. Here he spent most of his time carousing with friends. Oneimportant contact was with the critic Hermann Bahr, who helped Trakl place threepoems in the Neue Wiener Journal, his first publication outside of Salzburg. In1910 he completed his university training, and that year Trakl was faced withthe necessity of fending for himself. His father died, and with this the smallallowance he was granted ended. Trakl faced the poverty he would know for therest of his life. One way to avoid the horrors of everyday life was, ironically,to enter the military, and Trakl began a one-year term of service in the army.But this was only temporary, and after his year he was faced with the sameproblem. He tried to work at a pharmacy in Salzburg, but the experience wascatastrophic: dealing with customers so unnerved Trakl that he would sweatthrough several shirts in a day; finally he quit. He would, more or less, remainunemployable for the remainder of his life. After finally getting a position hesought in the Viennese bureaucracy, he quit after only two hours. Other jobsfared similarly, and his attempts to emigrate to Borneo or Albania in search ofwork also failed. From this time on, Trakl’s search for some secure perch inlife was coupled with his need and inability to establish a firm identity.In 1912, Trakl returned to the military, and was sent to work in an armyhospital in Innsbruck. Here he had his first and only stroke of good luck. Atthe Café Maximilian, Trakl met Ludwig von Ficker, publisher of the literaryjournal Der Brenner (which, among other things, was in part responsible for theKierkegaard revival in the early twentieth century.) Predictably, the meetingtook some effort; Trakl sat apart from the group around Ficker for hours,paralysed by shyness. Finally, he asked a waiter to deliver his card. Fickerinvited him over, and from then on until his death, Der Brenner would publish aTrakl poem in every issue. Through Ficker Trakl met the only men of genius equalto his own that he would know: the satirist Karl Kraus, the painter andplaywright Oscar Kokoschka, and the architect Adolf Loos. Through Der Brennerthe novelist Franz Werfel (who followed the trail Walter Benjamin took throughthe Pyrenees; see “The Political Suicide”) read his poems and was so impressedthat he convinced his publisher, Kurt Wolff, to publish them. In July 1913,Gedichte (Poems), the only collection published in Trakl’s lifetime, appeared; asecond collection, Sebastian in Traum (Sebastian in a Dream) was also accepted,but appeared after his death.Yet although his time in Innsbruck and his association with Ficker was probablythe happiest and most promising of his life, Trakl was never really happy andits clear he suffered from some form of mental imbalance, most likelyschizophrenia. To a friend at this time he was “silent, reserved, shy, entirelyturned inward … sensitive, sick.” He had “hallucinations” and “raves.”24 Onehallucination, which he said had also come to him as a child, was of a manstanding behind him with a drawn knife. Later, when under observation by armyphysicians, Trakl confessed that he heard bells; he also told them that his realfather was a cardinal and that he himself was destined for some greatness – anot unusual remark from a poet, and in part justified. Trakl probably hadvisions throughout his life and, as in the case of the French poet Gérard deNerval, his friends may have simply chalked these up to his temperament. At acountry fair, for example, he once pointed to a calf’s head and announced, “Thatis our lord Christ!” He would also sit for hours in company without saying aword, then suddenly erupt into a monologue having nothing to do with whateveranyone else had been talking about.That he himself had doubts about his sanity can be seen in a letter Trakl wroteto Ficker, ostensibly about his concern over his sister’s marital problems andrecent miscarriage. (She had married an older man for security, but soonrealized her mistake, and, like Georg, had used drugs to compensate.) He toldFicker, “I no longer know in from out,” a concise description of a schizoidsplit. “It is such an indescribable disaster when one’s world breaks apart. Ohmy God, what a judgement has broken over me. Tell me that I must have the powerto live on and act truthfully. Tell me that I’m not insane. A stony darkness hasbroken in. Oh my friend, how small and unhappy I have become.”25Although it’s difficult to see Trakl ever overcoming his difficulties, theoutbreak of WWI made this more or less impossible. Trakl was sent to Galicia, onthe eastern front, and, with no medical training, was single-handedlyresponsible for the care of ninety badly wounded soldiers following the battleof Grodek. Trakl could do little to help and the screams and shrieks of painwere terrifying. A soldier who could no longer stand it shot himself in thehead, and Trakl could see pieces of his brain sticking to the wall. He ranoutside, but there, in the courtyard, he saw the corpses of partisans hangingfrom the trees; it’s possible he may even have seen one place the noose over hisown head. This was too much, and at dinner that evening he announced that hewould shoot himself, and ran outside. He was stopped before he could pull thetrigger and put under arrest. He was sent to Cracow, where he shared a room witha lieutenant suffering delirium tremens; understandably, his condition worsened.Trakl’s suicidal impulse may have broken out earlier than this. At Grodek he’ssaid to have tried to rush to the front line; it took six men to disarm him, aresurgence, perhaps, of the same urge that had him step in front of a movingtrain. While in Cracow he expressed concern that he would be tried forcowardice, and perhaps this led to his final attempt, although a military thatcould put as unstable an individual as Trakl in charge of ninety badly woundedmen should itself have faced a court martial. A doctor in charge of Traklremarked that his case represented an interesting example of “genius andmadness,” and noted that his patient “ ‘wrote poetry’ ”, the inverted commassuggesting the dubious character of the practice. Ficker managed to see Trakl inCracow; it was then that he suggested writing to Wittgenstein, who was also atthe front, to ask him to visit. (Ficker had been chosen by the philosopher todistribute his donations.) Ficker also asked Trakl if he had any drugs. “Would Ibe alive otherwise?” the poet replied, ironically making clear that they werethe only thing keeping the horror of reality from overwhelming him. Evidentlythey couldn’t do this for long, and on that November day, Trakl used them foranother, more lasting release from an unbearable situation.HEINRICH VON KLEISTImmanuel Kant was perhaps the most influential philosopher of the last fewcenturies and his Critique of Pure Reason is one of the most importantphilosophical works in the canon. By the time of his death in 1804 he wasclearly aware of his achievement and of the enormous impact his work had on hiscontemporaries. What Kant wouldn’t know was that seven years after his death hisideas about epistemology, the study of how we know what we know, would lead to asuicide, a double one in fact. On 21 November 181126, on a grassy knolloverlooking Lake Wannsee just outside Berlin, the playwright and novelistHeinrich von Kleist put a bullet through the heart of his companion HenrietteVogel, a 31 year-old woman with an incurable cancer, and then placed the barrelof the gun in his mouth and fired. Although Kleist, like Harry Crosby, had shownan inclination to form suicide pacts, with both male and female friends, from anearly age, it was his study of Kant that sent him over the edge. “My one supremegoal has vanished, and I am bereft,” he wrote after reading the sage ofKönigsberg. Kleist read Kant in 1801, and in that year, legend has it, he andsome friends walked along the Wannsee, discussing the best methods of killingoneself. Ten years later, at the age of thirty-four, Kleist decided to put someof their ideas to the test.Kleist’s ‘supreme goal’ was to order his life according to the Enlightenmentideals of reason and logic. Like many of his time, he strove to organize amethodical ‘life plan’ and to put it into effect. Knowledge, understanding, andplanning, he believed, could master life’s chaos and reduce the wild andarbitrary to the controlled and orderly. Happiness could be attained, providedone pursued it rationally. But Kant, as far as Kleist was concerned, had pulledthe rug out from under this project by showing that we can never know the worldas it is in itself, but only as our perceptions show it to us; only, that is, asappearance. All we can know is the world of the senses, and they are by no meansinfallible. What the world is really like is a mystery. Our knowledge, and thecertainty it provides, is, Kant argued effectively, severely limited. Thistroubled Kleist. “We cannot decide if what we call truth is really truth, orwhether it only seems that way to us,” he despaired in a letter of 1801, theyear of his ‘crisis’.Such abstruse metaphysics may leave most of us unperturbed, but their effect onKleist was devastating. “Regardless of whether this interpretation talliedexactly with Kant’s teaching,” Kleist’s biographer Joachim Maass writes, “itpierced Kleist’s heart like a poisoned arrow and sent him staggering.”27 Theresult, or so Kleist believed, was a shattering insight into life’s fundamentaluncertainty, its dissonance with our own hopes and aims, a discontinuity thatcarried through down to the individual and society. This dark, disturbing visionbecame the essence of Kleist’s work, seen in his novel Michael Kohlhaas, instories like “The Earthquake in Chile,” and even in comedies like The BrokenJug. Writing of Kleist’s plays, E.L. Doctorow remarked that their “overwhelmingsense […] is of immense disorder, teeming madness, an infernally wildfluctuation of feeling and event.”28 Kafka, he says, loved Kleist’s work, andread him aloud to his friends.Such a vision is by now commonplace. Epistemological, moral and culturalrelativity reign; it’s the so-called ‘postmodern condition’. But in Kleist’stime it was radical, and many, including Kleist’s older contemporary Goethe, whoaffirmed the harmony between personality and the world, took it as a sign ofmadness. Goethe is said to have burned his copy of Kleist’s play Das Kätchen vonHeilbronn, about shared dreams and somnambulism, because it was “tainted with anincurable disease.”29 Like his other contemporary, E.T.A. Hoffmann (who Goethealso disapproved of), Kleist had an interest in trance, dreams and other alteredstates of consciousness, an expression of his rejection of reason and inherentmysticism.Today, like his near-contemporary Thomas Lovell Beddoes, Kleist is seen as aheadof his time, a precursor of contemporary literary themes like the theatre of theabsurd, existentialism and post-modernism. After Kant, consciousness for Kleist,as for many of us, became a burden; it no longer illuminated the path torational perfectibility, but the unavoidable descent to the abyss. Hence, in hisbrilliant and beautiful essay, “On The Marionette Theatre,” Kleist argues thatno adult human being possesses the grace and unself-conscious ease of movementwe find in puppets. He posits some future state in which this innocence may berecaptured, denied us since our exile from the garden and, more recently, ourloss of childhood. “Grace,” he writes, “appears in that form which either has noconsciousness or an infinite consciousness. That is, in the puppet or in thegod.” Another form of unconscious grace, one that Kleist in the end would availhimself of, is, of course, death.Bernd Heinrich Wilhelm von Kleist – to give his full name – was born on 18October 1777 in Frankfurt-on-the-Oder; Kleist himself, however, celebrated hisbirthday on 10 October, an indication of the ambiguity associated with his life.Kleist’s Prussian family was well known, and he came from a long line ofgenerals, although there was one poet, Ewald von Kleist, a friend of Lessing’s,whose death fighting for Frederick the Great at the hopeless battle ofKunersdorf can be seen as a kind of suicide. Like many romantic young men,Kleist thought little of his family’s standing, and he said that he would gladlyabandon honour, nobility and class, in exchange for love and happiness. There’slittle known about Kleist’s childhood, which he thought of as ‘joyless’, andwhich, he claimed, was attended by ‘musical hallucinations’. His tutor spoke ofhim as a fiery spirit, provoked into rages by trifles, but also possessed ofgenerosity and chivalry. An inordinate response to everyday incidents is acharacteristic of both Kleist’s life and work, and early on he made a suicidepact with his cousin, agreeing to take their lives if “anything unworthy” shouldbefall them.In this Kleist seems one of Hesse’s ‘suicides,’ who are ready at a moment’snotice to give up their self. There was, as Maass argues, “not a single work inwhich he did not treat explicitly or implicitly of this alternative, not asingle defeat to which he did not respond with a yearning for self-destruction.”Like Jacques Vaché and Harry Crosby, he didn’t want to die alone; “the deathdrive and love were for him inseparable, a longing, as it were, for the ultimateembrace.”30 His closest relationship seemed to be with his half-sister Ulrike,from his father’s first marriage; in later life, after the failure of his ownrelationships, she provided some measure of emotional ballast, as well asfrequent financial support. In his last days, however, a falling out with herprecipitated his release from this world.At 14, Kleist joined a regiment of guards at Potsdam and had achieved the rankof second lieutenant before he decided to leave the military eight years later,after seeing service in the Rhine campaign against revolutionary France. Heentered Frankfurt University, studying physics, mathematics, philosophy,cultural history and law. “I have set myself a goal that will require theunremitting exertion of all my powers and the use of every minute’s time,” hewrote, embarking on his project of self-betterment with the kind of intensitythat would in the end undermine him. In the same year, 1799, he confided toUlrike that he found it “incomprehensible how a human being can live without aplan for his life; the sense of security with which I employ my present time andthe calm with which I look to the future make me profoundly aware of just whatinestimable happiness my life plan assures me.” Yet, this confidence concealedan insecurity. “Existing without a life plan,” he continued, “without any firmpurpose, constantly wavering between uncertain desires, constantly at variancewith my duties, the plaything of chance, a puppet on the strings of fate – suchan unworthy situation seems so contemptible to me and would make me so wretchedthat death would be preferable by far.”31Ironically, a wavering, unstable life was precisely what was in store forKleist; again like Thomas Lovell Beddoes, he would find himself shifting backand forth between several cities: Dresden, Paris, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Berlin,Basle, Prague. In 1800, in an effort to anchor himself in respectability, heinitiated an engagement with Wilhelmine von Zenge, the daughter of a regimentalcommander. The two were unsuitable and the engagement was another part of his‘life plan’. It had little time to succeed, as Kleist soon left Frankfurt forLeipzig and Dresden. In Würzberg he underwent some kind of surgery which, heinformed his fiancé, would make him ‘worthy’ of her. There’s suspicion thatKleist was impotent and/or homosexual, or that he had some deformity (he didsuffer from a speech defect, which made him uneasy in company); in any case hissexual life remains mostly obscure (he seemed to exhibit a lifelong abstinence),and the engagement was soon broken off. Not, however, before Wilhelmine tried torefute the new scepticism that had overtaken him. She was concerned that hisobsession would interfere with him obtaining some position that would enablethem to marry. He was concerned that it had undermined the entire foundations oflife. In 1802 he abruptly ended the engagement and, more or less, jettisoned anyclaim on normality. That same year he began to write.In 1803 Kleist moved between Berne, Milan, Geneva and Paris. At some point onhis return to Prussia, he had a nervous breakdown. He contemplated followingRousseau’s philosophy and thought of living as a peasant while getting ‘back tonature’; at the same time he considered joining Napoleon’s army in the hopes ofbeing killed during his planned invasion of England. His first play, TheSchroffenstein Family, appeared anonymously, and he began work on The BrokenJug. He also started work on a tragedy, Robert Guiscard, but burned themanuscript in disgust. Kleist had by this time met Goethe, Schiller and Wielandand his literary profile, if not his professional one, was rising. In 1805 hetried for a second time to enter the Prussian civil service, but was predictablyunsuccessful. In 1807, while trying to enter occupied Berlin without a passport(the year before, Napoleon had routed the Prussians and had occupied thecountry), he was arrested by the French and spent six months in prison. Here hewrote Penthesilea, which anticipates Nietzsche’s savage vision of the Dionysiancharacter of Greek tragedy, rejecting the received notion of Apollonian serenityembraced by Goethe. On his release from prison, his first short stories startedto appear.In Dresden, with the philosopher Adam Müller, Kleist started a literary journal,Phoebus; here he published perhaps his best known story, “The Marquise of O,”about a woman who discovers she is pregnant but has no idea how it happened orwho is responsible. The journal however soon went bust and Kleist and Müllerparted on bad terms. Kleist suffered another failure at the hands of Goethe, whostaged an unsuccessful production of The Broken Jug; Kleist was so enraged hewanted to challenge Goethe to a duel. Perhaps prompted by his imprisonment,Kleist had become fanatically patriotic and he devoted himself to writingpolitical poems and tracts. But in 1809, Austria was trounced at Wagram andKleist fled to Prague where he fell seriously ill with some unspecifiedcomplaint. Rumours that he had been admitted to an insane asylum competed withothers that he had planned to assassinate Napoleon; he did, indeed, ask a friendto procure arsenic for him, but this probably had more to do with a plannedsuicide attempt than a political murder. At any rate, Kleist felt at an end;writing, he said, had become pointless. “How shall I ever pull myself together?”he asked Ulrike in a letter. The “imperfect state of the world, the fundamentalirreconcilability of the social order with justice and decency” that Thomas Mannsaw at the centre of Kleist’s vision had, it seemed, triumphed.1810 was a better year, at least at first. He finally settled in Berlin andthere started the city’s first daily newspaper, the Berliner Abendblätter.Initially successful, it was later censored by the government, and itsreadership dropped. By early 1811, it folded, and Kleist was again left adrift.Financially insecure, his work, although acknowledged by his peers, havinglittle public success, Kleist again tried to gain a toehold in the civilservice, but again failed. He had by this time met Henriette Vogel, one of the‘interesting’ women courted by the Berlin romantics; she had already been one ofMüller’s lovers, but he left her to marry a woman Kleist had been in love with.At 33, Henriette was no longer pretty. But she had wit, an appetite forknowledge, was an accomplished pianist and singer and, perhaps most resonantwith Kleist, was given to spiritual exaltation. She was also suffering from aterminal uterine cancer, and had not concealed her yearning for a quick death,to avoid a certain slow and painful one.Although Kleist found her unattractive at first, Henriette pursued him; herhusband, a good natured accountant, apparently accepted the affair. Recently,Marie von Kleist (no relation), a woman Kleist had great feeling for, had leftBerlin, and Henriette moved to fill the void. At one point, Kleist dramaticallypromised that he would do whatever she asked of him. Soon after this, listeningto her sing to her own accompaniment, Kleist enthused: “It was so beautiful Icould shoot myself!” Their eyes met and Henriette reminded him of his promise.He assured her he would keep his word. She then asked him to shoot her.The couple decided on a plan. They needed an accomplice, and Henriette chose aclose friend of her husband’s, whom she assured Kleist would perform therequisite duties. Writing their farewells and placing them in a sealed box, theychose a popular inn near the Wannsee, the appropriately named New Jug, as thesite of their last days. In his final letters to Marie von Kleist, whom he hadon several occasions asked to accompany him to the next world (and who hadobviously declined) Kleist wrote, “Since my childhood days, in my thoughts andin my writing, I have been in constant contact with beauty and morality and thathas made me so sensitive that the most trifling aggressions […] are doubly andtrebly painful.”32 Like Anne Sexton, Kleist killed himself because he had no‘numbness’; like Werther, he could find no place for himself in the world, andhis idealism left him bruised at the slightest rebuff. It’s no wonder Goetherecoiled from him. Like Kierkegaard, Kleist could see the world only in terms ofan ‘either/or’: either total triumph or a quick departure. His last lettersdisplay remarkable insight into his inability to reconcile himself with theworld, and a delicacy of feeling toward those he was leaving behind. He alsoasked that his barber be paid what he was owed. For her part, Henriette leftdetailed instructions for a Christmas gift for her husband.The couple arrived at the New Jug on the afternoon of the 20th. To the innkeeperand his wife, they seemed happy and carefree, but that night they were heardpacing the floor. The next morning they awoke early, and asked if a letter couldbe sent to Berlin. A messenger was found and the letter dispatched. They askedabout the lake and if a boat could take them to the further shore. There was noboat, they were told, but it wasn’t a long walk. They seemed in fine spirits andin the afternoon asked if the messenger would reach his destination soon. Theywere assured he would; at this they seemed glad. They then asked that coffee bebrought to them at a grassy spot, not far from the inn, overlooking the lake.This was surprising, as the weather was cold and a fog was settling. But theyinsisted and were generous with their thalers; as they walked away, thehousekeeper wondered what might be in the basket Henriette carried and which wascovered by a white cloth. She soon found out.When the housekeeper brought the coffee, Henriette wondered if they couldn’thave a table and chairs as well. The housekeeper said the coffee would be coldby the time she could do this, but she insisted again. When these too werebrought, Kleist asked for a pencil; when this was brought, Henriette gave thewoman one of the coffee cups, asked her to wash it, and to bring it back. As thewoman walked away, baffled by these requests, yet happy with the guests’largess, she heard a shot. “A funny couple,” she thought, “playing with guns.”Then she heard another one.When she returned with the washed cup she found them. Henriette lay on her back,her coat open and a small dark hole showing on her blouse. Kleist knelt by herfeet, his left arm hanging over his left leg, his right hand, still clutchingthe pistol, on her hip, his head resting on it. The housekeeper understood whatwas in the basket. Bloody foam oozed from Kleist’s mouth. By seven that evening,Henriette’s husband, accompanied by the friend entrusted with the gruesomecharge, had arrived; they had received the letter as the couple consummatedtheir tryst. The instructions, detailed, considerate, and not unreasonable,included a request to be buried side by side. They were, but not before anautopsy performed on Kleist reached the conclusion that his brain showed clearevidence of “mental unbalance;” Kleist would have been pleased to know that thesaw used to open his skull had broken. A failure by all accounts in hislifetime, today the Kleist prize is one of the most honoured literary awards inGermany.THOMAS LOVELL BEDDOESLike the Hungarian writer, physician and suicide Géza Csáth33, the poet,dramatist and doctor Thomas Lovell Beddoes combined a career in medicine withone in literature. In Csáth’s case, the appeal of a medical career had much todo with his drug addiction; for Beddoes it was a combination of his obsessionwith death and dead bodies – he was, for Ezra Pound, “the prince of morticians”– and his strange conviction that the study of physiology and anatomy would leadto a new era in drama. Sadly, Beddoes’ careers in both medicine and literaturewere practically non-starters. Although he received his MD in 1831 from theUniversity of Würzberg, he never practised professionally. And although hecompleted the work for which, if at all, he is known today, Death’s Jest-Book,in 1829, he spent the remaining twenty years of his life revising it, andpublishing nothing. His ‘messterpiece’ itself, as it might be called, onlyappeared after Beddoes’ death. Although peppered with lyrical, if macabrebeauty, it remains more an oddity than anything else and is, as one critic putit “perfectly adapted to remain unread.”An uncomfortable air of frustrated energies surrounds Beddoes, partly rooted inhis often thwarted homosexuality; among his several neuroses was an inability tofinish his projects, hence Graham Greene’s sobriquet of “the filibusteringmedical poet.” Delay even followed him to the grave. After his death, his friendand editor Thomas Forbes Kelsall bequeathed his collection of Beddoes’ papers tothe poet Robert Browning. Although Browning announced that if he ever became aprofessor of poetry, his first lecture would be on Beddoes, “a forgotten Oxfordpoet,” he himself stashed the MSS in a box and left them untouched for a decade;Beddoes, then, was doubly forgotten. The box, the MSS and Beddoes’ interminablerevisions are reminiscent of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, who kept asimilar collection of scraps, fragments, and jottings in cramped, crowdedhandwriting in a similar chest; like Beddoes’, Pessoa’s best known ‘work’, TheBook of Disquietude, remained unfinished. Like Pessoa, Beddoes committed hiswork to an unwieldy mess of notes, and like his MSS, Beddoes’ life was one offragments and pieces.For Harold Bloom, “Beddoes, in despair of his time and of himself, chose towaste his genius on a theme that baffled his own imagination.”34 That theme wasdeath, and like Harry Crosby, Beddoes seemed to have little else on his mind. Hemade more than one suicide attempt. As one of the characters in Death’sJest-Book says: “O Death! I am thy friend, I struggle not with thee, I love thystate: Thou canst be sweet and gentle, be so now; and let me pass praying awayinto thee …” In 1848, after failing to open an artery sufficiently enough forhim to bleed to death – a sad showing for an anatomist – Beddoes’ leg becamegangrenous, and had to be amputated below the knee. A year later, in 1849, atthe age of forty-six, in his third suicide attempt, Beddoes finally managed tokill himself in a Basle hospital by ingesting a dose of curare, the Orinocoarrow-tip poison that a century later would become an accessory to generalanaesthesia. There is a certain irony in this: one of Beddoes’ early tragicworks was entitled Love’s Arrow Poisoned, an expression of the macabre blackhumour that coloured his life. In his suicide note, Beddoes wrote: “I ought tohave been, among a variety of other things, a good poet.” He also added, in abit of doggerel justifying the first remark: “I am food for what I am good for –worms.” Like the note pinned to René Crevel’s chest, “Please cremate me.Disgust,” this ranks as a searing expression of profound self-contempt.Thomas Lovell Beddoes was born in 1803 in Clifton, Shropshire, and came from anillustrious and eccentric family. His mother was the sister of the novelistMaria Edgeworth and his father was the doctor Thomas Beddoes. Friend ofColeridge, Erasmus Darwin, and Humphry Davy, Beddoes senior was among the earlyself-experimenters with nitrous oxide, inhaling the ‘wild gas’ and discoveringits anaesthetic properties.35 He also had the strange habit of dissectinganimals with his son in attendance. This was in order to teach children“accurately to distinguish the parts of the body.” Beddoes senior’s pedagogicalzeal no doubt influenced his son’s later preoccupations, although he wouldn’t beaware of them; he died when Beddoes junior was only 5. Eccentric ideas were notunfamiliar to the maternal side of Beddoe’s family too. His maternal grandfatheris said to have tried to divert the course of the Rhône, and to have invented akind of carriage that supplied its own road, the so-called ‘walking barrel’.This eccentric strain appeared in Beddoes as his aforementioned inability tocomplete a work, and in a predilection for creating or finding himself inunenviable situations. After attending Bath grammar school he was sent toCharterhouse where he proved “wilful, perverse, independent and precocious,”36and where he occupied himself writing verse, Gothic tales, a novel in imitationof Fielding, and in inventing a slang language. A story told of this time givesus an idea of his character. Unhappy with the work a locksmith did on hisbookcase, when Beddoes next met the man he gave him an impromptu hair-raisingdramatic performance of his own death and descent into the pits of hell; thelocksmith, terrified, rushed out, and it took much persuasion to have him everreturn.Beddoes’ independent streak carried over to Pembroke College, Oxford, where heonce appeared at a tutorial with a large butcher knife to cut the pages of abook he hadn’t yet read. At Oxford he published The Improvisatore in his firstyear, a clearly immature work which was later suppressed. In 1822 The Bride’sTragedy – his only completed verse tragedy – which showed his affinity with theElizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, appeared and was something of a success.According to Lytton Strachey, “In a single bound, he had reached the thresholdof poetry, and was knocking at the door.”37 Unfortunately, Beddoes seemed tohave stopped knocking before the muse opened up. He tried to follow The Bride’sTragedy with other works, but his projects stalled, and he at one point proposedto continue writing under the pseudonym Theobald Vesseldoom.In 1824, called to Florence by the ill health of his mother (she died before hearrived), he met Walter Savage Landor and Mary Shelley, with whom he shared aninterest in corpses: Death’s Jest-Book is often called a kind of ‘Frankenstein’smonster,’ put together from bits and pieces.38 In 1825 he completed his degreeat Oxford and began work on what he called “a very Gothic styled tragedy,” yet,rather than pursue a literary career, he decided to study anatomy andphysiology. The ‘Gothic styled tragedy’, Death’s Jest-Book, was completed fouryears later. But Beddoes, insecure about his creativity and highly susceptibleto others’ opinions, agreed to revise it as friends suggested, and spent therest of his life doing so.After leaving Oxford he went to Göttiingen, the beginning of his long self-exilein German speaking lands. There he proved brilliant but unruly. In 1829 he wasexpelled from the university for being drunk in the street. It was also inGöttingen that he made his first suicide attempt. He had become obsessed withdiscovering the mythical ‘Bone of Luz’, a kind of osseous Philosopher’s Stone,spoken of in Talmudic lore, and which was supposed to hold the key toimmortality. Located in the coccyx, it was said to revive the dead. Pursued byFaustian furies, Beddoes was compelled to search for “every shadow of a proof orpossibility of an after existence, both in the material and immaterial nature ofman.” When his investigations into the seat of the soul proved futile, he triedto take his own life.39 His attempt failed, but he left Göttingen “penetratedwith the conviction of the absurdity and unsatisfactory nature of human life.”40He moved on to Würzberg to complete his degree, but was deported from Bavariathe next year for being a political agitator; he never received his diploma.Along with his interest in bodies and poetry (which Beddoes senior also wrote),and his knack for eccentricity, Beddoes junior had inherited his father’s tastefor radical politics: this, death and his unfinishable work would occupy himfrom now on. He studied German philosophy, became a member of the GermaniaBurschenshaft, a radical student political society, and wrote inflammatorypamphlets in his adopted language. Indeed, Beddoes took to German so well thathe remarked that English seemed a foreign tongue to him; linguistically, as inother ways, Beddoes became a “psychic alien … a man so essentially modern thathis wandering existence becomes an appropriate metaphor for the contemporaryhuman condition.”41 He settled in Zürich, where he was elected a professor ofcomparative anatomy, but the university authorities refused to recognize hiselection. His years in Zürich were relative happy, but antiliberal riots forcedhim to flee once again: he witnessed an army of six thousand peasants armed withpitch forks, scythes and knives depose the liberal government. His friend, oneof the liberal leaders, was killed, and Beddoes barely escaped himself. Fromthis point on, he had no fixed home and, like another seeker of immortality (andappreciator of death), the Renaissance alchemist and physician Paracelsus,42Beddoes drifted from place to place, a strange solitary figure, with longtangled hair and his ever present meerschaum pipe.During a ten month stay in London, Beddoes expressed his contempt at the stateof English theatre by attempting to burn down the Drury Lane playhouse with alit five pound note. Visiting Kelsall in Southampton, he locked himself in hisroom for days, smoking constantly, sinking into deep depressions. Visitingrelatives, he arrived at their country house astride a donkey. Understandably,friends and family began to think he had gone mad. He himself remarked in aletter that he had become “a non-conductor of friendship.” In 1847 he returnedto Frankfurt where he began a homosexual relationship with Konrad Degen, a bakernearly thirty years his junior. Beddoes’ affection for Degen was considerable:he once hired a theatre in Zürich for a night so that Degen, who we assume hadthespian aspirations, could play Hotspur, with Beddoes the sole audience. Afalling out with Degen led to Beddoes attempting suicide. At the Cigogne Hotel,he slashed his leg with his scalpel, one he may have used in dissection. When hefailed to bleed to death, he was taken to the hospital where, like Cato, he toreoff the bandages; he did this so often that eventually, as mentioned, his legdeveloped gangrene and had to be amputated. Beddoes told his family that he hadfallen from a horse and the real reason for his amputation and later death wasonly revealed sometime after he was dead.A reunion with Degen followed, and things seemed to be going better; they spokeof an Italian holiday, of literature and politics. Beddoes was able to walk andthere seemed little to suggest that he would make another stab at killinghimself. But during one walk, at a chemist’s Beddoes purchased the curare. Whenhis doctor was summoned to his bed on the evening of 26 January, he found thepoet-doctor insensible. He never regained consciousness and died that night.Among other things, his last note asked that a case of Moet Champagne – fiftybottles – be drunk in honour of his death, and that one of “Reade’s best stomachpumps” be purchased and given to his physician as a gift. Appropriately forBeddoes, when death came for him, it left a few jests in parting.OTTO WEININGEROn 26 March 1827 one of the undisputed geniuses of western civilization, Ludwigvon Beethoven, died in his room at Schwarzspanierstrasse 15 in Vienna.Seventy-six years later the address would become famous once again for anotherdeath. In the same room on 3 October 1903, shortly after the publication of hismagnum opus, Geschlecht und Charakter (Sex and Character), the twenty-three yearold Austrian philosopher Otto Weininger shot himself in the chest. He was foundthe next morning, fully clothed and covered in blood, and was taken to hospitalbut died soon after. Weininger had only recently returned from Italy, where hehad gone for a holiday, after completing the work for which, if at all, he isremembered today. That he banked a great deal on the book’s reception is evidentfrom a remark he made to a friend shortly after finishing it. “There are threepossibilities for me,” he declared. “The gallows, suicide, or a future sobrilliant that I don’t dare to think of it.” What actually happened can be seenas a self-fulfilled prophecy. Weininger had expected his work to excite criticalacclaim, and while it was cordially received, it failed to make the stir he hadhoped for. Disappointed in his masterpiece’s reception, and troubled by his owndepressions, Weininger, who considered himself a kind of ‘Redeemer’, decided toend his life where one of his greatest heroes had ended his, thus forging a linkbetween Beethoven’s genius and his own, genius in general and his own inparticular being one of Weininger’s central themes.Predictably, following his suicide, Sex and Character became a best-seller,ironically creating precisely the kind of heated debate and sensational noticeWeininger had wished for. This isn’t surprising, given that the book made somestartling assertions. Although Weininger begins with an idea that today, comingafter Jungian psychology, doesn’t seem that radical – that everyone is really amixture of both masculine and feminine psyches – from this point on he enterssome very turbulent waters.43 Notoriously, Weininger argued that women were aninferior species, immoral, soulless and uncreative, who were basicallyinterested only in sex and child-bearing. Men, on the other hand, were spiritualbeings who were responsible for practically all the virtues and achievements ofculture and civilization. While women are only concerned with sexual relations –they are, he said, ‘matchmakers’ by instinct – men have a mission to create andpromote works of genius. This, of course, is hampered by the cunning and deceitof women.44 Equally inflammatory were Weininger’s remarks about Jews, or moreprecisely, Jewishness, which he saw as a decadent strain in human nature, notlimited to one race, although in the Jews, Jewishness is understandably moreprominent than in other races. As a Jew himself who had converted toChristianity, Weininger provided anti-Semites with much metaphysical ammunition,and to Jews he seemed a virulent case of Jewish self-hate. Embedded in theseexplosive views were Weininger’s exhortations to pursue the difficult task ofbecoming a genius, which he believed was possible through an effort of will andwhich, we can assume, Weininger believed he had accomplished in producing hiswork.Not surprisingly, Weininger became a kind of a cultural hero among the manyaspiring young Viennese geniuses and his work became a cause célèbre; his deathtriggered a string of imitations, and achieved in reality what Goethe’s Wertheronly did in myth. Like many in this book, suicide was something Weininger hadcontemplated throughout his life, although his views on it, like much else inhis life, were often paradoxical. In a letter to a friend, Arthur Gerber,written in the time leading up to his death, Weininger wrote, “The man who failsin suicide? He is the complete criminal, because he wants life in order torevenge himself. All evil is revenge!” Yet in a series of brilliant aphorisms hewrote while contemplating killing himself, Weininger remarked that, “The suicideis almost always a sadist, because he alone wants to get out of a situation andcan act; a masochist must first question all eternity whether he may, should,take his own life.” (Like Man and Woman, Sadist and Masochist were for WeiningerPlatonic Ideals or characterological types.)45Of death itself Weininger wrote, “I cannot comprehend life so long as I amliving it … Only death can teach me the meaning of life,” an insight echoed adecade later by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. A great reader ofWeininger, in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Wittgenstein wrote, “Death isnot an event in life: we do not live to experience death … The sense of theworld must lie outside the world … The solution of the riddle of life in spaceand time lies outside space and time.”46Although Weininger is reviled today as an anti-Semite and misogynist,Wittgenstein, like August Strindberg, Edvard Munch, James Joyce, Ford MaddoxFord, and others recognized his importance. The poet William Carlos Williams wasso impressed by Weininger’s ideas that he decided to marry a woman he didn’tlove, because Weininger argued that sexual affinity, rather than love, formedthe true bond between Man and Woman. He also believed that he himself fell shortof Weininger’s criteria for genius, precisely because of his weakness for women.In The Female Eunuch, the feminist Germaine Greer offered an ageist and sexistbackhanded complement to Weininger, calling Sex and Character “a remarkablyrigorous and committed book by a mere boy.” Hitler, too, had a high opinion ofhim; speaking of Weininger, who he more than likely did not read, he is reportedto have said, “There was only one decent Jew, and he killed himself.”47Obviously, such remarks could not have helped Weininger’s reputation, and otherswere understandably less impressed. Elias Canetti refused to write anintroduction to a reprinting of Sex and Character on the grounds that it wasracist and sexist.Otto Weininger was born in Vienna on 3 April 1880 to a successful Jewishgoldsmith. Weininger’s father, Leopold, was a strict parent who, recognizingOtto’s precocity, encouraged it. At an early age he took Otto to concerts,introducing him to the work of Mozart, Weber and, above all, Wagner; in laterlife, Wagner would become Weininger’s favourite composer. He promoted Otto’sfacility with languages, and by the time he was eighteen, Otto had an excellentcommand of Latin, Greek, French, English, Italian, Spanish and Norwegian, not tomention his native German. He was also early on addicted to books, so much sothat his father remarked, “There was one thing Otto would never share withanyone – his books. He lived in complete isolation with them.”48This youthful evidence of genius had the usual effect: Otto had little time forgames and rarely played with other children. His father’s strict character hadan equally powerful effect, and most accounts suggest that the rigid andhyper-serious Otto inherited his inflexible demeanour from his father. Of Otto’smother we know very little, other than that Otto never mentioned her in hisletters, that she was good at languages and that she, like the rest of thefamily, suffered under Leopold’s dominance, enduring his criticisms and demandswhile suffering from tuberculosis. If Weininger’s later musings on the Sadistand the Masochist have a basis in his history, its safe to say his parentsprovided the models.Weininger’s brilliance was evident in school, but, as with Thomas LovellBeddoes, so was his unruliness. He often disrupted class work and followed hisown inclinations, rather than that of his teachers, rejecting assignments andworking on his own. This predilection for his own path was clear outside schoolas well. Otto’s friends remarked that he never read a newspaper and that“happiness was not part of his nature.” Young Otto had a haughty, sensitivepersonality and, like Heinrich von Kleist, would react violently if he felt hisdignity was at stake. He was dedicated to ideas though, and liked nothing morethan to stay up all night discussing them. As a friend recalled, “Abstractregions, from which others would turn away with a cold shiver, were his realhome.”In 1898 Weininger graduated from secondary school and, after an argument withhis father, who wanted him to put his multilingual abilities to practical use byentering the Consular Academy, registered at the University of Vienna. Here hestudied philosophy, psychology, natural sciences and medicine, and again likeKleist, seems to have thrown himself into a massive self-improvement programmeaimed at solving the big riddles of human existence. This resulted in histhesis, “Eros and the Psyche,” an early version of his major work. In 1901,looking for a publisher for it, he approached Freud. Although Freud laterrecalled Weininger as a “slender, grown-up youth with grave features and aveiled, quite beautiful look in his eyes,” and that he “could not help feelingthat I stood in front of a personality with a touch of genius,” he declined tosuggest Weininger’s work to his own publisher. He advised the young genius,whose work was much more metaphysical than scientific, to spend the next tenyears gathering empirical evidence. “People want facts, not thoughts,” Freudsaid. Weininger replied that he’d rather write ten different books in that time.Freud also pointed out that he himself was working on a similar theme –suggesting a possible proprietary interest in publishing first – and passed onsome of his own thoughts on bisexuality. One result of this was that when Sexand Character appeared, Freud’s friend and collaborator William Fliess sued himfor giving his ideas about bisexuality to Weininger, and Weininger himself wasaccused of plagiarism.When Weininger received his Ph.D, his first act was to renounce the faith of hisfathers and convert to Protestantism. Although a not uncommon career move formany assimilated Viennese Jews – one famous convert being the composer GustavMahler – Weininger had more philosophical reasons. Judaism, for him, exemplifiedthe “extreme of cowardice;” the Jewish faith, he argued, was feminine, soulless,and lacked a sense of good and evil, something, he believed that could not besaid of Christianity. Christ himself became something of an ideal, and Weiningerincreasingly adopted an ascetic lifestyle, specifically focusing on inhibitinghis sexual urges.Weininger’s own sexual life remains something of a mystery. Some have suggestedthat his appearance precluded anyone falling in love with him. His fatherremarked that Otto didn’t have sex until his twenties, but there’s littleevidence for this. There’s practically nothing about his relations with women inaccounts by friends, aside from a single meeting with a “Miss Meyer,” whom, hissister reported, after an hour with Weininger said, “I have been with JesusChrist.”49 Nietzsche remarked that ascetics adopt their stringent disciplinesbecause of powerful sensual appetites; given the vehemence of Weininger’sremarks about women, and his powerful creative drive, one suspects he wasprofoundly attracted to them, but his dedication to his ideal demandedabstinence. There is also reason to suspect an element of homosexuality inWeininger, and that, like his Jewishness, his effeminate traits were somethinghe had to fight against. There was also a possible masochistic strain in this;as his biographer says, “He seemed to enjoy using the ugliest self-hatred todestroy his own life through ascetic practices.”50 Nietzsche again: asceticismaimed at destroying sensuality often becomes a source of it. Weininger seemed tocombine both the Sadist and Masochist in himself.By this time, Weininger had undergone a kind of psychic shift; he seemed to takethe exact opposite of the course suggested by Freud, and abandoned empiricismentirely and embraced a kind of universal symbolism. “The scientist,” hebelieved, “takes phenomena for what they are; the great men of genius for whatthey signify” – a remark that could have been made by Swedenborg, Goethe orBlake. Plato, Plotinus, Augustine, Kant, Wagner and Beethoven were his pantheon,and introspection became a central methodology; at twenty Weininger lectured ata Conference on Psychology in Paris on its importance. He became his ownsubject: he would look at his image in the mirror when he felt inspired, to seeif the state made any change in his appearance. This increasing inward turn,combined with his inordinately high standards and iron discipline began to takeits toll. He began to feel criminal urges, along with his sexual ones, and tohave hallucinations – or, as he believed, to recognize the significance ofotherwise banal incidents. Talking to his friend Gerber about suicide, Weiningertold him about the link between a dog barking and death. Sitting in theMünchener Gasthoff, Weininger “suddenly heard a dog bark in a very peculiar,penetrating way which was then quite new to me, and at the same moment I had theinevitable conviction that someone was dying at that very moment.” The use ofthe word ‘inevitable’ prompts wonder. Months later, “in the most terrible nightof my life … I literally had to fight against death … Just as I was fallingasleep, I heard a dog bark three times in just the same way as that time inMunich.”51As the dog began to symbolize death for Weininger, the horse did the same forinsanity. “With the surety of a guiding thought,” he wrote, “I had the feelingthat the horse represents insanity.”52 Death and insanity began to preoccupyhim. “The danger of insanity,” he confided in his friend, “is always present inthose who try to penetrate the discipline of logic and pure knowledge,”something that Weininger had clearly engaged in. One sign of his mental strainwas the appearance of his Doppelgänger, or double, which he began to see veryoften; as the legend of the Doppelgänger goes, if you see him, you are nearingdeath. He asked his friend Gerber, “Have you ever thought of your own double?What if he came now? Your double is the man who knows everything about you, eventhat which nobody tells.”53 What nobody was telling, but what his friends couldhave little doubt about, was that the stress of pursuing genius, battling hislower urges and confronting an oblivious world was becoming too much forWeininger.In a strange document entitled “Condemnation,” written in November 1902, about ayear before his suicide, Weininger likened his interior world to a house. Ofwhat was going on inside it Weininger wrote: “A wild desperate activity, a slowterrifying realization in the dark, an eternal clearing out of things. Do notask how it looks inside the house.” Shortly after this he made a kind of formalfarewell to his family.Weininger seems to have had insight into the roots of his radical views. “Thehatred of woman,” he wrote in Aphorisms, “is always only the not yet overcomehatred of one’s own sexuality.” And if, as he believed, “All genius is aconquering of chaos and mystery,” it was sadly also becoming clear that, “Thegenius which runs to madness is no longer genius.” In a perceptive essay onWeininger, one writer summed it up: “It may be that his passionate pursuit oftruth led him to envisage a standard of maleness which he felt he could notsustain, and that this was what led to his suicide.”54 It’s reported that apartial lunar eclipse took place during his funeral: a fitting emblem, one thatWeininger himself would no doubt have sought the meaning of.ARTHUR KOESTLERIn 1999 female students at the University of Edinburgh, along with members ofthe Scottish Women’s Aid Centre, as well as some politically correct males,succeeded in removing a bust from the psychology department that had residedthere for years without causing the slightest controversy. Most likely the manystudents who passed the likeness of the Hungarian-born English novelist,essayist, and journalist, whose estate at the time of his death in 1983,estimated at just short of a million pounds, had been bequeathed to theuniversity, didn’t even notice it. Or if they did, they saw it as only one moremonument to one more dead white European male, a breed whose collective cachethad depreciated considerably throughout the 80s and 90s.But the recent newspaper serialization of sections of a new biography of thisparticular dead white male had caused a stir – not surprisingly, as the excerptspublished dealt with the scandalous and, if the assertions they made werecorrect, criminal sex-life of a highly respected literary and political figure.Sex scandals are commonplace in the British press, but rarely do they result ina university changing its décor. These scandals, however, centred around acharge of ‘date rape’, then, as now, an incendiary if ambiguous subject. And ifthe ‘series’ of such assaults on women the biographer placed at his subject’sdoor were substantiated by little more than his assertions – meaning he providedlittle, if any, corroboration for them – this was a negligible detail. Then, asnow, the mere accusation was enough for the self-righteous to demand immediateaction, especially as the female students involved complained that they felt‘uneasy’ beneath the bust’s salacious stare. The university felt compelled totake steps, and to this day the bust rests in some undisclosed spot, where it issafe from attack and, perhaps more to the point, where its unseemly gaze canharm no one. The financial contribution associated with it suffered no suchindignation.The bust in question is that of the polymath Arthur Koestler, most famous forhis anti-Stalin political thriller Darkness at Noon, but also the author of anumber of books in an embarrassingly wide spectrum of subjects, ranging fromcreativity, biology and behavioural psychology to capital punishment, ESP andthe history of the Jews. The biography is David Cesarani’s massive tome ofacademic gossip, Arthur Koestler: The Homeless Mind (1998), described as both“richly documented,” and an “erratic” work of “moral prating”. The ‘date rape’in question is that of the filmmaker Jill Craigie, wife of the later Labourleader Michael Foot, and allegedly took place in 1951. Craigie did not make itpublic until forty years later.Cesarani claims that Koestler raped other women as well, but it’s thecircumstances surrounding Koestler’s suicide in 1983 that possibly places him inthe same category as Harry Crosby and Jacques Vaché. On the morning of 3 March1983, a housekeeper employed by Koestler and his wife Cynthia arrived at theirhouse at 8 Montpelier Square in Kensington and found a note pinned to the door.“Please do not go upstairs,” it read, “Ring the police and tell them to come tothe house.” Amelia, the housekeeper, telephoned friends of the Koestlersinstead, who then rang the police. When Inspector David Thomas and a colleaguefinally entered the house they found Koestler in the sitting room, dead, uprightin an armchair, a glass of brandy in his hand. Cynthia was lying on a sofa,facing Arthur, a whisky beside her on a coffee table. She was dead too. Also onthe table were two wine glasses, both with a powdery residue, and a jar ofhoney, used to sweeten the drug they had taken. The powder was the remains ofthe Tuinal they had dissolved, a powerful barbiturate. An examination suggestedthey had been dead for thirty-six hours, which means they must have taken thedrug on the evening of the 1st.At the time of his death, Koestler had been suffering from Parkinson’s diseaseand leukaemia for years, although he had kept this a secret for a long time,and, as his friend and fellow parapsychology investigator Brian Inglis remarked,he was “falling apart.” Others, like the writer Julian Barnes, who became afriend and chess-mate late in Koestler’s life, were also struck by hiscondition. His hands shook, he had difficulty concentrating, could barely walk,his eyesight was failing, and a recent swelling in his groin suggested thecancer was spreading.Koestler was a very vocal advocate of euthanasia; he was vice president of theEuthanasia Society (now EXIT) and had even written a ‘how-to’ pamphlet onkilling yourself. That he would take his own life rather than allow himself todeteriorate further seems understandable. Indeed, his editor and literaryexecutor Harold Harris, who saw Koestler for the last time a week before hissuicide, knew, as most of his friends did, that he would not “quietly submit tothe final removal of his physical and mental faculties.” Harris was evenconcerned that Koestler “might have left it too late.”55 “He was unable tostand, his speech was disjointed, and he clearly found it difficult toconcentrate on what was being said to him.” What caused an uproar and remainstoday a controversial subject is the fact that Koestler’s wife, Cynthia Jeffries– his third – decided to join him. Unlike Koestler, Cynthia was in good health,and at 55 wasn’t yet facing the ravages of old age which Koestler, at 77, hadbegun to confront years earlier.Although up until her death friends believed she gave no indication of wantingto kill herself, when the facts emerged practically everyone agreed that it madesense that she had. By all accounts, including her own, Cynthia was absolutelydevoted to Arthur – pathologically so, according to some observers. She had beenin love with Koestler since they first met in Paris in 1949, when he hired heras a secretary, and she had worked for him on and off until they married in1965, when she was thirty-eight, and he was fifty-five. George Mikes, a fellowHungarian and close friend of the two said, “No one knows or will ever know whatexactly happened between Arthur and Cynthia. No one knows how and when Cynthiadecided to die with him. But everyone who knew them well can see the logic,almost the inevitability of her decision.”56 Harold Harris, who edited theunfinished joint autobiography of Koestler and Cynthia, published posthumouslyas Stranger on the Square, wrote that, “It is hardly an exaggeration to say thathis life became hers, that she lived his life. And when the time came for him toleave it, her life too was at an end.”57Yet not everyone was happy with this assessment, especially not David Cesarani.Cesarani’s motive in writing his book was initially to explore the question ofKoestler’s Jewish roots – roots Cesarani, a professor of modern Jewish history,believed Koestler had vigorously and egregiously rejected. Cesarani gainedaccess to the Koestler papers at Edinburgh on the strict condition that he wasnot writing a biography, a condition he agreed to and which the universitybelieved he would honour. The task of writing Koestler’s biography was alreadygiven to Michael Scammell, whose authorized work is scheduled for publication in2007, although it has already missed a few deadlines. Cesarani’s subsequentbook, which, using Koestler’s jettisoning of his Jewishness as a peg, hangs onit a plethora of personal faults and flaws, has itself caused a literary storm.Scammell, Barnes and the novelist Frederick Raphael have accused Cesarani oflying, of selecting his facts to suit his argument, of making unsubstantiatedclaims, and of engaging in a malicious exercise in character assassination. ThatCesarani depicts in tabloid detail the many sexual escapades Koestler engaged in– it was common knowledge even before Cesarani’s ‘expose’ that Koestler was anobsessive and aggressive womaniser – as well as incidences of violence, suggeststhat something more than academic interest fuelled his study. His mostcontroversial assertion, however, is that, after a relationship and marriagebuilt on domination and submission, Koestler bullied Cynthia into taking herlife with him, in a form of ‘suttee’. “It is this negation of another humanbeing,” Cesarani writes, “that casts a pall over the life, work and reputationof Arthur Koestler.”58That life, work and reputation were considerable. Koestler had the kind of lifemost writers only write about. And, as is borne out by the titles of many of hisbooks – Arrival and Departure, The Yogi and the Commissar, The Lotus and theRobot, and perhaps most succinctly in one of his last works, Janus: A SummingUp, Janus being the two-faced Roman god – it was characterized by the tensionborn of two opposing forces. In Koestler’s case, it was a clear, rigorous andsupremely logical mind, linked to a fiery, impulsive and often violent emotionallife.Born in Budapest in 1905 to a prosperous father who had success with inventionslike ‘radioactive soap’ and an envelope-opening machine, and a mother whovisited Freud because of her persistent violent headaches, Koestler went on tohave a life that exemplified “a typical case-history of a Central Europeanmember of the educated middle classes, born in the first years of ourcentury.”59 Koestler could be seen as a kind of ideological impulse-buyer, wereit not for the incisive intellect he brought to each of his infatuations. In aseries of sudden shifts, starting with burning his matriculation book andabandoning university before receiving his degree, which he described as a“sudden enamouredness with un-reason itself,”60 and which would reappearconsistently throughout his life, Koestler embraced and rejected Zionism,Communism, Marxism, politics, scientific materialism, and Darwinism. In his lastyears he engaged in an eloquent if highly criticized exploration of thepossibilities of parapsychology and its links to quantum physics, which includedhaving a weighing machine installed at Montpelier Square, so he could test thepossibility of levitation.Although in books like The Lotus and the Robot, a study of Indian philosophy andZen, he is critical of mysticism, and although he was one of the first toexperiment with and reject psychedelic drugs – calling their effect “confidencetricks played on one’s own nervous system”61 – Koestler himself claimed that “itwas always the ‘oceanic’ type of experience that dictated the really importantdecisions of my life, and determined its abrupt zigzag course.”62 One incidenceof the ‘oceanic’ came to him while he sat in a Franco prison, during the SpanishCivil War, waiting to be executed. Whiling away the time by working out themathematical proof that there is no ultimate prime number, Koestler experienceda “wordless essence, a fragrance of eternity, a quiver of the arrow in theblue.” This serene detachment was interrupted by a vague nagging thought, whichhe recalled was the realization that he might be shot, and to which he replied,“So what? Have you nothing serious to worry about?”It was experiences like these that led Koestler, at the height of his fame andinfluence in the 1950s as a passionate anti-Communist, to startle his critics byabandoning politics and plunging into detailed examinations of the flaws inDarwinian theory, the dangers of behavioural psychology and the roots of humancreativity in a series of brilliant books like The Sleepwalkers, The Act ofCreation and The Ghost in the Machine, now classics of anti-reductionistthought. By the time of his death, Koestler was a best-selling author, arespected journalist, had received numerous honours, organized dozens ofsymposia (so many that his last novel, The Call Girls, satirized the conferencelife) had hobnobbed with intellectual celebrities like Bertrand Russell, and wascourted by Margaret Thatcher.Yet alongside his cultural achievements, Koestler had acquired a reputation as ahard-drinking, bullying male chauvinist, a dark side that Cesarani had no qualmsabout revealing, although, as many reviewers of his book pointed out, many ofhis revelations had been made in previous books about Koestler. Koestler’smarriages, to Dorothy Ascher, Mamaine Paget, and Cynthia, were characterized byhis domineering personality, forced abortions, and appalling behaviour, mostlycentred around his wives’ need to accept his philandering, as well as his heavydrinking and general abusive treatment. Most bullies suffer from an inferioritycomplex and Koestler, incorrigibly competitive, would not be outdone: he oncesaid that his inferiority complex was “as big as a cathedral.”His friend George Mikes broke off relations with Koestler when he tried to bullyhim into drinking more during their get-togethers. Koestler had a habit ofsmashing up his cars, and on one occasion, arrested for drink-driving in Paris,he took a swing at a policeman; something similar happened in the 1970s inLondon as well. During the Hungarian uprising in 1956, Koestler threw bricksthrough the window of the Hungarian legation. He was also prone to depressionand attempting suicide and prior to his death, made several botched attempts.Once, on hearing that Walter Benjamin, who he had met in Marseilles, had killedhimself, he swallowed the morphine Benjamin had given him, but his stomachrefused it and he only vomited. An early attempt to gas himself, triggered bythe Party’s rejection of an early novel, failed when a book fell off a shelf andhit him on the head, leading him to change his mind. On another occasion inanother Spanish jail he again tried to poison himself, but his body againrejected it. He even wrote a book about a suicide. In The Case of The Mid-WifeToad Koestler investigates the tragic story of the Viennese Paul Kammerer, abrilliant biologist and believer in the Lamarckian theory of acquiredcharacteristics, who killed himself in 1926 when it was discovered that some ofthe test results supporting his work had been faked. Kammerer himself was notresponsible for the forgery but his reputation was ruined and in despair he blewhis brains out.Cynthia, too, an attractive South African girl – shy, awkward and painfullyself-conscious – was no stranger to suicide. Her father killed himself when shewas thirteen and she herself considered it years later when she had been workingfor Koestler for some time. The two had become intimate, and she believed he wastrying to get rid of her. “I knew he did not want me to be his ‘slavey’ for everand that he thought I should find a husband and lead a life of my own. […] I wasconfronted by my empty self from whom there was no escape even for an instant.At last I found a solution to this intolerable existence. […] I would killmyself.”63 She thought of slipping into Kensington Gardens at night and takingan overdose of sleeping pills. She was pulled out of this despair by gettinginvolved with another man. But the affair didn’t last long and she was soonsending Koestler postcards, hoping he had lots of work for her.That Cynthia was something of a cipher, and that she willingly gave herself overto Koestler, becomes clear from reading her sections of Stranger in the Square.That he took professional advantage of her devotion to him is also clear.Speaking of their first meeting, Koestler wrote, “More important, from aprofessional point of view, was a quality in her of unobtrusiveness, almost ofself-effacement …”64 Whether this is acceptable or not is debatable, but mostwriters as busy as Koestler would have been happy with the catch.For Cynthia, working for Koestler was a dream come true. “It had long been myambition to work for a writer. As a child I was happiest when reading and myfavourite people were the imaginary heroes of books rather than those livingaround me.” She had even fantasized about being like Arlova, the doomedRubashov’s secretary in Darkness at Noon. “I decided that she was the kind ofsecretary Arthur wanted. She never spoke, she never reacted in a distractingway.” She even wished she could wear “an embroidered Russian blouse likehers.”65 When Koestler had sent her away for a time she was inconsolable. “I waslonging for the past – for the days when I had worked for him and for thethrilling moments when we happened to be alone. I could not face the fact thatlife would never be the same again.” That this devotion carried over into theiremotional life and marriage, and that Koestler often, but not always, abused it– he did have a generous, affectionate side – is also difficult to ignore in theaccounts of their life, both by Cesarani and by people sympathetic to Koestler.But that he purposely browbeat her into killing herself, when by all accounts hecould barely do the job himself, is a different question. In his pamphlet forthe Euthanasia Society, Koestler spells out the many reasons why one shouldn’tcommit suicide. One of these is the loss of a loved one. Koestler makes clearthat it’s possible to survive this, providing one had strong outside interests.Yet it doesn’t take much to see that Cynthia lacked these, even though, in hersuicide note, she wrote, “I cannot live without Arthur, despite certain innerresources.” The fact that she says this has led many, not only Cesarani, tobelieve that Koestler’s grip on her lasted until she drank the honeyed Tuinal.Yet it was a grip she willingly endured, and even went out of her way to submitto.The scenario of their last days raises some questions. If she didn’t really wantto join him, wouldn’t it have been easy to fake taking the drug, especially inthe company of a man dying in bits and pieces anyway? Cesarani indicts Koestlerof not ensuring that she wouldn’t kill herself after his death, and of nottaking his own life in some way without her being present. “It is an indictmentof Koestler,” he writes, “that he lived with a woman who was a vacuum.”66 But ifthe “vacuum” loved him for some thirty-four years, was she really a vacuum? Yeteven Cesarani doesn’t see her as such. “She was woman of intelligence andhumour, who saw through Koestler and knew exactly what she was doing with herown life.”67 This doesn’t sound like a “vacuum.” Friends who knew them said thatin his last years, Koestler was in Cynthia’s thrall, and was helpless withouther. Perhaps Koestler did try to talk her out of it, and failed? Barely able towalk or to speak, how could he have stopped her?As George Mikes said, no one will ever know what exactly happened between them,but when Michael Scammell’s biography appears, things may possibly becomeclearer. That his wife felt compelled to join him in death is surely tragic, yetit’s possible that Koestler’s bust, languishing in a closet in Scotland, may yetagain see the light of day.THOMAS CHATTERTONEven before Werther, the teenaged Thomas Chatterton was the original tragicRomantic genius. “The marvellous boy,” as Wordsworth called him, abandonedpoetry at an even younger age than Rimbaud, and in a more dramatic manner,committing suicide at seventeen, defeated in his battle against an uncaring,philistine London, which he had hoped to conquer after leaving his provincial,mercantile Bristol.68 Ignored or rejected by those who should have recognisedhis gift – Horace Walpole in particular became the villain of this piece –Chatterton was left to starve in the archetypal garret, too proud to beg or evento accept help when it was offered. He struggled valiantly and defiantly,writing his poems, articles, and stories, sending them to editors, only for themto become lost in the wash of hackwork flooding Grub Street, or worse, printedwithout payment. Finally, his fate became unbearable and he decided to end itall, tearing his last poetry to bits in his death throes, succumbing to thearsenic he took that dreadful night of 23 August 1770 in Brooke Street, Holborn.Unknown and practically unmourned when he died – he was buried in a pauper’sgrave – Chatterton soon became the symbol of the rising Romantic new guard, andan early death the trademark of that generation. Keats, who would himself dieyoung, would dedicate his Endymion to Chatterton. Rossetti would later dedicatesonnets to his memory. Coleridge wrote a monody on his death, Blake spoke of himwith praise, and Henry Wallis’ painting of his corpse – with George Meredith asmodel – flame-haired and fallen in his attic room, still prompts sighs and mutedappreciation from viewers at Tate Britain. Across the channel, Alfred de Vigny’sChatterton was a success and, to its author’s chagrin, triggered a spate ofimitation suicides, causing Théophile Gautier to remark that in those daysacross Paris “you could hear the crack of solitary pistols in the night,”69 asstarving poets agreed that killing oneself was “still the best way to proveone’s genius.”70 Vigny’s play was so successful in fact, that the Frenchgovernment held a debate to argue the best way to halt its deplorable effect. Togive Vigny credit, he was appalled at the suicide craze and pointed out that hehad written the play in order to plead the cause of young writers, not toencourage them to kill themselves.As in the case of Goethe’s Werther, the dual themes of youth and neglectedgenius struck a chord in the public’s sentiments. There were Chattertonhandkerchiefs and Chatterton engravings. Odes were written in his honour,concerts given, and even a Gothic ruin erected in his name. A decade after hisdeath, a best-seller by Herbert Croft, Love and Madness (a title reminiscent ofa Woody Allen film), combined a recent crime passionel with Chatterton’s storyand more than anything else secured his place in the public consciousness as adoomed angel, a songbird too sensitive for this rough clime.71 A year earlier,an English translation of Goethe’s Werther included a note explaining to itsreaders that Werther’s feelings, “like that of our Chatterton, were too intenseto support the load of accumulated distress; and like him his diapason ended indeath.” Although the Chatterton craze ended with WWI, a trickle of it carried oninto the new age, with works by Vita Sackville-West and a German writer, ErnstPenzoldt, carrying on the myth.Chatterton’s ghost has even played a saving hand in the lives of other poets,dissuading at least two of them from following in his tragic footsteps. Duringthe fin-de-siècle, the wretched Francis Thompson – penniless, starving, drugaddled and sleeping rough beneath the Covent Garden arches – having spent hislast pence on a fatal dose of laudanum, was stopped from killing himself byChatterton’s spirit. Having swallowed half the dose, Thompson was about to downthe rest when he felt a hand on his wrist. It was Chatterton, staying him,providentially, as the very next day, Thompson received news that the editorWilfred Meynell had published one of his poems and wanted to contact him. Theresult was that Thompson spent his last years under Meynell’s care, writing thepoetry he is known for today.Chatterton’s biographer, the eccentric E.H.W. Meyerstein, a figure asfantastical as his subject, was plagued by depressions and thoughts of suicidethroughout his life and, like Chatterton, was fated to be denied recognition inhis lifetime; even today, although the author of many novels and books ofpoetry, he is known solely through his massive account of his hero’s short life,and this by only a few. Meyerstein, though, deserves to be better known, and notonly for his eccentricities, although these do spark curiosity – among others hewas said to wave his false teeth to make a point, and he had an obsession withcrime scenes, and would walk for miles to view one. Meyerstein’s dedication toChatterton brought him to live for a time beneath the poet’s beloved Saint MaryRedcliffe in Bristol, where, aside from his last four months in London, he spentall of his brief life. And in a small room in Holborn, similar to the one inwhich Chatterton gave up his ghost, Meyerstein too faced the demon ofself-destruction. Although in his journal he had written, “There is one ethicalcommand: YOU MUST NOT KILL YOURSELF. However unbearable your environment is youmust not do that,”72 the loneliness, doubt and stung pride that afflictedChatterton visited him too. But the ghost of Chatterton appeared again and, aswith Francis Thompson, moved Meyerstein to take heart and endure. Meyerstein wasso affected he wrote a poem, “Chatterton in Holborn: A Vision.”Not many yards from this your lonely bedA lonelier than you broke life’s locked door,And when the shades of fatal night were fledThey found his papers piecemeal on the floor,The limbs and face distorted of the dead,Who had no sense of what his days were for,But now remembers and bids you live on,Your guardian angel Thomas Chatterton.Ironically it was Meyerstein’s A Life of Thomas Chatterton, published well pastthe prime of Chatterton’s posthumous fame, that dissolved the romantic mythsabout him and made him a more human and more interesting figure, making clearhis less than attractive sides, his spite, his quarrelsomeness, and hisambitions.Thomas Chatterton was born in Bristol on 20 November 1752. It was not apropitious start. According to his horoscope, provided by Meyerstein, he hadMercury in the sixth house, which presented “an infallible argument of awretched life and fatal end.”73 Whether Meyerstein worked back from the knownfacts to arrive at this assessment is unclear, but Chatterton’s life wascertainly not happy. His father had died two months before Chatterton was born,and what we know of him suggests an interesting character. He was aschool-master by trade but a musician by inclination who, among other works,composed an anthem for his own funeral; he was also a dabbler in the occult withan interest in the past, and, apparently, a drinker.Chatterton’s mother, twenty and with an older daughter born out of wedlock, wasleft penniless and was forced to set up house with her mother-in-law. Shebrought in money from starting a sewing school. Chatterton’s family had held theoffice of sexton in Saint Mary Redcliffe, a parish church, for nearly twocenturies – the position was then held by Thomas’ uncle, Richard Philips – andthe church, with its atmosphere of mystery and times long gone, was the singlemost important influence on the boy. Although he was deemed backward at first,Mary, Chatterton’s sister, taught him to read. He scorned modern books but wasfascinated by ancient texts, their illuminated capitals attracting him like sometalisman. He learned to read from a Black Letter Bible, and roamed the churchgrounds, becoming familiar with the inscriptions on the tombs, spelling his waythrough these traces of a lost world.Around this time we find an early appearance of what was probably Chatterton’scentral character trait. When his sister asked him what he would like painted onhis bowl, he replied, “Paint me an angel with wings, and a trumpet to trumpet myname over the world.” Early on fame and all that comes with it was his goal. Yetyears later he would lament, “It is my pride, my damned native, unconquerablepride that plunges me into distraction.”74 “Proud as Lucifer” was how a cousinhe lived with in Shoreditch, before his last days in Holborn, described him,when he chastised her for calling him “Tommy.”75 “When was a poet ever namedTommy?” he asked. Not being very knowledgeable about poets, his cousin said shedidn’t know.Once he had mastered it, reading became his life’s blood; Chatterton devouredbooks whole, gorging on metaphysics, mathematics and works on antiquities. Hehaunted bookshops and was a regular at the circulating libraries – and this, wemust remember, as a boy. He was also prone to trance states, or at least deepabstraction, and he would sit for hours, contemplating some inner world. Hewould also cry for no apparent reason. He seldom played with other children, andhis sole amusement seemed to come from the old parchments his father had takenfrom the muniment room of the church. His father had used these to cover books,and his mother used them in her sewing, but Chatterton saved them from thisabuse and secreted them away in a lumber room in the attic. Here he also broughtpaper, inks, and charcoal. His mother wondered what he did there, locked awayfor hours. Soon enough, the world would know.At eight Chatterton was sent to Colston’s Hospital, a charity school. Here thebasics in reading, writing and arithmetic were taught. While these did little tosatisfy Chatterton’s appetite for learning, the school’s dress code had a deepereffect. The students wore medieval dress: a bluecoat, long surcoat, yellowstockings, and their hair was cut in a kind of tonsure. The curriculum depressedhim but his sister noted that he seemed happier once he had begun to writepoetry. At 10, his first poem was published in a Bristol paper. Soon after hehad also completed a “Hymn for Christmas Day.”His father’s talent for composition seemed to be resurfacing, but Chatterton putit to a peculiar use. He had spent the hours locked away in his lumber room withthe ancient parchments performing a kind of resurrection – or, to put it lessromantically, he brought his love of the past and his knack for poetry togetherand invented an idealized Medieval Bristol poet-priest, one Thomas Rowley,producing a series of poems which he claimed to have discovered among thechurch’s ancient texts. An audacious act for a boy not yet in his teens, but itwas successful, and the authenticity of the ‘Rowley poems’ became a matter ofdebate for decades.It was in fact an age of forgeries and frauds. The Scot James Macpherson hadgained fame as the true author of the Ossian poems, seminal Romantic works bythe ‘Celtic Homer’ that were translated by Goethe and formed the favouritereading of Napoleon. Palamazaar, a Frenchman who posed as a native of Formosa,wrote a book in Latin about his life; when his ploy was discovered, no onethought the less of him, the formidable Dr. Johnson remarking, “I should as soonthink of contradicting a bishop.” And Horace Walpole, who played a major part inChatterton’s fortunes, originally published his Castle of Otranto as a work“translated by William Marshall, Gent., from the original Italian of OnuphrioMuralto.” Chatterton may only have been trying to hit the popular note.Chatterton presented his forgeries to some local antiquarians, who weredelighted with his discoveries and, more importantly, asked no embarrassingquestions about them and wondered if there were more. He obliged and for a timehis hunger for achievement and distinction was satisfied. But not for long. At14 he left Colston’s and was indentured to John Lambert, a Bristol attorney.Although the work was light – simple copying – and Chatterton was lucky to getit, he hated the routine and disliked having to eat with the servants. Hisattempts at poetry suffered as well; a servant found him writing poems andunceremoniously tore them up and threw them in the fire. As the years passed hismisery increased until he spoke openly of suicide; when a letter he wrote to afriend saying that he planned to kill himself was discovered, his employer askedone of the antiquarians to speak with him – the last thing Lambert needed was asuicidal teenager on his hands.Chatterton, who by this time was writing political satires for London papers,quickly realized the true power of the word. He realized that he had no futurein Bristol, and his attempts to gain recognition by writing to well knownfigures, like Horace Walpole, were failures. Walpole questioned the authenticityof the Rowley poems, but more importantly was miffed at the idea of a teenageindentured servant speaking to him as an equal and said as much, forever aftercasting himself as the man who could have ‘saved’ Chatterton, but didn’t.Chatterton knew he had to get to London and so wrote an even more desperatesuicide note and left it in plain view. Lambert took one look at it and waseager to wash his hands of the boy. Chatterton soon left for London, armed withfive pounds, his notebook, the address of his cousin in Shoreditch, and histitanic pride.Yet, in a brilliant essay, Richard Holmes argues that Chatterton didn’t commitsuicide, but that his death was from an accidental overdose of arsenic, taken asa curative for syphilis, a common, if dangerous treatment at the time, a notionthat Peter Ackroyd employs in his novel Chatterton.76 Holmes points out thattraces of opium were found on Chatterton’s teeth when his body was discovered,and that he had more than likely been a user for some time, both his lastletters and works like the weird, near hallucinogenic “African Eclogues”suggesting a state of consciousness associated with the drug. One ofChatterton’s friends in Brooke Street was a Mr. Cross, a chemist, and he morethan likely supplied Chatterton with the narcotic. Opium was used widely as acure-all until the late nineteenth century and it was often cheaper thanalcohol. Chatterton was also living on his own for the first time in the fewweeks leading up to his death. In Shoreditch he shared a room, a bed even, andhad relatives around him. But on Brooke Street he was alone.Poverty, hunger, pride and that strange sensibility which would soon be calledRomantic would lead him to reject the brutal world around him – Brooke Streetwas known for its prostitutes and cut-throats – and to seek comfort in somerealm closer to his heart’s desire, a realm accessed by himself and many otherssince through drugs. His friend the chemist Cross also told the scholar MichaelLort, who began to investigate the Chatterton story in the 1770s, thatChatterton “had the foul disease which he would cure himself.” The ‘fouldisease’ was syphilis and that Chatterton would ‘cure himself’ is in character;he had pretensions to medical knowledge and at one point in his last days wroteDr. Barrett – one of the antiquarians to whom he delivered the Rowley poems – tohelp him get work as a surgeon on a ship bound for Africa: a mad dream, perhaps,occasioned by the poppy? The usual cure for syphilis involved calomel andvitriol, but a quicker, if more dangerous method employed arsenic in smalldoses.Arsenic for the disease and opium to kill the pain. Alcohol more than likely aswell. For anyone a dubious brew, but for Chatterton, according to Holmes, adeadly one. Drunk, stoned, impatient and unsure of his dose, Chatterton’s deathmay have been the result of a tragic miscalculation, rather than that ofneglected genius. He left no suicide note, other than the phoney one which freedhim from Bristol four months earlier. And from the tone of his writings inLondon, which jettisoned the pre-Morris medievalism for the barbed satire ofpolitical taunt, and the barbaric splendour of the “African Eclogues,” onedoesn’t get the sense that Chatterton – proud, unbending and as convinced asever of his genius – wanted to “fall upon the midnight with no pain.” Wild andunsupervised as never before, he may have just taken too much and the cure, asoften is the case, may have simply turned out deadlier than the disease.It’s a shame that unlike Francis Thompson and Meyerstein, Chatterton had noguardian angel to stay his hand, or at least to lessen his dose. Like WalterBenjamin, he seemed plagued by bad luck; money that would have saved him fromstarvation without curdling his pride came the day after his death, and a fedChatterton would have faced the world with a different outlook. Who knows whatmight have come of it, and what the loss of such a powerful symbol would havehad on the starving poets and neglected geniuses that followed?CESARE PAVESEOn the evening of Sunday 27 August 1950, the body of the Italian poet, novelistand translator Cesare Pavese was found in a room he had taken the day before atthe Hotel Roma in Turin, a few blocks from his own apartment. He had swallowedthe contents of over a dozen packets of sleeping pills and was fully clothed andlying on the bed. He was only 42. Pavese had spent the weeks prior to hissuicide arranging as neat and orderly a death as he could, burning letters anddocuments on a brazier in his room, even going so far as to make sure that L’Unità, the Communist Party newspaper, to which he contributed, had a goodphotograph of him in its files, presumably for his obituary. He had alwaysbelieved that one should “seek death of one’s own free will, asserting one’sright to choose,” and now he had put that belief to the test. Not long before,Pavese had won the prestigious Strega Prize, the most sought after Italianliterary award, and the novels he wrote just before his end, like The Moon andThe Bonfires, probably his best known outside Italy, show a craftsman and artistat his peak.The ostensible prompt for taking his life was his rejection by the AmericanB-movie actress Constance Dowling77, but any reader of Pavese’s remarkablejournal, published as This Business of Living, soon recognizes that suicide,what he called his “absurd vice,” was something he was moving toward practicallyall of his life – inexorably, one wants to say, aware of the cliché, butconscious of its aptness. Writing of Pavese, A. Alvarez remarked that he was thekind of suicide that is born, not made, and it’s clear that Pavese was one ofthose whom the “Treatise on the Steppenwolf” describes so accurately. “I knowthat I am forever condemned to think of suicide when faced with no matter whatdifficulty or grief,” he wrote.78 His suicide note, left on the first page ofhis copy of his philosophical Dialogues with Leucò, found open in the room, wasa plea for those he left behind to make no fuss. “I forgive everyone and askforgiveness of everyone,” he wrote. “O.K.? Not too much gossip, please.”79 Thecalm and nonchalance of these last words, reminiscent of Mayakovsky’s, contrastpowerfully with the tortured final entry in his journal. “The thing most fearedin secret always happens … All it needs is a little courage. The more the paingrows clear and definite, the more the instinct for life asserts itself and thethought of suicide recedes. It seemed easy enough when I thought of it. Weakwomen have done it. It needs humility, not pride. I am sickened by all this. Notwords. Action. I shall write no more.”80The chasm between words and action, or art and life, plagued Pavese endlessly.It’s almost too obvious to point out that when he finally succeeded in crossingit, what he achieved was death.Cesare Pavese was born in 1908 on a farm where his family spent their holidays,near the small village of Santo Stefano Belbo, in the Langhe area of Piedmontbetween Turin and the Alps. Although he spent most of his life in Turin, wherehe worked as an editor and translator for the publisher Einaudi, the landscapeof his early years made a deep, perhaps fatal impression. Pavese believed indestiny and his destiny was shaped by the rugged, austere hills of his birth, onwhich he loved to wander on long, solitary walks. The contrast between the cityand the country, which, like other dichotomies in his life, he was never able toreconcile – “I am made up of many parts that do not blend,” he told his friendand biographer Davide Lajolo – became a mythic theme for him. The people ofthese hills were as rugged as they are, taciturn and reticent, and Pavese’smother was no exception. When his father died from a brain tumour when Pavesewas six, his undemonstrative mother offered little tenderness and warmth, thoughhe got some measure of this from his older sister, with whom he would live formost of his adult years. Throughout his life, Pavese had difficulty with women,and although his dissatisfaction with Italian Communism, with which he belatedlybut without real conviction became involved, joining the party after WWII, isoften cited as an equal element in his suicide, it was really his inability tofind love that turned him toward indulging in his “absurd vice.” As one criticremarked, “At the centre of his life there appears to have been an emotionalvacuum which he tried repeatedly to fill, always without success.”81 Throughouthis life, Pavese remained “the contemplative observer of himself who seeks … tobreak out of his solitude and yet continually fails to do so.”82In his later years Pavese would try to recapture some sense of the innocence ofhis early days; yet, by most accounts his childhood wasn’t happy. He gives theimpression of being an ‘outsider’ from early on – someone who, like the figurein Poe’s poem, “does not see as others do”83 – and, like the contrast betweencity and country, that between solitude and human contact is a central theme inboth his life and work. Like many sensitive, intelligent children, Pavese stoodapart from the life around him, exercising a capacity for distance that isessential for most writers, yet which would soon create a gulf between himselfand the world.Pavese’s first experience with rejection happened, as it does with most of us,in his teens. Like most romantics, Pavese was attracted by the lure of theinaccessible. Thin, scholarly, and not particularly handsome, throughout hislife Pavese was drawn to glamorous, overtly sexy women, and although on occasiona Marilyn Monroe might be attracted to an Arthur Miller, the kind of woman thatPavese desired usually wasn’t interested in him. His first timid attempts atmeeting girls resulted in fainting fits and when a cabaret singer he had metwhile in high school stood him up, he was sick for three months; their date wasfor six, but Pavese waited until midnight before admitting she wasn’t going toshow. Pavese also seems to have been plagued by some sexual inhibition orself-consciousness: impotence and premature ejaculation turn up frequently inhis journal; “The man who ejaculates too soon,” he writes, “had better neverhave been born. It is a failing that makes suicide worth while.”84Although his novels have an existential air, and its understandable thatfilm-makers like Michelangelo Antonioni would be drawn to his work, Pavese’soutlook is fundamentally romantic. Women are infinitely desirable, yet the realstuff of sex is nasty, dirty and ugly, and is always a disappointment. He isdrawn to it, but repelled at the same time, and it’s clear that the social andpolitical concerns in Pavese’s writings are an expression of his recognitionthat his detachment from life is essentially a product of immaturity. Yet he isnot really a political writer, his association with Communism notwithstanding.His focus on the working class and the peasants in his novels is really anattempt to break through his isolation into ‘life’, yet it could never providethe kind of intensity that ‘really’ living does. It’s instructive that he speaksof living as a ‘business’. As one critic commented, Pavese saw life “as anecessary performance, as an artefact to be constructed, rather than a processto be accepted.”85 Self-conscious, awkward, rarely at home with himself, Paveselacked that unconscious grace that many less thoughtful people seem to enjoy.If life was, as Pavese thought, a business, it wasn’t one he was very good at.Like others we have met – Trakl, Anne Sexton, Benjamin – Pavese seemed adept atbeing inept. In a letter written to a friend the young Pavese confesses that heis “incompetent, timid, lazy, uncertain, weak and half mad,” and that he lacksany potential to “settle into a permanent job and make what is called a successin life.”86 And in a poem he sent the same friend, Pavese makes an earlyreference to suicide. He says that “one evening in December” he walked along adeserted road, with “turmoil in my heart,” and also a gun. He fires a blast intothe ground, feeling the recoil. He then imagines “the tremendous jolt it willgive on the night when the last illusion and the fears will have abandoned meand I will place it against my temple to shatter my brain.”87 This is areference to an incident in real life, when Pavese’s best friend committedsuicide, and Pavese was determined to do the same. He got a gun and went to thetree where his friend shot himself, but found he couldn’t repeat the act; hefired shots into the tree instead. The inability to complete the suicidalgesture stayed with Pavese, adding to his sense of incompetence.The experience that would set him on his destiny as a suicide would combine botha woman and politics. In 1930, Pavese’s mother died. Although their relationshipwas never close, her death upset him deeply. He became even more cut off fromother people, and his thoughts inevitably drifted toward suicide. In 1933, inorder to get a position as a teacher, Pavese joined the Fascist Party, anecessity at the time. Soon after, however, he became involved with a woman,another teacher, who was a Communist and anti-Fascist. Pavese believed that hisaffair with Tina Pizzardo, “the woman with the hoarse voice,” would be his greatlove, and, when she asked him if he would receive letters for her from otheranti-fascists, he agreed. Tina, however, was being watched, and the police soonraided Pavese’s house and found the letters. Pavese was arrested. If, as TimParks points out, he explained that he was in love and was only letting hismistress use his address, he probably would have been released.88 But this wouldhave meant compromising the source of his happiness, and that was unthinkable.Pavese protected Tina, and the result was that he was first imprisoned, thenplaced in exile in a remote coastal village in Calabria.He found the place unbearable. “Study is impossible,” he told a friend in aletter. “You can do nothing worth doing in this state of uncertainty, nothingother than to savour utter boredom, misery, spleen and gut-ache.”89 Afterspending a year under house arrest, he appealed for clemency, and was released.During that time Tina wrote only once, but Pavese rationalized this by sayingshe was simply protecting herself and other subversives, by avoiding any linksto a known antifascist. Understandably, on his release Pavese was eager to seeher, and he took the first train to Turin. But when he arrived he was told thatTina had married another man the day before. Pavese fainted on the platform. Itwas bad enough that he had lost his chance at love, which, he believed, wouldbring with it a home and family – symbols of maturity – but any standing he mayhave had with the other anti-fascists dissolved when it became known that he hadpleaded for clemency. Other arrested subversives stoically endured their fate.When Pavese asked Tina why she didn’t wait and marry him, she told him that“you’re good at writing poetry, but you’re not good for a woman.” It was ananswer he probably already knew, but to hear it from the woman he had just spenta year in exile for must have hurt. She also made it clear that it was hisdependence on her that turned her away. It’s a banal reflection, but Paveseseems to have sought out women that, like his mother, would show him littleaffection; those that did, didn’t interest him. It was a ‘no win’ situation, andit’s little wonder that he could write acid aphorisms like: “A woman, unless sheis an idiot, sooner or later meets a piece of human wreckage and tries to rescuehim. She sometimes succeeds. But a woman, unless she is an idiot, sooner orlater finds a sane, healthy man and makes a wreck of him. She alwayssucceeds.”90 Yet, although this expresses a sentiment shared by many men whohave wasted themselves on a woman, another aphorism makes it clear that it isnot so much the woman who turns one toward self-destruction, but the dangers oflove itself. “One does not kill oneself for the love of a woman,” Pavese wrote.“One kills oneself because a love, any love, reveals us in our nakedness, ourmisery, our impotence, our nothingness.” If Pavese spent his short life seekinga woman who would love him and whom he could love, he was also seeking thatwhich would make him feel most suicidal.After Tina, he didn’t have much luck. As he told Davide Lajolo, “the woman fromTurin … ended it between me and women.” Much of Pavese’s subsequent writing hasbeen combed, predictably, for signs of misogyny; Lajolo even has a chapterentitled, “The Other Women as Revenge,” in which he examines Pavese’s “contemptfor women.” Women are raped, murdered, and abandoned in his writings and thereare also intimations of his end, prefigured in the fates of some of his womencharacters. One of his last novels, Among Women Only, begins with a failedsuicide attempt by one of the central characters. By the end of the novel, shemakes another attempt; this time she is successful, and her death is an almostmirror image of Pavese’s own, taking barbiturates in a hotel room. “I am afraidnothing matters. We are all whores,” one of Pavese’s women declares.Nevertheless, he still tried to find a woman who could give him the love andstability he needed. Yet Pavese never mastered the knack of making himselfattractive. He would use his intelligence and sensitivity to ingratiate himself,but the transition from sympathetic friend to lover was rarely made; hisself-consciousness and detachment was unbridgeable, as was his sense of sexualinferiority. He was attracted to and became an intimate friend of one woman, butfor five years never tried to kiss her; finally out of the blue he asked her tomarry him. She declined. When he met the actress Constance Dowling in Rome, itsunderstandable he would be taken with her: blonde and glamorous, she was alsoAmerican, and Pavese had a passion for Americana. His university thesis had beenon Walt Whitman, and Pavese had translated Melville, Sherwood Anderson, SinclairLewis, Dos Passos and Faulker, among others, making modern American literatureaccessible to Italian readers. But although he enjoyed a brief happiness withConstance – and perhaps the fact that he was happy was the most painful thingabout the affair, having what he had sought for so long soon snatched from him –it’s clear she wasn’t Ms Right. When she left Rome for the States, Pavese waitedfor her to return, but soon he received a letter telling him the affair wasover. He was devastated and his final descent had begun. Months later, onhearing that he had won the Strega Prize and soon after had committed suicide,Constance simply remarked, “I didn’t know he was so famous,” sad indication ofhow much their fling meant to her.In his last days, Pavese took to inviting prostitutes to his office at Einaudi.They sat and talked, drank and smoked, but its doubtful he ever availed himselfof their services. A few days before he took the room at the Hotel Roma, he meta girl at a dance hall, but more than likely he was tired of trying and wantedto stop. “Suicides are timid murderers. Masochism instead of sadism,” he wrotein his journal on 17 August, echoing Otto Weininger. A few months before, theAmerican critic F.O. Mathiessen, whose work Pavese admired, had killed himself,and its probable that Pavese took this as a sign.91 The night before his last,he made a few phone calls, asking people to dinner, but no one was free. Heprepared his journal for publication – he had always written it with this inview – made the necessary arrangements, and, making what he felt was aconscious, rational choice, fulfilled the destiny he had embraced long ago.MARY WOLLSTONECRAFTIncluding Mary Wollstonecraft in my “Ten Suicides” is something of a cheat.Although she made two attempts at suicide, both were failures. Yet sadly, lessthan two years after her second attempt, she died from complications givingbirth to her daughter Mary, later Mary Shelley, wife of the poet Percy Shelley,and author, among other works, of Frankenstein. That she died so soon afterfailing to kill herself is a tragedy and an irony; yet in her last years, spentwith the writer William Godwin, first as friends, then as cohabiting lovers, andfinally as husband and wife, she achieved the kind of happiness that had eludedher throughout most of her life. Novelist, essayist, historian, politicalphilosopher, feminist and teacher, if her personal life was one of trauma andgrief, in her creative life, Mary Wollstonecraft produced a body of work thatestablishes her as one of the most vital and original minds of her age. Whatmakes this especially true is the fact that in the few months in between her twosuicide attempts, when she was caught in the turmoil of depression, anger, fearand loneliness, she could produce one of the most influential works of the time,her remarkable Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway andDenmark.92Sent on a journey through Scandinavia – ostensibly a business trip on behalf ofher one-time lover Gilbert Imlay – that she could travel successfully alonewhile burdened with suicidal thoughts is itself a considerable achievement. Butwith its theme of a solitary traveller in a strange and foreign land,encountering her own soul amidst the sublime beauties of nature,Wollstonecraft’s book exemplifies and anticipates the Romantic consciousnessthat would emerge in full force only three years later in Wordsworth andColeridge’s Lyrical Ballads.Yet Wollstonecraft’s A Short Residence – as the work is commonly known – wasn’tthe only remarkable work associated with her attempts at suicide. After herdeath, in an effort to deal with his grief, her husband William Godwin producedthe equally groundbreaking Memoirs of the Author of the Rights of Woman, perhapsthe first work of biography in the modern sense. Godwin’s work was highlycriticized at the time, not only for his candour in depicting the oftendifficult moods of his wife, and for making public the details of herunsuccessful infatuation with the artist Henry Fuseli, and her disastrous affairwith the American entrepreneur Gilbert Imlay. What many found unforgivable inGodwin’s Memoirs was the attention he gave to her two attempts at taking herlife. What we today would find essential material in ‘life-writing’ was, forGodwin’s late Eighteenth century readership, a serious breach of authorialetiquette, not to say an insulting disregard for the memory of his wife: thepoet Southey, on reading the book, remarked that Godwin showed “a want of allfeeling in stripping his dead wife naked.” Although both authors championed alife free from the constraints and hypocrisy of social conventions and acceptednorms, when put into practice – with Mary in her own life, and with William inhis account of it – they became targets of censure and indignation, mostsurprisingly from people who had hitherto applauded their efforts to challengethe status quo.Mary Wollstonecraft had a difficult childhood, one that produced, as herearliest letters reveal, a basic insecurity. Her father was a sentimental,bullying man, who was as apt to beat his wife as he was to smother Mary and hersiblings in drunken affection. And although Mary received little warmth orattention from her mother – as a discipline, her mother often made the talkativeMary sit still for hours without making a sound – she would often sleep on thefloor outside her mother’s door, in order to protect her from the arbitraryviolence meted out by her father. Equally disturbing were the frequentrelocations that were a part of Mary’s early years. Although he lacked anyaptitude for it, her father was obsessed with becoming a farmer, and wasted aninheritance on ventures that soon collapsed, forcing the family to move on. It’sunderstandable that in later life, financial independence and domestic securitybecame her central aims.Her road to independence started when she was eighteen; she left home, and tooka job as a lady’s companion. Although it got her away from her family, likeThomas Chatterton, Mary resented being dependent on her employer and beingtreated like a servant. By this time she had also met and more or less fallen inlove – platonically – with Fanny Blood, a young woman, as Godwin describes her,“of extraordinary accomplishments.” So important was Mary’s introduction toFanny, that Godwin writes that it “bore a resemblance to the first interview ofWerther and Charlotte.”93 This wasn’t the only nod to Goethe’s tale of failedlove and suicide that Godwin makes in reference to Mary; the letters she wroteto her worthless lover Imlay, filled with ecstasy, despair and the obsessivepursuit of an unrequited love, were, he said, worthy of Werther, and indescribing Mary as someone whose mind “seems almost of too fine a texture toencounter the vicissitudes of human affairs, to whom pleasure is a transport,and disappointment is agony indescribable,” he simply says that “Mary was inthis respect a female Werther.”94 Both the early critics of Godwin’s Memoir andlater modern feminists took argument with this association, yet its clear to anyunprejudiced reader that Mary had the kind of temperament that we can only callRomantic.Mary’s attachment to Fanny Blood, who was two years older than her, isunderstandable. She saw her as a kind of model of self-improvement, somethingthat Mary was determined on throughout her life. At this time, Mary’s meagreself-esteem was evident. She let her long hair hang limp, and wore dull, coarseclothes. She ate very little, and suffered from headaches, fevers, and feelingsof gloom, characteristics that would remain with her throughout her life. (“Youtalk of the roses which grow profusely in every path of life,” she wrote Godwin,“I catch at them, but only encounter thorns.”95) Fanny, on the other hand,dressed attractively, could sing and play and drew well enough to earn moneyfrom it. As one biographer put it, Mary “could not love what she did not alsoesteem,”96 and finding little to esteem in her own family, she anchored thisneed in Fanny. Soon she asked Fanny to instruct her in spelling and composition.Eventually she would live with the Blood family, and so deep was her attachmentto her friend that later, when Fanny had married and moved to Portugal, Marywould travel there to assist her in childbirth. Like some presage of Mary’s ownfate, Fanny would die giving birth, and in memory of her great friend, Marywould name her own first child Fanny. She, too, sadly would have a tragic end.97Although Mary was at first in awe of Fanny, she soon outstripped her. Where Maryhad a vigorous, fiery, determined character, Fanny was timid and shy and, asMary soon discovered, as conventional as other women. Mary was never timid andshy, and she also soon proved herself a capable character. She had tended herill mother until her death, and when her sister Eliza suffered a nervousbreakdown, prompted by a bad marriage and postnatal depression, Mary tookcharge, taking Eliza away from her failed home in Bermondsey, to set up a schoolin Newington Green. There Mary met the celebrated Dr. Johnson, who was impressedwith her conversation. Mary, however, was more impressed with another doctor,Richard Price, one of the dissenters she met on the green. Unlike the cynicalDr. Johnson, Price believed that men’s will and determination could better theworld, and that in a just society, our better natures would have an opportunityto emerge, a belief that Mary too held strongly.Mary’s will and determination would have many chances to show their mettle. Whenshe returned from Portugal, she found the school floundering. She arrangedteaching positions for her sisters and was forced to accept a job as a governessin Ireland – not, however, before writing her Thoughts on the Education ofDaughters. Predictably, although the opportunity to travel again was welcome(she was one of the most travelled women of her generation) Mary didn’t relishher position as governess, and her outspokenness and dissatisfaction with thetrivial concerns of Lady Kingsborough soon led to her dismissal. She was put onthe road to destiny by meeting the publisher Joseph Johnson. Johnson recognizedher talent, and soon had her reviewing for his new Analytical Review. ThroughJohnson Mary met radical figures like Tom Paine and, more importantly, Godwin.Although there were clearly women writers before, Mary, as a freelance criticand essayist, considered herself “the first of a new genus.” Johnson alsopublished her novel Mary and her children’s book, Original Stories. Soon otherworks appeared. A Vindication of the Rights of Man, originally publishedanonymously, was her response to Edmund Burke’s Reflections on the Revolution inFrance. And Tom Paine’s Rights of Man prompted her most famous work, Vindicationof the Rights of Woman.Although in Vindication of the Rights of Woman Mary played down the importanceof sex in the ‘rational’ woman’s life, her own passions and desires began tomake trouble for her. The artist Henry Fuseli, who she met through Johnson, wasalready married, but this didn’t stop Mary from developing a ‘rational desire’for him. So rational it was, that she proposed a ménage à trois between herself,Fuseli and his wife. The career-minded Fuseli, however, was shocked, as was hiswife, and Mary discovered that the kind of freedom her friends lauded in herwriting was not necessarily welcomed in their lives. To avoid humiliation, andto get over Fuseli, she travelled once again, this time to France, where shewitnessed the Terror of the Revolution at first hand. On showing horror at theblood-soaked ground below the guillotine, a friend warned that, for her ownsafety, she had better keep her opinions to herself. She later wrote a historyof the revolution.98Yet another danger was in store for her in Paris. Here she met the Americanadventurer Gilbert Imlay, and all the frustrated passion of her unconsummatedattraction to Fuseli found a target. Mary and Imlay became lovers, and soon shewas pregnant – an imposition that Imlay quickly regretted. Although she hadanticipated a life together based on mutual respect and lofty ideals, which shemistakenly assumed Imlay shared with her, Imlay’s interest in Mary soon faded,and, after a brief time in Paris and then Neuilly, they would never livetogether again. Although on more than one occasion, Imlay declared her as hiswife – for her protection in Paris he had registered her as such at the AmericanEmbassy, after England declared war on France – they were never technicallymarried. By all accounts, Mary had conceived a love for a man who was unworthyof her, but her idealized picture of Imlay, like that of Fanny, worked againsther. If she could not love where she could not esteem, then Imlay must besomeone worthy of her esteem, even if, as practically everyone around her knew,he wasn’t. Readers of the Letters to Imlay, published by Godwin, soon recognizethe link to Werther. She may have been sexually passionate about Imlay, and theneed for little Fanny to have a father was also a concern, but the impressionone gets is that Mary refused to recognize that her love was misplaced and thatshe was the captive of her own ideals.She made her first suicide attempt in London in 1795, after being apart fromImlay for months, and suffering his repeated indecision about theirrelationship; although to everyone else it was clear he was through with her, hestill showed her sufficient concern to keep her hopes up and more or less toldher it was “up to her,” a typical male stratagem to avoid responsibility. Thelaudanum she took, however, only made her wretch, and when Imlay realized thatshe was serious, he decided to send her on her Scandinavian adventure.99 He mayhave known that throwing herself into some purposeful action was the best thingfor her, or he may have simply wanted to get her out of his hair. Mary, too,must have seen his request as a means of holding on to him, even if it would beat some distance. A ship Imlay had an interest in with a considerable cargo –£3,500 worth of silver, a fortune at the time – had been lost off the Swedishcoast, and it was Mary’s task to find out what had happened and recover what shecould of his investment. That a woman who had just tried to kill herself wouldembark on such a voyage is surprising. That she brought along her illegitimatebaby daughter and an inexperienced nursemaid smacks of Romantic fiction.One might think that an account of a business trip would be unpromising reading,yet Mary’s reasons for heading to what was more or less terra incognita soonbecome unimportant, and her reflections on the natural scenery, the strangecustoms, and herself grip the reader from the start; Godwin declared thatreading the book made him fall in love with her. Melancholy as she is, feelingherself as “a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind,”100 Mary isnevertheless visited by those sudden moments of delight that save Hesse’sSteppenwolf from an appointment with the razor. She speaks of feeling “thatspontaneous pleasure which gives credibility to one’s expectations ofhappiness,”101 and recognizes that “the sublime often gave place imperceptiblyto the beautiful, dilating the emotions which were painfully concentrated.”102On approaching the Swedish coast she notes that “the sunbeams that played on theocean, scarcely ruffled by the lightest breeze, contrasted with the huge darkrocks, that looked like the rude materials of creation forming the barrier ofunwrought space …”103Although she provides fascinating accounts of the life and people sheencounters, it is her response to ‘brute creation’ and sublime nature thatstrikes the reader forcefully. As Blake was doing in her own time, and asWordsworth and Coleridge would after her, Mary was discovering a strange newworld within herself. One word that continually comes up is imagination.“Without the aid of imagination,” she writes, “all the pleasures of the sensesmust sink into grossness.”104 In a letter to Imlay, who would scarcelyunderstand her, she explained that genius was a product of a fusion of feelingand thought, of desire and imagination, and that she herself had a share inthis. Unfortunately, as Mary would painfully discover, Imlay’s pleasures wererarely imaginative, and all her entreaties to him to cast off his lower self andbecome who he ‘really’ was fell, not on deaf ears, but on gross ones. He alreadywas who he really was, but she couldn’t admit this.When she returned to England, Imlay didn’t meet her, as he had promised, yet hefelt bound to provide a home for her and his daughter. He had by this time foundanother lover, one who wasn’t careless about contraception, and when Maryeventually found out, she decided again to kill herself. She walked along theriver to Battersea, but found the area too busy, so she took a boat further downto Putney. She walked back and forth along the bridge in the pouring rain,thinking that if her clothes were soaked, she would sink faster. Then sheclimbed the railing and jumped. Her clothes still buoyed her up, so she wrappedthem tightly around her. It was harder to drown than she thought, and beforebecoming unconscious, the pain was unbearable. Some fishermen had seen her andbefore she was pulled too far by the current, they hauled her out and broughther to a nearby public house. When she recovered, she was indignant andthankless, complaining that even her “fixed determination to die” had failed,although she did later remark that if she ever decided to commit suicide again,she would not do it by drowning. Her ‘suicide letter’ to Imlay had more or lessmade it clear what she would do, and soon friends arrived to take her home.Accepting that she still had to live, and that Imlay had another lover, sheagain proposed a ménage à trois; Imlay considered this briefly, yet both knew itwas impossible, and Mary probably didn’t want it anyway. After a time herobsession eased and her one-time lover faded from her consciousness, to bereplaced with other, more rewarding concerns.Notes 1 Bizan Kawamaki, 1908; Takeo Arishima, 1923; Ryunosuke Akutagawa, 1927;Shinichi Makino, 1936; Tamiki Hara, 1951; Michio Kato; 1953; Sakae Kubo; 1958;Ashihei Hino, 1960 are some of the more notable examples. 2 Henry Scott Stokes The Life and Death of Yukio Mishima (Penguin:Harmondsworth, 1985) p. 25.

Huysmans’ satanic novel,Là-Bas, one of whose characters, the Canon Docre, has crosses tattooed on bothfeet.11 Crowley exaggerated the initial A of his signature, fashioning it to looklike an erect penis. The sun, of course, is also a phallic symbol.12 Cowley p. 259.13 It is interesting that another poet, a younger contemporary of Crosby, RenéDaumal, was, like him, fascinated with death, and in his early work, adopted theblack sun as a symbol of “the beyond.” See his collection Counter Heaven.14 Wolff p. 190.15 Ibid. pp. 239–241. Again, the parallels with Aleister Crowley are striking.See Crowley’s infamous Book of the Law which contains passages such as, “Theseare dead, these fellows; they feel not. We are not for the poor and sad: thelords of the earth are our kinsfolk. […] We have nothing with the outcast andunfit: let them die in their misery … Compassion is the vice of kings: stampdown the wretched & the weak: this is the law of the strong … […] Pity not thefallen! I never knew them. I am not for them. I console not …” I’ve not comeacross any reference to Crowley in any literature on Crosby, although they werecontemporaries and Crowley was known in the Paris and New York of Crosby’s day.It’s almost a pity Crosby was unaware of him, if he was. Crowley’s philosophyof, “Do what thou wilt” would have appealed to him; he had a natural talent forit, as Crowley did for excess, indulging in monumental amounts of drugs, strangesex and other inebriants. On second thoughts, it was perhaps a blessing that thetwo didn’t meet, as Crowley, for whom the sun was also a powerful talisman,would more than likely have manoeuvred large portions of Crosby’s fortune intohis own pockets.16 Ibid. p. 242.17 Ibid. p. 30518 Trakl’s death is reminiscent of another literary suicide. Like Trakl, theHungarian doctor, short story writer and music critic Géza Csáth (pseudonym ofJosef Brenner 1887–1919) may have pursued a medical career simply because itwould provide close proximity to drugs. Csáth begin smoking opium in 1909; ayear later he was injecting large dosages of morphine. After several yearsworking at a clinic, he took up practice as a country doctor in 1913, mostlikely in order to indulge his habit undetected. By the time he was dischargedfrom service in WWI, he was showing signs of physical and mental decline. Hecarried knives and had members of his family followed by detectives. Finally, ashis infant daughter watched, he shot his wife. Committed to an insane asylum, hemade an unsuccessful suicide attempt. He then escaped; en route to Budapest, hewas stopped at the Serbian border. Following a brief struggle with the borderguards, he swallowed poison and died.

Predictably, Beddoes’ tragedywasn’t finished; Shelley’s was her second novel.39 Ibid. p. 6. The search for the physical location of the soul has animpressive pedigree. René Descartes, father of modern rational thought, believedit was located in the pineal gland. Before his transformation into a religiousthinker, the scientist Emanuel Swedenborg devoted many years of his life to thesame pursuit. Today it continues in the work of neuroscientists, and is focusedon the cerebral roots of spiritual experience; hence, popular magazine articlesabout such things as the brain’s ‘God’s spot’.40 Thompson p. 641 Ibid p. 1.42 One of Paracelsus’ aphorisms is, “Decay is the midwife of great things.” Hebelieved putrefaction was the key to life and transformation, and once,lecturing a group of learned dons on its virtues, he produced a plate of his ownfaeces as evidence.43 Jung called the feminine element in men the anima; the masculine element inwomen he called the animus. More recently, another possible literary suicideadvocated ideas very similar to Weininger’s. In June 1981, police were called tothe Highgate, North London home of Charlotte Bach, who in the 1970s haddeveloped a reputation and following as a kind of sexual philosopher and guru.Bach’s central idea was, like Weininger’s, that human beings contain elements ofboth sexes in their psyches, and that one’s personal evolution and developmentdepends on the way in which one integrates these polarities. Bach developed acomplicated system of what we might call ‘evolutionary transvestitism’ and triedto express it in an enormous work, Homo Mutans, Homo Luminens (which might betranslated as ‘Man the Changer, Man the Light-bringer’), and a later volume Manand/or Woman. Her central teaching was that one could either accept or rejectone’s psychic other (male for women, female for men), and depending on this, onewould either develop or remain stagnant. (And it has to be pointed out thatrejection is a positive thing in some cases, just as acceptance is a negativeone in others.) Bach found support in some high places, coming under the wing for a timeof Colin Wilson, whose book, The Misfits (note 3 above) gives a detailed accountof her ideas and history. What no one knew, and what the police who came to herflat discovered, was that Charlotte was really a man. When they examined thebody, they found that the breasts were false, and that the knickers concealed apenis. Charlotte was really Carl Hadju, a Hungarian con man, hypnotist,novelist, kleptomaniac and, possibly, murderer, who had deceived his followersfor years. He had also, it seems, deceived himself, as in his (or her) system, aperson with a powerful contrasexual component and who gives in to it – a verymasculine woman who goes butch, for example – loses all chance of using thepsychic tension for self-development. Charlotte/Carl had evidently done justthat, and accounts of her time prior to being found dead indicate she had beendepressed and ill. Although there is no evidence that he/ she consciously tookhis/her own life, circumstances suggest a possible suicidal intent. Neighbourscalled the police after milk bottles had accumulated outside her door. It’squite possible that, depressed at her own deceit, he/she simply ignored whateversymptoms were present, and allowed himself/herself to die. See also my article“The Strange Life of Charlotte Bach” in Bizarre winter 200244 In defence of Weininger it has to be said that other, somewhat lesscontentious voices raised similar themes. In his philosophical comedy Man andSuperman (1904), Bernard Shaw argues that, contrary to popular belief, men arethe dreamers who create civilization while women are down-to-earth pragmatists,who want to secure men’s energies for their own ends, which, as Weiningerbelieved, were basically child-bearing. Also contrary to popular belief, in Backto Methuselah (1929), Shaw argued that women came first, and created men inorder to help with their labours.45 Although C.G. Jung mentions Weininger briefly in his own PsychologicalTypes, it is unclear how much of an influence Weininger’s system was on Jung’s.46 Ludwig Wittgenstein Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (Routledge & Kegan Paul:London, 1969) pp. 145–149.47 One of the more dubious appreciators of Weininger’s work was the ItalianDadaist and esoteric philosopher, Julius Evola. Assimilating Weininger’s viewson women, race and genius, Evola developed his own system of spiritual racism,with which for a brief time he ingratiated himself with Mussolini. He also triedto interest the Nazis in his ideas but had less success. In the 1970s and 80sEvola’s ideas formed an ideological justification for several right-wingterrorist acts in Italy, resulting in several deaths, and in recent years hiswork has seen a resurgence among some New Age and spiritually oriented readersin the United States. For more on Evola see my article “Mussolini’s Mystic” inissue 191 (December 2004) of Fortean Times.48 David Abrahamsen The Mind and Death of a Genius (Columbia University Press:New York, 1946) p. 15.49 Ibid. p. 124.50 Ibid. p. 177.51 Ibid. p. 88.52 Ibid. p. 182. It is of course easy to see in this merely the onset ofWeininger’s madness. Yet it pays to recall that practically all poetry andmetaphor is based on precisely the same type of associations, and that whileWeininger and other artists (the Strindberg of the Inferno period comes to mind)are just as susceptible to madness as the rest of us – more susceptibleaccording to some authorities – they are also privy to insights and perceptionsdenied the rank and file. Symbolism, the most important aesthetic movement inthe nineteenth century, is based on similarly odd correspondences and could beseen by a particular literal mind to be nothing more than evidence of insanity;indeed, Max Nordau’s once very influential Degeneration (1892) did preciselythat. Weininger’s last works, only published after his death, On Last Things andAphorisms, reveal a subtle and poetic mind, often on a par with Nietzsche orWittgenstein, trying to convey the insights that came to him in his heightenedstates. It would be a mistake and irresponsible to label him a misogynisticracist and leave it at that, while ignoring the many flashes of genius found inhis work.53 Abrahamsen p. 50.54 Ellen Mayne “Otto Weininger on the Character of Man” (New AtlantisFoundation: Sussex, 1982).55 Harold Harris, Introduction to Arthur and Cynthia Koestler Stranger on theSquare (Hutchinson: London, 1984) p. 11.56 George Mikes Arthur Koestler: The Story of a Friendship (London: 1983).57 Harris, p. 14.58 David Cesarani Arthur Koestler: The Homeless Mind (William Heineman: London,1998) p. 555.59 Arthur Koestler Bricks to Babel (Random House: New York, 1980) p. 10.60 Arthur Koestler Arrow in the Blue (Collins: London, 1952) p. 116.61 Arthur Koestler “Return Trip to Nirvana” in Drinkers of Infinity (Hutchison:London, 1968) p. 209.62 Arthur Koestler Arrow in the Blue (Collins: London, 1952) p. 34.63 Cynthia Koestler Stranger in the Square p. 160.64 Arthur Koestler, Ibid. p. 65.65 Cynthia Koestler, Ibid. pp. 112–113.66 Cesarani p. 554.67 Ibid.68 The comparison with Rimbaud goes beyond mere age. In one of his last poems,the “African Eclogues,” Chatterton hits a note reminiscent of the Le Bateau Ivrea century away. “On Tiber’s banks where scarlet jasmines bloom/And purple aloesshed a rich perfume;/Where, when the sun is melting in his heat/The reekingtygers find a cool retreat/Bask in the sedges, lose the sultry beam/And wantonwith their shadows in the stream/ …”69 Quoted in Linda Kelly The Marvellous Boy: The Life and Myth of ThomasChatterton (Weidenfeld and Nicolson: London, 1971) p. xix.70 Parisian Diarist, quoted in ibid. p. 104.71 The main story in Croft’s book – actually an early version of thenon-fiction novel – was that of James Hackman and Martha Reay. Reay,thirty-three, was a singer, and the mistress of the Earl of Sandwich, who wastwenty years her senior; Hackman, twenty, was an officer. Hackman and Reay metand became lovers, but she was prudent enough to realize that Hackman would notbe able to support her and the children she had by the Earl. Although sent awayfor two years, Hackman remained infatuated with her, and on his return, tried tore-ignite their passion. He had been offered a position as a parson and would beable to afford a family. Yet Reay, dubious about starting life again atthirty-five with a much younger man, declined. Hackman persisted and, in anattempt to dissuade him, the Earl had Reay’s duenna advise him untruthfully thatshe had already taken a new lover. Hackman was shattered and determined onsuicide, which he proposed to commit at his ex-mistress’ feet. Waiting for heroutside the Covent Garden opera house, he suddenly changed his mind and shot herinstead, then clumsily tried to shoot himself, but only managed to wound himselfin the temple. He fell into the gutter, crying to the bystanders, “Kill me, killme!” He was later executed. On the ground next to the pistol that Hackman used,was found a copy of Werther’s last letter to Charlotte. Croft, who thought of Chatterton as “Apollo reincarnated,” and whocompared him favourably with Milton, was fascinated with his story and hadgathered a great deal of material about it. Loathe to let this go to waste, heinserted it in a long section of his book, which is based on the correspondencebetween Hackman and Reay during their two-year separation. Constrained to talkonly of “matters of general interest,” for fear of being discovered by the Earl,Hackman relates to Reay his investigations into Chatterton’s story.

Theexact reasons for her suicide are unclear, although by most accounts sheinherited a great part of her mother’s tendency to gloom and depression, whileMary’s second daughter, Mary Shelley, apparently received the better part of herdetermination and strength. By the time of her death, her half-sister had elopedwith the poet Shelley, who was still married to his first wife Harriet. Godwin,who had become more conservative in his views, abhorred the act, and his secondwife – disliked by those who knew Mary – had little love for her step-daughter.Fanny remained at home, out of attachment and respect for her step-father, yetit was clear she was becoming a burden to Godwin, who was facing mounting debts. Despite, or perhaps because of Mary Wollstonecraft’s efforts, women’sprospects had changed very little, and Fanny could look forward to a life verysimilar to the one her mother fought to avoid. Mary’s sisters half-heartedlyoffered her a position teaching at their school in Ireland, yet Fanny was loathto accept it, dreading a life in provincial Ireland after a childhood amidstprogressive circles; the sisters, too, were concerned about the recent scandalof their niece’s elopement, and had long since lost any love for their sister orher memory. Fanny’s suicide note is, with Crevel’s and Beddoes’, one ofheartbreaking self-loathing: “I have long determined that the best thing I coulddo was to put an end to the existence of a being whose birth was unfortunate,and whose life has only been a series of pain to those persons who have hurttheir health in endeavouring to promote her welfare. Perhaps to hear of my deathwill give you pain; but you will soon have the blessing of forgetting that sucha creature ever existed as …” She had torn off her signature, hoping, at thelast, to spare her family yet another scandal. Her identity was soon determined,and the undergarments she wore bore the initials “M.W.” Her suicide was seen asanother argument against the dangerous ideas of her mother. Scandal andbereavement had still not done with Godwin; soon after his step-daughter’ssuicide, Harriet Shelley drowned herself in the Serpentine.98 Historical and Moral View of the Origin and Progress of the FrenchRevolution (1794).99 The laudanum attempt turns up in her unfinished novel The Wrongs of Woman,or Maria.100 Mary Wollstonecraft A Short Residence (Penguin: Harmonds-worth, 1987) p.69.101 Ibid. p. 68.102 Ibid.103 Ibid. p. 65.104 Ibid. p. 73."},{"pageContent":"PART 2A SUICIDAL MISCELLANY [table_of_contents.htm#ch8]"},{"pageContent":"A BALLADE OF SUICIDEG.K.

It was perhaps inMother Russia that they were most prevalent – the Slavic soul, as exemplified inDostoyevsky, had a predilection for self-destruction. One famous club, The BlackSwan, hosted by Nicolai Riabushinsky, was extremely popular, although how itsmembership was maintained is unclear. Here, Robert Louis Stevenson shows thatLondon, too, had its own fascination with societies dedicated to a quick escapefrom the travails of life.FROM THE SUICIDE CLUBROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON‘Can you muster eighty pounds between you?’ he demanded.Geraldine ostentatiously consulted his pocket-book, and replied in theaffirmative.‘Fortunate beings!’ cried the young man. ‘Forty pounds is the entry money of theSuicide Club.’‘The Suicide Club,’ said the Prince, ‘why, what the devil is that?’‘Listen,’ said the young man; ‘this is the age of conveniences, and I have totell you of the last perfection of the sort. We have affairs in differentplaces; and hence railways were invented. Railways separated us infallibly fromour friends; and so telegraphs were made that we might communicate speedily atgreat distances. Even in hotels we have lifts to spare us a climb of somehundred steps. Now, we know that life is only a stage to play the fool upon aslong as the part amuses us. There was one more convenience lacking to moderncomfort; a decent easy way to quit that stage; the back stairs to liberty; or,as I said this moment, Death’s private door. This, my two fellow-rebels, issupplied by the Suicide Club. Do not suppose that you and I are alone, or evenexceptional, in the highly reasonable desire that we profess. A large number ofyour fellow men, who have grown heartily sick of the performance in which theyare expected to join daily and all their lives long, are only kept from flightby one or two considerations. Some have families who would be shocked, or evenblamed, if the matter became public; others have a weakness at heart and recoilfrom the circumstances of death. That is, to some extent, my own experience. Icannot put a pistol to my head and draw the trigger; for something stronger thanmyself withholds the act; and although I loathe life, I have not the strengthenough in my body to take hold of death and be done with it. For such as I andfor all who desire to be out of the coil without posthumous scandal, the SuicideClub has been inaugurated.

In 1949, Mann died from anintentional overdose of sleeping pills in Cannes. Son of Thomas Mann, Klausnever really escaped from the shadow of his father, with whom he had a difficultrelationship. His homosexuality too, caused him much anxiety. Losing his Germancitizenship in 1933, Mann became a citizen of the world, moving to Amsterdam,gaining Czech nationality, and finally living in the United States, first inPrinceton, later New York. His most famous work, Mephisto, based on the careerof the actor Gustaf Gründgens under the Nazis, first published in 1936, was thesubject of a long legal battle in the 1960s, providing Mann with some posthumousfame. Here he calls on his intellectual comrades to shock the world with a waveof mass suicides, rather like Alexander Trocchi’s infamous call to his fellowwriters in the 1960s, to engage in shooting up heroin en masse.FROM EUROPE’S SEARCH FOR A NEW CREDOKLAUS MANNA weak, dissonant chorus, the voices of the European intellectuals accompany theprodigious drama. I have heard many voices on my travels, some aggressive andarrogant, others gentle or flippant, passionate or sentimental. I have yet tohear the harmony of coordinated sounds, the concert of reconciled or peacefullycompeting forces.“There is no hope. Whether we intellectuals are traitors or whether we arevictims, in any case we’d better recognize the utter hopelessness of oursituation. Why fool ourselves? We’re done for! We’re licked!”These words were uttered by a young student of philosophy and literature I metin the ancient university town of Uppsala, Sweden. What he had to say wascertainly characteristic, and l believe his words echo the beliefs of yourintellectuals in all parts of Europe.He continued: “we’re licked, we’re through. Why not admit it at last? Thestruggle between two great anti-spiritual powers – American money and Russianfanaticism – does not leave any room in the world for intellectual integrity orindependence. We are compelled to take sides and, by doing so, to betrayeverything we should defend and cherish. Koestler is wrong when asserting thatone side is a little better than the other – not quite black, just gray. Inreality, neither side is good enough – which is to say that both are bad, bothare black”.He said a new movement should be launched by European intellectuals, “themovement of despair, the rebellion of the hopeless ones. Instead of trying toappease the powers that be, instead of vindicating the machinations of greedybankers or the outrages of tyrannical bureaucrats, we ought to go on record withour protest, with an unequivocal expression of our bitterness, our horror.Things have reached a point where only the most dramatic, most radical gesturehas a chance to be noticed, to awake the conscience of the blinded hypnotizedmasses. I’d like to see hundreds, thousands of intellectuals follow the examplesof Virginia Woolf, Ernst Toller, Stefan Zweig, Jan Masaryk. A suicide wave amongthe world’s most distinguished minds would shock the peoples out of thelethargy, would make them realize the extreme gravity of the ordeal man hasbought upon himself by his folly and selfishness”.In a trembling voice, he said to me, “Let’s sign ourselves to absolutedespondency. It’s the only sincere attitude, and the only one that can be of anyhelp”.While l thought of the black future the young men and women of Europe mustvisualize for themselves, the university student added, very softly, while afaint, timid smile was lightening his pensive young voice: “Do you remember whatthat great Kierkegaard has told us? The infinite resignation is the last stageprior to faith … Therefore faith hopes also in this life, but … by virtue of theabsurd, not by virtue of the human understanding”."},{"pageContent":"FROM RELIGION AND THE REBELCOLIN WILSONMy solipsism I had arrived at by reading of Berkeley and Hume in some textbookof philosophy. I remember explaining to a group of friends in the playground atschool why a bar of chocolate existed only in their own minds. Berkeley, addedto Einstein and Eliot’s Hollow Men, made a vertiginous mixture.Then, quite suddenly, my ‘nihilism’ received a check. A day came when Iseriously contemplated suicide. It was during the long, hot summer of 1947, whenI was working as a laboratory assistant. I arrived home one evening in a stateof nervous exhaustion, and tried to ‘write away’ my tension in my journal. Ifound writing simply an aid to reflection, a crutch for my thoughts. And afterabout an hour of writing, I found my resistance slowly returning. I thoughtclearly: This must cease immediately; I will not go on living like this. I wasall too familiar with these revivals of strength that was sucked away the nextday. Then I saw the answer: Kill myself.It cheered me immensely. I cycled to my evening classes with a feeling of havingat last learned to master my destiny. I arrived late, and listened to theprofessor’s sarcasms without interest. It was our evening for analyticalchemistry practice. A glass tray contained a mixture of powders which we had toseparate. I took some in my watch glass, sniffed it, tested it in a Bunsenflame, and then went into the other room to the reagent shelves. Glass bottlescontained cobalt chloride, silver nitrate, potassium iodide and various acids.In the middle there was a bottle of hydrocyanic acid. As I took it down, my mindmade a leap, and for an instant I was living in the future, with a burning in mythroat and in the pit of my stomach. In that moment I was suddenly supremelyaware that what I wanted was not less life, but more. The sensation of drinkingthe acid was so clear that it was almost as if it had actually taken place. Istood there for a second with the bottle in my hand, but the experience was sovivid that it seemed to last for hours. Then, as someone stood beside me, I putit back, vaguely, as if I had taken it by mistake, and reached down for themethyl red. In one second, I had seen something that I have striven to see allmy life since.DAVID HUME[…] both prudence and courage should engage us to rid ourselves at once ofexistence when it becomes a burden.

Three of his four brothers killed themselves. As astudent he had hoped to study under Ludwig Boltzmann, but was prevented fromdoing this by Boltzmann’s suicide in 1906. We’ve seen that he was on his way tovisit the poet Georg Trakl, but on arrival discovered that Trakl had killedhimself. We’ve also seen that Wittgenstein was a great reader of Otto Weininger,who also killed himself. Wittgenstein was a gloomy character, who mortifiedhimself over his homosexuality, and is said to have read Dostoyevsky’s BrothersKaramazov a dozen times. Like many figures in this book, he set an impossiblyhigh standard for himself, and when he failed to achieve it, thought of killinghimself. Although suicide per se does not figure in the works published in hislife time, in the number of notebooks and journals to appear since his deathfrom cancer in 1951, it is a frequent theme. Wittgenstein’s last words were,“Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life.”FROM NOTEBOOKS 1914–1916LUDWIG WITTGENSTEINIf suicide is allowed then everything is allowed.If anything is not allowed then suicide is not allowed.This throws a light on the nature of ethics, for suicide is, so to speak, theelementary sin.

An earlier attempt at suicide by throwing himself into theMarne was foiled when a couple, making love in a boat, paused to pull him out,perhaps the only time on record when coitus interuptus served a life-savingfunction. Hedayat, whose work since 2006 has been banned in his native country,is best known for his unclassifiable Kafkaesque fantasy, The Blind Owl, an eerienightmarish novel whose closest relative is Alain Resnais’ 1961 film Last Yearat Marienbad. Melancholy, desperation and a sense of doom characterize Hedayat’swriting, yet it’s unclear how he saw suicide as an escape from these. “The factof dying,” he wrote, “is a fearful thing itself, but the consciousness that oneis dead would be far worse.” Hedayat was concerned that in the great cosmiceconomy, the atoms making up his own body would, after his death, go to form thebodies of those he considered “rabble-men.” “There were times when I wished Icould be endowed after death with large hands, with long sensitive fingers: Iwould carefully collect together all the atoms of my body and hold them tightlyin my hands to prevent them, my property, from passing into the bodies ofrabble-men.” (The Blind Owl [Cannongate: Edinburgh, 2000] here[the_surreal_suicide.htm#p82]) Nevertheless, Hedayat, like Beddoes and HarryCrosby, had a fascination with death, as this prose poem makes clear.“DEATH”SADEGH HEDAYATWhat a sensational and frightening word “death” is! Even mentioning it rends theheart, rubs smiles off of lips and cuts joy to the quick; it brings on dullnessand depression and drives all kinds of troubled thoughts through the mind.Life and death are inseparable. If not for life, there would be no death. Thus,there must be death in order for life to have meaning. Everything, whether thelargest star in the sky or the smallest particle on the earth, will sooner orlater die: stones, plants, animals – they all come into existence and willsuccessively be sent back to the world of inexistence. They will all turn into ahandful of dust and fall into oblivion. However, the earth keeps spinningrecklessly in the endless sky; nature resumes its life on the remains of thedead; the sun shines; the breeze blows; flowers fill the air with theirfragrance; birds sing. All living creatures become excited. The sky smiles; theearth nourishes; the angel of death reaps the harvest of life with her oldsickle… .Death treats all living creatures equally and determines their fatesimpartially. It recognizes neither the rich nor the poor; neither the lowly northe high. It puts human beings, plants and animals next to each other in theirdark graves. It is only in the graveyard where executioners and theblood-thirsty stop acting tyrannically and innocents are not tortured. In thegraveyard there is neither an oppressor nor an oppressed; young and old restpeacefully. What a peaceful and pleasant sleep! One will never see the nextmorning and will never hear the bluster and tumult of life. Death is the besthaven, a refuge from pains, sorrows, sufferings and cruelties. With death thescintillant fire of lust and capriciousness goes out. All wars, disputes andkillings among human beings end and their fierceness, conflicts and self-praisesubside in the depth of cold dark soil and the narrow pass of grave.If death did not exist, everyone would long for it. Cries of despair would riseup to the sky. Everyone would curse nature. How frightening and painful it wouldbe if life were endless. When the hard and arduous test of life extinguishes thebeguiling lights of youth, when the wellspring of kindness dries up, whencoldness, darkness and ugliness befalls us, it is death which remedies thesituation. It is death which puts our bent stature, our wrinkled faces and ourafflicted bodies in their resting places.Oh death, you lessen the sadness and sorrow of life and take its heavy burdenoff our shoulders. You put an end to the misery of wandering, ill-fated andunhappy men. You are the antidote for grief and despair. You make tearful eyesdry. You are like a compassionate mother who embraces and caresses her child andputs him to sleep after a stormy day. You are not like life – bitter and fierce.You do not drag man to aberration and depravity and throw him to a horriblewhirlpool. You laugh at the meanness, lowness, selfishness, stinginess andgreediness of human beings and hide their indecent acts. Who has not drunk yourpoisonous wine? Man has created a terrifying image of you. You, a gloriousangel, are regarded as the raging Devil. Why are they afraid of you? Why do theydouble-cross you and accuse you? You are a shining light, but they take you fordarkness. You are the auspicious angel of kindness, but they mourn loudly whenyou arrive. You are not the messenger of mourning and lamentation.

His familiarity with circus lifeinfluenced his Expressionist, aphoristic style, and Lulu, the centre of his bestworks, is an embodiment of the irrepressible life force.

In pre-WWI England, he, along with otherRussian imports like the Ballet Russe, was something of a craze, and no book wasmore popular than Sanine. A Nietzschean celebration of individuality and sensualfreedom, its eponymous hero jettisons the Slavic gloom that characterizes mostRussian literature, and glories in his own pagan common sense. Several of thecharacters in Sanine kill themselves, and at one point, attending the funeral ofa friend who has shot himself, Sanine remarks impatiently “One more fool gone.”Like Wedekind, in this early work Artzibashev argued against suicide, and at theend of the novel, his hero, leaving behind the failed lives of his fellows,strides forth to meet the world “facing the jocund, lustrous sun … beneath thewide dome of heaven.” Unfortunately, Artzibashev didn’t maintain this optimism,and in later works, suicide wins out; in his next novel, The Breaking Point,practically everyone in it blows his brains out. Here a would-be suicide issaved by a faulty weapon.FROM SANINE (TRANSLATOR PERCY PINKERTON)MICHAEL ARTZIBASHEV“No matter what road I choose nor at what goal I aim, show me the pure andperfect ideal for which it were worth while to die! No, it is not that I amweak; it is because life itself is not worthy of sacrifice nor of enthusiasm.Consequently there is no sense in living at all.”Never before had this conclusion seemed so absolutely convincing to him. On histable lay a revolver, and each time he passed it, while walking up and down, itspolished steel caught his eye.He took it up and examined it carefully. It was loaded. He placed the barrelagainst his temple.“There! Like that!” he thought. “Bang! and it’s all over. Is it a wise or astupid thing to shoot oneself? Is suicide a cowardly act? Then I suppose that Iam a coward!”The contact of the cold steel on his heated brow was at once pleasant andalarming.“What about Sina?” he asked himself. “Ah! Well, I shall never get her, and so Ileave to some one else this enjoyment.” The thought of Sina awoke tendermemories, which he strove to repress as sentimental folly.“Why should I not do it?” His heart seemed to stop beating. Then once more, anddeliberately this time, he put the revolver to his brow and pulled the trigger.His blood ran cold; there was a buzzing in his ears and the room seemed to whirlaround.The weapon did not go off; only the click of the trigger could be heard. Halffainting, his hand dropped to his side. Every fibre within him quivered, hishead swam, his lips were parched, and his hand trembled so much that when helaid down the revolver it rattled against the table.“A fine fellow I am!” he thought as, recovering himself, he went to the glass tosee what he looked like.“Then I’m a coward, am I?” “No,” he thought proudly, “I am not! I did it rightenough. How could I help it if the thing didn’t go off?”*"},{"pageContent":"When George Sterling’s poem A Wine of Wizardry was published in Cosmopolitanmagazine in 1907, it was hailed as the greatest poem ever written by an Americanauthor. Recognized in San Francisco as the “uncrowned king of Bohemia,” Sterlingis little read today, and his name is familiar mostly to fans of Jack London;Sterling was the leader of an artist’s colony in Carmel, California, with whichhis friend London was associated. An intimate of the sardonic Ambrose Bierce andmentor to the poet Robinson Jeffers, Sterling was also an important inspirationfor the third member of the Weird Tales triumvirate, Clark Ashton Smith, whoalong with Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft, were the magazine’s most popularwriters. Sterling’s lush, romantic style did not catch on outside the moreEuropean environs of San Francisco, and although at the Panama-PacificInternational Exposition, his name was carved on the walls along with those of“the immortals,” Sterling never became a national poet. By the 1920s he wasdecidedly passé. Sterling killed himself in 1926, ingesting cyanide in his roomat the San Francisco Bohemian Club; he was fifty-six. According to Kevin Starrin Americans and the Californian Dream 1850–1915 (Oxford Univeristy Press:1986), “When George Sterling’s corpse was discovered in his room at the BohemianClub, the golden age of San Francisco’s bohemia had definitely come to amiserable end.”“OMNIA EXEUNT IN MYSTERIUM”GEORGE STERLINGIThe stranger in my gates – lo! that am I,And what my land of birth I do not know,Nor yet the hidden land to which I go.One may be lord of many ere he die,And tell of many sorrows in one sigh,But know himself he shall not, nor his woe,Nor to what sea the tears of wisdom flow;Nor why one star is taken from the sky.An urging is upon him evermore,And though he bide, his soul is wanderer,Scanning the shadows with a sense of hasteWhere fade the tracks of all who went before –A dim and solitary travellerOn ways that end in evening and the waste.IIHow dumb the vanished billions who have died!With backward gaze conjectural we wait,And ere the invading Shadow penetrate,The echo from a mighty heart that criedIs made a sole memorial to pride.From out that night’s inscrutable estateA few cold voices wander, desolateWith all that love has lost or grief has sighed.Slaves, seamen, captains, councillors and kings,Gone utterly, save for those echoes far!As they before, I tread a forfeit landTill the supreme and ancient silence flingsIts pall between the dreamer and the star.O desert wide! O little grain of sand!IIIAs one that knew not of the sea might comeFrom slender sources of a mountain stream,And, wending where the sandy shallows gleamAnd boulder-strewn the stumbling waters humAnd white with haste the falling torrents drum,Might stand in darkness at the land’s extreme,And stare in doubt, where, ghostly and supreme,Muffled in mist and night, the sea lay dumb, –So shalt thou follow life, a downward rillA-babble as with question and surmise,To wait at last where no star beaconeth,And find the midnight desolate and chill,And face below its indecisive skiesThe Consummation, mystery and death.*"},{"pageContent":"Leo Tolstoy did not kill himself, although his adulterous heroine Anna Kareninafamously did, throwing herself in front of a train, to avoid the complicationsof an affair. Although most readers today find her actions somewhat extreme,Anna’s death ranks with that of Emma Bovary (see below) as one of the greatliterary suicides. Tolstoy did face suicidal urges, though, and in hisexistential work A Confession, he examines the moral vacuum that led him to thebrink of madness. Curiously, it is precisely the emptiness of literary successthat planted the idea of suicide in Tolstoy’s troubled psyche.FROM A CONFESSION (TRANSLATOR AYLMER MAUDE)LEO TOLSTOYSome day I will narrate the touching and instructive history of my life duringthose ten years of my youth[…]I cannot think of those years without horror, loathing, and heartache. I killedmen in war, and challenged men to duels in order to kill them; I lost at cards,consumed the labour of peasants, sentenced then to punishments, lived looselyand deceived people. Lying, robbery, adultery of all kinds, drunkenness,violence, murder – there was no crime I did not commit, and for all that peoplepraised my conduct, and my contemporaries considered and consider me to be acomparatively moral man.So I lived for ten years.During that time I began to write from vanity, covetousness, and pride. In mywritings I did the same as in my life. To get fame and money, for the sake ofwhich I wrote, it was necessary to hide the good and display the evil. And I didso. How often in my writings I contrived to hide under the guise ofindifference, or even of banter, those strivings of mine towards goodness, whichgave meaning to my life!To remember that time, and my own state of mind and that of those men (thoughthere are thousands like them today) [Tolstoy means writers], is sad andterrible and ludicrous, and arouses exactly the feeling one experiences in alunatic asylum.In spite of the fact that I now regarded authorship as of no importance, I yet[…] continued to write. I had already tasted the temptation of authorship: thetemptation of immense monetary rewards and applause for my insignificant work;and I devoted myself to it as a means of improving my material position, and ofstifling in my soul all questions as to the meaning of my own life, or of lifein general […]… but five years ago something very strange began to happen to me. At first Iexperienced moments of perplexity and arrest of life, as though I did not knowwhat to do or how to live; and I felt lost and became dejected. But this passed,and I went on living as before. Then these moments of perplexity began to recuroftener and oftener, and always in the same form. They were always expressed bythe questions: What’s it for? What does it lead to?At first it seemed to me that these were aimless and irrelevant questions. Ithought that it was all well known, and that if I should ever wish to deal withthe solution, it would not cost me much effort […]The questions, however, beganto repeat themselves frequently, and more and more insistently to demand replies[…]That occurred which happens to every one sickening with a mortal internaldisease. At first trivial signs of indisposition appear, to which the sick manpays no attention; then these signs reappear more and more often and merge intoone uninterrupted period of suffering. The suffering increases, and before thesick man can look round, what he took for a mere indisposition has alreadybecome more important to him than anything else in the world – it is death!That is what happened to me […] The questions seemed such stupid, simplechildish questions, but as soon as I touched them and tried to solve them, I atonce became convinced, (1) that they are not childish and stupid but the mostimportant and profound of life’s questions; and (2) that, try as I would, Icould not solve them. Before occupying myself with my estate, the education ofmy son, or the writing of a book, I had to know why I was doing it. As long as Idid not know why, I could do nothing, and could not live … when thinking of thefame my works would bring me, I said to myself, “Very well; you will be morefamous than Gogol or Pushkin or Shakespeare or Molière, or that all the writersin the world – and what of it?” […]I felt that what I had been standing on had collapsed, and that I had nothingleft under my feet […]The truth was that life is meaningless. I had, as it were, […]come to aprecipice and saw clearly that there was nothing ahead of me but destruction […]there was nothing ahead but suffering and real death – complete annihilation.It had come to this, that I, a healthy, fortunate man, felt that I could nolonger live: some irresistible power impelled me to rid myself one way or otherof life. I cannot say I wished to kill myself. The power which drew me away fromlife was stronger, fuller, and more widespread that any mere wish […] All mystrength drew me away from life. The thought of self-destruction now came to meas naturally as thoughts of how to improve my life had come formerly. And it wasseductive that I had to be wily with myself lest I should carry it out toohastily […] it was then that I, a man favoured by fortune, hid a cord frommyself, lest I should hang myself from the cross-piece of the partition in myroom; and I ceased to go out shooting with a gun, lest I should be tempted by soeasy a way of ending my life […]My mental condition presented itself to me in this way: my life is a stupid andspiteful joke someone has played on me […] I was only surprised that I couldhave avoided understanding this from the very beginning – Today or tomorrowsickness and death will come (they had come already) to those I love or to me;nothing will remain but stench and worms. Sooner or later my affairs, whateverthey may be, will be forgotten, and I shall not exist. Then why go on making anyeffort? […] One can only live while one is intoxicated with life; as soon as oneis sober it is impossible not to see that it is all a mere fraud and a stupidfraud![…] I was like one lost in a wood who, horrified at having lost his way, rushesabout, wishing to find the road. He knows that each step he takes confuses himmore and more; but still he cannot help rushing about.It was terrible indeed. And to rid myself of the terror I wished to kill myself[…] The horror of darkness was too great, and I wished to free myself from it asquickly as possible by noose or bullet. That was the feeling which drew me moststrongly to suicide.I found that for people of my circle there were four ways out of the terribleposition in which we are all placed.The first was that of ignorance. In consists in not knowing, not understanding,that life is an evil and an absurdity […]The second way out is Epicureanism. It consists, while knowing the hopelessnessof life, in making use meanwhile of the advantages one has […]The third escape is that of strength and energy. It consists, when one hasunderstood that life is an evil and an absurdity, in destroying life. A fewexceptionally strong and consistent people act so. Having understood thestupidity of the joke that has been played on them, and having understood thatit is better to be dead that to be alive, and that it is best of all not toexist, they act accordingly and promptly end this stupid joke, since there aremeans: a rope around one’s neck, water, a knife to stick into one’s heart, orthe trains on the railways; and the number of those of our circle who act inthis way becomes greater and greater, and for the most part they act so at thebest time of their life, when the strength of their mind is in full bloom, andfew habits degrading man’s mind have as yet been acquired.The fourth way out is that of weakness. It consists in seeing the truth of thesituation, and yet clinging to life, knowing in advance that nothing can come ofit. People of this kind know that death is better than life, but, not having thestrength to act rationally […] they seem to wait for something […]I found myselfin that category […]This was repulsive to me and tormenting, but I remained inthat position …*"},{"pageContent":"The Irish-Greek-American-and naturalized Japanese writer Lafcadio Hearn is oneof the great eccentrics of literature. Starting out as a tabloid journalistspecializing in the sensational and macabre in cities like Cincinnati and NewOrleans, Hearn later went to Japan on assignment, and wound up staying, becomingthe nation’s official spokesman to the West. In this excerpt, Hearn shows thatthe kind of Liebstodt we associate with Wagnerian excess is not foreign to thepsyche of the Far East.FROM “THE RED BRIDAL”LAFCADIO HEARNFalling in love at first sight is less common in Japan than in the West; partlybecause of the peculiar constitution of Eastern society, and partly because muchsorrow is prevented by early marriages which parents arrange. Love suicides, onthe other hand, are not infrequent; but they have the particularity of beingnearly always double. Moreover, they must be considered, in the majority ofinstances, the results of improper relationships. Still, there are honest andbrave exceptions; and these occur usually in country districts. The love in sucha tragedy may have evolved suddenly out of the most innocent and naturalboy-and-girl friendship, and may have a history dating back to the childhood ofthe victims. But even then there remains a very curious difference between aWestern double suicide for love and a Japanese joshi. The Oriental suicide isnot the result of a blind, quick frenzy of pain. It is not only cool andmethodical: it is sacramental. It involves a marriage of which the certificateis death. The twain pledge themselves to each other in the presence of the gods,write their farewell letters, and die. No pledge can be more pro-found andsacred that this. And therefore, if it should happen that, by sudden outsideinterference and by medical skill, one of the pair is snatched from death, thatone is bound by the most solemn obligation of love and honour to cast away lifeat the first possible opportunity. Of course, if both are saved, all may gowell. But it were better to commit any crime of violence punishable with half ahundred years of state prison than to become known as a man who, after pledginghis faith to die with a girl, had left her to travel to the Meido alone. Thewoman who should fail in her vow might be partially forgiven; but the man whosurvived a joshi through interference, and allowed himself to live on becausehis purpose was once frustrated, would be regarded all his mortal days as aperjurer, a murderer, a bestial coward, a disgrace to human nature.*"},{"pageContent":"Werthermania understandably provoked a backlash.

Not onlybecause the two main characters, Kirilov and Stavrogin, both kill themselves,but because their suicides are embedded in a profound meditation on the dangersand responsibility of human freedom. In these excerpts, Kirilov tries toelucidate how his suicide is an expression of his free will, and Stavrogin’s‘Confession’ shows how the abyss of freedom can lead a man to the saintly or thedemonic.FROM THE POSSESSED (TRANSLATOR CONSTANCE GARNETT)FYODOR DOSTOYEVSKY“You still have the same intentions?” Stavrogin asked after a moment’s silence,and with a certain wariness.“Yes,” answered Kirilov shortly, guessing at once from his voice what he wasasking about, and he began taking the weapons from the table.“When?” Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch inquired still more cautiously, after a pause.In the meantime Kirilov had put both boxes back in the trunk, and sat down athis place again.“That doesn’t depend on me, as you know – when they tell me,” he muttered, asthough disliking; but at the same time with evident readiness to answer anyother question. He kept his black, lustreless eyes fixed continually onStavrogin with a calm but warm and kindly expression in them.“I understand shooting oneself, of course,” Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch begansuddenly, frowning a little, after a dreamy silence lasted three minutes. “Isometimes have the thought of it myself, and then there always came a new idea:if one did something wicked, or worse still, something shameful, that is,disgraceful, only very shameful and … ridiculous, such as people would rememberfor a thousand years and hold in scorn for a thousand years, and suddenly thethought comes: ‘One blow in the temple and there would be nothing more.’ Onewouldn’t care then for men and that they would hold one in scorn for a thousandyears, would one?”“You call that a new idea?” said Kirilov, after a moment’s thought.“I … didn’t call it so, but when I thought it I felt it was a new idea.”“You ‘felt the idea’?” observed Kirilov. “That’s good. There are lots of ideasthat are always there and yet suddenly become new. That’s true. I see a greatdeal now as though it were for the first time.”“Supposed you had lived in the moon,” Stavrogin interrupted, not listening, butpursuing his own thought, “and suppose there you had done all these nasty andridiculous things […] You know from here for certain they will laugh at you andhold you in scorn for a thousand years as long as the moon lasts. But now youare here, looking at the moon from here. You don’t care here for anything you’vedone there, and that the people there will hold you in scorn for a thousandyears, do you?”“I don’t know,” answered Kirilov. “I’ve not been in the moon,” he added, withoutirony, simply to state the fact.“Whose baby was that just now?”“The old woman’s mother-in-law is here – no, daughter-in-law, it’s all the same.Three days. She’s lying ill with the baby, it cries a lot at night, it’s thestomach. The mother sleeps, but the old woman picks it up; I play ball with it.The ball’s from Hamburg. I bought it in Hamburg to throw and catch, itstrengthens the spine. It’s a girl.”“Are you fond of children?”“I am,” answered Kirilov, though rather indifferently.“Then, you’re fond of life?”“Yes, I’m fond of life! What of it?”“Though you’ve made up your mind to shoot yourself!”“What of it? Why connect it? Life’s one thing and that’s another. Life exists,but death doesn’t at all.“You’ve begun to believe in a future eternal life?”“No, not in a future eternal life, but in eternal life here. There are moments,you reach moments, and time suddenly stands still, and it will become eternal.”“You hope to reach such a moment?”“Yes.”“That’ll scarcely be possible in our time,” Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch respondedslowly and, as it were, dreamily; the two spoke without the slightest irony. “Inthe Apocalypse the angel swears that there will be no more time.”“I know. That’s very true; distinct and exact. When all mankind attainshappiness then there will be no more time, for there’ll be no need of it – avery true thought.”“Where will they put it?”“Nowhere. Time’s not an object but an idea. It will be extinguished in themind.”“The old commonplaces of philosophy, the same from the beginning of time,”Stavrogin muttered with a kind of disdainful compassion.“Always the same, always the same, from the beginning of time, and never anyother,” Kirilov said with sparkling eyes, as though there were almost a triumphin that idea.“You seem to be very happy, Kirilov.”“Yes, very happy,” he answered, as though making the most ordinary reply.“But you were so distressed lately, angry with Liputin.”“H’m … I’m not scolding now. I didn’t know then that I was happy. Have you seena leaf, a leaf from a tree?”“Yes.”“I saw a yellow one lately, a little green. It was decayed at the edges. It wasblown by the wind. When I was ten years old I used to shut my eyes in the winteron purpose and fancy a green leaf, bright, with veins on it, and the sunshining. I used to open my eyes and not believe them, because it was very nice,and I used to shut them again.”“What’s that? An allegory?”“N-no … why? I’m not speaking of an allegory, but of a leaf, only a leaf. Theleaf is good. Everything’s good.”“Everything?”“Everything. Man is unhappy because he doesn’t know he’s happy. It’s only that.That’s all, that’s all! If anyone finds out he’ll become happy at once, thatminute. The mother-in-law will die, but the baby will remain. It’s all good. Idiscovered it all of a sudden.”“And if anyone dies of hunger, and if anyone insults and outrages the littlegirl, is that good?”“Yes! And if anyone blows his brains out for the baby, that’s good too. And ifanyone doesn’t, that’s good too. It’s all good, all. It’s good for all those whoknow that its all good. If they knew that it was good for them, it would be goodfor them, but as long as they don’t know it’s good for them, it will be bad forthem. That’s the whole idea, the whole if it.”“When did you find out you were so happy?”“Last week, on Tuesday – no, Wednesday, for it was Wednesday by that time, inthe night.”“By what reasoning?”“I don’t remember; I was walking about the room; never mind. I stopped my clock.It was thirty-seven minutes past two.”*“Kirilov, I’ve never been able to understand why you mean to kill yourself. Ionly know it’s from conviction … strong conviction. But if you feel a yearningto express yourself, so to say, I am at your service […] Only you must think ofthe time.”“What time is it?”“Oh oh, just two.” Pyotr Stepanovitch looked at his watch and lighted acigarette.“It seems we can come to terms after all,” he reflected.“I’ve nothing to say to you,” muttered Kirilov.“I remember that something about God comes into it […] you explained it to meonce – twice, in fact. If you shoot yourself, you become God; that’s it, isn’tit?”“Yes, I become God.”Pyotr Stepanovitch did not even smile; he waited. Kirilov looked at him subtly.“You are a political impostor and intriguer. You want to lead me on intophilosophy and enthusiasm and to bring about a reconciliation so as to dispersemy anger, and then, when I am reconciled with you, beg from me a note to say Ikilled Shatov.”Pyotr Stepanovitch answered with almost natural frankness.“Well, supposing I am such a scoundrel. But at the last moments, does thatmatter to you, Kirilov? What are we quarrelling about? Tell me, please. You areone sort of man and I am another – what of it? And what’s more, we are both ofus…”“Scoundrels.”“Yes, scoundrels if you like. But you know that that’s only words.”“All my life I wanted it not to be only words. I lived because I did not want itto be. Even now every day I want it to be not words.”“Well, everyone seeks to be where he is best off. The fish … that is, everyoneseeks his own comfort, that’s all. That’s been a commonplace for ages and ages.”“Comfort, do you say?”“Oh, it’s not worth while quarrelling over words.”“No, you were right in what you said; let it be comfort. God is necessary and somust exist.”“Well, that’s all right, then.”“But I know He doesn’t and can’t.”“That’s more likely.”“Surely you must understand that a man with two such ideas can’t go on living?”“Must shoot himself, you mean?”“Surely you must understand that one might shoot oneself for that alone? Youdon’t understand that there may be one man, one man out of your thousands ofmillions, one man who won’t bear it and does not want to.”“All I understand is that you seem to be hesitating […]That’s very bad.”*“If there is no God, then I am God.”“There, I could never understand that point of yours: why are you God?”“If God exists, all is His will and from His will I cannot escape. If not, it’sall my will and I am bound to show my self-will.”“Self-will? But why are you bound?”“Because all will has become mine. Can it be that no one in the whole planet,after making an end of God and believing in his own will, will dare to expresshis self-will on the most vital point? It’s like a beggar inheriting a fortuneand being afraid of it and not daring to approach the bag of gold, thinkinghimself too weak to own it. I want to manifest my self-will. I may be the onlyone, but I’ll do it.”“Do it by all means.”“I am bound to shoot myself because the highest point of my self-will is to killmyself with my own hands.”“But you won’t be the only one to kill yourself; there are lots of suicides.”“With good cause. But to do it without any cause at all, simply for self-will, Iam the only one.”“He won’t shoot himself,” flashed across Pyotr Stepanovitch’s mind again.“Do you know,” he observed irritably, “if I were in your place I should killsomeone else to show my self-will, not myself. You might be of use. I’ll tellyou whom, if you are not afraid. Then you needn’t shoot yourself today, perhaps.We may come to terms.”“To kill someone would be the lowest point of self-will, and you show your wholesoul in that. I am not you: I want the highest point and I’ll kill myself.”*"},{"pageContent":"FROM “STAVROGIN’S CONFESSION”I’ve tried my strength everywhere. You advised me to do this “that I might learnto know myself.” As long as I was experiencing for myself and for others itseemed infinite, as it has all my life. Before your eyes I endured a blow fromyour brother; I acknowledged my marriage in public. But to what to apply mystrength, that is what I’ve never seen, and do not see now in spite of all yourpraises […] I am still capable, as I always was, of desiring to do somethinggood, and of feeling pleasure from it; at the same time I desire evil and feelpleasure from that too. But both feelings are always too petty, and are neververy strong. My desires are too weak; they are not enough to guide me. On a logone may cross a river but not on a chip […]As always I blame no one. I’ve tried the depths of debauchery and wasted mystrength over it. But I don’t like vice and I didn’t want it […]. One may argueabout everything endlessly, but from me nothing has come but negation, with nogreatness of soul, no force. Even negation has not come from me. Everything hasalways been petty and spiritless. Kirilov, in the greatness of his soul, couldnot compromise with an idea, and shot himself; but I see, of course, that he wasgreat-souled because he had lost his reason. I can never lose my reason, and Ican never believe in an idea to such a degree as he did. I cannot even beinterested in an idea to such a degree […]I know I ought to kill myself, to brush myself off the earth like a nastyinsect; but I am afraid of suicide, for I am afraid of showing greatness ofsoul. I know that it will be another sham again – the last deception in anendless series of deceptions. What good is there in deceiving oneself? Simply toplay at greatness of soul? Indignation and shame I can never feel, therefore notdespair […]In Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch’s wing of the house all the doors were open and hewas nowhere to be seen.“Wouldn’t he be upstairs?”It was remarkable that several servants followed Varvara Petrovna while theothers all stood waiting in the drawing room. They would never have dared tocommit such a breach of etiquette before. Varara Petrovna saw it and saidnothing.They went upstairs. There, there were three rooms; but they found no one there.“Wouldn’t his honour have gone up there?” someone suggested, pointing to thedoor of the loft. And in fact, the door of the loft which was always closed hadbeen opened and was standing ajar. The loft was right under the roof and wasreached by a long, very steep and narrow wooden ladder. There was a sort oflittle room up there too.“I am not going up there. Why should he go up there?” said Varvara Petrovna,turning terribly pale as she looked at the servants. They gazed back at her andsaid nothing. Dasha was trembling.Varvara Petrovna rushed up the ladder; Dasha followed, but she had hardlyentered the loft when she uttered a scream and fell senseless.Stavrogin was hanging there behind the door. On the table lay a piece of paperwith the words in pencil: “No one is to blame, I did it myself.” Beside it onthe table lay a hammer, a piece of soap, and a large nail – obviously an extraone in case of need. The strong silk cord upon which Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch hadhanged himself had evidently been chosen and prepared beforehand and was thicklysmeared with soap. Everything proved that there had been premeditation andconsciousness up to the last moment.At the inquest our doctors absolutely and emphatically rejected all idea ofinsanity.”*"},{"pageContent":"Although Schopenhauer argued that life was a tremendous mistake, he did notpromote suicide, and he himself enjoyed a rather comfortable existence. Here hetakes argument with the idea that suicide should be considered a crime. It is,he feels, although inadvisable in most instances, rather an understandableblunder.ON SUICIDEARTHUR SCHOPENHAUERAs far as I know, none but the votaries of the monotheistic, that is, Jewish,religions look upon suicide as a crime. This is all the more striking, inasmuchas neither in the Old nor in the New Testament is there to be found anyprohibition or positive disapproval of it; so the religious teachers are forcedto base their condemnations of suicide on philosophical grounds of their owninvention. These are so very bad that writers of this kind endeavour to make upfor the weakness of their arguments by the strong terms in which they expresstheir abhorrence of the practice; in other words, the declaim against it. Theytell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice; that only a madmancould be guilty of it; and other insipidities of the same kind; or else theymake the nonsensical remark that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious thatthere is nothing in the world which every man has a more unassailable title tothan his own life and person.Suicide is actually accounted a crime; and a crime which, especially under thevulgar bigotry that prevails in England, is followed by an ignominious burialand the seizure of the man’s property; and for that reason, in a case ofsuicide, the jury almost always brings in a verdict of insanity. Now let thereader’s own moral feeling decide as to whether or not suicide is a criminalact. Think of the impression that would be made upon you by the news thatsomeone you know has committed the crime, say, of murder or theft, or beenguilty of some act of cruelty or deception; and compare it with your feelingswhen you hear that he has met a voluntary death. While in the one case a livelysense of indignation and extreme resentment will be aroused, and you will callloudly for punishment or revenge, in the other you will be moved to grief andsympathy; and mingled with your thoughts will be admiration for his courage,rather than the moral disapproval which follows upon a wicked action. Who hasnot had acquaintances, friends, relations, who of their own free will have leftthis world; and are these to be thought of with horror as criminals?I am of the opinion that the clergy should be challenged to explain what rightthey have to go into the pulpit, or take up their pens, and stamp as a crime anaction which many men whom we hold in affection and honour have committed; andto refuse an honourable burial to those who relinquish this world voluntarily.They have no Biblical authority to boast of, justifying their condemnation ofsuicide; nay, not even any philosophical arguments that will hold water; and itmust be understood that it is arguments we want, and that we will not be put offwith mere phrases or words of abuse. If the criminal law forbids suicide, thatis not an argument valid in the Church; and besides, the prohibition isridiculous, for what penalty can frighten a man who is not afraid of deathitself? If the law punishes people for trying to commit suicide, it is punishingthe want of skill that makes the attempt a failure […][…] The only valid moral argument against suicide is that it thwarts theattainment of the highest moral aim by substituting an apparent release fromthis world of misery for a real one. But from a mistake to a crime is a far cry;and it is as a crime that the clergy of Christendom wish us to regard suicide.The kernel of Christianity is the truth that suffering – the Cross – is the trueend and object of life. Hence Christianity condemns suicide as thwarting thisend; whilst the ancient world, taking a lower point of view, held it inapproval, in honour. But if that is to be accounted a valid reason againstsuicide, it involves the recognition of asceticism; that is to say, it is validonly from a much higher ethical standpoint than has ever been adopted by moralphilosophers of Europe. If we abandon that high standpoint, there is no tenablemoral reason left for condemning suicide. The extraordinary energy and zeal withwhich the clergy attack suicide is not supported by either any passages in theBible or by any considerations of weight; so it looks as though they must havesome secret reason for their contention. May it not be that the voluntarysurrender of life is a bad compliment for him who said that all things weregood? If so, this offers another instance of the crass optimism of thesereligions, denouncing suicide to escape being denounced by it.It will generally be found that as soon as the terrors of life outweigh those ofdeath, a man will put an end to his life. But the terrors of death offerconsiderable resistance; they stand like a sentinel at the gate leading out ofthis world. Perhaps no man alive would not have already put an end to his, ifthis end was of a purely negative character, a sudden halt to existence. Thereis something positive to it; it is the destruction of the body; and a manshrinks from this, because his body is the manifestation of the will to live.Yet the struggle with that sentinel is, as a rule, not as hard as it may seemfrom a long way off, mainly because of the antagonism between the ills of thebody and the ills of the mind. If we are in great bodily pain, or the pain lastsa long time, we become indifferent to other troubles; all we think about isgetting well. In the same way great mental suffering makes us insensible tobodily pain; we despise it; if it should outweigh the other, it distracts ourthoughts, and we welcome it as a pause in our mental suffering. It is thisfeeling that makes suicide easy; for the bodily pain accompanying it loses allsignificance in the eyes of one who is tortured by an excess of mentalsuffering. This is especially evident in the case of those who are driven tosuicide by some morbid and exaggerated ill-humour […].Suicide may also be regarded as an experiment, a question which man puts toNature […] What change will death produce in a man’s existence and in hisinsight into the nature of things? It is a clumsy experiment, for it requiresthe destruction of the very consciousness which asks the question and awaits theanswer.*L. H. Myers is best known, and that by only a few, for his masterpiece The Rootand the Flower, a trilogy of novels set in an imaginary Medieval India, butwhich is really a philosophical and ethical indictment of early twentiethcentury England, specifically of the Bloomsbury set, through which he movedbriefly and with much disdain. Myers was born in 1881 into a distinguishedfamily. His father, the poet and scholar F.W. Myers, was one of the foundingmembers of the Society for Psychical Research; the author of the monumentalHuman Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death, he is also responsible forthe word ‘telepathy’. As a boy L.H. Myers attended some of the séances conductedat the Myers household, and, along with a financial bequest, Myers inherited hisfather’s passion for the spiritual and metaphysical. F.W. Myers’ own interest inthe afterlife may have been prompted by his love for his cousin’s wife, whocommitted suicide; there is some suspicion that Myers senior’s own death was insome way ‘willed’, in order for him to unite with his lost love. L.H. Myers wasa contradictory personality. Although his novels are characterized by an extremeethical fastidiousness and ascetic sensibility (one of his few literary friendswas the novelist David Lindsay, whose fantastic A Voyage to Arcturus displays asimilar outlook) Myers himself was an incorrigible womaniser; and although inhis last years he committed himself to Communism, he maintained a substantialinterest in a successful expensive French restaurant, Boulestins. Myers had abelief in the transcendental, but also a taste for racing. These contradictionstook their toll, and Myers’ view of society, depicted in a sociological analysiswhich he destroyed before his death, along with an autobiographical work, was asunforgiving as his insight into himself. “Why should anyone want to go on livingonce they know what the world is like?” he asked. Myers answered that query on 7April 1944 when, like Witkacy, fearing the coming collapse of westerncivilization, he took an overdose of sleeping pills. This extract from his earlyeccentric novel The Orissers, although not directly about suicide, displays thekind of unblinking self-analysis that eventually led Myers’ to his destruction.FROM THE ORISSERSL. H. MYERSEach one of us has a fixed, unconscious notion of what constitutes hischaracter, and is prevented from carrying into effect the behests of hisimagination, by an irrational, but compelling instinct to conform with thataccepted idea of himself. This compulsion is strongest when intimates arepresent. The unfortunate ego, partly in deference to the suggestion of others,and partly in self-protection against them, has encrusted itself in a hardshell. It has made public profession of a certain ‘character’, which its mannerand behaviour are constrained to illustrate. This is its response to a need toexhibit a definite outline, by which its fellow creatures shall recognize it;but it is also – and, alas, more urgently still! – a response to its own need topossess a form by which it shall recognize itself.In the conduct of everyday life each one of us like to refer to some fairlywell-defined conception of his own character in order to decide without troublewhat to do, what to say, and even what to think. We require some rule of thumbin our current self-manifestations; for a perpetual effort of choice would be anintolerable burden. Do we not all habitually repose with a sense of satisfactionupon what we take to be our fixed characteristics – upon the supposedly fatalelement within us? And of those given characteristics are not even the mosttrifling our pride? “Yes,” we reflect with complacency, “I’m like that. It isstrange; but that’s what I always am.” What pride in discovering in themalleable substance of ourselves some streak supposedly resistant – somethingirresponsible, something demonic, something which the reason cannot coerce, northe consciousness incorporate, something genuine, in fact – in the sense ofbeing spontaneous, self-existent, and inevitable – when all the rest of the poorlittle personality is a make-up, in which the only inevitabilities are thoseimposed by helplessness.Man, then, assumes a character, and, having done so, can let the character-partplay itself. But this sacrifice of variability has its disadvantages. Thecharacter develops at the expense of the perceptions and the imagination. Theyoung man is apt to feel at times that he is investing himself in habilimentswhich cramp him. He would fain throw them off; but almost irresistible is theforce of precedent; that is, the force of interior and exterior expectation.Besides it is only in moments of unusual excitation that the ego gathers theenergy to rebel. For the most part it prefers to take its ease in an inertillustration of the public personality, which has, indeed, become “a secondnature.”*"},{"pageContent":"As noted, the Portuguese poet and novelist Mário De Sá-Carneiro killed himselfat the age of 26, taking a massive dose of strychnine in a small room in Paris.It was a painful and ignominious end, a far cry from the kind of fulfilmentSá-Carneiro envisions death to be in much of his fiction. It was also somethingthe ill-fated poet had been moving toward almost inexorably. For most of hisshort life, suicide was not far from Sá-Carneiro’s mind. This is understandable;while still at school, Sá-Carneiro’s best friend blew his brains out in front ofthe class. Both boys shared the loss of their mother at an early age, and theabsence of an emotional ballast – hardly compensated for by an over-anxiousnanny and an absent affluent father – led Sá-Carneiro to see himself as aperpetual outsider, forever waiting for life to “turn up.” Sadly, it never did,and even leaving Lisbon for Paris, the cultural capital of the world, did littleto relieve Sá-Carneiro’s sense of crushing ennui. When his father married anex-prostitute and, because of his extravagant life-style, was forced to cut offthe allowance that allowed his world-weary son to remain in Paris, the thoughtof returning to provincial Lisbon proved too much. Sá-Carneiro had invited afriend to witness his last moments, but the poet’s screams sent him out insearch of a doctor. As it was for his friend, Fernando Pessoa, madness was aconstant preoccupation for Sá-Carneiro, and his work almost overwhelms with afeverish, delirious intensity. Paradoxes abound. Pessoa described him as a “sanemadman,” and Sá-Carneiro himself spoke of his “healthy morbidity” and oncecomplained that he was “dying of starvation, of excess.” Wedding over-ripefin-de-siècle decadence with Futurist speed and brutality, Sá-Carneiro createdan idiosyncratic prose, that rushes headlong into what he called “the GreatShadow.”"},{"pageContent":"FROM THE GREAT SHADOW (TRANSLATOR MARGARET JULL COSTA)MÁRIO DE SÁ-CARNEIROThe artist often considered suicide, as a cure for his anxiety. And then hewould be torn apart by an infinite tenderness, a limitless pity for himself. Didhe really have to destroy himself? Yes, it was perhaps his only salvation. Howsad! And he imagined himself as someone crossing a bridge carrying a preciousbundle which, when he was already close to his destination, he had to throw intothe river in a final gesture of despair, since he lacked the strength to carryit any further.He had more than once decided, positively decided, to put a bullet through hisheart. He had even got as far as buying a gun. In the end, though, at least upuntil now, he had always given up the idea with a feeling of great joy, a joythat soon dissipated: even if he didn’t commit suicide, he would have to die oneday. If only not committing suicide could save him from death …*"},{"pageContent":"As mentioned earlier, Emma Bovary’s death so impressed the translator EleanorMarx that she committed suicide in the same way. Yet the idea may not have beenher own. When she discovered that her lover Edward Aveling had secretly marrieda young actress, in response to her distress, he proposed a suicide pact, which,however, he had no intention of honouring. Yet the idea appealed to the romanticEleanor, and Aveling even went so far as to procure the prussic acid she usedfor her. Aveling was rightly castigated for his actions, yet no legal chargeswere made against him, although it seems clear that this was some form ofmanslaughter, if not murder. What is surprising is that a reader of Flaubert’swrenching account of Emma Bovary’s last minutes should be prompted to followsuit. Perhaps no other depiction of suicide presents its results in suchmeticulous and off-putting detail.FROM MADAME BOVARYGUSTAVE FLAUBERT“Ah, now it is beginning!” she murmured.“What do you say?”She rolled her head with a gentle movement full of anguish, at the same timecontinually opening her jaws as though there had been something very heavypressing down upon her tongue. At eight o’clock the vomiting recommenced.Charles noticed that there was at the bottom of the basin a sort of white grit,attached to the sides of the porcelain.“It is extraordinary! It is most peculiar!” he repeated.But she said in a loud voice:“No, you are mistaken!”Thereupon, softly and almost like a caress, he passed his hand over her body.She uttered a piercing scream. He started back, terrified.Then she began to groan, feebly at first. A deep shudder shook her shoulders,and she became paler than the sheet in which her nervous fingers were buryingthemselves. Her irregular pulse was now almost imperceptible.Drops of sweat oozed over her bluish face, which seemed as it were congealed inthe exhalation of a metallic vapour. Her teeth chattered, her eyes, grownlarger, gazed vaguely around her, and to every question she only replied bynodding her head; two or three times he even smiled. Little by little her groansbecame louder. A hollow shriek escaped her; she maintained that she was better,and that she would get up very soon. But convulsions seized her; she cried out:“Ah! It is cruel, my God!”He threw himself upon his knees by the bedside.“Speak! What have you eaten? Answer, in Heaven’s name!”And he looked at her with eyes of tenderness such as she had never seen.“Ah, well, there … there!” she said, in a failing voice.He sprang to the writing desk, broke the seal, and read aloud: “Let no one beaccused …” He stopped, passed his hand over his eyes, and read over again.“What! … Help! Help!”And he could only repeat the one word: “Poisoned! Poisoned!” …**********“Do not weep!” she said to him. “Soon I shall no longer torment you!”“Why? What has driven you to it?”She answered:“It had to be, my dear.”“Were you not happy? Is it my fault? I have done all I could…!”“Yes … that is true … you are kind, you!”And she passed her fingers through his hair slowly. The sweetness of thissensation placed an additional burden on his grief; he felt his whole existencecrumbling with despair at the thought that he must lose her at the moment when,on the contrary, she was confessing for him more love than ever before; and hecould think of nothing to do; he did not know, did not dare, the urgency of animmediate decision completing his confusion.She had done, she reflected, with all the betrayals, the meannesses and thenumberless longings that had been wont to torture her. She hated no one now; atwilit chaos fell over her mind, and of all the sounds of earth Emma heard nolonger any save the intermittent lamentation of that poor soul, gentle andindistinct like the last echo of a symphony that is dying away.**********It was not long before she began to vomit blood. Her lips became more tightlycompressed. Her limbs fidgeted restlessly, her body was covered with brownspots, and her pulse slipped under the fingers like a tightly stretched thread,like a harp-string about the snap.Next she began to scream horribly; she cursed the poison, abused it, besought itto make haste, and with her stiffened arms pushed away everything that Charles,in an agony greater than her own, strove to make her drink […]Her chest began immediately to heave rapidly. The whole tongue protruded fromher mouth; her eyes, as they rolled about, grew pale like two globes of a dyinglamp, till she might have been thought already dead had it not been for thefrightful acceleration in the movement of her ribs, which were shaken by afurious breathing, as if the soul were making leaps to set itself free. Félicitéknelt before the crucifix, and the chemist himself wavered a little on his legs,while M. Canivet looked vaguely out of the window into the square. Bouornisienhad again fallen to praying, his face bowed over the edge of the bed, and hislong, black cassock dragging behind him on the floor of the room. Charles was atthe other side, on his knees, with his arms stretched out towards Emma. He hadtaken her hands and was pressing them, as at each beat of heart they gave a jumplike the rebound of a falling ruin. As the death-rattle grew louder, the priestquickened his prayers; they mingled with Bovary’s stifled sobs, and sometimeseverything seemed to be lost in the dull murmur of the Latin words, whichsounded like the tolling of a death-knell.Suddenly there was heard on the pavement outside a noise of heavy wooden shoes,together with the scraping sound of a stick; and a voice came up, a hoarsevoice, that was singing:“Souvent la chaleur d’un beau jourFait rêver fillette à l’amour.”Emma raised herself like a corpse that is galvanized, her hair in disorder, thepupils of her eyes fixed, and dilated wide.“Pour amasser dilieimmentLes épis que la faux moissone,Ma Nanette va s’inclinantVers le sillion qui nous les donne.”“The blind man!” she cried.And Emma burst into laughter, cruel, frantic, despairing laughter, fancying thatshe could see the hideous face of the poor wretch standing out in the eternaldarkness like a crowning terror.“Il soufflé bien fort ce-jour-làEt le jupon courts’envola!”A convulsion flung her back on the mattress. All around her drew near. She hadceased to exist.*"},{"pageContent":"Like Schopenhauer, the Romanian philosopher Emile Cioran held a highlypessimistic view of human life, something that can be gleaned from the titles ofhis lucid, aphoristic works, for instance On the Heights of Despair, A ShortHistory of Decay and The Trouble with Being Born. Although suicide preoccupieshis reflections, Cioran himself did not indulge in it; his reasons forabstaining may be detected in the brief selection below. A resident of Parisfrom the late 1940s, Cioran moved among its literary and artistic figures,becoming friends with many of them, including the poet Paul Celan. A fellowRomanian, Celan lost his parents to the Nazi death camps and was himself sent toa labour camp for eighteen months. His most famous poem, “Death Fugue,” depictsin cryptic brevity the horrors inflicted on those of his and his parentsgeneration. Celan came to prominence in the 1950s, his poetry providing anunflinching insight into the dark side of history. Celan’s own psyche wasunderstandably shaken by his experiences, and when he was accused of plagiarismby the wife of the German poet Yvan Goll, he suffered a nervous breakdown. Inthe 1960s his depression and paranoia increased, and after attacks on his wife,Celan spent a month in a psychiatric hospital. A great reader of the philosopherMartin Heidegger, who never apologized for his own involvement with Nazism,after the two met Heidegger is reported to have said “Celan is sick –hopelessly.” He became suicidal and threw himself into the Seine on 7 April1970. Cioran claims that he ran into Celan just before he killed himself, andtried to cheer him up. If true, there is an irony here of mythic proportions:not only is Cioran an unlikely candidate to cheer anyone up, in his early,Romanian years, he briefly espoused an admiration for the Nazi ‘experiment’,although, unlike Heidegger, he later renounced his naïve enthusiasm.E.

The man seemed to observe me narrowly; but ifhe did, I managed my voice and countenance, so as to deceive him. The day thatrequired my attendance at the bar of the House, being not yet come, and about aweek distant, I kept my bottle close in my side-pocket, resolved to use it whenI should be convinced there was no other way of escaping. This, indeed, seemedevident already; but I was willing to allow myself every possible chance of thatsort, and to protract the horrid execution of my purpose, till the last moment;but Satan was impatient of delay.The day before the period above mentioned arrived, being at Richard’scoffee-house at breakfast, I read the newspaper, and in it a letter, which thefurther I perused it, the more closely engaged my attention […] The authorappeared to be acquainted with my purpose of self-destruction, and to havewritten the letter on purpose to secure and hasten the execution of it. My mind,probably, at this time, began to be disordered; however it was, I was certainlygiven up to a strong delusion. I said within myself, ‘your cruelty shall begratified; you shall have your revenge!’ and, flinging down the paper, in a fitof strong passion, I rushed hastily out of the room; directing my way to thefields, where I intended to find some house to die in; or, if not, determined topoison myself in a ditch […]Before I had walked a mile […] a thought struck me that I might yet spare mylife; that I had nothing to do, but to sell what I had […] go on board a ship,and transport myself to France […] Not a little pleased with this expedient, Ireturned to my chambers to pack up all that I could at so short a notice; butwhile I was looking over my portmanteau, my mind changed again; and self-murderwas recommended to me once more in all its advantages.Not knowing where to poison myself, for I was liable to continual interruptionin my chambers from my laundress and her husband, I laid aside that intention,and resolved upon drowning. For that purpose I immediately took a coach, andordered the man to drive to Tower wharf; intending to throw myself into theriver from the Custom House quay […] I left the coach upon the Tower wharf,intending never to return to it; but upon coming to the quay, I found the waterlow, and a porter seated upon some goods there, as if on purpose to prevent me.This passage to the bottomless pit being mercifully shut against me, I returnedback to the coach, and ordered it to the Temple. I drew up the shutters, oncemore had recourse to the laudanum, and determined to drink it off directly; butGod ordained otherwise. A conflict, that shook me to pieces, suddenly tookplace; not properly a trembling, but a convulsive agitation, which deprived mein a manner of the use of my limbs; and my mind was as much shaken as my body.Distracted by the desire for death, and the dread of it, twenty times I had thephial to my mouth, and as often received an irresistible check; and even at thetime it seemed to me that an invisible hand swayed the bottle downwards, asoften as I set it against my lips […] Panting for breath, and in a horribleagony, I flung myself back into the corner of the coach. A few drops of laudanumwhich touched my lips […] began to have a stupefying effect upon me. Regrettingthe loss of so fair an opportunity, yet utterly unable to avail myself of it, Idetermined not to live; and already half dead with anguish, I once more returnedto the Temple. Instantly I repaired to my room, and having shut both the outerand the inner door, prepared myself for the last scene of the tragedy. I pouredthe laudanum into a small basin, set it on a chair by the bedside, halfundressed myself, and laid down between the blankets, shuddering with horror atwhat I was about to perpetrate […]At length […] with the most confirmed resolution, I reached forth my handtowards the basin, when the fingers of both hands were as closely contracted, asif bound with a cord, and became entirely useless. Still, indeed, I could havemade shift with both hands, dead and lifeless as they were, to have raised thebasin to my mouth, for my arms were not at all affected: but this new difficultystruck me with wonder; it had the air of a divine interposition […] The horrorof the crime was immediately exhibited to me in so strong a light, that, beingseized with a kind of furious indignation, I snatched up the basin, poured awaythe laudanum into a phial of foul water, and, not content with that, flung thephial out of the window […]I spent the rest of the day in a kind of stupid insensibility; undetermined asto the manner of dying, but still bent on self-murder […] I went to bed to take,as I thought, my last sleep in this world. The next morning was to place me atthe bar of the House, and I was determined not to see it. I slept as usual, andawoke about three o’clock. Immediately I arose, and by the help of a rushlight,found my penknife, took it into bed with me, and lay with it for some hoursdirectly pointed against my heart. Twice or thrice I placed it upright under myleft breast, leaning all my weight upon it; but the point was broken off square,and it would not penetrate […]Not one hesitating thought now remained, but I fell greedily to the execution ofmy purpose. My garter was made of a broad piece of scarlet binding, with asliding buckle, being sown together at the ends: by the help of the buckle, Iformed a noose, and fixed it about my neck, straining it so tight that I hardlyleft a passage for my breath, or for the blood to circulate […] At each cornerof the bed was placed a wreath of carved work, fastened by an iron pin, whichpassed through the midst of it: the other part of the garter, which made a loop,I slipped over one of these, and hung by it some seconds, drawing my feet underme, that they might not touch the floor; but the iron bent, and the carved workslipped off, and the garter with it. I then fastened it to the frame of thetester, winding it round, and tying it in a strong knot. The frame broke short,and let me down again.The third effort was more likely to succeed. I set the door open, which reachedwithin a foot of the ceiling; by the help of a chair I could command the top ofit, and the loop being large enough to admit a large angle of the door, waseasily fixed so as not to slip off again. I pushed away the chair with my feet,and hung at whole length. While I hung there, I distinctly heard a voice saythree times ‘Tis over!’ […] I hung so long that I lost all sense, allconsciousness of existence.When I came to myself again, I thought myself in hell; the sound of my owndreadful groans was all that I heard, and a feeling, like that produced by aflash of lightning, just beginning to seize upon me, passed over my whole body.In a few seconds I found myself fallen on my face on the floor. In about half aminute I recovered my feet; and reeling, staggering, stumbled into bed again […]*"},{"pageContent":"FROM FOUNDATIONS OF A METAPHYSICS OF MORALSIMMANUEL KANTFirstly, under the head of necessary duty to oneself: He who contemplatessuicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea ofhumanity as an end in itself. If he destroys himself in order to escape frompainful circumstances, he uses a person merely as a mean to maintain a tolerablecondition up to the end of life. But a man is not a thing, that is to say,something which can be used merely as means, but must in all his actions bealways considered as an end in himself. I cannot, therefore, dispose in any wayof a man in my own person so as to mutilate him, to damage or kill him.

I suppose that you wonder why, as most things which are evil may beaccidentally good, this is to be the only exception (for may not death, too, bebetter than life in some cases?), and why, when a man is better dead, he is notpermitted to be his own benefactor, but must wait for the hand of another.By Jupiter! yes, indeed, said Cebes, laughing, and speaking in his native Doric.I admit the appearance of inconsistency, replied Socrates, but there may not beany real inconsistency after all in this. There is a doctrine uttered in secretthat man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door of his prison and runaway; this is a great mystery which I do not quite understand. Yet I, too,believe that the gods are our guardians, and that we are a possession of theirs.Do you not agree?Yes, I agree to that, said Cebes.And if one of your own possessions, an ox or an ass, for example took theliberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no intimation ofyour wish that he should die, would you not be angry with him, and would you notpunish him if you could?Certainly, replied Cebes.Then there may be reason in saying that a man should wait, and not take his ownlife until God summons him, as he is now summoning me.Yes, Socrates, said Cebes, there is surely reason in that. And yet how can youreconcile this seemingly true belief that God is our guardian and we hispossessions, with that willingness to die which we were attributing to thephilosopher? That the wisest of men should be willing to leave this service inwhich they are ruled by the gods who are the best of rulers is not reasonable,for surely no wise man thinks that when set at liberty he can take better careof himself than the gods take of him. A fool may perhaps think this – he mayargue that he had better run away from his master, not considering that his dutyis to remain to the end, and not to run away from the good, and that there is nosense in his running away. But the wise man will want to be ever with him who isbetter than himself. Now this, Socrates, is the reverse of what was just nowsaid; for upon this view the wise man should sorrow and the fool rejoice atpassing out of life.The earnestness of Cebes seemed to please Socrates. Here, said he, turning tous, is a man who is always inquiring, and is not to be convinced all in amoment, nor by every argument.And in this case, added Simmias, his objection does appear to me to have someforce. For what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away andlightly leave a master who is better than himself? And I rather imagine thatCebes is referring to you; he thinks that you are too ready to leave us, and tooready to leave the gods who, as you acknowledge, are our good rulers.Yes, replied Socrates; there is reason in that. And this indictment you thinkthat I ought to answer as if I were in court?That is what we should like, said Simmias.Then I must try to make a better impression upon you than I did when defendingmyself before the judges. For I am quite ready to acknowledge, Simmias andCebes, that I ought to be grieved at death, if I were not persuaded that I amgoing to other gods who are wise and good (of this I am as certain as I can beof anything of the sort) and to men departed (though I am not so certain ofthis), who are better than those whom I leave behind; and therefore I do notgrieve as I might have done, for I have good hope that there is yet somethingremaining for the dead, and, as has been said of old, some far better thing forthe good than for the evil.But do you mean to take away your thoughts with you, Socrates? said Simmias.Will you not communicate them to us? – the benefit is one in which we too mayhope to share. Moreover, if you succeed in convincing us, that will be an answerto the charge against yourself.I will do my best, replied Socrates. But you must first let me hear what Critowants; he was going to say something to me.Only this, Socrates, replied Crito: the attendant who is to give you the poisonhas been telling me that you are not to talk much, and he wants me to let youknow this; for that by talking heat is increased, and this interferes with theaction of the poison; those who excite themselves are sometimes obliged to drinkthe poison two or three times.Then, said Socrates, let him mind his business and be prepared to give thepoison two or three times, if necessary; that is all.I was almost certain that you would say that, replied Crito; but I was obligedto satisfy him."},{"pageContent":"FROM THE LAWS (TRANSLATOR BENJAMIN JOWETT)PLATOAnd what shall he suffer who slays him who of all men, as they say, is his ownbest friend?
