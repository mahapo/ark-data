So effective and powerful was this new approach to knowledge thatwithin a relatively short time – merely a few centuries – it achieved ascendancyin practically all fields of human endeavour, and subsequently became, as it istoday, the gauge by which we measure such difficult and fundamental notions as‘truth’ and ‘reality’. A few centuries may not seem like a short time, but if wecompare the changes that have taken place in human existence since this new wayof knowing first raised its head, to the millennia that preceded it, we will notbe exaggerating too greatly if we feel that something like a ‘revolution’ hadoccurred. As more than one historian has pointed out, human life, even that ofthe planet itself, has changed more in the four centuries since the arrival ofthis new mode of knowing, than in the long ages that came before it. Whathappened in the first years of the seventeenth century was no gradualdevelopment, no addition to what had gone before, but a complete break with thepast and a radical new beginning.To be sure, the roots of this new way of knowing could be traced back to earliertimes. Its origins can be seen in Greek philosophy, in Plato and Aristotle. Butthey go back even further, and can be found in much earlier thinkers, such asThales, Anaximander, Pythagoras, and the other pre-Socratic philosophers whoappeared around the eastern Mediterranean in the centuries around 500 bc. Thiswas the period that the German existential philosopher Karl Jaspers christenedthe ‘Axial Age’. Jaspers assigned a unique importance to this age because heargued that it was during it that ‘the spiritual foundations of humanity werelaid’, a development that took place across the globe.1[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-1] During Jaspers’ Axial Age, Confucius andLao-Tse appeared in China; India saw the creation of the Upanishads and theappearance of the Buddha; Zoroaster emerged in Persia and laid the groundwork ofZoroastrianism, which saw the world as a battleground between the cosmic forcesof good and evil; and in the Holy Lands, the Hebrew prophets arose, preaching anew relationship between God and his creation.It was during this time that in Greece a new kind of individual, moved by newinterests and sensibilities, appeared. While in other parts of the globe theAxial Age saw the appearance of powerful religious and ethical feelings andinsights that would inform whole civilisations, in Greece and Asia Minor – thatpart of modern Turkey bordering the Mediterranean Sea – something differentoccurred. Here what we can call a movement from a ‘mythical’ to a ‘mental’outlook took place. A new kind of character, the ‘thinker’, appeared for thefirst time, what the philosopher Edmund Husserl called ‘theoretical man’. Thisnew type of character had a strange impersonal curiosity about the world aroundhim. As the literary critic George Steiner put it, unlike most people aroundhim, he found himself ‘interested in something for its own enigmatic sake’, andnot for the practical reasons that until then had motivated most human inquiry.2[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-2] That this is still the case today is nottoo difficult to confirm.For such a person, the old myths concerning the creation of the world that theyfound in Homer and Hesiod were no longer satisfying. They were not interested ina narrative explaining how the world came to be, or the supernatural origin ofother elements in this world. What Thales of Miletus or his student Anaximanderand other thinkers much like them wanted to know was what the world was made of.According to the philosopher John Shand, they were looking for ‘the original andcontrolling stuff and first principle of the universe, the nature of whichprovides an explanation of the existing universe, and its origin, as a whole’.3[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-3] For Thales this was water. ForAnaximenes, a younger contemporary of Anaximander, it was air. Later sages hadother ideas. Heraclitus – called the ‘dark philosopher’ because of his gnomicsayings – believed the ‘original and controlling stuff’ was fire. Other thinkershad similar suggestions.We may not be impressed with these answers to what may seem to us childishattempts to ‘explain’ the universe, even if Thales, Anaximenes and the othershad substantial arguments to support their theories. But the impetus behind themcarries on today. We see this when the world’s media becomes very excited at thediscovery of yet another sub-atomic particle even more elementary than the last,that will supposedly allow us to finally solve the ‘mystery’ of existence –until, that is, the next particle turns up.Closer to the seventeenth century, we can say the new mode of knowing that I amspeaking of arose out of the renewed interest in Nature as an object of studyand contemplation, that presaged the rise of the Gothic in the twelfth century.Round about AD 862, John Scotus Eriugena, an Irish monk and theologian, wrote awork called De divisione Naturae (On the Divisions of Nature). Eriguena – thename means ‘born in Ireland’ – had earlier translated from Greek into Latin awork by an anonymous Syrian monk who most likely lived circa ad 500.4[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-4] The Celestial Hierarchy combined theNeoplatonic philosophy that had flourished centuries earlier in Alexandria inEgypt with the nascent theology of early Christianity to create the greatpanoply of spiritual beings – Seraphim and Cherubim down to the angels – thatinhabit the Christian universe. Eriguena absorbed this Neoplatonic influence andthrough it he began to see Nature in a different light, something that comesthrough in his work. Rather than relegate the natural world to the unredeemedpagans or, worse, the devil, as had been the case for centuries, he recognisedwithin it the presence of the divine. He spoke of nature’s ‘manifesttheophanies’ – God’s appearance within it.To the later scholars of the School of Chartres in the twelfth century, theseappearances were most recognisable in what became known as ‘sacred geometry’.This was exemplified in formulae like the ‘golden section’, or phi, that theyfound embodied in different forms throughout nature, and which was used inconstructing many Gothic cathedrals. From the Timaeus – one of the few works ofPlato available to them – they learned that God was a geometer andmathematician. As it had been for Plato – and even more for his predecessorPythagoras – number became a way of grasping the divine. Images of the Creatorusing a compass appeared on cathedrals, with Pythagoras himself finding a placeon the west portal of one of the most magnificent examples of sacred geometry toappear in any age, the cathedral at Chartres. It must be clear by now to the reader that the ‘new way of knowing’ I have beenwriting about was what we have come to know as science. Like the first sages ofancient Greece, around the first years of the seventeenth century, individualsbegan to appear who were curious about the world in a way that was strikinglyand disturbingly different. Like their Greek predecessors, they wanted to knowwhat made the world tick – an anachronistic phrase here that would soon proveworryingly apt. Two centuries earlier the Renaissance filled many bold spiritswith the belief that man was something more than the lowly, sinful creature ofthe Middle Ages, forever in danger of wandering off the path of redemption andfinding his way to the temptations of Satan. The rediscovery of the works ofsages like Plato and even more those of the supposed founder of all learning,the celebrated Hermes Trismegistus, gave the creative spirits of the Renaissancea renewed sense of human potential. Man was able to choose his own path; he wasno longer held back by the limitations and constraints of dogma and fear. He wasa creative force. There was a sense that man, in his own way, was reallysomething of a god. He was certainly more vitally endowed and strategicallyplaced than the angels, a belief given vivid expression in a representative workof the time, Pico della Mirandola’s Oration on the Dignity of Man.This stirring confidence and incentive now informed a new breed of genius. Likethe mages of the Renaissance, they believed in humankind’s ability to understandtheir world, to free themselves from the shackles of ignorance and fear. Andlike the scholars of Chartres, they believed that number was essential to thisendeavour. Number, as Pythagoras had said long ago, was indeed behindeverything. It was. But for these new men, it wasn’t in the way that Pythagorashad believed.For Pythagoras, numbers had a metaphysical reality; they were symbols orexpressions of certain qualities, certain fundamental characteristics oressences that provided the pattern and shape of reality. There was a quality ofwhat we would call ‘twoness’ just as there was a quality of ‘threeness’.Pythagoras and his followers summed up this insight in a figure they called thetetraktys, which encompassed the entire universe in a pyramid formed of tendots. In this way they showed how through certain stages, the physical worldemerges from the undifferentiated One. A later variant of this belief can befound in the Kabbalah, the esoteric tradition of Judaism, as well as inNeoplatonism.[../images/00002.gif]The tetraktysNumber was understood in what we might call this mystical way for some time, butwith the rise of the new way of knowing, this changed. From housing qualitiesand archetypes of reality, number came to be seen as primarily an agent ofmeasurement. Through a strange, brief, but effective collaboration, the Churchand a rising science, soon to be sworn enemies, temporarily worked together toempty the world of its qualitative character, of what the philosopher oflanguage Owen Barfield calls its ‘insides’.5[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-5] What remained was its ‘outside’, itsphysical form, its surface, which, it was increasingly understood, was subjectto what were beginning to be called ‘the laws of nature’. These laws were of apurely physical character, the push and pull of mechanical cause and effect. Atthis point the idea of finding out what made the world ‘tick’ became somethingmore than a metaphor. Increasingly it was seen that Creation was only the mostgrand form of a variety of mechanical devices – machines – that had recentlycaptured western imagination. From a world of qualities what was emerging wasone of quantity. And so vigorous was the pursuit of this new approach to numberthat what quickly came into effect was what the Traditionalist philosopher RenéGuénon called the ‘Reign of Quantity’.Such was the seismic shift in Western man’s relationship to the world – thechange came about later in other parts of the planet but has by now encircledthe globe – that Jaspers argues that it was as ‘incisive’ an event in humanhistory as his ‘Axial Age’.6 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-6] It isarguable that its effect has been even more profound, at least on the level ofour material lives. It takes a small effort of imagination to recognise that theway in which the average person in the west lives today would have beeninconceivable to anyone living prior to the ‘scientific revolution’. We enjoy ateasy grasp a technology that kings of an earlier time could not dream of, letalone possess. From smartphones to anaesthetics, automobiles to interstellarspace probes, the ‘reign of quantity’ has produced remarkable results. No onedenies this and only a fool or a confirmed luddite would believe we could in anypositive sense return to a pre-technological world. I say ‘positive sense’because we have no dearth of dystopian visions, apocalyptic anticipations of asoon-to-be-future in which our technological world comes crashing down aroundus, and we find ourselves, and not only metaphorically, back in the caves. Itseems that for many, the only way to conceive of the world without technology isto end it.And yet, it seems almost a cliché by now to point out that the power and masteryover the natural world that has come to us through the reign of quantity, andwhich we turn more and more on ourselves, has come at a very high price. Theemptying of the ‘inside’ of the world – and increasingly ourselves – that wasnecessary in order for the new way of knowing to take root, has not been anunalloyed success. While at first a necessary stage in humankind’s development –or so I see it – the power over the natural world that has come into our handshas in recent times begun to show its shadow side. Global warming, urbanisation,industrialisation and the environmental and social problems that arise withthem, as well as a variety of other crises facing us today, have their roots inthe kind of mastery over the physical world that arrived with our new way ofknowing. But as pressing and urgent as these challenges are – and I havementioned only a few of them merely as an indication of their nature – they arenot the only unforeseen side effects of the ‘knowledge revolution’ fourcenturies ago.Our own ‘inside’ has been dramatically affected by it too. The freedom of mindthat was achieved by jettisoning dogma and faith had a dual effect. It liberatedthe human mind, but it also seemed to set it adrift. One of the results of thenew way of knowing is that it has left many of us feeling, as the novelistWalker Percy put it, ‘lost in the cosmos’. Man, in his ignorance, had believedhe was the centre of the universe. Our new knowledge disabused us of thismisconception. We are not at the centre. We occupy a modest position near amid-range star in one arm of one galaxy, itself full of billions of other stars,set in a universe full of billions of other galaxies. And for all we know, thereare billions of other universes.We began to lose our moorings in the mid-sixteenth century when Copernicus setthe sun loose from the earth and we began, as the philosopher Nietzsche said,‘rolling from the centre toward X’.7 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-7] Thesuccess the new way of knowing had in disabusing us of any idea that we are inany way necessary, important, or essential to the universe is perhaps bestexpressed in a remark by the respected astrophysicist Steven Weinberg. In TheFirst Three Minutes, his book about what happened immediately after the BigBang, Weinberg writes, ‘The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more italso seems pointless’.8 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-8] Comprehensiblehere means quantifiable. It does not take much to infer from this that we, theinhabitants of this pointless but quantified universe are, unavoidably, evenmore pointless.Anomie, apathy, alienation, a sense of existential ‘So what?’ accompanied thesuccess of our now seemingly unstoppable aim of quantifying all of existence andour experience of it. The quantification of human existence was carried out indifferent ways, with disciplines once considered part of the ‘humanities’ nowadopting the effective methods of the new way of knowing. The itch to obtain thesame kind of ‘objective’ ‘measurable’ results that the ‘hard’ sciences wereachieving made their ‘softer’ relations jealous, and so increasingly practicallyall forms of scholarship, research, inquiry, and study aped the new approach.What this meant was that science was quickly becoming, or giving birth to,‘Scientism’. This, according to the eminent historian Jacques Barzun, is ‘thefallacy of believing that the method of science must be used on all forms ofexperience and, given time, will settle every issue’.9[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-9]Although since the rise of the new way of knowing many have taken argument withits misuse and obvious inadequacies in dealing with many forms of experience –we will meet some of these critics as we go along – for the most part‘Scientism’ is the dominant ‘belief system’ – less abstractly, religion – ofmodern times. When we want answers to the ‘mysteries’ of the universe, or ofourselves, we don’t go to philosophers, poets, mystics, or priests. We go toscientists, many of whom, it seems to me, are only too happy to provideconfident, convincing answers even if they have as much idea about the mysteryas anyone else.Barzun points out that at its beginning someone well trained in the new way ofknowing, and who was blessed with a natural talent for it, was also prescientenough to recognise that if not used wisely it could lead to problems. BlaisePascal was born in 1623 and it was not long before he was recognised as aprodigy; at the age of twelve he was sitting in on mathematics discussions withthe philosopher René Descartes, regarded as one of the founders of the modernworld, and a brilliant exponent of the new way of knowing. Pascal was amathematician, logician, physicist, and inventor; experiments he conducted ledto the invention of the barometer, and he devised the first calculating machine,known as La Pascaline, something he whipped up to help his father, a taxcollector. But Pascal was also a religious philosopher and what we can call anearly existentialist. And although he was not a mystic, as he is oftendescribed, he did have at least one mystical experience, the import of which hehad written down and had sewn into his coat; it was only upon his death that itwas discovered. It was headed by one word, ‘fire’, and spoke of ‘tears of joy’.Its gist was that he believed in the ‘living God’ of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,not the bloodless abstraction of the ‘scholars and philosophers’.10[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-10]Also after his death a collection of notes Pascal had made for a book defendingChristianity against the rising ‘freethinkers’ – exponents of the new way ofknowing – were discovered. These have come down to us as his Pensées,‘Thoughts’. Famously in them he voiced what to our ears strikes the familiarnote of cosmic anxiety. Looking at the vast strange universe revealed throughthe ‘scientific method’, Pascal remarked that ‘the eternal silence of theseinfinite spaces terrifies me’. It seems that well before Steven Weinberg, Pascalwas concerned about our comprehensible, but pointless, existence.But in his Pensées Pascal also voiced a concern about the new way of knowingthat had opened the curtains on the spaces that terrified him. At the beginningof the Pensées Pascal writes about the differences between what he calls the‘mathematical and intuitive mind’, or the esprit géométrique and the esprit definesse, the ‘spirit of geometry’ and the ‘spirit of finesse’.11[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-11] As Barzun explains, the spirit ofgeometry ‘works with exact definitions and abstractions in science ormathematics’, while the spirit of finesse ‘works with ideas and perceptions notcapable of exact definition’.12 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-12] Thereis no debate over the definition of a right-angle triangle or gravity, Barzunpoints out, while things like love, freedom, poetry and other meaningful butless exact phenomena are not so well defined. The spirit of geometry workssequentially, reasoning its way step-by-step, following its rules, whereas theintuitive minds sees everything all at once. It arrives at its goal in oneglance, not by a process of deduction.The drawback here is that because the lack of definition is rooted in itssubjects themselves, and not due to insufficient information or ‘facts’ aboutthem – when will we have all the facts about love or freedom? – those who followthe spirit of finesse find it difficult, if not impossible, to explain how theyknow what they know. There are no steps 1, 2, and 3; it just hits them and it isobvious, self-evident. We hear a sonata by Beethoven and we know it is beautifuland meaningful; we do not arrive at this knowledge through a series of logicalsteps. We do not say to ourselves, ‘Well, it has x number of notes in thispassage, which means that …’ and so on. But if asked how we know it is beautifuland meaningful, and even worse, if we can prove it, we draw a blank. The spiritof geometry can take us by the hand and lead us from definition, theorem, andaxiom to the goal. But the process is mechanical, practically tautological, aseach definition is merely another way of stating the same thing (4 is onlyanother way of saying 2 + 2). And it works best with practical, utilitarianthings, not with those that have a purchase on our emotional being.Pascal was admirably equipped to follow mathematical reasoning, but he knew ofother reasoning too; as he famously wrote, ‘the heart has its reasons thatreason does not know’. It knows them through the spirit of finesse, theintuitive approach, one of the two directions, as Barzun says, that the ‘onehuman mind can take’.13 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-13]Pascal’s distinction between the spirit of geometry and the spirit of finessehas been voiced in different ways at different times by different thinkers. Afew centuries before Pascal, St Thomas Aquinas posed his own distinction between‘kinds of knowledge’. He called the ‘lower’ knowledge that was achieved throughreasoning the ‘active search’ for knowledge, while the ‘higher’ kind, intellect,was ‘the intuitive possession of it’.14 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-14]Some centuries after Pascal, in his unclassifiable work The Adventurous Heart,the German writer Ernst Jünger spoke of something he called ‘the master key’.‘Our understanding is such,’ Jünger writes, ‘that it is able to engage from thecircumference as well as at the midpoint. For the first case, we possessant-like industriousness, for the second, the gift of intuition.’ Jünger goeson: ‘For the mind that comprehends the midpoint, knowledge of the circumferencebecomes secondary – just as individual room keys lose importance for someonewith the master key of a house.’15 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-15]Similarly, the philosopher Michael Polanyi differentiated between what he called‘tacit’ and ‘explicit’ knowing. Explicit knowing is the kind we can relatestep-by-step, as in a scientific experiment or a mathematical equation. Tacitknowing is implicit. It cannot be stated clearly in the same way as explicitknowing. It is the kind of knowing of which, as Polanyi says, ‘we can know morethan we can tell’.16 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-16] You can spell out,step-by-step, the process of solving a quadratic equation; that is explicitknowledge, and we are subject to it throughout our school years. But if you tryto explain to someone how to ride a bicycle, you will find it very difficult.You can show them how to do it; that’s easy because it is tacit knowledge,knowledge you have but can’t say much about. But you cannot explicitly saystep-by-step what you do when you are showing them how to ride the bike. Mostlikely if you try to do this you will fall off. And that is how we learn to ridea bicycle in the first place. We don’t ‘half’ ride it, then ride it a bit more,until we finally can ride it ‘all the way’.17[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-17] We find one day that suddenly we can,all at once. Some part of us other than our conscious mind has absorbed what wehave learned and does it for us, what Colin Wilson calls ‘the robot’. In fact,this absorption is ‘learning’. And the knowledge remains, implicitly, unless wemake the mistake of thinking about it too much. If I start to think about how Itype I will soon lose track of what I want to type.The philosopher Alfred North Whitehead recognised this when he said that:‘Civilisation advances by extending the number of important operations which wecan perform without thinking about them’. Whitehead also made a distinctionbetween two kinds of perception that share similarities with Polanyi’s ‘tacit’and ‘explicit’ knowing and Pascal’s spirits of geometry and finesse. InSymbolism: Its Meaning and Effect, Whitehead speaks of ‘immediacy perception’and ‘meaning perception’.18 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-18] Simply put,immediacy perception gives us the individual, immediate ‘facts’ of what we see,bit by bit, while meaning perception gives us the whole picture, all at once.It is not too difficult to see that Whitehead’s immediacy is well suited for thekind of quantitative knowing that came to prominence in the seventeenth century,and that ‘meaning perception’ is another way of talking about Ernst Jünger’s‘master key’. Elsewhere I have written about Whitehead’s work in the context ofnew developments in ‘split-brain’ psychology.19[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-19] In The Master and His Emissary theliterary scholar and neuroscientist Iain McGilchrist reboots the whole ‘leftbrain/right brain’ discussion, which had petered out in the 1990s when ‘hard’neuroscientists were averse to being associated with something that had beentaken up by pop psychology and New Age enthusiasts.Another factor also turned serious research away from our split-brain. The neatseparation and localisation of different psychological functions that hadinitially seemed the case when investigation into why we have two brains firstbegan, fairly soon began to break down. When it appeared that, with mostfunctions, both sides of our brain are involved – with emphasis in some thingson one side or the other – scientists began to doubt whether there was anysignificant reason why we had two brains in the first place. Some even jokedthat one was a ‘spare’. Yet what McGilchrist discovered is that while both sidesof our brain may do the same things, they do them very differently. It was not amatter of what they did, he saw, but how they did it.Put briefly, our right brain, which McGilchrist contends is older and primary –it is the ‘master’ of his title – sees the world as a whole, as a giventotality, a living presence, much as we see another person. In Pascal’s terms,it sees things intuitively, ‘at a glance’. It is interested in implicitmeanings. Because of this, its picture is somewhat vague, somewhat ‘fuzzy’. Ithas a general, indubitable sense of ‘meaning’, yet it cannot articulate it inany detail – much like the implicit meanings in music that we cannot articulateexplicitly. That is the job of the left brain, McGilchrist’s ‘emissary’. It’sbusiness is to ‘unpack’ what the right brain ‘presences’, to ‘spell it out’, asit were, to focus on the individual trees that make up the forest given to it bythe right brain – and eventually to focus on the individual leaves of a giventree. In Whitehead’s terms, the right brain sees with ‘meaning perception’,while the left is concerned with ‘immediacy perception’. We could also say thatthe left brain knows through Aquinas’ ‘active search’ for knowledge, while theright has the ‘intuitive possession’ of it.McGilchrist argues that throughout human history, the two ‘ways’ of our twobrains complemented each other and worked, as democracies should, through asystem of checks and balances, with each one inhibiting or compensating for theother’s excesses in a kind of friendly rivalry. There have been times when onehas gained a dominance, but these have always been evened out. And there havebeen times when both brains worked together creatively, in what I call a‘Goldilocks moment’, when things are ‘just right’. There is good reason tosuspect that for millennia, something like a right brain dominance was the case,and that the shift in human consciousness that produced ‘theoretical man’ duringJaspers’ ‘Axial Age’, was a movement toward giving the left brain more say.What has happened though, McGilchrist argues, is that over the last twocenturies – more specifically since the Industrial Revolution – the left brainhas gained an increasing ascendancy over the right. Its determination to analyseexperience, to break everything down into easily manageable bits and pieces, anecessary process for our survival, has got out of hand and is squeezing theright brain’s contribution out of the picture. What has happened is that, asMcGilchrist presents it, the ‘emissary’ has usurped power from the ‘master’, andhas set itself up as the boss. What this has resulted in, McGilchrist argues, isan increasingly fragmented picture of the world, with less and less awareness ofthe intuitive glue, needed to hold things together.The Industrial Revolution is the child, of course, of the ‘knowledge revolution’of the early seventeenth century, with the reign of quantity giving birth to thekinds of technology that dominate us today. We can say that McGilchrist’s leftbrain – not his own personal one, of course, although it, too, like our own,shares in this – has taken the new way of knowing and run with it. But this putsthe cart before the horse. The new way of knowing is rooted in the left brain,it is a product of it and it is, as we’ve seen, something that has been with usat least since the Axial Age. What has happened is that in the ‘knowledgerevolution’ of the seventeenth century, through various factors, the new way ofknowing – a heightened, intensified, and ruthless application of the curiosityof ‘theoretical man’ – made a successful bid to oust any competitors. The driveto quantify experience and to apply the results of this to practical ends began.The result of this is the modern world we see around us, and which McGilchristbelieves is evidence of the left brain’s bid to recreate the world ‘in its ownimage’, with any input from the right being marginalised, if not dismissedoutright.If McGilchrist is right, then we are truly suffering from a kind ofschizophrenia, with one part of ourselves trying to excise the other – an‘other’ which is as deeply rooted in us, if not more, as itself. As canimmediately be seen, if this attempt is successful, it will result in a kind ofsuicide. At the very least we will suffer the kinds of self-antagonism thatbefell people who were subject to operations disconnecting one brain from theother, and who subsequently found themselves at war with their ‘other half’.20[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-20] In Faust, his classic tale of how thedominance of one kind of knowing can empty a life of all meaning andsatisfaction, the great German Romantic poet Goethe said: ‘Two souls, alas, livein my breast’. He may have got his anatomy wrong, but the insight is clear. YetGoethe might have added: ‘And they don’t get along’.If our brains are really battling it out – or, more accurately, if our rightbrain is being subjected to aggression from the left – then we are, I am afraid,in for some trouble. If our left brain, fired with a passion for the new way ofknowing, succeeds in evicting its neighbour, then the result will be some newkind of being, that will be radically different from ourselves, or at least fromhow we are supposed to be. We would not have two brains if we did not need themand we would not need them if they did not work differently, with bothapproaches necessary for us to be ‘fully human’.McGilchrist was not the first to recognise this. More than a century ago theclassicist Francis Cornford wrote a remarkable book, From Religion toPhilosophy, that charted the shift from the ‘mythic’ to the ‘mental’ sensibilitymentioned earlier. While Cornford recognised, as Jaspers did, that somethingmonumental had taken place around the eastern side of the Mediterranean circa500 BC, he also saw that our ‘mythic consciousness’ was not as thoroughlyeliminated at that time as early historians of ideas believed. ‘Thephilosophical Muse is not a motherless Athena,’ Cornford wrote, referring to themyth of the birth of Athena, fully formed, from Zeus’ brow, after it had beensplit open by Prometheus’ axe. What this meant is that the new ‘theoretical’approach grew out of mythic soil; it did not appear suddenly and was notunprecedented. Cornford argued that the new kind of consciousness that informed‘theoretical man’ emerged from Greek religion and mythology. It did not jettisonthese last entirely, as forms of superstition and ignorance, as Cornford’scontemporaries, and practically everyone else, believed it had, and were happyto do themselves.21 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-21]The new way of wondering about the world would eventually, as we’ve seen, becomewhat we know as science. But it grew up in the company of another tradition. Thetwo schools, Cornford saw, were ‘moved by distinguishable impulses along linesdiverging, more and more widely, towards opposite conclusions’. Writing in 1912,Cornford argued that these impulses ‘are still operative in our own speculation,for the simple reason that they correspond to two permanent needs of humannature, and characterise two familiar types of human temperament’.22[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-22] We seem to be back at Pascal’s twospirits, and if there is any doubt, Cornford goes on to dot the i’s and crossthe t’s. Speaking of the prevalence of the one tradition in his – and our –time, Cornford says that ‘driven by a deep-lying need to master the world byunderstanding it, science works steadily toward its goal – a perfectly clearconceptual model of reality, adapted to explain all phenomena by the simplestformula that can be found …’ But Cornford saw that there’s a catch. ‘When wecontemplate the finished result, we see that in banishing “the vague”, it hasswept away everything in which another type of mind finds all the value andsignificance of the world’.23 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-23] Thatother type of mind is the spirit of finesse, the intuitive approach, Jünger’s‘master key’, the glance that takes in everything, all at once, and not bit bybit, one step at a time.Banishing ‘the vague’ may seem like a good idea. Of course we want things to beclear, simple, and direct, and that is something the left brain, according toMcGilchrist, is very good at making them. But too much clarity can obscurethings as well as reveal them. The sun’s light hides the stars. A ‘perfectlyclear conceptual model of reality, adapted to explain all phenomena by thesimplest formula’ sounds like the most ‘cost efficient’ way of explaining theworld and ourselves. But efficiency isn’t everything and ‘the vague’ forCornford means the kinds of things amenable to Pascal’s spirit of finesse, butnot his spirit of geometry. It means values like beauty, freedom, love, thingsthat are important in a more than utilitarian way, whose importance is inthemselves and not as a means to some practical or socially beneficial end. Theyare, as George Steiner calls them, ‘the sovereignly useless’.24[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-24] They are not good for anything, howeverthinkers of a Darwinian slant may say they are. They give life meaning and arewhat make it worth living. When Jesus said that man does not live by breadalone, this is what he had in mind.What happens when a reasonable desire for a ‘clear conceptual model of reality’arrived at by ‘the simplest formula that can be found,’ gets out of hand?Scientism happens, which is successful precisely because it reduces reality towhat it can abstract from it and apply to useful ends. We tend to associatereductive science with matter and materialism. But ‘matter’ itself is anabstraction. It is not the stuff we encounter in the world, but our conceptualgrasp of it. We have all seen material things – they surround us – but no onehas ever seen matter.25 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-25] What is wrongwith Scientism is not that it is ‘material’ but that it is too abstract, toomuch in love with the hunt for the simplest formula, which today takes the formof a ‘theory of everything’. To be effective science must limit the part ofreality that it deals with to what is relevant for its purposes. Because ofthis, as Barzun tells us, ‘the realm of abstraction, useful and far from unreal,is thinner and barer and poorer than the world it is drawn from’.26[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-26]To abstract means to ‘extract’ or ‘remove’ something, whether it is an‘abstract’ of a scientific paper you are interested in – that is, a briefdescription of it – or your idea of ‘tree’ from all the many, different ‘real’trees you have encountered. One of the great sleights of hand that Scientism haspulled off is to convince the unthinking public that the thin, bare, poor worldthat it abstracts from – i.e. ‘pulls out of’ – our thick, luxuriant, rich worldis the ‘really real’ world, the one that ‘objectively exists’, while the one weencounter and love and struggle with is a kind of subjective illusion, housedwithin our individual island consciousness. It manages this trick solely becauseof the practical effectiveness it provides. Reducing reality to those parts ofit that can be quantified and manipulated to our benefit ensured that the newway of knowing would quickly become the arbiter and guarantor or what was realand what was true. It worked, no doubt about that. But at a price. So far we have looked, albeit briefly, at the development and success of one ofthe two traditions that Cornford argued were active at the dawn of ourpeculiarly Western mind. I say ‘peculiarly Western’ because, although it hasspread around the globe, the kind of insatiable curiosity about the world – thedesire to know what made it ‘tick’ and to apply this knowledge to practical ends– that arose among the Greeks in the Axial Age, seems not to have appearedelsewhere, or at least not in the same concentrated way. This is not tocelebrate Eurocentrism, merely to recognise that Western consciousness has aparticular task, which we can see as establishing and maintaining the creativepolarity between our two traditions. And what is the other tradition?As an example of the other tradition, Cornford points to Pythagoras, whom we’vealready spoken about. Although Thales preceded Pythagoras he was not in fact thefirst philosopher, if only because it was Pythagoras, who came some years after,who coined the word. He also contributed other important terms of ourdiscussion: cosmos, for one, and theōria, which gives us our ‘theory’, foranother. Theōria comes from the Greek theōros, which means ‘spectator’. We stillretain something of this root when we say we have a theory about something basedon our ‘speculation’ about it. We can see Pythagoras as an early ‘scientist’ inthe sense that he worked at arriving at a rational account of existence. We allknow his theorem – or at least struggled to learn it in school – and hisdiscovery of the octave, which is the basis of western music. But unlike Thalesand his followers, Pythagoras did not think in terms of some fundamental stuffout of which the world was made. As we’ve seen, he believed number was behindeverything. That is, he thought in terms of a kind of principle, or idea, ratherthan some material substance. Pythagoras also saw philosophy as something morethan rational inquiry, although it certainly was that. It was more like areligious or mystical discipline. We can say that with the PythagoreanBrotherhood, Pythagoras founded the first esoteric school, ‘esoteric’ beingconcerned with what is ‘inner’, either the ‘inner’ significance of a teaching orreligion, or the shape of our ‘inner’ world. That is, it was a school aimed atnot only a defensible conceptual model of reality, but at a change inconsciousness, a change, that is, in the philosopher’s inner world, his mind.This was the wisdom that the philosopher, the ‘lover of wisdom’, pursued.Pythagoras began as a devotee of the Orphic mysteries, which were themselves arefinement of the earlier, more orgiastic rites of the drunken god Dionysus. Thetransgressive revels of Dionysus, and the more ascetic, meditative practices ofthe Orphics, had the same aim. They were concerned with awakening the spark ofspiritual life that lay asleep, sunken in the ‘portable tomb’ of the body andits sense of itself as a separate, mortal individual. But while the Dionysiacsthrew off the constraints of the conscious mind through wild excess, and theOrphics awakened the soul through denying the flesh, Pythagoras sought to raisethe consciousness of his students – and himself – by the contemplation of theeternal principles of reality. Rather than escape the conscious mind (that keptone separated from the whole) or quieten the body (that drew one’s awarenessaway from the soul) Pythagoras saw a different path. He saw that the spiritcould be awakened – raised from the dead, as Orpheus, in the original myths, didhis wife Eurydice – through philosophy.27[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-27] This meant achieving a harmony withinoneself that matched the cosmic harmony without, what he, or his followers,called ‘the music of the spheres’.Pythagoras sought to achieve a creative balance between the older, mythical kindof consciousness, embodied in the Dionysian and Orphic mysteries, and the newer,mental one. In fact ‘harmony’, with which Pythagoras is associated, means‘balance’, achieving a good ‘fit’. Such a balance is difficult to reach, butattempts to achieve it are not infrequent in the history of Westernconsciousness, nor are successes unknown. As Barzun points out, Pascal himselfis ‘proof that one can be a great geometer and a profound intuiter’. (We’ve seenthat McGilchrist, too, is in both camps.) Barzun optimistically suggests that‘any good mind properly taught can think like Euclid and like Walt Whitman’.28[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-28]It is not a question of two species of individual, or of ‘two cultures’, as abook by C.P. Snow, himself a scientist and a novelist, argued in the 1950s. Thenotion of two separate cultures or two ‘kinds’ of mutually exclusive minds – nottwo ways of using one mind – is a product of the proliferation ofspecialisation, first within the sciences, and then, in imitation of them,within the humanities (or ‘social sciences’, something, I think, of a misnomer)themselves. It is not the case that a vague, implicit mind can’t handle clearconceptual models, or that minds attuned to the simplest formula can’t stomachintuitions, although in individual cases the ability to do so, of course,varies. It is the information explosion that has been going on for some time nowthat keeps not only the two cultures separate from each other; it also separatesscientists from scientists and literary critics from their fellows too. Thesheer amount of material produced in each niche makes it impossible to keep upwith anything outside of them, and the niches themselves are on the increase.Scientists may not talk to poets, but they also don’t speak with many otherscientists, outside their speciality, either. The problem here is not that oftwo cultures not understanding each other, but of too much information – most ofit, as the policy of ‘publish or perish’ ensures, of dubious quality.We can say that the other tradition that followed the Pythagorean approach – notnecessarily his teachings – aims to achieve a kind of creative polarity betweenour two ways of knowing. It recognises the value of the new, quantitative way,the spirit of geometry. But it also recognises the value of the other way, thespirit of finesse. It also recognises that when the two are brought together ina creative tension something greater than either one can emerge. When the vague,implicit meanings are unpacked by an articulate mind attuned to them, and whenthe abstractions needed to conceptualise reality are informed by a wider,overall sense of context, then something that we might call genius, or at leastinsight, can occur. The other tradition does not want to jettison its mythic,intuitive heritage in its eagerness to explain the world in some eloquent,economical way. Nor does it want to plunge back into the warm waters of ourearlier mode of consciousness, enjoying an inarticulate sense of connection tothe All, something with which it is often confused. It also does not want toalleviate the tensions that arise out of the opposition between the two ways ofknowing by way of some bland, placid compromise, a lukewarm agreement betweenhot and cold. It wants, as I’ve said elsewhere, to reach that Goldilocks moment,when the balance between the two is ‘just right’.There is, of course, no formula for this. If there were we would all haveachieved it by now – notwithstanding some attempts to pin it down and get‘genius in a bottle’. But given that we have been working under the edicts ofthe new way of knowing for some centuries now, it seems to me, and to others,that we may need a refresher course in our other way of knowing. It has nevergone away, even though periodically pontiffs of Scientism declare that it wasever only a misunderstanding and muddle of what is now absolutely clear, andthat it has henceforth departed – only to appear again shortly after. Thistradition, however, while a part of our heritage – because it is part ofourselves – is by its nature fluid and shifting, and less easily and clearlydefined than its rival. As we’ve seen, it does not operate with fixed, exactdefinitions and unchanging sequential orders or algorithms, but with patterns,relationships, sympathies, analogies, intuitions, insights, and a synoptic graspof experience – that is, it takes it in ‘at a glance’.Elsewhere I write about our other way of knowing in the context of a history ofthe Western esoteric tradition, the body of inner, mystical, or occult knowledgethat has come down to us from ancient sources such as Hermetism, Gnosticism,Neoplatonism, Kabbalah, and also more recent ones.29[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-29] The tradition this body of texts andpractices represents is one, in the words of the historian of the occult JamesWebb, of ‘rejected knowledge’, a status it shares with the kind of intuitiveknowledge and way of knowing I have been writing about here. It is rejected forthe same reason that Jünger’s ‘master key’ is, because it does not follow theprescribed rules of what ‘real’ knowledge should be like. There is also, asJünger points out, a kind of professional jealousy. Those with the master key tothe ‘house of intellect’ – a nod to a once influential book by Barzun –‘penetrate effortlessly into the single rooms, arousing the wrath of thespecialists who watch their banks of files invalidated at a single stroke’.30[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-30] If we can find our way out of the mazewith one step, without a map, we will soon put the cartographers out ofbusiness.The watchdogs of geometry do not care for the inexplicable bull’s-eyes of theirrivals, and generally do their best to disparage them or to explain them away interms of their own ideas. That, in fact, is one of the themes I have exploredelsewhere: namely that the Western esoteric tradition, once held in high regard,has, since the arrival of the new way of knowing, been subject to the kind ofleft brain aggression that, McGilchrist argues, the right brain has beenenduring for some time now.31 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-31] I see theWestern esoteric tradition as a body of what we might call ‘right brainknowledge’. And although it certainly had its troubles with religious dogma,both from the Church and, later, Islam, it was not until the arrival of the newquantitative way of knowing that it completely fell from grace and was relegatedto the dustbin of ideas. But just as our other way of knowing has never been andcannot be excised from ourselves – without, I believe, fatal consequences – ourtradition of ‘rejected knowledge’ has never truly disappeared. It has emerged indifferent ways at different times and in different places, reminding those awareof it that a different way of knowing ourselves and our world, that does notreduce it to the ‘simplest formula to be found’, exists, and is there to help usbe ‘fully human’.Some of this rejected knowledge and the people who pursued it will appear in thepages that follow. As mentioned, one of the difficulties in speaking about thisother tradition is the simple one of what to call it, given that, by definitionit is not something to which clear definitions apply. This is something thathamstrings what we can call the various ‘alternative’ approaches to life,society, Nature, and so on, that have grown up over the last half a century orso, and which are generally, and erroneously I believe, corralled under theheading ‘New Age’ or ‘New Science’ or some other misleading, unedifying title.We simply don’t have a good name to give it, that can cover all its aspectsadequately, and also give an interested party something solid to hold onto. Thisis also because it is not so much a ‘new’ age or ‘new’ science, but a differentway of looking at the age and science we already have. We are not necessarilylooking for new facts, but for a new way of looking at the facts we alreadyknow.Another reason for the ambiguity is that it is generally the establishedtradition that does the naming, and as it is not exactly in sympathy with theconcerns of its alternative, it will not necessarily be very accurate in what itcalls it. Another reason is the wide variety of different ideas, teachings,practices, and beliefs that are lumped together by virtue of their being ‘other’than the dominant ones. This can lead to some confusion and odd pairings, withbooks on UFOs, Satanism, diet, or health, being put in the same category asthose on Western esotericism, mysticism, or philosophies of consciousness. Thisis not to disparage aliens, Satanists, or people concerned about the spiritualdimensions of their diet. But it does mean that serious students of esotericphilosophy often have to devote considerable time to explaining the differencebetween their pursuits and these others, when asked exactly what esotericism isabout.While I was writing The Secret Teachers of the Western World, a phrase keptreturning to me with an insistence that forced me to pay attention to it. It wascoined by the poet, essayist, and Blake scholar Kathleen Raine. Raine, who I meton a few occasions and interviewed some years ago, spoke of what she called ‘thelost knowledge of the imagination’.32 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-32]This was linked to something she called ‘the learning of the imagination’, aphrase that she found in the work of the poet W.B. Yeats, himself a devotee, aswas Raine, of the tradition of ‘rejected knowledge’. A ‘lost knowledge’ and a‘rejected knowledge’ – Raine also speaks of an ‘excluded knowledge’ – may not beidentical, but they certainly seem rather similar, and in the great dustbin ofideas, filled to the brim by the rigorous editing of the new way of knowledge,they must, I suspect, be close neighbours.Raine wrote many books arguing that this ‘lost’ or ‘excluded’ knowledge was infact central to our humanity, and in them she showed how some of the mostrespected figures in Western culture were in fact students of it. She even wentso far as to establish an academy dedicated to this knowledge, which shechristened Temenos, a Greek word meaning ‘sacred space’, the holy ground thatlay before a temple to the gods. Like William Blake, Raine laboured at this‘mental fight’ for many years, dedicating her life to it. She died in 2003 atthe age of ninety-five.This book is about this ‘lost’ knowledge of the imagination. Yet, while this maygive us a handy phrase under which we can put examples of the other kind ofknowing I have been speaking about, it is not immediately clear what we mean by‘imagination’. Imagination is one of those things which we all know intimatelybut which we would find difficult to pin down exactly. It is one of those thingsthat, as Whitehead said, are ‘incapable of analysis in terms of factors morefar-reaching than themselves’.33 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-33] Thatis to say, we can’t get ‘under’ imagination because the very act of trying to doso requires imagination itself. Memory, self-consciousness, thought, perception:all inform and are informed by imagination and are difficult, if not impossible,to pry apart from it or each other. This should not be surprising. Imaginationdoes not follow the clear axioms and definitions of the spirit of geometry, butthe wayward, vague, surprising insights of the spirit of finesse. As Blakehimself said, ‘Improvement makes straight roads, but the crooked roads, withoutImprovement, are roads of Genius’.34 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-34] Inthe pages ahead of us, we will follow some of these crooked roads of genius, andsee where they will lead us.There are of course many books on the imagination. Psychological studies,motivational works, instructions in visualisation, research into creativity,guides to using imagination in business, relationships and self-improvement –these are some of the results that come from a quick internet search on thesubject. There are many more. Most definitions of imagination speak of itscontrast with reality. My Oxford Dictionary tells me that imagination is the‘mental faculty of forming images or concepts of objects or situations notexistent or not directly experienced’. Merriam-Webster tells me it is ‘theability to imagine things that are not real’ – which seems something of atautology – and ‘something that only exists or happens in your mind’. TheCambridge Dictionary says that imagination is ‘the ability to form pictures inthe mind’ and that it concerns ‘something that you think exists or is true,although in fact is not real or true’. Imagination is of course also creative.Roget’s Thesaurus calls it the ‘power to create in one’s mind,’ and samples ofthe synonyms it provides range from ‘artistry,’ ‘awareness,’ and ‘inspiration’,to ‘ingenuity,’ ‘insight’ and ‘creativity’.I believe imagination is one of those things which we all know immediately butwhich, as I’ve said, we would find difficult to define. Indeed, an exactdefinition of it would only make it more obscure.35[part0005_split_001.html#rw-num-note-35] Nevertheless, here I will offer my owndefinition of imagination. It is not necessarily exclusive of others; I give itto emphasise what I take to be imagination’s central work, and also to makeclear how it is a different way of understanding the imagination. I take it fromColin Wilson, who in his own work explored the evolutionary potential ofimagination. Imagination, he said, is ‘the ability to grasp realities that arenot immediately present’. Not an escape from reality, or a substitute for it,but a deeper engagement with it. We could also say that imagination is simplyour ability to grasp reality, or even, in some strange way, to create it, or atleast to collaborate in its creation. For the moment let us limit ourselves tothe first formulation.It is because we need imagination to grasp reality – that part of it immediatelybefore us, and its wider horizons that exceed the reach of our physical senses –that we can speak of a ‘knowledge’ of the imagination. Imagination has a noeticcharacter; it is the source and medium of our other way of knowing. It shows usaspects and dimensions of reality that we would miss without it – and whichmuch, if not most of official Western culture has missed since the new way ofknowing became dominant. While it can be used for fantasy, illusion,make-believe, and escapism, the real work of imagination is to make contact withthe strange world in which we live and to serve as both guide and inspirationfor our development within it. It is the way we evolve. Imagination presents uswith possible, potential realities that it is our job to actualise. It alsopresents us with a world that would not be complete without our help.Let us look then for this lost knowledge of the imagination, and see how much ofit we can find.NOTES1 [part0005_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-1] Karl Jaspers, Way to Wisdom, RalphManheim, trans.

It is a world that exists ‘outside’ us, an‘objective’ world, as we say, of solid, independent, discrete ‘objects’ or‘things’ laid out in what we call ‘space’ and happening in what we call ‘time’.Some of these things we see make up what we call ‘Nature’: trees, clouds,mountains, stars, rivers, oceans, valleys. We know that something along theselines most likely exists in other areas of space and did exist at other pointsof time, and we assume that they will exist in the future. We have yet to findlife on any other planet, and what we have learned about the planets closest tous makes them sound rather inhospitable. But while we might not find trees orrivers or cities on the surface of Mars, whatever we do find there, or anywhereelse, will exist, just as what we encounter here on Earth does, ‘outside’ us.Some of the things we see are living – plant life, animals, and other peoplelike ourselves. Indeed, for someone else, we are ‘objectively there’, just asthey are for us – something it may take an effort of imagination to grasp. Andsome of the things we see, perhaps most these days, are ‘man made’. They are not‘natural’ and only came into existence through the work of human beings. Thecities we live in, the airplanes overhead, the cars we drive in and the roadsthey follow, the computer I am writing this on and the television I will watchlater this evening: these, and many other things too obvious to mention, are theresult of human effort.All this seems clear and, as I say, too obvious to point out. We assume thatthis is the natural, given, normal way of things and that something like thismust have always been the case. The philosopher Edmund Husserl called seeing theworld in this way ‘the natural standpoint’. We really can’t help it. We seem tobe made this way. The world as I see it existed before I came on the scene andit will be here after I depart, and my entrance and exit will do little tochange it.In fact, according to the natural standpoint, the world was here before anyoneturned up and it will remain after the last flicker of consciousness, human orotherwise, dies out. When the first humans became self-conscious and gazed outon the world, we assume they saw it in the same way that we do, as something‘outside’ them. There were no buildings, no cities, no shopping malls, nohighways or airports. Our man-made world did not exist. But the natural worlddid, and the humans who were waking up to that world experienced it in much thesame way as we do today. We know a great deal more about the world than ourancestors did, in the sense of our new way of knowing, and this knowledge iswhat sets us apart from them. It’s what constitutes our ‘progress’. But theworld our prehistoric ancestors experienced and the one we do today are thesame. We just understand it better than they did.This is the conventional picture of our relationship vis-à-vis the world and itspast and it is one that most of us do not question. We see no reason to questionit as it seems too obvious to doubt. Some people do question it, and dependingon how they express their doubts we call them poets, or philosophers, ormystics, or madmen; Husserl, whom we’ve mentioned, was one of them. We willreturn to them shortly; for the most part they make an exception to the rule andin any case, no one pays much attention to them. The general consensus remains.There is the world outside, and there is me, or at least my consciousness,‘inside’ my head, just as there is your consciousness inside yours.I say that at least my consciousness is ‘inside my head’ because, as mentioned,the head in which my consciousness is supposed to reside is, as the rest of mybody is, a part of the ‘outside’ world. It is part of the outside world to otherpeople, but strangely it is also part of the outside world to me. I can see myhead in a mirror and hold it in my hands, but I can’t see my inside or touch itin any way.1 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-36] I can, in the interests ofscience, allow my head to be opened and its interior inspected. The strangething here is that the ‘inside’ that I believe is there, and which I experienceall the time, won’t be found. What the scientists examining me will find is mybrain, a soggy lump of densely convoluted organic matter weighing about threepounds, the work of whose different hemispheres we discussed in the lastchapter. If, in the further interest of science, I allow this mass of greymatter to be opened as well, my inside will still not be found. This has ledmany prestigious people to declare that the inside I am looking for doesn’treally exist. It is an illusion somehow created by the physical processes takingplace in my brain, whether the neurochemical exchanges going on between itssynapses, or something further down, at the molecular or sub-atomic level.2[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-37] In any case it is an ‘outside’phenomenon that somehow gives rise to my experiencing an ‘inside’.3[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-38]My inside is the only one I know directly, the only one of which I have anyimmediate experience. I assume that the other people I see when I look out intothe world have an inside much like my own, but I cannot know this directly. YetI must assume that their inside is more or less like mine; for one thing, lifewould be very difficult if I didn’t. Our inner furnishings may differ – we allhave different ideas, memories, fantasies, thoughts – but the general floorplanof our interiors must be the same.We can say that each of our own independent ‘insides’ consists of two parts.This is of course an oversimplification but for our immediate purposes here itwill serve. We can say that one part of our inside is a kind of mirror with asort of camera attachment, that reflects the world and also takes snapshots ofit. The other part is a storeroom where I keep the pictures. This in a nutshellis the picture of our inside, our consciousness, that has been accepted sincethe philosopher René Descartes first proposed something like it in hisMeditations on First Philosophy, published in 1641. It has certainly beendominant since John Locke, who followed Descartes, argued that there ‘is nothingin the mind that was not first in the senses’, as he did in his Essay On HumanUnderstanding, published in 1689. Both works appeared in the early days of ournew way of knowing, and in fact were instrumental in establishing it. Lockeactually disagreed with Descartes. Descartes believed that our storeroomcontained some items that were there before we started taking photographs. Hecalled these ‘innate ideas’. Locke didn’t believe in innate ideas, but thedisagreement he had with Descartes is less important here than what they had incommon.According to Locke and philosophers like David Hume who came after him, ourinside is empty until we start taking pictures and putting them in thestoreroom, rather like a new flat is empty until we go to Ikea and fill it upwith stuff, or a mirror is blank until we put something in front of it.4[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-39] I can reach into this storeroom andfind some of the photographs I’ve taken. This is called memory. Most of thetime, these photographs float around as it were, and come to me – whoever thatis – unbidden, often when I don’t want them. But when I do I can retrieve someof them, even if they are not as vivid or clear as when I first took them. And Ican move the photographs around and even cut them up and rearrange them, as anartist makes a collage. This produces something ‘new’, in the sense that what Iarrive at wasn’t originally photographed in that form. But it is made up ofthings that I did originally photograph. So it is not so much new content, but anew or different arrangement of old content.As we will see, this is the distinction that the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridgemade between fantasy and imagination, with fantasy doing collage work, andimagination creating something that is truly ‘new’. For Coleridge a unicorn or aflying pig is a product of fantasy, of putting together different bits andpieces of our snapshots. True imagination is something else. But if Locke isright, then it is difficult to see how we can have anything other than fantasy,a point we will return to.In his attempt to secure some indubitable nugget of certainty, necessary for usto truly understand the world, Descartes arrived at his famous formula, Cogitoergo sum: he thought, therefore he was. While he could doubt everything else inhis experience as possibly an illusion created by some demon, he could not doubthis own existence, for in order to be tricked by a demon, he would have toexist. For Descartes this provided an Archimedean point from which he coulderect a new model of the universe, or at least of our experience of it, and wehonour him by coupling his name with Newton’s as one of the creators of themodern world.Descartes secured his certainty, at least to his own satisfaction, but at aprice. The cost was the split between mind and matter, or more immediately, mindand body, our inside and outside, that has hampered human understanding eversince. After much meditation Descartes decided that there were two fundamentalkinds of things in reality, or in fact two realities, what he called rescogitans and res extensa, ‘thinking’ or ‘knowing’ things, and ‘extended’ things.This was the knowing mind and what it knows, or, in our terms here, our insideand the outside, consciousness and the external world.We need not follow Descarte’s argument; his conclusion is what matters. Itmatters because there seemed to be no clear, comprehensible way that these twodifferent things could ‘interact’, as we say – a problem neuroscientists andphilosophers of mind still encounter when they consider how one gets from aneuron, which is physical, to a thought, which is not, what is known as the‘hard problem’.Descartes believed that the two realities did interact – they had to, as weexperienced this in ourselves all the time – and he thought that this happenedin a tiny organ in the brain called the pineal gland. This is located behind thethird ventricle and strangely, this is also where in ancient Hindu tradition the‘third eye’ is found, the ‘opening’ of which triggers mystical vision.5[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-40] Descartes laboured hard to find a wayfor the two realities to get together there, but ultimately he did not manageit. The task was taken up by others, notably the eighteenth century Swedishscientist and religious philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg, although he tooeventually gave it up.6 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-41] It was in factSwedenborg’s failure to find ‘the seat of the soul’ in the brain that led to hisabandoning science and the beginning of what we can call his ‘visionary’ period,during which he made several visits to heaven, hell and an intermediary spherehe called the spirit world.7 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-42] More onthis later.Descartes’ failure to find the ‘seat of the soul’ and his method of radicaldoubt started what Colin Wilson called a ‘forest fire’ in Western philosophythat ended by ‘consuming everything’, a catastrophe from which philosophy isstill recovering.8 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-43] One thing Descartes’blaze did eventually consume was our ‘inside’. In a way this made sense, as hehad already got rid of an inside to everything else. The outer world, for him,was really just a machine, moved by purely physical forces; even animals werereally only machines, or what we would call robots. They only appeared to sufferpain or to express emotions; in reality they were empty mechanisms, moved solelyby the push and pull of cause and effect. Our own bodies were subject to thesame mechanical laws, but Descartes ring-fenced our subjectivity, our inside,protecting it temporarily from the fire he had started.Others were less delicate. Through what seemed an irrevocable process, the rescogitans started to lose ground. This was inevitable, given the success of thenew way of knowing, which recognised only ‘objective’, quantifiable, positivelyidentifiable things that could be measured. Pascal’s ‘thinking reed’ – his imageof humankind – became a recording device, dependent on input from the outerworld in order to function, a kind of ‘penny in the slot’ machine. Sensory inputcame in, and we responded accordingly. Eventually our inside became nothing morethan a ‘ghost in the machine’, as the philosopher Gilbert Ryle famously calledit in his book The Concept of Mind, and which Arthur Koestler used as the titleof his book attacking the kind of reductive philosophy Ryle championed.Since then many have tried to lay the ghost to rest, and I have written aboutsome of their attempts elsewhere.9 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-44] Manybelieve they have finally exorcised it. Yet many disagree, and dismiss the ideaof a ‘ghost’ entirely, saying rather it is the machine that is unreal. One ofthese dissenters was the literary scholar and philosopher of language, OwenBarfield.To those other than his many readers, Owen Barfield is perhaps best known asbeing the great friend of C.S. Lewis. He is also known to fans of J.R.R. Tolkienas being a member of the Inklings, the name given to a literary pub gathering inOxford that included Tolkien, Lewis, and also Charles Williams, a Dante scholar,member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and author of some stillreadable ‘esoteric thrillers’. Still others may know of Barfield through hiswritings about the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner. Barfield lived to the ripe ageof ninety-nine; I met him in 1996, shortly before he died, and conducted what Ibelieve was the last interview with him.10[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-45]Barfield began his career in 1926, with his first book History in English Words.His last, History, Guilt, and Habit, was published in 1981. In the interveningyears Barfield wrote much else, including poetry and novels, but his themeremained the same. As he told me during our interview, he was what thephilosopher Isaiah Berlin called a ‘hedgehog,’ who knows one big thing, incontrast with the ‘fox’, who knows many things. This was the reason why, hesaid, he had written the same book over and over for fifty years.11[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-46] The one big thing that Barfield knewwas what he called ‘the evolution of consciousness’, which he saw as ‘theconcept of man’s self-consciousness as a process in time’.12[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-47] And he had come to know this through astudy of language.Like imagination and consciousness, language seems to be one of those thingsthat Whitehead said were ‘incapable of analysis in terms of factors morefar-reaching than themselves’. We may think we know how language ‘works’. Wemust know, we believe, because we use it all the time. But when we try to spellthis out explicitly, we quickly find ourselves confronting a mystery. Barfieldexpressed something of this difficulty when he said that ‘asking about theorigin of language is like asking about the origin of origin’.13[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-48] In order to talk about imagination wemust use imagination and in order to talk about language we must use language.We can’t get behind them or stand apart from them, as detached observers, as wecan with something in the physical world, but must understand them from‘inside’. That, in fact, is what Barfield set out to do.Barfield’s investigation into language began when he was a schoolboy. His Latinclass was given an assignment in syntax and asked to analyse the sentence: Cato,octoginta annos natus, excessit e vita. A bare English translation is: ‘Cato,eighty years of age, departed this life’, meaning that he died. That would havebeen correct, but a schoolfriend of Barfield added some dash. ‘Cato,’ he said,‘at the age of eighty, walked out of life.’ That, Barfield’s friend said, was a‘rather nice’ way of putting it.14 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-49]Barfield agreed. It was rather nice. In fact, it was more than nice. Putting itthat way had a strange living character to it that conveyed more than the bareinformation that the great Roman historian died at the age of eighty. It addedcolour and movement, freshness and a kind of vitality. It was what we call‘figurative language’, a metaphor, and at that moment Barfield first realisedthat one could enjoy metaphors and figures of speech – language itself in fact –for its own sake, and not only as a means of communicating something. Some yearslater Barfield found that the metaphors that he enjoyed most came from lyricpoetry and the Romantic poets; that is, poetry about the poet’s inner world, hisfeelings and emotions. As he said in a lecture he gave on the subject, thesemetaphors would bear ‘not merely reading and enjoying’. There was something moreto them. ‘One could somehow dwell on them.’ They altered the way in which he sawthe world; it became ‘a profounder and a more meaningful place when seen througheyes that had been reading poetry’. Poetry, he found, ‘had the power to changeone’s consciousness a little’.15 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-50]Exactly how it can change consciousness and why, was something Barfield wasdetermined to understand.Before I continue I should perhaps make clear what a metaphor is. Like languageand imagination, metaphors are something we use all the time but rarely notice,unless, like Barfield, we have a keen ear or eye for them. My Oxford Dictionarytells me that a metaphor is ‘the application of a name or description tosomething to which it is not literally applicable’. The Cambridge Dictionarytells me it is ‘an expression, often found in literature, that describes aperson or object by referring to something that is considered to have similarcharacteristics to that person or object’. Other sources give similardefinitions.We can say that a metaphor is something that stands for, or takes the place of,something else, to which it is related, but not in an obvious way. It issomething more than a sign. A sign is merely an indicator, pointing towardsomething. It does not add to our understanding of it. A metaphor points to whatit stands for, but it also brings out or allows more ‘meaning’ to emerge fromits subject, a meaning that is in addition to the bare information it provides.In this way it is more like a symbol, which can have multiple meanings, than asign which has only one.Literalness, we can say, is using language solely with its exact, explicitmeaning and nothing else. It is a very ‘left brain’ way of speaking; the leftbrain has a difficult time with metaphors but for the right they aren’t aproblem. If you told a very literal person that a friend was so happy that hewas ‘over the moon’, he would very likely say: ‘That’s impossible. Where did heget the rocket from?’ For a literal person a rose is a rose is a rose andnothing else. For a person with a metaphorical mind a rose can be many things.If you told a very literal person that someone exploded with anger, he wouldlook for the pieces. If you told him a pretty woman’s face bloomed, he wouldlook for the petals.Many science fiction stories have scenes in which a robot or android or someother very ‘logical’ individual – think of Star Trek’s Mr Spock – is at a lossto understand the metaphorical speech of humans. These scenes aim to elicit somehumour in the contrast between the ‘cold’ logic of the robot and the ‘warm’feeling of the humans. But we can do the same thing whenever we point tometaphors that we use regularly but no longer recognise as metaphors. They havehardened, as it were, into stock phrases, whose figurative character no longermakes an impact, the kind of impression young Barfield felt when hearing of Cato‘walking out of life’.Much of our language is made up of these ‘dead metaphors’, and this has beenpointed out by thinkers such as Emerson and Nietzsche. Emerson spoke of clichésas ‘fossilised poetry’ and Nietzsche used a metaphor himself, saying such wordsand phrases are like coins whose faces have been worn down by use. We havebecome so used to them that we forget that they once had a ‘living’ character.Barfield points this out using the phrase ‘to leave no stone unturned’, meaningan exhaustive search for something. Originally, it conveyed an image of someoneflipping over stones with a pickaxe, but today we hardly think of this andrecognise the phrase as a cliché. So, if in discussing some old affair, someoneremarked that it was so long ago that it was ‘water under the bridge’, we couldhave a ‘Mr Spock moment’ by asking ‘what bridge?’ You get the picture? – whichis, of course, only another metaphor.This excursion into metaphor is important because metaphor plays a central rolein Barfield’s recognition that language provides evidence of an evolution ofconsciousness. Jumping ahead a bit we can say that for Barfield metaphor is away of seeing the ‘inside’ of things, and not only their surface, which is whatliteral language limits itself to. Barfield will argue that, just as themetaphors we use harden over time and lose their living character, so too ourlanguage as a whole has gone through the same process. It started out as‘living’ and able to express the inside of the world, and over time lost itsvitality and become limited to only the surface of things. What Barfield wantsto say is that this has been the case because the way we perceive the world haschanged over time, which means that our consciousness has changed. It hasshifted, as the literary scholar Erich Heller said, from speaking poetry tospeaking prose.16 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-51]At an earlier time, Barfield argues, humans perceived the world in a way that wetoday would say was very metaphorical, very figurative, and very poetical. We nolonger see it that way, or do so only when stimulated by poetry, or if we alterour consciousness through some means, usually drugs or alcohol. Poetry and winehave long been linked, and they are fellow travellers because both can alter ourperception of things. Both inspire the reflection that the world is more‘interesting’ than we normally give it credit for being.Barfield arrived at this insight by looking at the history of language. What hediscovered, and spelled out in History in English Language and another earlywork, Poetic Diction, is that if we look back into the language of an earlierperiod, we see that it is more figurative than our own. This is why such earlylanguage can have the same effect on us as lyrical poetry has, of brieflyshowing us the world in a different way – in other words, changing ourconsciousness. As Barfield says: ‘Almost any kind of language in fact that isexpressing a consciousness essentially different from our own’ can have thiseffect.17 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-52] In lyric poetry the poet isconsciously, or at least purposefully, aiming at creating striking metaphorsthat can convey the feelings, the inner experience, he wants to express. Living,figurative language is something he strives for. But in older language, thelanguage of the past, this living character is simply there, in the languageitself. It was not striven for, as the poet strives for it. It is just a part oflanguage. The poet aims at altering our consciousness by using strikingmetaphors. The old language didn’t aim at doing this, but it nevertheless did.Old language, Barfield saw, was doing by itself, what ‘poetic language’ aimed atdoing intentionally.The kinds of metaphor that made the strongest impression on Barfield, as they doon most readers of poetry, are the kinds that use a material image to express animmaterial idea. Barfield refers to the poet Shelley saying that the West Windhas made him its lyre.18 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-53] What Shelleymeans is that he has been inspired by the wind to break out into song, not thathe has been turned into an ancient musical instrument by it. A literal-mindedperson would have told Shelley that he didn’t look at all like a lyre. The lyreis a material image that captures the immaterial change in Shelley’sconsciousness.All of this got Barfield thinking about the roots of language and its relationto consciousness and to the world. Along with recognising that the further backwe go in language, the more metaphorical and figurative it is, Barfield alsosaw, as other language philosophers have, that words today that have an abstractor immaterial content started out with more material origins. I spoke of Shelleybeing ‘inspired’ by the west wind. We think of inspiration as an immaterialthing, as a sudden impetus to creative activity. Yet ‘inspire’ is rooted in‘spirit’ and means having the spirit put into you, while ‘spirit’ itself isrooted in a term for ‘breath’.19 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-54] Westill acknowledge this root when we speak of alcohol as ‘spirits’, referring tothe fumes given off by it. ‘Impetus’ itself, which we think of as ‘motivation’has its roots in ‘force’ or ‘energy’, while motivation itself begins as thatwhich gets us ‘moving’. If you have ‘grasped’ what I have just written, that isa material image of a hand grabbing something, which we take as meaning we‘understand’ it. ‘Under/standing’ itself is a material image of a mentalprocess.This idea, that our words for immaterial things started out as referring tomaterial ones, led some nineteenth century language theorists to some importantbut questionable conclusions about its origins. Referring to what thephilosopher Jeremy Bentham called our ‘immaterial vocabulary’ they said ineffect that in the beginning ‘immaterial meanings … began their life … by havingpurely material meanings, which were then extended by metaphor’.20[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-55]In other words, there were no ‘real’ immaterial things, then or now, justmaterial things made to seem immaterial through the magic of metaphor.What this seemed to say was that the language that we experience as figurativeoriginally began as non-figurative, as, in other words, literal, and was then‘worked on’, made figurative, and that is what we have inherited. From thispoint of view, all language in fact started in this way. Yet Barfield felt thatthis seemed not to chime with the evidence that language presents itself. Thisview suggested that language began as grunts and groans, either in an attempt toimitate natural sounds, or as a way of expressing surprise or some otheremotion, what Barfield calls the ‘bow wow’ and ‘ooh aah’ theories. Out of theseprimitive sounds meaningful words were supposed to have arisen.This seemed a common sense view, although the people espousing it failed to showhow ‘meaning’ can have come from a consciousness that was assumed to be bereftof it, given that they more or less accepted John Locke’s view of our ‘inside’.It was assumed that grunts and groans were at some point transformed intomeaningful words, designating material objects, that is, into literal language.Then at some point, a rash of ‘prehistoric poets’ got to work on this literallanguage and ‘morphed’ it into figurative language. Why they did this no oneever quite answered; we just have to assume a whole generation of ancientliterary stylists simultaneously getting to work.We have no record of this taking place, as the language that has come down to usarrived after this supposed ‘age of metaphor’. Yet we must assume it happened.This was the only possible answer to the evidence language presented itself:that, as we’ve seen, the further back we go, the more metaphorical it is. Pokingfun at the great Orientalist Max Müller, who can stand for the conventionallanguage theorists he is questioning, Barfield writes that ‘although when hemoves backwards through the history of language, he [Müller] finds it becomingmore and more figurative with every step, yet he has no hesitation in assuming aperiod – still further back – when it was not figurative at all!’21[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-56] It is in order to account for thisdiscrepancy that Müller and his fellow theorists have to call in a race of‘amateur poets’ who, in the ‘infancy of society’, got to work churning outmetaphors by the dozen.But as Barfield knew, no one has drilled through the layers of metaphor thatsupposedly obscure our original non-figurative Ur-language and revealed this inall its primal literal glory. No matter how far back we go, we hit the wall offigurative language – literally.Barfield realised that all of the theorists who held to this view started outwith the same premise, an unvoiced one. In hindsight it seems inevitable thatthey should have done so; nevertheless, it has caused a great deal of confusion.The premise is the view of the world with which I began this chapter. Theyassumed, as we all do, that the world our prehistoric ancestors came toself-awareness in was exactly like the world we see today. Our man-madecontributions to it were not, of course, available. But in all other regards itwas the same. They saw the world, as we do, from Husserl’s ‘natural standpoint’,as something ‘outside’, distinctly external to themselves. They saw it in theliteral way that we do, when we are not speaking figuratively. For them a rosewas a rose and nothing more – at least that’s what it was after they came upwith the name for it.To this assumption the language theorists added another. As Barfield pointedout, this quest for the origin of language took place in a Darwinian climate.Evolution through natural selection was the rage, and Müller and other languagetheorists worked on the assumption that human consciousness had emerged from apurely animal one, from, that is, ‘a consciousness to which any notion ofmeaning was inapplicable’. As Barfield writes:The human being, it was assumed, first awoke to self-awareness to find himselfsurrounded by a world of sharply defined objects; and that self-awarenessgradually increased as he learned to control and manipulate these objects in thecourse of the struggle for existence, the struggle for survival.22[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-57]The most effective tool for his survival that early man hit upon was speech. Soit was the pressure of having to survive that turned our prehistoric ancestors’grunts and groans into meaningful literal speech. Once that was settled, aswe’ve seen, a cadre of poetical cavemen got to work inventing scores ofmetaphors, forever blocking our encounter with that primal matter-of-facttongue.It was practically impossible for the language theorists at the time to look atthe situation in any other way. The unquestioned assumption that the trajectorythat Darwin and his followers charted for human evolution was the obviouslycorrect one compelled them to do so. How else could language have developed?Barfield had some ideas about that. For the purposes of speculation let usassume, he thought, that the prehistoric poets who turned the originally literalmother tongue into a metaphorical one, did not exist. Where does that leave us?For one thing, we would have to accept that, rather than starting out literaland then mysteriously being made metaphoric, language was metaphoric, that isfigurative, to begin with. This would mean that our first speakers did not beginwith matter-of-fact explicit designations for things, that later becamefigurative, but that their speech was figurative from the start. This would meanthat it had the living, vital character that Barfield loved in lyric poetry andhad discovered in older language.Assuming this, what does it suggest? It suggested to Barfield that perhaps theworld the first speakers were talking about was not like the world we see today– and again, not in the obvious way that there were mammoths in it rather thanautomobiles and lush virgin forests rather than car parks. Perhaps languagebegan as figurative because the world itself then was more like how it is whenwe speak of it figuratively than how it is when we are being literal? This wouldmean that the first speakers spoke poetry, although they would not have thoughtof it this way. Poetry for us is a ‘special’ use of language, or at least itused to be, before the idea of poetry as either fractured prose or rawself-expression took hold sometime in the twentieth century. We have to go outof our way to write poetry, whereas prose, as Erich Heller observed, is ourdefault setting for language.23 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-58] Thefirst speakers then would not have been poets as we understand them, but theywould have seen the world and experienced it in a way that we today wouldconsider ‘poetical’. Speaking of the philosopher Hegel, who thought of the pastas a ‘fundamentally poetic state of the world’, Erich Heller writes that thiswas a world:… in which poetry is not merely written, but, as it were, lived. The activeintervention and participation of gods in the lives of mortals; groves andsprings and hills as the habitats of nymphs and fauns; the poetic comprehensionof life was at that time not a matter of the poetic imagination at work in theminds of a few chosen individuals, of artists … but was ‘natural’, a matter offact, of ways of thinking and feeling shared by the whole community.24[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-59]‘It is not absurd to say’, Heller continues, ‘that in such a world ourdistinctions between imagination and fact were of little importance, if notunknown’. Heller remarks that it was reflections like these that led a youngNietzsche ‘to accuse the first great analytical rationalist of Greece, Socrates,the indefatigable questioner, of having destroyed mythology …’25[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-60]We can say that the distinction between imagination and fact that Heller refersto as ours, started around the time of Jaspers’ ‘Axial Age’ with the rise ofrational thought and the move away from mythology. It achieved a kind of optimumform or apogee with Socrates and Plato (who still retained a good portion of theolder mythological view), and then gradually began to atrophy; we can say thatthe hardening started with Aristotle. According to the philosopher Jean Gebser,it entered what he called its ‘deficient mode’ around the time of theRenaissance, and we can say that this reached a kind of manic intensity with thenew way of knowing that appeared in the early seventeenth century and hasdominated the Western mind ever since.26[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-61] What we can see here, and what Barfieldcharts in his ‘evolution of consciousness’, is the gradual loss of an immediateawareness of the ‘inside’ of things, and our arrival at a point in which wedoubt even the reality of the one inside we are sure of, or at least used to be– our own.I don’t think Barfield knew of Heller’s work, or that Heller knew of his; atleast I’ve not seen the one reference the other in any of their books. Yet bothhit on the same idea: that our earliest perception and encounter with the worldwas one much more like poetry than prose, one that we would call much more‘imaginative’ than how we see the world today. Yet, as Heller says, echoingBarfield, it is a mistake to give the credit for this to the poetic imaginationof a few individuals. No one ‘made’ it that way. It was ‘natural’, ‘matter offact’, and shared by entire communities. And here we have a neat turnaround.As we have noted, early language theorists say that our speech started out asliteral, as matter of fact, and then somehow became poetic. Heller is saying:‘No, it started out poetic, but such poetic language was “matter of fact” forthe people at the time, and it then only gradually became prosaic’. I turn to myOxford Dictionary and I find that ‘matter-of-fact’ means ‘unimaginative,prosaic, unemotional’. Other definitions include ‘dry’, ‘commonplace’,‘straightforward’, ‘down-to-earth’, ‘everyday’. So what we seem to have here isa way of being in the world that to us would seem ‘imaginative’ but which to thepeople experiencing it would seem ‘business as usual’. They saw the world in away very different from our own, but to them it was ‘normal’.What was their ‘normal’? If the figurative character, what Barfield calls the‘presence of living imagery’, that we find in early language was not ‘made’, asit is today by poets (those, of course, still writing true poetry), how did itcome about? Barfield says it was just there in the language. It was a given kindof meaning, a given kind of imagery, just as the static, literal world we seefrom the ‘natural standpoint’ is given to us when we open our eyes. And if thisliving imagery was ‘given’ – was ‘the case’, as the philosopher Wittgenstein mayhave put it – along with the ‘imaginal meaning in the earliest words’, one wantsto ask who gave it?27 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-62]‘There must have been going on,’ Barfield says, ‘not only a different kind ofthinking but a different kind of perceiving’. He continues: ‘the picturequality, the given meanings must have been present not only in the perceiver butalso in what he perceived; it must have been present in fact in the world aroundhim’ [my italics]. Barfield then goes on to make his central point, a veryimportant part of his ‘one big thing’. ‘There must have been,’ he says, ‘a kindof participation between perceiver and perceived, between man and nature’. Thismeans that we must envision a kind of world in which the strict separation ofinside and outside, subjective and objective, living and dead, fact andimagination that we experience was not the case.We no longer experience this, Barfield acknowledges, except for the brief tastesof it we have through our imagination. I would add to this that a determinedattempt to completely exorcise ‘participation’ from our consciousness began withthe rise of our new way of knowing in the seventeenth century.28[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-63] But we can get a glimpse of it, asBarfield says, ‘through the creative imagination of a modern painter or poet’.29[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-64] To this list we can also add the use ofcertain substances whose effect, I would argue, is to put our consciousness backinto this earlier, participatory state. I mentioned wine earlier; that there aremore powerful and risky substances is common knowledge today. Poetry and art maybe less immediately powerful than these, but their use, as it were, is whollybeneficial, and the change they bring about longer lasting.Barfield contends that language emerged from this ‘participation’ and could bebest described at its beginning as ‘nature speaking through man, rather than manspeaking about nature’.30 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-65] Man then was‘spoken into being before he himself began to speak’, a phrase that isreminiscent of the philosopher Heidegger’s remarks that ‘language is the houseof being’ and that ‘language speaks man’, rather than the other way around.31[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-66] Language developed, according toBarfield, because what he calls ‘original participation’ dwindled over time.This evolution of language, Barfield believes, took the ‘form of a contractionof meaning and therefore of consciousness – an evolution from wide and vague tonarrow and precise, and from what was peripherally based to what is centrallybased’.32 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-67] Elsewhere Barfield speaks ofa shift from a ‘vague but immediate awareness of the “meaning” of phenomena’ –that is, nature – ‘towards an increasing preoccupation with the phenomenathemselves,’ and of a ‘contraction of human consciousness from periphery tocentre – a contraction from the cosmos of wisdom to something like a purelybrain activity’.33 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-68] In terms oflanguage, this is the shift from a figurative, poetic kind of speech to aprosaic one.This shift from the ‘wide and vague’ to the ‘narrow and precise’ seems similarto the shift from a right brain way of knowing to a left brain one that weremarked on in the previous chapter. It also suggests a movement from ametaphorical thinking to a more literal kind and reminds us once again of whatwas said earlier about the ‘two permanent needs of human nature’.What it also suggested to Barfield is that it is meaningless to ask about the‘origin’ of language, at least in the way that early language theorists thoughtof this. They thought of language appearing in a world already ‘there’, a worldlike the one they themselves inhabited. As we’ve seen, Barfield says this iswrong. Language did not appear at some point in a world already given; languageand ‘the world’ that we know emerged simultaneously as two separate phenomena asa result of the loss of original participation, that is of a prior unityencompassing both. And that loss of original participation itself resulted inthe polarity of inner and outer worlds that we experience today. Consciousness,from being spread out and interfused – as Wordsworth would say – with its worldbegan to contract, to become more definite by becoming more limited, finding itshome more and more within the confines of our skulls.34[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-69] As Barfield writes in Saving theAppearances, in original participation ‘man was a part of nature in a way whichwe today … find it difficult to conceive’. What nascent sense of self there wasknew that ‘it and the phenomena’ – that is, the natural world – came from whatBarfield calls the ‘same supersensible source’. It was aware of its link to itssurroundings through an inner sense, not the outer ones. Man’s soul, Barfieldsays, was not yet his own, meaning that his inside was not yet his ‘privateproperty’ as it appears to be for us. As Barfield writes, the further back wego, the ‘more indistinguishable’ would human ‘acts and utterances become fromprocesses taking place in what has since become “outer” nature’.35[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-70]Slowly, Barfield says, the human psyche ‘gradually drew forth its own meaningfrom the meaning of its environment’. It began to separate itself and it was inthis process that the polarity ‘man’ and ‘world’ came into being.36[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-71] So, from this point of view, there wasno ‘origin of language’ separate from an ‘origin of the world’ and ‘origin ofman’. All three were part of the same evolution. This is why Barfield says thatlooking for the origin of language is like looking for the origin of origin.37[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-72] ‘Speech did not arise as the attempt ofman to imitate, to master or to explain “nature”’, Barfield says. ‘Speech andnature came into being along with one another’.38[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-73] There was no world separate fromourselves until language could speak it.Many have bemoaned the loss of this Adamic speech, the Ursprache spoken in Eden,with which Man gave names to God’s creation, when word and world were one. Andthe change in consciousness that so delighted Barfield as he read the Romanticpoets was precisely a return of this lost participation, coupled with theawareness of self that was gained by its loss. He ‘participated’ but he alsoknew that he did. This is what in Saving the Appearances Barfield calls ‘finalparticipation’. That is to say, the flash of ‘meaning’ that lyric poetryproduces, is not so much a plunge back into our earlier unconsciousparticipation, but a conscious grasp of it – a conscious experience of it –brought about by ‘mental activity’, that of the poet and the reader; that is,through their imagination.39 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-74] Thisproduces an ‘expansion’ of meaning rather than its ‘contraction,’ which is theresult of the drift into a literal way of seeing the world.40[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-75] It is a moment of what Colin Wilsoncalls ‘duo-consciousness’, and which Barfield, following Coleridge, calls‘polarity’.41 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-76]Barfield does not see our exit from Eden as a ‘fall’ so much as a necessarysacrifice in order to achieve self-consciousness. What has happened though, isthat what began as a necessary polarisation into an inside and outside has, withthe new way of knowing appearing in the seventeenth century, become an‘exclusive disjunction’. The polarisation of inner and outer, necessary forhuman self-consciousness, has now widened into a true rift, what Whiteheadcalled a ‘bifurcation’, meaning a division. And as we’ve seen, this had led manyto doubt the existence of our inside at all. The outer, phenomenal world, withwhich at some unconscious source we are joined, has become for us a completelyalien ‘other’. By forgetting its unity with ourselves we have turned it, asBarfield says, into an ‘idol’. And we have so succumbed to our ‘idolatry’ thatrather than understand the world in terms of our consciousness – which forBarfield are pari passu, two sides of the same thing – we work diligently toexplain consciousness in terms of the world; that is, to explain our inside interms of the outside. This, for Barfield, is like trying to explain the originof language in the way that the earlier language theorists did, with a worldquite like ours in which primitive man was prodded by his physical needs to turngrunts and groans into words and then to quickly work some metaphorical magic onthem. For them, there is only a physical world ‘out there’ that, in some stillinexplicable but soon to be clarified way, gave rise to our illusory world ‘inhere’.But Barfield saw that a vivid grasp of both our own inside and that of the worldcan be had through figurative language. This, as he says, allows us to seethrough one meaning of a word to another. It is this translucence that allowsfor the vaguer, indefinite, implicit meaning of things to be conveyed, whatBarfield sees as an inner meaning arising from an outer one.42[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-77] Literalism, precisely the lack ofimagination, wants to contend that the monotone opaque way in which it presentsthe world, showing only its surface, is the truth. But as Barfield points out,such literalism is the end product of an historical process, the shift from apoetic way of seeing the world to a prosaic one. Its success depends on itpurposefully ignoring a dimension of reality, its depth and inwardness.We can regain a sense of participation today, but it costs a certain effort.Meaning, Barfield tells us, cannot be conveyed directly from one person toanother; ‘words’, he says, ‘are not bottles.’ But we can intuit meaning forourselves, if we make a certain kind of effort, what Barfield calls a ‘specialexertion’ of the imagination.In the last chapter I spoke of a kind of imaginative knowledge that the Germanwriter Ernst Jünger described as a master key, that enables one to go to theheart of problem immediately. Jünger calls the act of doing this ‘stereoscopy’,a kind of double vision in which surface and depth are perceivedsimultaneously.43 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-78] He says its ‘actionconsists in grasping things with our inner claws’.44[part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-79] ‘True language, the language of poets,’Jünger writes, ‘is distinguished through words and images that are seized inthis manner’. Such words, ‘although they are long familiar to us, unfold likeflowers and appear to radiate an immaculate luster, a colourful music’, whatJünger calls a ‘secret harmony’.45 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-80]Such double vision, Jünger believes, allows us to overcome the dichotomy between‘the surface of life and its depths’.46 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-81]As it is now we move from one to the other – we can say from science to poetry –without being able to bring the two together. Often the depths seem merely themeans of creating the glittering surface, which we find beautiful andfascinating – Jünger himself was a keen entomologist, and a species of beetlethat he discovered is named after him. But at other times the surface seems‘composed only of signs and letters, through which the depths speak to us oftheir secrets’.47 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-82] Jünger reflects thatin a crystal, surface and depth appear simultaneously to the eye (we arereminded of Barfield’s use of the work ‘translucent’). A crystal, he says, can‘generate inner surfaces’ and can ‘turn its depth outwards,’ and Jünger wondersif the world itself is like a crystal, even if we perceive it in this way onlyseldom.48 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-83]Elsewhere I have written about the work of the eccentric French Egyptologist andalchemist, René Schwaller de Lubicz.49 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-84]In his own way and through a different route, Schwaller de Lubicz hit upon aninsight that I relate to Barfield’s ideas about language and ‘participation’.Schwaller spent years studying the Great Pyramid, the monuments at Luxor andKarnak, and other ancient sites, and he came to believe that their main purposewas to serve as compendia of esoteric knowledge, the kind of knowledge that wasresolutely rejected by the West in the seventeenth century. The ancientEgyptians had access to this knowledge through what Schwaller called ‘theintelligence of the heart’. In essence, like Barfield’s ‘participation’, theintelligence of the heart allowed the Egyptians – or at least their high priestsand those who designed their monuments – to see into the ‘inside’ of the world.What they saw there was a ‘cosmic harmony’, the balancing of the spiritualforces at work creating and maintaining the universe.Through the ‘intelligence of the heart’ Schwaller believed that the Egyptianscould participate with these forces. As he wrote in his oracular posthumous workNature Word – the title itself suggests a link to Barfield – with theintelligence of the heart we can ‘tumble with the rock that falls from themountain’, ‘seek light and rejoice with the rosebud about to open’, and ‘expandin space with the ripening fruit’.50 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-num-note-85]All of this, it seems to me, sounds very much like a world in which figurativelanguage was the norm.The Egyptians saw the world symbolically, Schwaller believed; for them it was akind of text to be interpreted. They were able to ‘read’ the world in this waythrough what Schwaller called symbolique. For him this meant an ability to holddifferent, sometimes contradictory ideas together simultaneously – somethingrather similar to Jünger’s ‘stereoscopy’. The hieroglyph of a bird stood for theanimal; that was its ‘outer’ meaning. But it also had another meaning, that ofthe ‘cosmic function’ of flight – and of this the bird itself was a livinghieroglyph. The symbol evoked this ‘cosmic function’ and one who read itproperly could participate in it, could feel the forces behind existence atwork, what the Egyptians called the neters. With symbolique one looked not onlyat the world, but into it.This ability to look into the world, to see it from the inside, is a centraltheme in the knowledge of the imagination. It recurs repeatedly throughout itshistory, appearing in many forms. In the next chapter we will look at how oneindividual, a poet and scientist, managed to regain a sense of our lostparticipation, and how from this he developed an entire philosophy of nature.NOTES1 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-36] This is a point that Maurice Nicollmade very well in his book Living Time (London: Watkins, 1981) in which heargues that we are, in essence, invisible.2 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-37] This is the conclusion of TorNorretrander’s The User Illusion (New York: Penguin, 1999), one of many bookswhose aim, as its subtitle tells us, is to ‘cut consciousness down to size’.3 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-38] If we think about this we can seethat it can lead to somewhat disturbing conclusions. One is that my ‘I’, mysense of self, a very important part of my inside, must not really exist. Normust those of the scientists and philosophers writing books declaring that myinside or theirs doesn’t really exist. What is really writing those books arethe physical processes that create the illusion that there are individual ‘I’s’doing it. But for there to be an illusion, there must be someone being ‘fooled’by it. The usual suspect here would be me. But if ‘I’ am the illusion, one wantsto ask who it is that I am fooling? Another possibility is that, if there is noinside, then everything, all of reality, must only be an outside. But here aresome logical problems here too. To have an ‘outside’ one must have an ‘inside’,just as in order to have a back one must have a front. Yet if there is no‘inside’, and so no ‘outside’ what are we left with?4 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-39] One criticism of this idea is thefact that unborn babies dream while still in the womb. If there is nothing inthe mind that was not first in the senses, one wants to ask what these unbornchildren are dreaming about, given that their senses are not yet working, atleast not in the way that they will be once they have left the womb. And even ifwe want to say that ‘No, their senses are working and they are internalisingsensations they receive through the mother’, one wants to ask how different anexperience their ‘waking’ and ‘sleeping’ can be? Engulfed in the warmth,darkness and comfort of the womb, there would not be a great deal for them to‘internalise’, very little, that is, for them to ‘photograph’. This suggeststhat these unborn dreamers may be dreaming about something like Jung’sarchetypes, inherent patterns of experience, they come ‘furnished’ with throughtheir biological inheritance.5 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-40] It is also linked to the productionof the neurotransmitter serotonin.6 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-41] Swedenborg, like Pascal, was anothergood geometer and intuiter.7 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-42] See Gary Lachman, Swedenborg: AnIntroduction to His Life and Ideas (New York: Tarcher/Penguin, 2009).8 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-43] Colin Wilson, Beyond the Outsider(Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1965) p. 51.9 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-44] Gary Lachman, A Secret History ofConsciousness (Great Barrington, MA: Lindisfarne Books, 2003) pp. xxi–xxxv.10 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-45] This interview was originallypublished in Lapis 3, 1996; it can be found in Gary Lachman Revolutionaries ofthe Soul (Wheaton, Il: Quest Books, 2014) pp. 43–82.11 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-46] The pairing comes from the Greekpoet Archilochus: ‘The fox knows many things, the hedgehog knows one big thing’.12 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-47] Owen Barfield, Romanticism Comes ofAge (Middleton, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1989) p. 189.13 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-48] Owen Barfield, Owen Barfield and theOrigin of Language (Spring Valley, NY: St. George Publications, 1976) p. 10.14 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-49] Barfield’s friend was Cecil Harwood,another member of the Inklings, a writer himself, and the founder of the firstWaldorf school in England, the ‘New School’ which subsequently became MichaelHall.15 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-50] Barfield 1976, p. 3.16 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-51] Erich Heller, In The Age of Prose(Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1984) ‘The age of prose: this meantthat … prose had become the ruling mode of perception’. p. 3.17 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-52] Ibid. p.7.18 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-53] ‘Make me they lyre, even as theforest is/What if my leaves are falling like its own?’19 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-54] This does raise some complicationswhen we consider that something we find ‘breathtaking’ – say some beautifulnatural scenery – can also being ‘inspiring’.

Hardly. It seems even that hasdeteriorated to the telegraphic Newspeak of text messaging and ‘snap chats’.Orwell’s nightmare of a language spoken by the larynx and not the mind – thatis, automatically and with reduced meaning – seems not too far off.24 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-59] Heller 1984, p. 3.25 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-60] Heller and Barfield were not theonly ones to consider this. The eighteenth-century Italian philosopherGiambattista Vico believed that human beings ‘danced before they walked’. Healso believed that ‘poetry came before prose, and that men naturally embodiedtheir feelings, attitudes, and thoughts in symbols’. According to thepsychologist Anthony Storr, whom I am quoting, ‘the metaphorical use oflanguage, according to Vico, preceded the literal or scientific’, and Storrmentions that a more recent philosopher, Martin Heidegger, felt the same.‘Poetry proper,’ Heidegger says, ‘is never merely a higher mode of everydaylanguage. It is the reverse: everyday language is a forgotten and thereforeused-up poem, from which there hardly resounds a call any longer’. In his essayon Vico, another philosopher, Isaiah Berlin – one not usually associated withHeidegger (and certainly not Barfield) – speaks similarly. ‘A world in which mennaturally talk of the lips of a vase, the teeth of a plough, the mouth of ariver, a neck of land, handfuls of one thing, the heart of another, veins ofminerals, bowels of the earth, murmuring waves, whistling winds and smilingskies, groaning tables and weeping willows {examples all take from Vico’sScienza Nuova} – such a world must be deeply and systematically different fromany in which such phrases are felt, even remotely, to be metaphorical, ascontrasted with so-called literal speech’. Anthony Storr, Music and the Mind(London: HarperCollins, 1997) pp. 12–13. Storr is quoting from Heidegger’s essay‘Language’, which is collected in Poetry, Language, and Thought (New York:HarperCollins, 2000) and Isaiah Berlin’s Vico and Herder (London: Hogarth Press,1976) pp. 46f. He also remarks that Jean Jacques Rousseau believed that theearliest languages were melodic and poetic rather than prosaic and practical.26 [part0006_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-61] Jean Gebser, The Ever-PresentOrigin, trans.

Hisfriends in Weimar, where he had been living at the court of the young Grand DukeKarl August – who had made Goethe a Privy Councillor some years earlier – weresurprised at his sudden departure, but Goethe brushed aside all concern aboutthis. Goethe could be an exemplar of urbanity and decorum, but if needsdemanded, he could also be rude. Weimar had become stifling. He had learned muchand developed significantly during his time there – and development wassomething that preoccupied Goethe profoundly – but he felt stalled, hemmed in byhis obligations and responsibilities. So, requesting a sudden leave of absencefrom the Duke, and speaking vaguely of a mineralogical excursion into the nearbymountains, Goethe, with minimum baggage, no servant, and an assumed name –Möller – headed south. He was gone for two years.His account of his travels, Goethe’s Italian Journey, not published until 1816,is a remarkable work, but it is not entirely one that a poet would be expectedto produce. It contains much of what the standard travel book should. Goetherelates encounters with the people he meets, talks about the unusual customs heis discovering, describes his experience viewing the ruins of classicalcivilisation and the great art that spans the centuries. He had some interestingencounters indeed: in Sicily he met the family of the great Freemason orcharlatan – depending on your perspective – Cagliostro, and while he was inNaples Vesuvius seemed to acknowledge his presence with an eruption. But readerscoming to the work without some prior knowledge of Goethe’s interests may besurprised at the scientific tone of much of the book. Goethe’s Italian Journeyis as much an account of scientific fieldwork as it is an account of a poet’stravels in a strange land, perhaps even more so.Surprising as this may sound, in Goethe’s case it really should not be, becauseGoethe considered himself a poet and a scientist. Indeed not long before hisdeath in 1832, Goethe told his friend Johann Peter Eckermann that he believedhis scientific work was more important than his poetry, an opinion notnecessarily shared by many others, scientists and poets included.1[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-86] If Owen Barfield was a hedgehog,holding tight to his one big thing, Goethe was most definitely a fox – one witha keen interest in many different things, one of which was science, or the‘natural philosophy’ out of which what we know as science emerged.Goethe’s Italian Journey is filled with precise descriptions of the topography,geology, minerals, meteorological conditions, animal behaviour and otherobjective ‘facts’ about the land he is travelling through. Consider a passagedescribing his entry to Bavaria. Stopping at the monastery of Waldsassen, Goethenotes the ‘saucer or basin-like hollow’ in which the monastery stands; the soil,which is a ‘decomposed clayey slate’, made ‘loose and fertile’ because of thequartz from the surrounding rock formations; and the gradual rise of the terrainand the movement of its streams towards ‘the Eger and the Elbe’. He remarks thathe can always get a ‘topographical idea of a region’ by noting the direction ofits streams, and then goes on to comment about the ‘first class high road ofgranite sand’ on which his coach finds itself rumbling.2[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-87]This is the kind of meticulous factual recording that we might expect from ageographer or mineralogist, but not necessarily from the poet who once spoke ofthe ‘inmost, sacred warmth of the life of Nature’ and of the ‘overwhelmingabundance’ he felt as the ‘glorious forms of infinite Creation moved’ in hissoul.3 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-88] In both cases – Werther andItaly – Goethe is writing about Nature, but the nature that appears in eachseems radically different. The Goethe who eagerly notes down the gradualmovement of a stream to its drainage basin and the one who warbles on about theeffect of nature on his soul seem two different people. Yet the nature beingwritten about and the person doing the writing are in each instance the same.When Goethe’s artist friends in Rome – the last leg of his journey – saw thebook years after his visit, they were appalled. He practically ignored many ofthe most well-known masterpieces, and his accounts of the ones he did see ledhis friends to say that ‘he must have gone through Italy blindfolded’, hisremarks about these works being either banal or seemingly wrongheaded.4[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-89] Goethe certainly hadn’t travelledthrough the land of the citrons with his eyes closed and in fact one of thethings Goethe went to Italy to do was to improve his drawing, and his study ofthe great works he did see helped him there. But although Goethe was, of course,a lover of classical art, a stronger passion grabbed him on his journey.As he found himself moving from Carlsbad to Verona, Venice, Naples and Rome, hesaw that he was more and more absorbed in his observations about thecountryside, its flora and fauna. His perception of nature had cooled somewhatfrom how he depicted it in the passion-soaked pages of Werther. He was of courseno longer the twenty-five year old whose novel about unrequited love ending insuicide triggered a rash of copycat self-deaths across the continent. Butsomething more than the natural cooling of ardour that happens with age was atwork. Although Werther had got the Sturm und Drang ball rolling, and it was nowbarrelling away as Romanticism swept across Europe, Goethe had for some timeturned his back on the overwrought emotionality and morbid sensitivity thatafflicted his tragic hero and his many epigones. He wanted to see nature as itwas in itself, and not as a convenient pegboard for our conflicting emotions, apractice in which the Romanticism that he spawned had, he believed,overindulged.Goethe turned to natural philosophy as a corrective to the debilitatingsubjectivity that he felt was encouraged by a too acute attentiveness to one’sfeelings. This movement from intense subjectivity to a rigorously imposedobjective discipline is not uncommon among German speaking poets. In the earlytwentieth century, the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke followed Goethe in this,although his needed rigour came from the advice of the sculptor Rodin, for whomhe worked as a secretary for a time in Paris, rather than science. Rodin advisedthe young poet to forget his feelings and take a good look at things, to, in asense, sculpt his poems in the way that he, Rodin, did his statues.5[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-90] The result was a breakthrough inRilke’s work, the Ding Gedichte or ‘thing poems’ recorded in his New Poems.These works try to capture the hard reality of their subject, and not merelyexpress the poet’s feelings about them.Half a century earlier than Rilke, a young Friedrich Nietzsche – as much apoet-philosopher as Goethe was a scientist-poet – cooled his heated Romanticbrow by taking up the discipline of philology – the study of ancient languages –and abandoning his idea of becoming a composer.6[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-91] His oversensitive system neededsomething repetitious and methodical to keep it from going to extremes. Each ofthese poets in their own way realised that too much indulgence in emotion, toomany ecstasies and excitements, would prove harmful to them.Of the three, Goethe was perhaps the strongest – at least he lived longer thanthe other two. But his turn to the objective world was not motivated by acomplete rejection of poetry, nor did it result in the kind of science based onthe new way of knowing that appeared in the early seventeenth century. WhatGoethe wanted to achieve was a kind of ‘poetic science’, a natural philosophybased not on seeing the world as a kind of machine, but one based on seeing it,participating with it imaginatively, as a living intelligence. We can say thatif Goethe wanted to bring some objectivity to his perception of nature, he alsowanted to bring some subjectivity to it, but a different kind than he hadbefore. We can say that it was a kind of ‘objective subjectivity’. As Barfieldwas interested in doing, he wanted to see the inside of the world.Goethe’s desire to grasp Nature’s secrets – or God’s; the two were oftensynonymous for him – started early on. At the age of nine he built an altar toNature out of material from his father’s natural history collection; this hedecorated with candles, which he lit as a sign of his devotion and the solemnityof the occasion. Even then he had a vague feeling that he would, at some point,develop a kind of ‘mystical religion’ of his own.7[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-92] Such thoughts should not strike us asstrange, coming from a boy his age, as the part of Germany where Goethe was born– Frankfurt-am-Main – was associated with the Pietist religious movement of theprevious century. Pietism placed great emphasis on personal experience and depthof spirituality, rather than religious dogma, and as Ronald Gray in Goethe theAlchemist argues, the Pietism of Goethe’s time was often associated with themore serious side of alchemy.8 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-93] Alchemyis concerned with the transformation of matter, with its metamorphosis from alowly state – lead – into a more noble one – gold – although whether it isconcerned with an inner transformation of the alchemist, rather than an outertransformation of physical matter, remains debatable. But if there was onecentral idea informing the ‘mystical religion’ Goethe would spend his lifearticulating in different ways, we can say that it too concerned itself withthis kind of metamorphosis: how the mysterious and universal force of lifetransformed itself into its endless variety of forms.Goethe’s literary talent showed itself early on too; even before he had erectedhis altar to Nature, he had written a play. By his early teens he was studyingPlato, Aristotle, and the mystical Plotinus. His first plan was to study law,which he did for two years in Leipzig. But on his return to Frankfurt hisinterest in uncovering the secrets of nature took a more inward turn. He becameinvolved with a group of Pietists, of whom the religious writer Suzanne vonKlettenberg was the most prominent, and through her he began a serious study ofalchemical, Hermetic, and spiritual literature, absorbing difficult texts byParacelsus, Basil Valentine, J.B. van Helmont and George Starkey.Von Klettenberg and her fellow Pietists were well versed in the obscure writingsof the sixteenth century Bohemian theosophist Jacob Boehme, whose dark visionshave influenced a number of important thinkers, among them the philosophersHegel and Heidegger, the poets Blake and Coleridge, as well as the religiouswriter Martin Buber and the psychologist C.G. Jung. One morning, the ‘mysticcobbler’, as Boehme was called – he made his living making shoes – wastransfixed by the sight of sunlight reflected off a dish. He suddenly felt as ifhe saw into the heart of nature and could understand the secret of everythingaround him. As his early biographer Abraham von Franckenberg recounted, Boehmehad been ‘introduced into the innermost ground or centre of the recondite orhidden nature’, and he perceived what he later called ‘the signature of things’,their inmost essence.9 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-94] Boehme was sostartled by the experience that he walked into some nearby fields in order toshake it off, but it persisted. He felt that he was actually seeing into thetrees, leaves, and grass around him. He felt as if he learned ‘more in onequarter of an hour’ than he would have had he spent years at university. Boehmetried to convey his vision in a series of books whose deep import isrecognisable, even with their dense obscurity. He wrote in an regrettably opaquealchemical language, borrowing much from the sixteenth century Swiss alchemistand physician Paracelsus, who had himself earlier claimed that ‘we may look intoNature in the same way that the sun shines through a glass’.10[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-95]It was this interior vision that motivated Goethe’s Pietist friends, and Goethehad an opportunity to benefit from some of its practical application. On hisreturn from Leipzig Goethe’s health suffered and he experienced something of anervous breakdown. Among those attending von Klettenberg’s Pietist meetings wasa certain Dr Metz, who often alluded to a mysterious ‘Universal Medicine’ ofwhose secrets he was aware. Dr Metz spoke of certain books and writings throughthe study of which one could possess this medicine. Goethe’s mother, a member ofthe Pietist group, knew of Metz’s claims and, fearful of her son’s health –Goethe’s condition seemed to be worsening – begged Dr Metz to use his wonderdrug on him. He did and Goethe experienced a rapid and inexplicable – fromconventional medicine’s point of view – recovery.11[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-96]Following his miraculous cure, Goethe plunged deeper into his alchemicalstudies, beginning the kind of ‘hands on’ scientific work he would continuethroughout his career. Goethe set up an alchemical laboratory in his parents’attic. Here he collected a furnace, a retort, some alembics and a sand-bath, andset to work in order to produce liquor silicium or ‘flint juice’, a product ofmelting down pure quartz with a mixture of alkali. If successful, this operationshould result in a kind of transparent glass, of remarkable clarity, whichdissolves on contact with air. Goethe wanted to achieve the liquor siliciumbecause it would serve for him as his alchemical prima materia, the first, or‘primal’ matter, the base from which the alchemical work of transformation wouldproceed. Goethe worked hard at capturing his ‘flint juice’, but to no avail, andafter several attempts he had to admit defeat. Yet the desire to arrive at a‘primal’ phenomenon remained and would inspire his later scientific work.Goethe pursued his law studies in Strasbourg, and while there he had anexperience that would shape his later investigations into Nature’s secrets. Likemany who visited the city, Goethe was struck by its Gothic cathedral which, formore than two centuries, was the world’s tallest building.12[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-97] Its height was especially striking forGoethe who, at that time, 1770, was twenty-one years old and suffering fromvertigo. The cathedral fascinated Goethe and he observed it under a number ofdifferent conditions, being especially attentive to the way in which varyingangles of light affected its appearance. He said that in it ‘the sublime hasentered into alliance with the pleasing’.13[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-98] He made many sketches of the cathedral,trying to observe it from as many perspectives as he could, even forcing himselfto climb its tower, in order to cure himself of his vertigo. At a small,unprotected platform just below the tower’s summit, Goethe would repeatedlyendure the giddiness that came over him, until he had conquered it.Just before leaving Strasbourg to return to Frankfurt, Goethe mentioned to somefriends that, in his opinion, the tower was incomplete, and he made a sketch ofwhat it would have looked like, had the original designed been followed.14[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-99] A friend who knew of the cathedral’soriginal plans confirmed that Goethe’s suspicions were correct; indeed the toweras they knew it was not as it had initially been planned and Goethe’s sketch hadgot it right. Goethe’s friend asked him who had told him of this, as it was notcommon knowledge. Goethe replied that the tower itself had told him: ‘I observedit so long and so attentively and I bestowed on it so much affection that itdecided at the end to reveal to me its manifest secret’. As Hans Gebert, writingof Goethe’s experience at Strasbourg Cathedral, remarked: ‘Through observation,exercise, and mental effort he had penetrated to an imperceptible reality, theidea of the architect’.15 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-100] That is tosay that through his imagination, Goethe had hit on knowledge that was otherwiseinaccessible. What helped Goethe here was his ‘developed inner life’, what thephilosopher Robert McDermott describes as ‘the painstakingly trained process bywhich the sympathetic personal knower imaginatively gleans the ideal form ofeach physical object and natural process’.16[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-101]Long and attentive observation of and affection toward the world around him wereon Goethe’s mind as his coach led him deeper into the land where the citronblooms. He had by this time established himself as, if not a professional, thenat least a highly talented amateur naturalist, having in 1784 shown that thehuman anatomy contained the intermaxillary bone. Prior to this the perceivedabsence of this small bone in human anatomy was taken as evidence that humanbeings were something apart from the rest of creation; they had a specialdispensation from God and were set apart from other animals, that possessed thebone. Goethe discovered the presence of the intermaxillary bone in humans byobserving and comparing human and animal skulls. The bone is located in the jawand as Goethe looked and reflected on the similarities in shape among thedifferent skulls before him, there it was. ‘Eureka’, he wrote to his friend thephilosopher Johann Herder, who, like Owen Barfield, was deeply interested in theevolution of language. ‘I have found neither gold nor silver, but something thatunspeakably delights me,’ he told Herder. It was the intermaxillary bone.Darwin was later to credit Goethe’s discovery as the starting point of our realunderstanding of evolution. Goethe was not around to accept Darwin’s compliment;he died some years before The Origin of Species was published in 1859. I suspecthe would have acknowledged it gracefully but I also believe he would have withequal grace pointed out to Darwin and to his followers, that his own ideas aboutevolution were rather different from theirs. He did not see it as a mechanicalprocess, driven by ‘natural selection,’ ‘survival of the fittest’ and accidentalmutations brought about by sheer chance. On the contrary, evolution for Goethewas the sign of an intelligent force working from within outward, rather thanthe result of purely external factors impinging on a passive, reactive matter.Nature was a great alchemist and in its manifold forms Goethe saw the active,creative response of life to the surroundings in which it found itself, as wellas the growth and development of its own inherent purposiveness, its ownself-direction. For Goethe life was not some infinitely plastic stuff that wouldpassively submit to the push and pull of the environment, but an intelligentcreative force that took advantage of the conditions in which it found itself inorder to actualise to the optimum its inherent possibilities.It was for evidence of this mysterious, hidden, but ever present force thatGoethe sought as his coach drew him into the sunshine of the south. By this timehis interest in the forms that life takes had shifted from the animal world tothat of the plants. He was in pursuit of what he called the Urpflanze or ‘primalplant’. In a letter to Herder he described it as ‘the strangest creature in theworld, which Nature herself shall envy me’. It was the key to ‘the secret of thereproduction and organisation of plants’, yet at the same time was ‘the simplestthing imaginable’. With it, Goethe was confident that ‘it will be possible to goon for ever inventing plants and know that their existence is logical’. Whatthis meant is that if such plants do not already exist, ‘they could, for theyare not the shadowy phantoms of vain imagination, but possess an inner necessityand truth’.17 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-102]What Goethe meant by this ‘inner necessity and truth’ is what his youngercontemporary, the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, spoke of as ‘facts of mind’. Forboth Goethe and Coleridge, the imagination was not merely a loosening of reasonand a setting free of uncontrolled fantasy – as the Enlightenment regarded it –but a cognitive power that obeyed its own rules and disciplines. These wereother than those associated with the analytical reasoning that informed most ofthe burgeoning science of Goethe’s and Coleridge’s time – and which hasdominated it up until today. But they were nevertheless in their own way just asdemanding and rigorous. But what was essential in what we can call ‘theimaginative method’ was the way in which phenomena, whether a plant or a work ofarchitecture, were observed.That the poetic and the scientific – imagination and knowledge – were never farapart in Goethe’s mind is clear from his account of how he first saw the ‘primalplant’. Goethe was not subject to the dichotomy of ‘two cultures’, thebifurcation of science and the humanities at the heart of C.P. Snow’s onceinfluential book. (And that science should itself be something apart from thestudy of what makes us human gives pause for thought.) On 17 January 1787,Goethe was on his way to the Public Gardens in Palermo, Sicily, ‘with the firmintention of meditating further upon my poetic dreams’, when there was a suddenchange in plans. The poem he was working on, inspired by the clear Mediterraneansky, could wait – ‘Nausicaa’ remained a fragment – but something equally if notmore poetic seized his attention. He reflected that here, where ‘instead ofbeing grown in pots or under glass’ as they were back in Weimar, plants were‘allowed to grow freely in the open and fresh air and fulfil their destiny’,they became more intelligible. Faced with the variety of such specimens beforehim, ‘an old fancy’ suddenly captured his mind. ‘Among this multitude,’ Goethethought, ‘might I not discover the Primal Plant?’ That there must be such athing Goethe was forced to accept, ‘otherwise how could I recognise that this orthat form was a plant if all were not built upon the same basic model?’18[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-103]What was – or is – Goethe’s Primal Plant? Many have tried to explain it andGoethe himself was aware of the difficulty in doing so. ‘My theory is difficultto describe,’ he confided in a journal. ‘No matter how clearly and exactly it iswritten down, it is impossible to understand merely from reading’.19[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-104] Goethe’s remark tells us that what isimportant in being able to understand his idea is that one should have the kindof experience that enabled Goethe to see his Primal Plant. One could know itadequately only in this way, and this required a special effort of imagination,what Goethe called ‘active seeing’, something different from the passivereflection we usually consider ‘seeing’ to be. Goethe’s ‘active seeing’ issimilar to the effort that Owen Barfield suggested was needed in order toexperience ‘participation’ consciously. In essence Goethe and Barfield arespeaking of the same thing: using the imagination as a means of knowledge.Goethe’s Urpflanze was – or is – a kind of botanical Platonic Form, an idealmodel from which all actual plants emerge. In Jungian terms we can say it is the‘archetypal’ plant. Yet it differs from Plato’s forms and Jung’s archetypes inthat, at least according to Goethe, the Urpflanze can actually be seen. Plato’sForms are not sensible. They cannot be seen directly, but we can see thephysical phenomena in which they manifest, and we can grasp their realityintellectually, that is, through the mind. Likewise, Jung maintained that we cannever experience the archetypes directly, because it is through them that wehave experience, rather as the philosopher Kant maintained that we know theworld through what he called categories that we do not perceive but throughwhich we have perceptions.Goethe’s Urpflanze – or Urphänomena, as there are more than one ‘primalphenomena’ – is something different. Jumping ahead a bit we can say that itoccupies a kind of middle ground between physical, sensible things, and pureconcepts, between the phenomena of the senses and the ideas of the intellect. Wecan say they exist in what the philosopher and religious scholar Henry Corbincalled ‘the Imaginal’, the realm of images, that has its home in our interiorworld.Goethe’s insistence that he could actually see the Urpflanze later got him intoan argument with his friend, the poet Friedrich Schiller. Schiller, too, wasinterested in science. Goethe was initially not partial to his youngercontemporary, finding his literary work – in particular his play, The Robbers –too much informed by the overheated Romanticism from which he had weanedhimself. But a correspondence had developed between them and in the spring of1794 the two met at a scientific conference in Jena. Goethe had by this timepublished his botanical work The Metamorphosis of Plants (1790) in which hepresented his theory of the Urpflanze and his method of perceiving it. AlthoughGoethe was famous throughout Europe, the work was so radical that his usualpublisher had rejected it, and he had to use another.20[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-105]After a lecture Goethe and Schiller fell into conversation. Schiller saidsomething that struck Goethe as insightful. Schiller remarked that the‘dissecting manner’ in which the lecturer had spoken of the scientific study ofnature, could not appeal to the layman – pre-echoing here William Wordsworth’soft-quoted line that ‘we murder to dissect’.21[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-106] Goethe agreed but went on to say thatsuch a manner, in which Nature was cut up into ever smaller bits and pieces –the work of the left brain – should not appeal to the professionals either. Hetold Schiller that ‘perhaps there was still the possibility of another method,one which would not tackle Nature by merely dissecting and particularising, butshow her at work and alive, manifesting herself in her wholeness in every singlepart of her being’.22 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-107]Schiller agreed and was intrigued by Goethe’s remarks and expressed an interestin hearing more. The walk from the lecture hall to Schiller’s house – he livedin Jena – was, according to Erich Heller, ‘the dramatic climax in the history ofGerman thought and letters’. Anyone overhearing them along the way would haveeavesdropped on what was ostensibly ‘merely a discussion about the growth ofvegetables’. But as Heller makes clear, what they were really discussing was‘the human mind and its search for truth’.23[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-108]When they arrived at Schiller’s home Goethe went into more detail. He explained‘with great vivacity’ his book on plant metamorphosis. He then drew a quicksketch of the Primal Plant, which Schiller regarded with ‘great interest andintelligence’. Yet after considering all Goethe had said, in the end Schillershook his head. ‘This,’ Schiller said, ‘had nothing to do with experience’. Itwas only ‘an idea’.This angered Goethe because it reminded him of a basic difference betweenhimself and Schiller. Schiller accepted the philosopher Kant’s firm distinctionbetween experience and ideas, between what we can have direct, sensory knowledgeof and what we can only think about. For him, Goethe’s Primal Plant was notsomething he could see, but only something he could think about. It was only anidea, like others, and no more ‘real’ than they. Goethe, ever tactful, repressedhis anger and turned Schiller’s reservations back on him. ‘Well,’ Goethe said,‘so much the better. It means that I have ideas without knowing it, and can evensee them with my eyes’.24 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-109]‘Seeing ideas with one’s eyes’ could be a way of describing what Goethe wentabout when he perceived the Primal Plant. Goethe’s approach to observation wasrather different from what had become the accepted method since the earlyseventeenth century. Where the new way of knowing demanded that the observerremain detached, isolated from the observed, so as to capture it in complete‘objectivity’, thereby making what was under observation an ‘object’ – denyingit had any ‘inside’ – Goethe knew that such objectivity was impossible. Wellbefore Werner Heisenberg, Goethe had grasped this central truth, that ‘thephenomenon is not detached from the observer, but intertwined and involved withhim’.25 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-110] Heisenberg’s ‘uncertaintyprinciple’ is credited with the recognition that the observer through hisobservation alters the observed; in the case of elementary particles, this makesit impossible for us to know the position and speed of a particlesimultaneously; we can only know one or the other, hence, the ‘uncertainty’. Yetin 1932 Heisenberg recognised Goethe’s primacy here and lamented that thetrajectory of science since Goethe’s day had renounced ‘the aim of bringing thephenomena of nature to our thinking in an immediate and living way’, and led toa practice less and less concerned with an ‘understanding of the world’.26[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-111]What Heisenberg meant was that science’s plunge into the dimension behind orbeneath phenomena – into the bizarre world of elementary particles, smaller andsmaller bits and pieces – separated it more and more from any kind of humanworld, the world of clouds, trees, mountains and forests. But it was preciselythe participation of the human and Nature, mind and matter, that Goethe believedwas the true subject of science.Where the new way of knowing required that the observer remain passive, so asnot to taint what he was observing with his ‘subjectivity’ – Thomas Huxley,Darwin’s ‘bulldog’, advises us to ‘sit down before fact like a little child’ –Goethe, as we’ve seen, took a more active approach.27[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-112] Like Schwaller de Lubicz’s‘intelligence of the heart’, Goethe wants to get inside phenomena, not behindthem to some ‘really real’ world, whether of elementary particles or Kant’sding-an-sich, the ‘thing-in-itself’ forever barred from our cognition by the‘categories’ of thought. The truth of the world, Goethe maintains, is givenimmediately. Nature, for Goethe, is not hidden, or if she is, it is in plainsight. Naked is the best disguise. Her secrets are manifest, if we know how tolook for them.28 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-113] ‘Nature,’ Goethewrote, ‘has nether kernel nor shell; she is everything at once’. As Hellerwrites: ‘what is within and what is without are for Goethe merely poles of oneand the same thing’.If this is so, then what is going on inside the observer is at least asimportant as what is going on outside him, what, that is, he is observing. Ourattitude toward what we are observing will determine what we see. If we aredetermined that what lies before us is merely a piece of complicated machinery,as many who engaged in the new way of knowing did, then that is what we willsee. If we believe that the only way to understand the world is to break it downinto smaller and smaller parts, then smaller and smaller bits and pieces arewhat we shall find.Yet we’ve seen that Goethe had a different aim in mind. He wanted to see Nature‘manifesting herself in her wholeness in every single part of her being’.Earlier I referred to Ernst Jünger’s idea of ‘stereoscopy’, a way of looking atthings that presents their surface and depth simultaneously. Jünger was amodern-day Goethean scientist, at least his attitude toward Nature was very muchalong Goethean lines; readers of his anti-Nazi parable On The Marble Cliffs knowthis. Like Goethe, he aimed to see inside and outside simultaneously. Thisrequires an effort of imagination, a gesture of getting in rapport with what youare observing.Goethe observed phenomena not with the cold detachment of the mechanicalscientist, but with the warmth and involvement of the artist, even, perhaps, thelover. This was not the same as the kind of emotional projection that Goethewrote out of his system in Werther. That kind of subjectivity did need to beinhibited. Goethe did not project his emotions on to the natural world, as if hewas spraying paint onto a blank wall. Goethe’s ‘lover’ here was somewhat moremature. What he did do was to direct an inner warmth and attentiveness to whathe was observing; he became involved in it in the same way that an artistbecomes involved in the subject of his work.29[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-114] Goethe observed his plant in allstages of development, from seed to flower, patiently following it in itsprocess of growth. He would then imagine the plant, building up an inner visionof it, recreating it in his mind, and following this too through itsdevelopment. Nature gave herself all at once, but she was never static, fixed,immobile, but was always in transformation, metamorphosis, growing from thesimple to the complex. We can say that where the quantitative approach to Naturetook very precise snapshots of her at selected moments, freezing her constantflow into a fixed form so that it could be ‘pinned down’, Goethe’s way was toslow his own consciousness down, so that he could see the growth of a plant as awhole.Yet at each moment of development, the whole is wholly given and for one engagedin Goethe’s active seeing, it is visible. ‘To recognise living forms as such, tosee in context their visible and tangible parts, to perceive them asmanifestations of something within, and thus to master them, to a certainextent, in wholeness through a concrete vision’, what Goethe called Anschauung,a ‘direct perception’: such was the aim of Goethe’s morphologicalinvestigations.30 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-115]Goethe’s attentiveness to phenomena was acute. The poet W.H. Auden, one of thetranslators of the Italian Journey, said that Goethe ‘makes enormous efforts …to say exactly what shape and colour an object is, and precisely where it standsin spatial relation to other objects …’ At times such attention to detail givesthe Italian Journey a somewhat stilted feel, Goethe’s meticulous observationstopping the narrative flow; Auden even makes an oblique comparison with thestatic nouveau roman of the French novelist Alain Robbe-Grillet, known for hisobsessive, paralysing descriptions. But this attention is at the heart ofGoethean science, as it is at the heart of a method of philosophy that wouldemerge in the century after Goethe’s death. I’m referring to the ‘phenomenology’developed by Edmund Husserl, mentioned earlier in this book.Husserl was appalled at the state philosophy had gotten into by the earlytwentieth century and believed it was time for a new beginning. Hisphilosophical battle cry was ‘To the things themselves!’ This meant thatphilosophy had to return from the abstract realms it had lost itself in withHegel and the relativistic view it had adopted through what was known at thetime as ‘psychologism’, the belief that philosophical problems originate in thehuman psyche, and had no ‘reality’ of their own; this is not radically differentfrom how much of contemporary neuroscience sees them today. Husserl called for anew, rigorous and thorough approach involving an acute observation anddescription of phenomena. Hence his method was known as ‘phenomenology’, anattempt to arrive at a detailed, accurate account of things as they appear tous, as they are ‘given’ in our consciousness, forgetting questions about theirreality or essence.Hegel had, of course, earlier used the term phenomenology in The Phenomenologyof Mind, his account of the different forms mind or spirit takes in itsmanifestation in human history (the German word Geist, which Hegel uses, can betranslated into English as either ‘mind’ or ‘spirit’). Husserl was notinterested in a historical account of consciousness, as Barfield was, althoughin other ways their insights support each other. His focus was on consciousnessas we experience it now, as given. His central insight was that our perceptionof things is intentional. In its simplest form this means that consciousness isalways consciousness of something. It is directed at a target. There is always asubject, the mind that is conscious, and an object, what it is consciousness of.The object of consciousness can be a tree, the idea of a tree, an image of one,or a memory of one: in all cases, consciousness’s relation to it is nonetheless‘intentional’.This seems evident enough and Husserl’s ideas spawned much of early twentiethcentury ‘continental’ philosophy, giving birth not only to phenomenology, butthrough his one-time student and friend Martin Heidegger, existentialism. Laterphenomenologists took Husserl’s cues and developed them in ways that differedprofoundly from the master; Heidegger himself was the most famous example here,transforming Husserl’s focus on consciousness to what Heidegger called the‘question of being’, and moving from phenomenology to ‘fundamental ontology’.Max Scheler, who I write about in The Caretakers of the Cosmos, developed anapproach that differed from both Husserl and Heidegger. Where Husserl wanted tosave philosophy from relativism by developing a rigorous method that would makeit a kind of science, Scheler saw phenomenology as more of an attitude, aGeisteshaltung, or ‘disposition of spirit’, that he likened to love, a‘phenomenological love’ along the lines of Goethe’s ‘attentiveness’.31[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-116]Husserl’s writings are dense and opaque and his ideas are expressed in atypically difficult abstract prose. But the basic vision that emerges from themis that Husserl believed consciousness was not only intentional, that isdirected at a target, but was also in some strange way involved in the cominginto being of whatever it was directed at. That is to say that consciousness wascreative, or, at the least, ‘participatory’ in the way that both Barfield andGoethe believed.The basic ‘act’ of phenomenology is what Husserl calls ‘stepping out of thenatural standpoint’. I mentioned the ‘natural standpoint’ in the last chapter.It is basically our immediate unquestioned acceptance of the world as ‘given’,as ‘there’, whether we are or not, and ourselves as passive observers of thisfact. Husserl said that the natural stance of the waking ego is a perceiving, a‘looking’. But when we step out of the natural standpoint and perform whatHusserl calls the epoché, a temporary suspension of belief in everything wethink we know about the world, the relation of consciousness to the worldchanges. The world no longer seems to be something simply ‘there’ that ourconsciousness somehow mirrors. Our perceiving seems somehow more ‘active’. Webecome aware of the dynamic character of our perception, something that isobscured when we are within the natural standpoint – in other words, most of thetime.32 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-117]It may seem that stepping out of the natural standpoint is an easy affair. It isnot. It takes much effort and is difficult to sustain. It does not consist ofmerely saying to yourself ‘Okay. For the next ten minutes I will not believe ineverything I do believe about the world’, and then agreeing to a number ofabsurd proposals. During those ten minutes you may agree that the moon may bemade of Swiss cheese, but you really know it isn’t, no matter what you say. Yourtoken agreement did not in any way upset your fundamental assumptions, your‘metaphysics’ about the world. To truly step out of the natural standpoint meansreally digging down deep into yourself and making a peculiar effort ofimagination and truly seeing the world free of all your assumptions about it.This as difficult to do as any meditation and requires practice and perseveranceto achieve. The sign that your efforts are bearing fruit is that what youperceive should begin to have an air of ‘strangeness’ about it. This should leadto a feeling of strangeness about yourself, your consciousness, an oddunfamiliarity with it, which at the same time seems familiar, as if you wereremembering something you had forgotten or, in a tried and true philosophicalanalogy, were waking from a dream.All philosophy requires a kind of violence, an effort to go against the currentof everyday life and secure some footing from which we can contemplate it,rather than be driven headlong in its constant flow. As Whitehead said, ‘Ittakes an extraordinary intelligence to contemplate the obvious’. But it isprecisely the obvious that can lead to the most mysterious things of all.This active character of our perception was lost on many of the phenomenologiststhat followed Husserl; Jean-Paul Sartre, for example, argued against itvigorously.33 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-118] Yet the philosopher PaulRicoeur captured it in his analysis of Husserl’s philosophy. Concerning‘intentionality’, Ricoeur wrote:By means of this reduction [the epoché] consciousness rids itself of a naivetéwhich it has beforehand, and which Husserl calls the natural attitude. Thisattitude consists in spontaneously believing that the world which is there issimply given. In correcting itself about this naiveté, consciousness discoversthat it is in itself giving, sensegiving. The reduction does not exclude thepresence of the world; it takes nothing back. It does not even suspend theprimacy of intuition in every cognition. After the reduction, consciousnesscontinues seeing, but without being absorbed in this seeing, without being lostin it. Rather, the very seeing itself is discovered as a doing (opération), as aproducing (oeuvre) – once Husserl even says ‘as a creating’. Husserl would beunderstood – and the one who thus understands him would be a phenomenologist –if the intentionality which culminates in seeing were recognised to be acreative vision.34 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-119]Recognising that the ‘intentionality which culminates in seeing’ is a ‘creativevision’ seems very close to how Goethe perceived the way in which we observe theworld. One should also point out that Ricoeur’s remark that ‘after thereduction, consciousness continues seeing, but without being absorbed in thisseeing, without being lost in it’ has some connotations beyond Husserl’sphenomenology. Being absorbed and lost in seeing, in the world, that is, seenfrom the natural standpoint, sounds rather like the condition of ‘nescience’ or‘ignorance’ in Buddhism or being stuck in Maya in Hinduism or what Gurdjieffcalls ‘sleep’: that is, a dream that is doubly deceptive because it presentsitself as wakefulness. This suggests to me that although couched in verydifferent language and motivated by what seem very different concerns,phenomenology’s terrain, at least as Ricoeur seems to be presenting it, sharesmuch with more ostensibly spiritual, esoteric or religious disciplines.35[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-120]Goethe’s search for the Urpflanze may have annoyed Schiller and embarrassedbotanists who felt he should have stuck to poetry. But his feud with Newton overthe phenomenon of colour was even more scandalous. Like his younger contemporaryWilliam Blake, who railed against ‘single vision and Newton’s sleep’ –championing in his own way the kind of ‘double vision’ we have been exploringhere – in Newton, Goethe saw the emblem of the mechanical, dissecting sciencethat he and Schiller both abhorred.36 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-121]But where Blake devised a dramatic cosmic mythology which he expressed in epicand often obscure poems in order to submit his complaints, Goethe decided tobeat Newton at his own game, and devise his own theory of colour, to show howNewton’s Opticks (1704) had got it wrong.Goethe believed that Newton’s demonstration of how light is made up of thecolours of the spectrum was arrived at by inadmissible means, rather like theconfession of a prisoner obtained through torture. Newton arrived at hisconclusion, Goethe argued, by subjecting light to the kind of dissection andanalysis he and Schiller had agreed was an impediment to a true understanding ofnature. Much has been written showing that Goethe misunderstood Newton, that hisown ideas were simply absurd, or that he had no business doing science anyway, asad example of a great mind in one field showing its utter ignorance – andegotism – in another. Goethe wanted to show that colour was not merely theeffect of our subjective interpretation of a particular ‘wavelengths’ of light –between 400 and 700 nanometres – which sunlight can be ‘broken up’ into. Ratherit was the result of the polarity between light and dark, and the ‘struggle’between them. For Goethe, the colours of the spectrum are the result of the‘deeds’ and ‘suffering’ of light.As the reader might expect, no one, certainly not scientists, took Goethe’sarguments against Newton or those supporting his own theory very seriously.37[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-122] But the point is not so much whetherNewton was right and Goethe wrong as that their approach to the phenomenon ofcolour was radically different. Goethe did not want to ‘explain’ colour, andcertainly not in terms of the quantitative way of knowing that was becomingincreasingly more dominant in his time. Goethe was interested in the‘phenomenology of colour’, how we experience it, how colour is in our humanworld. The details of Goethe’s theory can be found in his book, Theory ofColours (1810), and there are excellent expositions of it and instructions inhow readers can make some of Goethe’s observations themselves.38[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-123] What is important here is his basicapproach, which, as we’ve seen, involves an awareness of the involvement of theobserver with the observed. Abstract colour produced mechanically underartificial conditions is not the same as colour experienced in the world, thetotality of which it is a part, Goethe believed. Newton saw the spectrum in anartificially darkened room and by forcing light to pass through a series ofobstacles. Goethe’s observations of colour took place in normal conditions andwere phenomenological in that they were focused on the ‘thing itself’, as it isgiven to is in our immediate experience.What is in question here, as Erich Heller recognised, is not who is ‘right’about colour, Newton or Goethe, but two different conceptions of knowledge. Forthe new way of knowing, knowledge was something ‘out there’, in the externalworld, or at least the ‘facts’ that make up our knowledge are. As The X-Filestell us, the truth is ‘out there’. Goethe saw things differently. Truth for himwas not wholly ‘out there’, as it was for the new breed of scientists, nor wasit wholly ‘in here’, as idealist thinkers who saw everything as ‘in the mind’believed. Truth was the polarity between the two, a creative tension between thesubject and the object. ‘Truth’ for Goethe, was ‘a revelation emerging at thepoint where the inner world of man meets external reality. It is a synthesis ofworld and mind’. This is so because ‘there resides in the objective world anunknown law which corresponds to the unknown law within subjectiveexperience’.39 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-124]Truth, then, is not something we arrive at by sitting down before facts like achild and patiently gathering them until, through sheer number, theymiraculously turn into knowledge. For us to arrive at truth requires that weactively and imaginatively engage with whatever it is we are observing. That, ina sense, we meet it halfway. In Strasbourg Goethe showed that a truth notvisible or measurable in any way was nevertheless discovered through hisobservation and imagination. Had he observed the cathedral without his ‘activeseeing,’ trying his best to be ‘objective’ in the conventional sense, he wouldnever have caught a glimpse of its ‘manifest secret’. Truth requires a meetingbetween inner and outer in order to come into being. It was with this idea inmind that Rudolf Steiner would later take Goethe’s insight and with it build aphilosophy based on the necessity for the human ‘inside’ to complete the world‘outside’. As Steiner wrote in his early work Goethe’s Conception of the World(1897): ‘Man is not only there in order to form for himself a picture of thefinished world’ – which is what we assume from the natural standpoint and whichforms the basis of conventional science – ‘Nay, he himself cooperates inbringing the world into existence’.40 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-125]Or, as Steiner put it somewhat differently elsewhere: ‘When one who has a richmental life sees a thousand things which are nothing to the mentally poor, thisshows as clearly as sunlight that the content of reality is only the reflectionof the content of our minds, and that we receive from without only the emptyform’.41 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-126]This, of course, is a complete rejection of the ‘blank slate’ school of humanpsychology, which maintains that there is nothing in our heads until our sensesput it there. Steiner via Goethe is saying the exact opposite: there is no‘outer world’ until we complete it with our inner one. (And we remember thatBarfield says something similar in his account of the rise of ‘language’ and‘the world’.) It was Goethe’s ‘developed inner life’ that enabled him to see themanifest secret of Strasbourg Cathedral. It was also this that allowed him tocatch a glimpse of the Urpflanze and to recognise the birth of colour throughthe polarities of light and dark. Goethe adapts a line from the Neoplatonicphilosopher Plotinus and turns it into verse to make his point. In the EnneadsPlotinus had written: ‘To any vision must be brought an eye adapted to what isto be seen, and having some likeness to it. Never did an eye see the sun unlessit had first become sun-like’. Goethe paraphrased this as: ‘If the eye were notsun-like, how could we ever see light? And if God’s own power did not dwellwithin us, how could we delight in things divine’.42[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-127] William Blake hit the same note when,for the frontispiece of his poem ‘The Gates of Paradise’, he writes: ‘The Sun’sLight/When he unfolds it … Depends on the Organ that beholds it’. Or in a moreaggressive mood, as he is often is in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: ‘A foolsees not the same tree as a wise man sees’. As Paracelsus and other alchemistsknew, only like can know like. What we see in the outer world depends on what webring to it. What is observed depends on the observer.We should point out that Goethe did not want to substitute his science forNewton’s. He was aware of the immense practical value of the new, quantitativescience. His science would complement that, but it would also set boundaries forwhat it was worthwhile for us to know. What concerned Goethe was whether thispractical, or, as we would say today, technological value would overshadowlarger existential issues. Goethe’s most famous work, Faust, can be seen as astudy in the difference between what man can know and what he ought to know. Thenew way of knowing was all about knowing what we can, regardless of theconsequences. For it, knowledge in itself, was good. We can understand this;after centuries of repression enforced by the Church, the intellect demandedabsolute freedom. Yet although such a catholic approach to knowledge hasresulted in a great many practical uses – from the keyboard I am tapping away atto the electric lights on in my study – in one sense we can say that Goethe hadan even more practical sense of the value of knowledge. For him, what counted astrue knowledge was what was good for man to know – something it requires wisdom,and not merely information, to grasp.What was good for us to know, according to Goethe, was everything that helped usto understand our place in the whole, in the totality of things. What did notaid us in grasping this was secondary and of minimal use. There were limits, notto the knowable, as Kant argued, but to the kind of knowledge that would do usgood; limits, that is, to the value of knowledge. Not only in practical,utilitarian ways, but in terms of our being. ‘Everything that liberates our mindwithout at the same time imparting self-control is pernicious’.43[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-128] ‘I hate everything that merelyinstructs me without augmenting or directly invigorating my activity.’44[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-129] These remarks give us an idea of howGoethe saw the value of knowledge. The second quotation was used by Nietzsche atthe beginning of his early essay On The Use and Disadvantages of History forLife (1874). Goethe’s remarks on the value of knowledge could be collected underthe title: ‘The Use and Disadvantages of Knowledge for Life’.Real, useful, true knowledge for Goethe can only be obtained by the whole humanbeing, one in whom all our faculties work in accord, not only the insatiableanalytical intellect. Knowledge devoid of imagination, feeling and the senseswould only lead us to distraction and dissatisfaction and to a world in whichthe human seems fundamentally negligible – as our contemporary science makesclear. As Heller writes: ‘The anxiety that the world, in the course of itsincreasing analytical disruption, may approach the point where it would becomepoetically useless [as it has in the ‘age of prose’], and a barren place for thehuman affections to dwell in, informs Goethe’s scientific motives …’45[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-130]Goethe’s aim was the perennial one of arriving at a conception of the ‘goodlife’, how we can best live in order to actualise the possibilities andpotentialities within us. Goethe was convinced that someone ‘given up tofascinations which exercise those of his faculties which have the least bearingon what he is as a person [that is the critical and analytical ones] …is merelydigging away at the gulf between him and the good life’.46[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-131] Has measuring wavelengths ofelectromagnetic radiation anything to do with light and colour as we experiencethem? Do Higgs bosons or any other elementary particle help me understand myexperience and my connection to the world around me? (This was Heisenberg’sreservation.) Do superstrings or selfish genes? Goethe isn’t saying that theseareas of inquiry should not be explored, that they should be prohibited in theway that the Church once prohibited, or at least look very askance upon, suchpursuits, or their earlier equivalents. What Goethe does say is that we need tounderstand these things as part of our whole being, as elements in the totalitythat is involved in making us human and living in a human world. How far he gotwith this is debatable. That these questions strike many of us as naïve suggeststhat Goethe’s concern for the good life and our means of arriving at it hasfallen by the wayside, clearing the way for an increase of the kind of knowledgewhich he believed could only lead man to ‘fret away his days in the narrowestand most joyless limitation’.47 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-132] Ascience that arrives at the conclusion that the more we understand the universethe more pointless it seems strikes me as satisfying that criterion.Goethe’s ideas about science, nature, and the human imagination may not havemade an impact on the scientists around him, but they did inform an important,if little known development in European philosophy which should be mentionedhere. This was the Naturphilosophie that arose in Germany as a product ofRomanticism. Its English translation, ‘philosophy of nature’, does not conveythe peculiar character of the movement, which for some blended ‘comparativeanatomy with transcendental mysticism’.48[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-133] Unlike the ‘natural philosophy’ of theAnglophone world, Naturphilosophie was interested in the ‘inner’ aspect ofNature, its soul. It took its cues from Goethe’s ideas about a ‘living’ Nature,‘manifesting herself in her wholeness in every single part of her being’.Several thinkers fell within the Naturphilosophie camp, among them G.H.Schubert, Carl Gustav Carus, Alexander von Humboldt and Franz von Baader.Schubert was a physician, Carus a physiologist and painter, von Humboldt anaturalist, explorer, and geographer, and von Baader a theologian andphilosopher. We could also include in their ranks Goethe’s young contemporaryFriedrich von Hardenberg, better known under his pen name Novalis. Like Goethe,Novalis strove to bridge the increasing gap between the critical and imaginativeaspects of human consciousness.49 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-134] Inhis short life – he died at the age of twenty-eight – Novalis studiedmineralogy, and was an assessor of mines; he also tackled mathematics,chemistry, geology and physics as well as philosophy, esotericism and history,in the meantime writing novels and mystical poetry such as his Hymns to theNight.A later exponent of Naturphilosophie was the German scientist and visionaryGustav Fechner, who proposed the idea that the earth was a single organism wellbefore James Lovelock popularised the notion of ‘Gaia’ in the early 1970s.Following a long illness, which included blindness, Fechner had a suddenillumination. Standing in a garden he felt that ‘every flower beamed upon mewith a peculiar clarity, as though into the outer light it was casting itsown’.50 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-135] Fechner took from hisexperience the conviction that Nature, the entire universe in fact, is alive andconscious, an idea that can be traced back to the anima mundi of theNeoplatonists. He called the earth an angel, an insight we will return to in thenext chapter.With Goethe Naturphilosophie was interested in nature’s transformative powers,how it ‘was steadily transformed from a simpler, less organised, earlier stateto a higher, more developed, later state’, much as was the aim of alchemy.51[part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-136] It was also fascinated, as Goethe was,by the different forms life adopted. Like Goethe, it saw these as variations onsome basic patterns, what it called ‘archetypes’, much in advance of C.G. Jung.These fundamental patterns seemed evidence of divine design, motifs of anintelligence at work in nature, rather than the mindless, mechanical forces thatDarwin and his followers would soon discover. For these thinkers, Nature was notan infinitely plastic stuff pushed and pulled by the blind forces of theenvironment; she was ‘self-forming’, rather in the way that ‘complexitytheorists’ speak of a ‘self-organising’ nature, although for Naturphilosophiethe idea that Nature was ‘intelligent’ was not an obstacle.The most influential of the Naturphilosophen was Friedrich von Schelling, afriend both of Goethe and Hegel. Schelling’s works, Ideas for a Philosophy ofNature (1797), On The World Soul (1798) and others had a powerful impact on theburgeoning Romantic movement, and it is accurate to say that it is within thearena of art, music and poetry that Naturphilosophie gained the most ground.Like Goethe, Schelling was concerned with the problem of the relation of Natureto the human mind, to consciousness. Kant and his follower Johann GottliebFichte had left this in a precarious state. Kant had argued that what we see asNature is the mind’s representation of world it can never know immediately, theworld of the ‘thing-in-itself’. Fichte, whose work had a profound impact on ayoung Rudolf Steiner, had taken this further and argued in effect that Nature,the perceived external world, was really a creation of the mind. Goethe had toodeep a feeling for Nature’s reality to accept this, and we’ve seen that heargued with Schiller about Kant’s distinction between what we can see and whatwe can only think about.But Goethe was no philosopher – at least he felt no attraction to abstractthought. Schelling agreed with Goethe about Nature’s reality and he also agreedwith him that it is in the union of the mind and Nature, self-consciousness andthe world it is conscious of, that genuine truth and knowledge can be obtained.The outer world of nature and our inner one of consciousness are two sides, twoexpressions of the same source. Schelling saw the same activities taking placein consciousness and in the outer world. For him humankind is Nature’s attemptat producing a being that could understand itself; we are, in fact, Naturebecoming self-conscious.For the historian of esotericism Antoine Faivre, Naturphilosophie finds in theworld ‘symbolic implications’ and ‘invisible processes’ that correspond to humanfeelings. Faivre agrees with Novalis that ‘knowledge of Nature and knowledge ofoneself go hand in hand’ (Novalis: ‘We will come to understand the world when weunderstand ourselves’.).52 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-137] This isagain Goethe’s insight, that only like can know like. We can understand thedifferent forms nature adopts in its development from its simplest state to itsmost complex, because we discover the same forms in ourselves when we strive forself-consciousness and self-understanding. As Schelling wrote in Ideas for aPhilosophy of Nature: ‘Nature should be Mind made visible, Mind the invisibleNature’.53 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-num-note-138]Schelling saw two fundamental forces at work both in Nature and in humanconsciousness, what he called ‘expansion’ and ‘contraction’. It was throughtheir polarity that nature expressed herself; her various forms were the resultof the clash between these two fundamental opposites. Schelling’s visionpresented a Nature that was much more active, a ‘dramatic’ Nature, full ofstorm, stress and struggle, rather than a mechanical one, made of cogs andwheels. Goethe saw this polarity as well, and it was through these contrastingmotions, what he spoke of as ‘systole’ and ‘diastole’, the contraction andrelaxation of the heart, that the Urpflanze transforms the leaf, its basic form,into the various parts we know: stamen, pistil, flower, fruit.These polarities would have a powerful impact on another Romantic poet who, likeGoethe, was aware of the importance of imagination in our attempt to know theworld: Samuel Taylor Coleridge. We will return to him further on. In the nextchapter we will look at how imagination can help us in our attempt to know, notonly the outer world, but inner ones too.NOTES1 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-86] John Armstrong, Love, Life, Goethe(London: Allen Lane, 2006) p. 295.2 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-87] Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, ItalianJourney, trans.

See my book, Beyond the Robot: The Life and Work of ColinWilson (New York: Tarcher Perigee, 2016) for a detailed analysis of Wilson’sideas on consciousness and intentionality.35 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-120] Husserl himself said that his aimin his phenomenological excavations was to uncover what he called the‘transcendental ego’, the ‘I’ behind our everyday ego. By doing this he hoped toarrive at the ‘keepers of the keys of being’, who he related to ‘the Mothers’who appear in Part Two of Goethe’s drama of Western consciousness, Faust. The‘I’ behind the everyday ego sounds rather like the Self of Eastern philosophy, adifferent centre of consciousness than the everyday left-brain ego. Heidegger,Husserl’s student, shared with the esoteric teacher G. I. Gurdjieff therecognition that one method by which we may be shaken out of our ‘forgetfulnessof being’ and made ‘awake’ is through a vivid realisation of the eventuality ofour death. Though phenomenology and spiritual teachings seem on the surface tohave little in common, they do share a concern with ‘authentic being’ andexperiencing our true ‘I’.36 [part0007_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-121] Both Goethe and Blake were unawareof Newton’s profound concern with alchemy and other aspects of Westernesotericism. Although well-known to Newton’s contemporaries, these aspects ofhis career only came to light in 1936, when the economist John Maynard Keynesbought a collection of Newton’s papers and quickly realised that the father ofmodern science – and the modern world – spent more time thinking and writingabout alchemy than he did gravity.

(London: PenguinBooks, 1997) p. 209."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Four"},{"pageContent":"THE WAY WITHINIn October 1913, Dr Carl Gustav Jung, once second in command to Sigmund Freud inthe psychoanalytic ranks, but now recently relieved of this position, had adisturbing experience. On the train from Zürich to Schaffhausen in northernSwitzerland, a journey of little more than an hour, Jung began to look at thescenery. Soon he saw more than he had bargained for. A flood of biblicalproportions seemed to sweep over Europe, coming from the North Sea and washingdown to the Alps. The mountains rose to protect Jung’s homeland, but in thechurning waters Jung saw much debris and many bodies. Then the waves were ofblood. Farmland, towns, villages: all were caught in the blood-red deluge thatswept across the continent, leaving destruction in its wake.The vision – if that is what it was – lasted for most of the journey andunderstandably Jung was shaken by it. For years he had treated patients at theBurghözli Asylum for just such symptoms, an invasion of their waking minds bycontents of the unconscious, and now it seemed that the physician would have toheal himself. His recent break with his one-time friend and mentor, Herr DrFreud, had, he knew, unbalanced him. It was a difficult decision, but Jung couldno longer accept Freud’s insistence on the sexual origin of neurosis. Jung, infact, had never accepted it wholeheartedly anyway, but the differences betweenhimself and Freud had become too obvious to ignore and so he was forced to gohis own way. The result, as was always the case with those who chose to thinkdifferently than the master, was excommunication from the psychoanalytic circleand ostracism and calumny from those who remained within it. Jung was strong andhe could bear much. But perhaps this feeling of total rejection had crackedsomething inside him?The feeling that something within him was trying to get out stayed with Jungafter his experience. His dreams became even more vivid and peculiar. He sawhimself sitting on a golden chair in a Renaissance setting. A white dove landedon an emerald tablet, then transformed itself into a girl. After she had turnedback into a bird, the dove told Jung that it could become a girl only when themale dove was busy with the ‘twelve dead’.1[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-139] In another dream he found himselfwalking through an avenue of ancient tombs; when he looked at them, theirinhabitants came back to life. He also caught himself at different timesthroughout the day fantasising about the dead returning to life and he began tofeel that it was more and more difficult to stop these fantasies from takingover his consciousness. Increasingly Jung feared that, like many of hispatients, he was losing his mind.More visions came, bringing more blood and devastation. In one dream he sawEurope caught in a sudden ice age. Jung’s concern for his sanity heightened; atone point, when the pressure from within increased, Jung began to sleep with aloaded pistol near his bed, so he could blow his brains out if things became toomuch for him. The psychic disturbances continued for some time, but Jungreceived an ironic relief when, in August 1914, the First World War broke out.His visions were not, it seemed, evidence that he was cracking up. They wereprophetic anticipations of the catastrophe that was erupting across Europe.2[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-140]Jung’s relief at the fact that a world war had broken out was short-lived. Thathis dreams and visions seemed to prophesy the war was no guarantee that his ownpsyche wasn’t becoming unglued. Hadn’t he become convinced by his study ofmental patients that their fantasies often contained precognitive and propheticelements, mixed in with the rubbish of their emotional and intellectualbreakdowns? Wasn’t it in fact over such peculiarities of the psyche as thesethat he had to break with Freud, who dismissed such notions as errant nonsense?Jung’s inner oppression continued. He was experiencing what the historian ofpsychiatry Henri Ellenberger called a ‘creative illness’, ‘a deep reachinginterior metamorphosis’, similar to the crisis that Gustav Fechner, mentioned inthe last chapter, went through.3 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-141] Itwas through such crises that people like Jung, Fechner, Swedenborg, RudolfSteiner and others ‘became who they were’, receiving the insights andinspirations that would inform the vision they brought back with them from theabyss. All indications suggested that Jung was on his way there now. When hearrived, the really interesting events would start happening.Jung tried different ways to quell the turbulence inside him. At one point hefound some relief playing with stones and making sand castles on the shore ofLake Zürich near his home; what boaters on the lake thought of seeing Dr Jungmaking mud pies is unclear. Yoga exercises he had recently learned helped too.Yet Jung’s need to understand what was happening to him compelled him to returnto the brink whenever he had managed to quieten himself down. If he was going tohelp people with their madness, he would have to get to know his own. He knewthe danger and to anchor himself in the everyday world he would repeat a kind ofmantra: he was Herr Dr Jung, with a diploma to prove it, a wife, a family and apractice. Others depended on him. This served as a kind of ballast to help keephim steady in the water.Yet after months of fighting off the feeling that he was going mad, Jung decidedto change his tactic. He would no longer fend off these attacks. If he was goingmad, then so be it. When the next wave of psychic pressure came, he would notfight it off. He would just let go. And so he did.Sitting at his desk, and once again panicking with the idea that he was losinghis mind, Jung let himself ‘drop’. As soon as he stopped trying to fend off theoppression, something very strange happened. Jung felt the ground give waybeneath him and that he was falling. He landed on what felt like a soft mass. Hefound that he was at the entrance to a cave; sitting there outside it was adwarf with leathery skin. Inside the cave Jung waded through icy waters. Hefound a huge glowing red crystal; beneath this he found the corpse of a blondyouth, a giant black scarab, then a brilliant sun. Then a geyser of blood, likethe kind he had seen in his vision on the train, shot at him. This sickened Jungand he ‘woke up’. Yet a dream a few days later seemed connected to his vision.Jung found himself with a brown-skinned man – rather like his leathery dwarf –and they were on their way to kill Siegfried, the hero of Wagner’s Ring Cycle.Jung was compelled to know what these experiences were about. What were theytrying to tell him? He could not accept them as random, nonsensical fantasies.There clearly seemed to be some intelligence behind them. But what? Jung neededto know and in order to find out he decided to deliberately induce thefantasies. As he had ‘dropped down’ to some strange interior world when he hadstopping fighting off the feeling that he was going mad, Jung decided to use thefantasy of entering a cave or burrow as a starting point. He received somestartling results.Letting himself ‘go’ once again, Jung entered a cave and then found himself in ableak lunar landscape. There he encountered two people, a white-bearded old manand a young girl. The old man was Elijah and the girl Salome, both figures fromthe Bible. Jung approached them and as he did they began to speak to him. Salomewas blind and the two were accompanied by a huge black snake. Other figuresappeared too, such as Ka, a kind of earth spirit. But the inner figure thatproved most important for Jung was one named Philemon, another figure from theBible.4 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-142] He became a kind of ‘innerguru’ for Jung, informing him about the world he had entered and giving himguidance in understanding it. In the Red Book, the record Jung kept of what helater called his ‘descent into the unconscious’, Jung depicted Philemon as abald, white-bearded old man with bull’s horns and the wings of a kingfisher. Inhis autobiography Memories, Dreams, Reflections Jung recounts many‘synchronicities’ – his term for ‘meaningful coincidence’ – surrounding thisimage.5 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-143]Philemon told Jung much, but there was one bit of information that he passed onthat was the most important of all. Philemon informed Jung that ‘there arethings in the psyche which I do not produce but which produce themselves andhave their own life’.6 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-144] This was not aneasy thing for Jung to accept. He had had difficulty in allowing the fantasiesthat landed him at Philemon’s feet in the first place, feeling they were abetrayal of his intellectual integrity. Now he was being asked to accept that heshared his psyche with inhabitants that had their own will and identity andwhich were not necessarily interested in him. To put it bluntly, there werepeople in his head. But that was exactly what Philemon had to teach him. In aseminar given in 1925 Jung spoke about the trouble he had assimilating whatPhilemon told him. It was not easy to absorb the idea that the figures Jung wasencountering, like Philemon, had a life of their own, and that by entering theirworld, he had fallen into a strange reality that somehow existed independentlyof him, as independently as the world that existed outside his front door. Ifthis was true, then Jung – and presumably everyone else – was sharing his mindwith others.‘As soon as one begins to watch one’s mind, one begins to observe the autonomousphenomena in which one exists as a spectator,’ Jung told his audience. It tooksome effort on Jung’s part to accept this. ‘It took me a long time,’ he said,‘to admit to something in myself that was not myself’. It was rather like‘writing letters to a part of myself that was not myself’.7[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-145] Jung had to teach himself how toobserve his thoughts as phenomena, in the way that Goethe had observed hisplants, not as expressions of his personality, but of a life other than his.Like all of us, Jung had believed that his thoughts were his, but Philemon knewbetter. Jung’s thoughts were no more ‘his’ than the animals in a forest orpeople in a room were, nor did they depend on him to exist, as neither theanimals nor the people did. They had an objective reality of their own.Jung in fact called the world he had entered the ‘objective psyche’, a term thatI find more profitable and helpful than his more familiar coinage of the‘collective unconscious’. ‘Collective’ carries unhelpful connotations of a‘group mind’ or ‘mass consciousness’, when what Jung means is an ‘unconscious’that we all share, in the sense that we all have access to it – or it has accessto us – and which is beyond the contents of our own ‘personal’ unconscious,which is peculiarly ours. The idea of a collective unconscious also has racialconnotations and suggests a kind of psychic sediment, built up over millennia,rather like the silt that builds up at a river’s delta. But Jung seems to besaying – or at least Philemon does – that there are things in ‘his’, or ‘our’psyche, that have nothing to do with us. They are not the residue of countlessaeons of human experience, but seem to be manifestations of some ‘other’ world,some strange dimension of reality that intersects with ours in an unaccountableway in our minds.Jung was not the only one to recognise this. Some years after Jung’s encounterwith Philemon, Aldous Huxley wrote about his own inner travels, facilitated bythe use of the drug mescaline and other means. Huxley wrote that ‘Like the earthof a hundred years ago’ – Huxley was writing in 1956 – ‘our mind still has itsdarkest Africas, its unmapped Borneos and Amazonian basins’. Huxley agreed thatthe creatures that inhabit these ‘far continents’ of the mind – its ‘antipodes’,what Huxley called ‘Mind at Large’ – seem ‘improbable’, yet they are nonetheless‘facts of observation’, which argued for their ‘complete autonomy’ and‘self-sufficiency’.8 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-146] Huxley wrotethese words in his little book Heaven and Hell, a follow up to his first forayinto the mind’s antipodes, The Doors of Perception. He got the title from anearlier inner voyager – a ‘psychonaut’, to use Ernst Jünger’s phrase – whosework was an influence on Jung, the eighteenth century scientist and religiousthinker, Emanuel Swedenborg.Critics of Jung have argued that his celebrated ‘descent into the unconscious’was nothing more than a psychotic episode. Put briefly, for them, Jung had abreakdown following his break-up with Freud, and that’s the end of it. Suchsentiments are not uncommon. More than a century before Jung’s experience,Swedenborg faced accusations of madness and an attempt to have him put in anasylum. It failed and Swedenborg remained free, but his accounts of his journeysto heaven and hell led many to speculate that he was insane.9[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-147] It is a longstanding truism that oneman’s vision is another man’s madness. It’s to be expected that Freudians wouldtake the view that Jung had simply cracked up, and that this judgment would beshared by most ‘rationally’ minded people. We can be more generous and give Jungthe benefit of the doubt and accept that his conversations with Philemon weresomething more than the symptoms of psychosis. We can extend this to othervisionaries and accept that their visions were also ‘true’. But this stillleaves us with the problem of exactly how we can judge whether a vision ormystical experience is ‘objective’, that is real, and not only imaginary in thenegative sense.Such concerns are not limited to hard-nosed realists, eager to cut allpretentions to some ‘other reality’ down to size. The problem of ‘falseimagination’ has occupied visionaries and their fellow travellers for some time.Paracelsus, the great sixteenth century alchemist, made a distinction between‘true imagination’, what he called imaginatio vera, and mere fantasy, which hespoke of as the ‘madman’s cornerstone’ and an ‘exercise of thought withoutfoundation in nature’.10 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-148] Paracelsusknew the power of the imagination, which he called our ‘inner firmament’, theuniverse that extends within us in the same way that the astronomical universeextends outside us. He knew it had the power to heal, but also to kill. Hefamously said that: ‘It is possible that my spirit … through an ardent willalone, and without a sword, can stab and wound others’. Paracelsus knew ofpsychosomatic illnesses well before modern science acknowledged them; in hisOpus Paramirum (1531) – ‘Work Beyond Wonders’ – he speaks of ‘illnesses of theimagination’, in advance of both what we know of psychosomatic problems andFreudian neurosis. He seems to have anticipated the poet and magician W.B.Yeats’ remark that ‘whatever we build in the imagination will accomplish itselfin the circumstances of our lives’.11 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-149]A similar awareness of the concrete power of the imagination led Owen Barfieldto impress upon his readers the need for a ‘responsibility of the imagination’,an awareness that what we think inside our heads does not necessarily staythere.12 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-150]We’ve seen that Goethe made the point of insisting to Johann Herder that, havingfound the ‘secret of the reproduction and organisation of plants’ in hisUrpflanze and thence being able, at least in principle, to ‘go on foreverinventing plants’, he was nevertheless assured of their ‘logical’ consistency.Such plants may not already exist, he said, but they could, ‘for they are notthe shadowy phantoms of vain imagination, but possess an inner necessity andtruth’. The non-existing plants that Goethe could hypothetically create wouldnot be monsters in the original sense of the word – aberrations of nature – butin perfect keeping with Nature’s designs. This is because Goethe had matched the‘unknown law’ in the outer world, Nature, with the ‘unknown law’ in his innerone, his imagination. As I mentioned, these ‘unknown laws’ are what Coleridgecalled ‘facts of mind’, necessities of the imagination, that must be met inorder for it to be something more than a ‘madman’s cornerstone’. Failing this,imagination sinks to being merely what Coleridge called ‘fancy’, which isnothing more than ‘a mode of Memory’, a way of re-arranging elements obtainedthrough the senses (‘flying pigs’), which is all the ‘blank slate’ school ofpsychology will allow us. Or worse, it becomes a distortion of reality,Paracelsus’s ‘madman’s cornerstone’ or the kinds of images being produced bymuch of modern art that Barfield found indicative of a spiritual bankruptcy andwhich, with something like Yeats’ warning in mind, he feared could eventuallyproduce a ‘fantastically hideous world’.13[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-151]We can see then that true inner voyagers are aware of the problem of gauging thereality of their experiences. They don’t accept everything, as the simple-mindedor mad would, nor do they reject it all, as tough-minded realists would. Asscientists of the outer world do, they have to gather material, sort theirfacts, apply their critical intelligence and test their theories. We can saythat the only difference between our psychonauts and conventional scientists isthat they apply their analytical and intuitive skills to the inner world, notthe outer one. In this they have much in common with the spirit of Husserl’sphenomenology, which aims for a detailed descriptive account of experience,putting aside any assumptions about its ‘truth’ or ‘reality’.Given this, it may not be surprising that one of the people in the modern worldmost responsible for arguing the case for imagination as a way of knowledge, andnot merely as a means of ‘make believe’, spent a good part of his career as aphenomenologist, and in a sense remained one throughout it. Henry Corbin was born in Paris in 1903. At the age of twelve he entered theMonastery School of St Maur. Ill-health plagued him in his early years, causingmany absences from school, but by 1925 he had earned a degree in philosophy fromthe University of Paris, where he had studied under the philosopher and medievalscholar Étienne Gilson. Gilson brought the world of medieval philosophy to lifefor Corbin, presenting it, not as some dusty item in ‘the cabinet of the historyof philosophy’, but as a tradition of ‘permanent living possibilities ofthought’.14 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-152] This is much the same wayin which Corbin himself would present to modern readers other living thought ofthe past.It was through Gilson that Corbin was first introduced to Arab philosophy,specifically the work of Avicenna (980‒1030), who taught a version of Aristotleinformed by the ideas of Neoplatonism. This had reached the Arab world followingthe ‘esoteric exodus’ from ancient Alexandria.15[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-153] But it was while studying Stoicism andSt Augustine at the École des Hautes Études that Corbin encountered a thinkerwho would change his life. Louis Massignon, the Catholic scholar of Islam and avocal advocate of Christian-Muslim tolerance and understanding, gave Corbin acopy of an unusual text. It was the Hikmat al Ishrak – translated as OrientalPhilosophy – of the Persian gnostic philosopher Suhrawardi, who was martyred forhis beliefs in Aleppo in 1191 by order of Saladin. There was, Massignon thought,‘something in it’, for Corbin. He was right. The encounter was decisive. In aninterview years later Corbin explained that ‘with my meeting with Suhrawardi myspiritual destiny … was sealed. His Platonism, expressed in terms of Zoroastrianand ancient Persian angelology, illuminated the path that I was seeking’.16[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-154]That path, though, would lead through phenomenology, or at least the version ofit presented by Husserl’s one-time friend but later philosophical opponent,Martin Heidegger. In 1930 Corbin began reading Heidegger and in 1931 hetravelled to Freiburg, where Heidegger had taken over Husserl’s professorshipfollowing his retirement in 1928. The meeting proved fruitful and there werefurther encounters in 1935 and 1936. In 1938 a selection of Heidegger’s essaysCorbin had translated into French appeared under the title Que’est-ce que c’estla Métaphysique?, Heidegger’s introduction to French readers. Corbin’stranslations had a profound effect on the French philosophical scene and wereread avidly by people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, majorfigures in existentialism.17 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-155] It wasalso around this time that Corbin developed a close friendship with theChristian existential philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, who had been expelled fromLeninist Russia and had found a home in Paris. Berdyaev, too, was a prophet ofthe imagination, and his early work, The Meaning of the Creative Act (1916)remains a thrilling exploration of the spiritual character of creativity. It wasduring this time too that Corbin started attending the famous Eranos Conferencesheld in Ascona, Switzerland, where he became friends and colleagues with Jungand other esoteric scholars.Corbin was taken with Heidegger’s notion of truth as aletheia, as a ‘revealing’,a ‘letting be shown’.18 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-156] Aletheia is anancient Greek word meaning ‘disclosure’ or ‘unconcealedness’. Heidegger tracedthe word ‘phenomenon’ to the ancient Greek phainesthai, meaning ‘that whichshows itself in the light’. This was in opposition to Kant’s belief thatphenomena were representations that our cognitive apparatus makes of theverboten ‘thing-in-itself’ – thus opening a divide between knowledge and being –and positivism’s idea of truth as scientific fact expressed in logicalpropositions – so reducing truth to the limits of banal prose. Yet whilephenomena disclosed themselves in aletheia they at the same time concealedthemselves; they remained question marks, pointing to the revelation of Being.It was through Heidegger’s emphasis on the work of seeing ‘what was hidden inplain sight’, as it were – and we remember Goethe’s remark that Nature is givenin her totality if we have the eyes to see it – that his phenomenology movedtoward interpretation and, eventually, to hermeneutics, the study of how weunderstand things.Hermeneutics would, in the end, become the central theme of Corbin’s work. Hewould find much to lead him there in the obscure but profoundly stimulatingwritings of the eighteenth century ‘anti-Enlightenment’ thinker Johann GeorgHamann, ‘the Magus of the North’, as the philosopher Isaiah Berlin called him.19[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-157] Hamann was a kind of éminence grise ofRomanticism. A friend of Kant’s, and extolled by Goethe, Hegel and Kierkegaard,Hamann began as a true believer in the Enlightenment, but at some point he lostfaith in reason and science as the royal roads to truth and knowledge. Where theEnlightenment saw these as absolutely fundamental in our attempt to understandthe world, Hamann argued that they rested on an a-rational, pre-logical faith,rooted in the imagination and determined by the mysterious ways of language,which reason and logic will never grasp as they themselves emerge from it.With Owen Barfield and Erich Heller, Hamann agreed that ‘poetry is themother-tongue of the human race’, and that we have ‘fallen’ from this in ourfascination with logical deduction and scientific explanation.20[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-158] Like Barfield, Hamann believed that atthe earliest time, the split between word and thing that we experience today –with words as arbitrary ‘signifiers’ pointing to an equally arbitrary‘signified’ – was not the case. He posited a pre-lapsarian, Edenic language inwhich ‘creature spoke to creature’ because all shared in the logos of theCreator.For the Sprachphilosoph George Steiner, Hamann’s work is ‘radiantly dark’ andsprings ‘from the pregnant muddle of his extraordinary intellect and hisintimacy with theosophical and Kabbalistic speculations’.21[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-159] Like the Kabbalists, Hamann believedthat language, the word, was at the very heart of existence. For Hamann,language is not a rational system of notation, devised to communicateinformation, but the very stuff of being. For him, in the beginning was theword, literally. He works toward a ‘general theory of significant signs’ underthe assumption that ‘a nerve fabric of secret meanings and revelations liesbelow the surface structure of all language’.22[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-160] We decipher when we read, turningblack squiggles on a page into meaningful content, but also when we observeNature, which is a script written by God for his creatures to interpret in orderto share in its hidden meaning. The philosopher of symbolism, Ernst Cassirer,agrees with Steiner. As Cassirer wrote, for Hamann, language ‘is not acollection of discursive conventional signs for discursive concepts, but is thesymbol and counterpart of the same divine life which everywhere surrounds usvisibly and invisibly, mysteriously yet revealingly’.23[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-161]It was this notion, that signs of the divine hand behind creation surround us,if only we can learn the secret of how to read them, that led Corbin to plungeinto the difficult practice of what he called ‘spiritual hermeneutics’, the art,we can say, of deciphering God’s handwriting. Corbin referred to this using theArabic term ta’wil, a hermeneutical practice that shares much with Goethe’s‘active seeing’, Schwaller de Lubicz’s ‘intelligence of the heart’, andBarfield’s ‘participation’. In essence it is a means of ‘looking through’phenomena, making them translucent, penetrating their surface – withoutdiscarding it – in order to perceive their depths, their interior. If phenomenasimultaneously conceal and reveal a hidden, occult reality, then ta’wil is theinterpretative method by which that occult reality is revealed, by returning itsapparent surface, what is known as zahir, to its true depths, known as batin.But if Hamann and Heidegger provided the philosophical impetus for Corbin’swork, it was Suhrawardi who spoke to his mystical longing, which ran deep inhim. Corbin’s mysticism, we can say, was one of listening, of being attentive to‘things’ so as to hear their voice. In 1932 Corbin expressed this in a piece ofmeditative writing composed near Lake Siljan in Sweden. In ‘Theology by theLakeside’ Corbin reflected that: ‘There is only revelation’ and that ‘thingswill tell you who they are, if you listen, surrendered to them, like a lover’.(We remember Goethe’s ‘affectionate’ attention to his plants and Max Scheler’snotion of ‘phenomenological love’.) Corbin says that things will speak to himbecause, in the peace of the northern forest, the Earth came to him as an Angel– rather as Gustav Fechner had perceived it following his illumination. ‘For ateach moment that you really read … that you listen to the Angel, and to theEarth, and to Woman, you receive Everything’. But when we try to understand suchgifts with the logical mind, ‘give a name and retain, explain and recover, ah!there remains but a cipher …’24 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-162]Knowledge, then, is something more than the literal facts of experiencerecounted accurately. What we truly know is only what we suffer in our ownbeing. Once again, only like can know like.The need for a change of being in order to receive certain kinds of knowledge isat the heart of the ‘angelised Platonism’ Corbin found in Suhrawardi. Suhrawardiwas born in 1155 near the present-day towns of Zanjan and Bijar Garrus innorthwest Iran; he is named after his birthplace, Suhraward. After studyingAristotle and Avicenna in Maragheh and then logic in Isfahan, Suhrawardiembarked on a ‘knowledge quest’ or ‘initiatory journey’, a not unfamiliaractivity for esoteric scholars. This took him through Anatolia, where he cameinto contact with Sufi schools and masters, including Fakhr al-Din al-Mardini.Like Suhrawardi himself, Fakhr al-Din al-Mardini combined mysticism withrigorous logic, a union that Suhrawardi looked for in other seekers of truth.Suhrawardi adopted the Sufic way of life, embracing an ascetic practice, wearingthe rough suf wool, from which the Sufis get their name and surrendering himselfto the ecstasies of sama, the Sufi music. But he also maintained a strictphilosophical discipline, subjecting his ecstasies to severe criticism andanalysis. His work was ‘addressed precisely to those who aspire at once to bothmystical experience and philosophical knowledge’ and should, he said, betransmitted only to ‘him who is worthy, chosen from among those who have givenevidence of a solid knowledge of the peripaticians’ philosophy [Aristotle] whiletheir hearts are nevertheless captured by love for the divine Light’.25[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-163] It was clear to Suhrawardi, as it wasto other ‘imaginative knowers’, that what was needed in order to arrive at real‘truth’, was thought and feeling working together in a creative polarity, not inopposition.Suhrawardi reached Aleppo in 1183 and he soon became friends with the city’sgovernor, al-Malik al-Zahir, the son of the great Salah ad-Din Yusuf Ibn Ayyub,known to the west as Saladin. Suhrawardi became al-Mailk’s tutor, a positionenvied by the local scholars, who already scorned Suhrawardi because of hisheretical beliefs and skill in dialectics, which he displayed to their regret intheir debates with him. He was obviously influenced by the words of the‘philosophers’, which for devout Muslims was a term of abuse. Soon the scholars’enmity toward Suhrawardi would prove fatal.The philosophers who influenced Suhrawardi came from pre-Islamic Persia, ancientGreece and Egypt. Together their ideas formed a potent blend of Zoroastrianism,Plato and the wisdom traditions of Alexandria, what Suhrawardi called a‘philosophy of Light’, a tradition of esoteric metaphysics that was handed downfrom sage to sage, Suhrawardi believed, through the ages. In 1186 Suhrawarditried to capture its essence in Hikmat al-Ishraq, translated, as mentioned, asOriental Philosophy and also as The Philosophy of Illumination, the book thatset Corbin on his hermeneutical quest. Suhrawardi wrote of an initiatic chain, aschool of adepts reaching back into the dim past, and which included the fabledHermes Trismegistus, Zoroaster, Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus and others. All wereinformed by the same primal revelation, the prisca theologia or ‘primaltheology’, which it was his task to resurrect.These ideas did not go down well with the orthodox jurists, ulama and mullahs ofAleppo. They accused Suhrawardi of practising magic and prophecy, and said hewould lead the people and their governor, Saladin’s son, astray. They petitionedSaladin for Suhrawardi’s execution saying he was corrupting the young, the samecharge that the council of Athens had brought against Socrates. Saladin acceptedtheir petition and ordered Suhrawardi’s death. Suhrawardi voiced a spiriteddefence and al-Malik al-Zahir at first refused to carry out his father’scommand, but eventually he had to concede. It remains unclear exactly howSuhrawardi met his death; some accounts say he was starved to death, others sayhe was strangled, still others say he was beheaded or crucified. But sometime in1191 – some accounts put the date further on – Suhrawardi died. Henceforth hewas known, not only as the Shaikh al-Ishraq, the ‘Master of Illumination’, butalso as the Shaikh al-Maqtl, the ‘murdered Master’.If Suhrawardi’s mission was to resurrect the ancient philosophy of Light, we cansee Corbin’s own mission as carrying on Suhrawardi’s work in the modern world.Through his many writings Corbin has introduced modern readers to an idea thatruns throughout esoteric thought, although articulated in different ways, andwhich we’ve already touched on a few times in this book.26[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-164] This is what is known as the ’âlamal-mithâl, or, as Corbin calls it, the mundus imaginalis, or ‘Imaginal World’.As Corbin writes, this is ‘a very precise order of reality, which corresponds toa precise mode of perception’. This ‘order of reality’ and ‘mode of perception’is based on a ‘visionary spiritual experience’ that Suhrawardi believed was ‘asfully relevant as the observations of Hipparchus and Ptolemy are considered tobe relevant to astronomy’.27 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-165]Hipparchus and Ptolemy may no longer be so relevant to contemporary astronomy,but Suhrawardi’s point is clear. The ‘visionary spiritual experience’ he speaksof, which involves his ‘inner firmament’, is, for the gnostic philosopher, theequivalent of the meticulous observations and charts the astronomers of his timemade of the stars, our ‘outer firmament’. But while Hipparchus, Ptolemy andtoday’s astronomers use their eyes to make their observations, Suhrawardi’saccount of his experience is based on the use of his organs of inner sight. Whatthese inner organs perceive is just as ‘real’ as the stars that Hipparchuscharted, but like the inhabitants of Jung’s ‘objective psyche’, or those ofHuxley’s ‘Mind at Large’, it exists in an interior dimension that we can gainaccess to through our subjective worlds.Corbin coined the term ‘Imaginal’ for this realm, in order to differentiate itfrom our usual ideas of the ‘imaginary’, and he placed it in an intermediatesphere between the realm of pure ideas – Plato’s Forms – and that of sensoryreality, solid matter. He affirmed that the Imaginal is ‘ontologically as realas the world of the senses and that of the intellect’.28[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-166] This means that the Imaginal has itsown mode of being, and that it can’t be reduced to the status of ‘just an idea’– as Schiller considered Goethe’s Primal Plant – or some reflection of aphysical tree. We can think of the idea of a ‘tree’ and know what we mean by it.And we can also see an actual, physical tree, standing in the garden. But we canalso imagine a tree and form an image of it in our minds. This image occupies akind of middle ground between the bare notion of ‘tree’ and the physical thingrising up from the lawn, rather as an artist’s image of what he wants to expressoccupies a middle ground between the idea behind his work and the finished,physical product. The ‘blank slate’ school of psychology says that our image ofa tree is merely the mental residue of our seeing an actual tree. Goethe woulddisagree. He would say that our image of a tree is an expression of theUrpflanze, which has a reality of its own, not dependent upon information abouttrees given by the senses collecting in my mind. As Goethe said, without thisprior image, how would I know what was a tree and what wasn’t?We usually think of the imaginary as unreal, false – in general as some way lessthan the physical, sensory world. Or we see it as leading to ‘novelty’ or the‘cutting edge’ in some process – this means technology most often today. ButCorbin and Jung and others contend that for them – and potentially for all of us– the ‘Imaginal’ constitutes an entire world of its own, that is just asobjective as the sensory world, with its own geography, history, laws, and, asJung discovered, its own inhabitants.Suhrawardi discovered some inhabitants of the mundus imaginalis himself. Hisneed for a ‘precise mode of perception’ arose from the kinds of initiatoryexperiences he underwent and which led to his ‘philosophy of illumination’.Through a series of meditations, Suhrawardi charted the way within. His innervoyage led to what he called Nâ-Kojâ-Abâd, ‘the country of no-where’. UnlikeUtopia, this did not mean a place that does not exist – a distinction Corbin isat pains to make. Rather it indicates an interior location, a place that cannotbe found on any map, or any physical terrain, but which occupies a position inSuhrawardi’s ‘hierarchy of light’. This is the chain of being reaching from thehighest spiritual realms to our own mundane world, versions which appear inHermeticism, Neoplatonism, Kabbalah and other traditions of Western esotericism.This descent marks an increasing solidification or materialisation of what is inessence spiritual; that is, non-manifest, non-physical.For Suhrawardi, borrowing from Neoplatonic ontology, light is the closest wecome in the physical world to the non-manifest spiritual essence. From a SupremeLight of Lights, beyond our physical world, emanations radiate out, gradually‘hardening’, and becoming dense – an idea that modern science seems to havepicked up on – and in the process eventually arriving at our universe.29[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-167]Suhrawardi sees this ‘ladder of lights’ as an angelic hierarchy, a theme heborrows from Zoroastrianism. In this arrangement, each rung on the ladder is anangel, while the angel itself is the state of consciousness proper to this levelof being. As in Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Gnosticism and Kabbalah, inSuhrawardi’s ‘philosophy of light’, the philosopher’s task is to journey back upthe ladder, to ascend it to its source. This was accomplished through a seriesof meditations and visualisations in which, as Jung did, the philosopher wouldencounter some of the inhabitants of this strange realm.Suhrawardi wrote what we can call ‘visionary tales’ in which the states ofconsciousness – or levels of being – that he reached would be symbolised in anarrative, with the characters and setting embodying the spiritual realities heencountered. That is, he used his imagination to transmute his ‘inner spiritualstates’ into ‘vision events’, creating a kind of story symbolising his level ofconsciousness.30 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-168] We can say he engagedin what we can call a kind of ‘waking dream’, precisely the kind of consciousfantasy that enabled Jung to pass out of his everyday world and into the‘objective psyche’. Jung later called his method of doing this ‘activeimagination’, a means of reaching a creative dialogue between the conscious andunconscious mind which he often used in his practice.31[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-169] That Corbin would agree with the ideathat the Imaginal can be reached via a ‘waking dream’ is clear. He urged hisreaders that we needed ‘to be clear in our minds as to the real meaning andimpact of the mass of information about the typographies explored in thevisionary state, i.e., the intermediary state between sleeping and waking’.32[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-170]This liminal condition is known as the ‘hypnagogic state’, a transitional modeof consciousness that we experience at least twice a day: when we fall asleepand when we wake up.33 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-171] As I havepointed out elsewhere, Jung was an experienced hypnagogist, as was Swedenborg.34[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-172] Swedenborg was apparently able tomaintain the liminal state between sleeping and waking for extended periods andit was during these that he undertook his journeys to heaven and hell.35[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-173] Swedenborg’s visits to heaven, hell,and an intermediary sphere he called the ‘spirit world’ were undertaken by himin the same way as Suhrawardi undertook his journey to Nâ-Kojâ-Abâd. He wouldrelax into a condition he called ‘passive potency’, a state of observantreceptivity, a kind of calm alertness, in which his conscious mind could watchthe operations of the unconscious – or, as Swedenborg would have said it, thespiritual worlds. This was not far different from Goethe’s attitude toward hisPrimal Plant with his ‘active seeing’. Swedenborg would then be taken on a tourof heaven, hell, or the spirit world by an angel, rather as Jung was shownaround the collective unconscious by Philemon. What made this different from adream is that Swedenborg remained conscious throughout; he ‘saw’ and ‘heard’ inthe same way that he did in waking life, but what he observed took place withinhim.36 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-174]Movement in these other spheres, as in Nâ-Kojâ-Abâd, was not through a physicalspace, but through changes of ‘state’, changes in consciousness, so ‘place’ and‘state’ became synonymous. While many of his contemporaries still believed in anactual heaven or hell occupying some remote yet nevertheless tangible place,Swedenborg was advancing the very modern idea that heaven and hell are states ofmind, dispositions of the soul, interior spaces that we carry around with us. AsSwedenborg and other explorers of the hypnagogic have observed, the visions seenin this state are self-symbolic. That is, the images seen and voices heard inthe hypnagogic state symbolise the state of the psyche at that time. HerbertSilberer, a colleague of Jung and, like him, deeply interested in the linkbetween alchemy and psychology, wrote an important paper on this phenomena whichalmost certainly influenced Jung’s ideas about ‘active imagination’. It is not afar cry from the auto-symbolic character of hypnagogic phenomena to Suhrawardi’suse of the imagination to transform ‘inner states’ into ‘vision events’.37[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-175]Another area in which Swedenborg and Suhrawardi meet is in Swedenborg’s notionof the ‘doctrine of correspondences’.38[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-176] This states that there is acorrespondence between the things of the earth and those of the spiritualrealms. Everything in our world of space and time correspondences to a spiritualreality in the realms beyond. ‘The whole natural world,’ Swedenborg wrote,‘corresponds to the spiritual world – not just the natural world in general, butactually in details. It is vital,’ he tells us, ‘to understand that the naturalworld emerges and endures from the spiritual world, just like an effect from thecause that produces it’.39 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-177] Spiritualknowledge, spiritual education, comes from the slow process of learning how todecipher these correspondences, to see the reflection of the higher in thelower, the divine in the everyday. Just as the reader must interpret a text, weread the world, trying to grasp the deeper meaning below the literal one; as theNobel prize winning poet Czeslaw Milosz said: ‘Swedenborg’s world is alllanguage’.40 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-178]The similarity of the practice of recognising correspondences to ta’wil seemsobvious. Both are a form of ‘spiritual hermeneutics’, the discipline of diviningthe hidden meaning, the depth (batin or esoteric) both announced and obscured bythe surface (zahir or exoteric). As Christopher Bamford writes, for bothSuhrawardi and Swedenborg ‘there is no apparent, sensible phenomenon that doesnot also mask, and hence manifest, a hidden, suprasensible noumenal reality’.41[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-179] In the nineteenth century, the Frenchpoet Charles Baudelaire, a reader of Swedenborg, took his notion ofcorrespondences and applied it to poetry and art in general, in the processinaugurating the age of Symbolism, which looked at the world metaphorically, inways that link it to Barfield’s ideas about participation and Heller’sreservations about the ‘age of prose’.42[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-180]I should mention that Rudolf Steiner was also an accomplished hypnagogist, andthere is good reason to believe that when Steiner read the Akashic Record, theoccult history of the cosmos that he was able to discern ‘supersensibly’, he didthis when in the hypnagogic state. Accounts of his lectures suggest that whenSteiner read the Akashic Record, he would turn his eyes away from the light,retreat into himself, and make a ‘deliberate adjustment of his being’, and thatwhen he spoke about ancient Atlantis, Lemuria, or some other aspect of theoccult history of humankind or the earth, he seemed to be actually seeing whathe was conveying to his audience.43 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-181]Steiner believed that prior to the kind of consciousness common to us now,humankind experienced a kind of ‘picture thinking’, rather like the poeticalcondition of things Owen Barfield suggested was the case before the rise ofindependent rational thought. Steiner called this ancient form of consciousnessby the somewhat awkward term ‘Old Moon’ and in A Secret History of ConsciousnessI suggest that there are important similarities between our Old Moonconsciousness and the hypnagogic state.Jung visited the objective psyche, Swedenborg went to heaven and hell, Steinerread the Akashic Record. In Suhrawardi’s case his journey to Nâ-Kojâ-Abâdentailed its own unique and equally unusual features. Although his ‘visionarytales’, and those of other ‘philosophers of light’ that Corbin studied, differin detail, they all share some elements in common. When, like the others,Suhrawardi had entered the proper state of calm alertness, his attention focusedwithin, the interior voyage began. As Jung and Swedenborg did, Suhrawardi soonfound that he was not alone. He discovered he was in the presence of a spiritualbeing. This being, known as ‘the messenger’, asks the voyager, Suhrawardihimself, who is called ‘the stranger’, who he is and where he comes from. Thestranger answers that he is a traveller who seeks to return home, to his truecountry beyond the realm of the senses. The journey homeward will take himbeyond Mount Qâf, what Corbin calls the ‘cosmic mountain’. This is made up ofthe celestial spheres the voyager must ascend on his return journey up theladder of light back to his source, a common theme in the Western innertradition. There, beyond Mount Qâf, the voyager finds his true self, his higherbeing, and as he does he finds that he is approaching Hūrqalyā, the ‘spiritualcity’, which begins at the ‘convex surface’ of the ‘Ninth Sphere’, the ‘Sphereof Spheres’, which embraces the entire cosmos.The stranger then passes beyond this sphere, and when he does, somethingextraordinary happens. Where in our everyday world we assume that we are ‘in’the cosmos – that like everything else we are ‘objects’ situated in space –here, beyond Mount Qâf, this seems to be no longer the case. Here, what weexperience and perceive as the ‘outer world’ is seen to exist entirely withinour own inner world. We are not in the cosmos; it is within us, something theancient Hermeticists, with their notion of the microcosm, or little cosmos,understood. As Corbin writes: ‘once the journey is completed, the reality whichhas hitherto been an inner and hidden one turns out to envelop, surround orcontain that which at first was outer and visible’.44[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-182]This seems a somewhat mystical or esoteric way of expressing Husserl’s idea ofstepping outside the ‘natural standpoint’, something Corbin would have beenfamiliar with from his phenomenological studies. Certainly the most fundamentalmatter-of-fact truth of the natural standpoint is that the world exists outsideus, and has done so, for aeons before we existed and will do so for aeons afterwe die. Stepping outside the natural standpoint entails a temporary suspensionof this belief, but for those who arrive beyond the Ninth Sphere it strikes as arevelation. As Corbin wrote: ‘for those who reach Nâ-Kojâ-Abâd everythinghappens contrary to the evidence of ordinary consciousness …’45[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-183] In Suhrawardi’s case, and in that ofthe other gnostic voyagers who followed in his path, the reality of a cosmosinside our consciousness is brought home with a peculiar power.Corbin was aware of the question asked earlier, of how inner voyagers,travellers in the Imaginal, can navigate among the rocks and shallows of fantasyand on to the wider waters of the true imagination, the imaginatio vera, orastrum in homine, Paracelsus’ ‘inner firmament’. There is a ‘lost continent ofthe mind’, but the way to rediscovering it requires accurate maps and charts andthe knowledge necessary to read them. Corbin speaks of a ‘type of control’ thatcan ‘protect imagination from straying and from reckless wastage’. We can knowwhen imagination has gone astray because at that point it will ‘cease to fulfilits function of perceiving and producing the symbols that lead to innerintelligence’. At that point it will have left the mundus imaginalis and haveentered realms of subjective fantasy.46[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-184]What differentiates the images seen with true imagination from thephantasmagoria of subjective fantasy is that the phenomena of the Imaginal havethe power to dispel ‘the mutual isolation of consciousness and its object, ofthought and being’. That is to say, their reality and our knowing them, ourexperience of them, are the same. As Corbin says, with this ‘phenomenologybecomes ontology’, ‘appearance’ and ‘being’ becoming one.47[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-185] The split between reality and ourknowledge of it, which has held Western philosophy in thrall, is healed.For Westerners, brought up with the unquestioned acceptance of a strict distancebetween subject and object, this is not an easy thing to grasp, and Corbin’smeaning is not always clear. But with persistent meditation it gets through. Forexample, the following reflection I believe requires repeated reading. ‘Thesoul,’ Corbin writes, is ‘capable of perceiving concrete things whose existence… constitutes eo ipso the very concrete existential form of these things’. Thatis to say, with these phenomena ‘consciousness and its object are ontologicallyinseparable’. In the Imaginal, knower and known are one. The kinds of phenomenawe find in the Imaginal are what Goethe meant by his Urphänomena. For Goethe andCorbin they are both ‘unconditional and irreducible’ and ‘cannot manifest in anyother way in this world’.This is what Goethe meant when he told his friend Herder that with the secret ofthe Primal Plant, ‘it will be possible to go on forever inventing plants andknow that their existence is logical’ because they would not be ‘the shadowyphantoms of vain imagination, but possess an inner necessity and truth’.48[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-186] This inner necessity and truth keepsthe imagination from sliding off the rails.It is through the work of the ‘active’ or ‘true imagination’ that, as Corbinwrites, ‘psychic energies that have been neglected or paralysed by our habits’can be revived’.49 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-187] These energies canthen be used to perform the work of ta’wil, the spiritual hermeneutics that canresuscitate the world of phenomena, which has fallen into the deadening embraceof mechanistic science and utilitarian exploitation. Functioning as a ‘facultyand organ of knowledge, just as real – if not more real than – the senses’,‘true imagination’ releases ‘things’ from their bondage by returning them totheir archetypal source in the Imaginal. At the same time true imagination canfree us from what Barfield calls our ‘idolatry’ to things, our slavish deferenceto their presumed primacy over the consciousness that co-creates them, amistaken humbleness abetted by reductionist science and ‘blank slate’psychology. True imagination has a transformative power; it can alchemicallytransmute information from the senses into symbols to be deciphered or languageto be translated. In essence it turns ‘facts’ into ‘meaning’ by linking partsinto wholes. It does not ‘construct something unreal’ – that is the business offantasy – but ‘unveils the hidden reality’. Its work, as Corbin writes, is to‘occultate the apparent’ – that is to obscure it – and it does this in order to‘manifest the hidden’, turning, we can say, the inside out.50[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-188]As Owen Barfield did, Corbin recognised the need for a ‘responsibility of theimagination’, guidelines as it were to keep it from, as he says, straying into‘reckless wastefulness’. For Corbin this meant a tradition, a body of practicesand beliefs that recognised the importance of the imagination and could providea structure and discipline that would help it keep its integrity. As a‘philosopher of light’, he understood this in a particular way. He spoke of theneed for ‘access to a cosmology structured similarly to that of the traditionaloriental philosophies, with a plurality of universes arranged in ascendingorder’.51 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-189] By this he meant the ladderof being that is at the heart of the Western esoteric tradition, the order ofreality reaching from the unmanifest source to the solid earth, thatHermeticists, Neoplatonists and Kabbalists all in different ways recognise.Traditional oriental philosophies meant for Corbin the ‘philosophy of light’ andprisca theologia that Suhrawardi wanted to resurrect, but we would not do wrongif we broadened this to include all philosophies that set mind, spirit orconsciousness as primary, rather than give physical reality pride of place, asour scientistic faiths do.Such a tradition is needed, Corbin believed, because without it there is thevery real danger that in its absence, our imagination will remain, as he putsit, ‘out of focus’ and its ‘recurrent conjunctions with our will-to-power willbe a never-ending source of horrors’.52[part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-190] A wilful imagination can be aformidable thing. That the collective imagination was clearly out of focusseemed obvious to Corbin when he wrote these words some forty years ago, and itis questionable whether it has righted itself in the meantime. Indeed there isevidence to suggest that it has got worse. Corbin even entertained the idea thatit may have been in some way necessary to lose access to the mundus imaginalis,to allow it to be bereft of its sacred character and become secularised, so thatthe ‘fantastic, the horrible, the monstrous, the macabre, the miserable, and theabsurd could come to the fore’.53 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-num-note-191] Thesimilarity with Barfield’s concern about an unchecked imagination – or, moreaccurately, fantasy – producing a ‘fantastically hideous world’ seems obvious.Perhaps by allowing it carte blanche the unconscious might be purged of itsdemons; it could exhaust its shadow by allowing it free reign, and throughindulgence reach satiety if not wisdom. The blasé acceptance of the surfeit ofsex, violence, vulgarity and coarse, crude humour which makes up much ofcontemporary entertainment – and of which there seems no end – suggests at leastthat our unregulated imaginations have run out of steam. This may lead to achange of taste, or, perhaps more likely, to the need for stronger stimulants toelicit some reaction.Yet if such an inoculation of the hideous was in some way necessary, surely bynow we have endured its effects long enough to gain whatever benefit wasexpected from it? Is it not time for the imagination to remember its truecalling, its real work and purpose? There have been many who believed this wasso and who throughout the Imaginal’s decline into the merely imaginary, workedto keep the tradition of the true imagination alive. They understood the needfor a ‘plurality of universes arranged in ascending order’, for a hierarchy ofspiritual states and conditions of consciousness, because it was evident to themthat reality itself was so arranged and that ultimately the mind behind thisarrangement was one with their own. Like Suhrawardi and other ancientphilosophers of light, they felt themselves exiled in this fallen world andsought the way back home. For many of them that way led through poetry.NOTES1 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-139] The ‘twelve dead’ eventually becamethe source of Jung’s strange Gnostic work, The Seven Sermons of the Dead. SeeGary Lachman, Jung the Mystic (NY: Tarcher/Penguin, 2010) pp. 122–24.2 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-140] Jung was not the only one at thistime to receive portents of the coming disaster. In 1912 the GermanExpressionist painter Ludwig Meidner produced a series of ‘ApocalypticLandscapes’ that depicted cities laid to waste. In them Meidner painted cometsshooting across the sky, a black sun, men and women running screaming throughthe streets and buildings collapsing. Meidner painted this works in a briefburst of inspiration; his later work lacks the intensity of these disturbingcanvases. One may speculate that the same prophetic genius that gripped Meidneralso came to Jung. http://weimarart.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/ludwig-meidner.html[http://weimarart.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/ludwig-meidner.html]3 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-141] Henri Ellenberger, The Discovery ofthe Unconscious (London: Fontana Press, 1994) p. 673.4 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-142] Philemon was a Christian whoreceived a letter from St Paul, the Epistle to Philemon, found in the NewTestament.5 [part0008_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-143] For example, while working on hispainting of Philemon, Jung came across a dead kingfisher along Lake Zürich.

Erich Kahler was one of the leading lights of a generation ofCentral European humanist scholars the like of which is practically unknowntoday; George Steiner is perhaps the closest we can get to one of them. Alongwith many other Central European intellectuals, Kahler fled the rise of Nazismin the 1930s and found a new home in the United States. In Kahler’s case, thismeant Princeton, New Jersey.At the time of Kahler’s arrival in 1938 – following some time in Great Britain –Princeton was home to perhaps the most famous of the intellectual émigrésfleeing fascism, Albert Einstein. Kahler and Einstein became friends, andremained so until Einstein’s death in 1955. Kahler was also a close friend ofthe novelist Thomas Mann, whose books, like Einstein’s, were heaped upon thebonfires by ardent members of the German Student Union in universities acrossthe Third Reich. Another novelist who became close friends with Kahler, and whowas also persecuted by the Nazis, was the Austrian Hermann Broch. It was inKahler’s home in Princeton that Broch wrote what is considered to be hismasterpiece, The Death of Virgil, a work that is as much a gigantic prose poemas it is a novel, depicting in hallucinatory detail the consciousness of theRoman poet Virgil as he approaches death. In the process Broch createdliterature that, as Aldous Huxley remarked, brought the reader to ‘the verylimits of the expressible’.‘The limits of the expressible’ may be an appropriate way to encapsulate thetheme of a series of lectures Kahler gave in spring 1967, at PrincetonUniversity, just three years before his death in 1970. The title of hislectures, The Disintegration of Form in the Arts, may give us an idea of whatKahler was concerned with. What troubled him was what he saw as the seeminglyirrevocable ‘loss of form’ in the arts. This may seem of limited interest, ofsignificance only to students of art history. But like Corbin and Barfield,Kahler saw the state of the imagination in the late twentieth century as anindication of wider issues. Like them, Kahler took what was happening in theworld of art as a sign of certain troubling developments in Westerncivilisation, but also as an agent of what he considered ‘an extremely dangeroustrend of events’.1 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-192]By the time Kahler gave his lectures, Western art had for some years gonethrough a series of dizzying changes and for a humanist of his generation itwould not be an exaggeration to say that it had become something unrecognisable.Exactly where we want to mark the start of this change is debatable, but I thinkwe can agree that between Marcel Duchamp’s urinal and Andy Warhol’s Brillo box,art had entered terrain rather different from the kind it had inhabited before.Kahler had lived through this transformation and seen it all and his response toart’s ‘loss of form’ couldn’t be dismissed as the whinging of an old fogey, outof step with the times. Hermann Broch’s work was considered as ‘experimental’ asthat of James Joyce – whose Ulysses was like nothing before it – and Einsteinhad already caused a revolution in our ideas about the universe. Kahler, whoknew both men well, was intimately acquainted with innovation, both in the artsand in science.It was the times themselves, from Kahler’s perspective, that were very much outof step, at least from the point of view of someone who was concerned with ‘whatmakes human beings human, what keeps humanity, the genus humanum human’.2[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-193] The loss of form that troubled Kahlerwas responsible for more than a glut of bad, or at best incomprehensible art,reprehensible and disturbing as that was. It was a sign that our very idea ofwhat it means to be human was under attack.Form, for Kahler, is a sign of wholeness, of a coherence between self and theworld, of an ‘inner organisation’ that is necessary and not arbitrary, an ideawe have already looked at in different ways in this book. It is not the same asshape. A lake, he argues, has a shape, but as it lacks structure, it has noform; water, we know, takes on the shape of its container, and if the shorelinearound a lake was to change, the shape of the lake would too. It has no organicwholeness, hence no organic form. The same is true of a stone. If you split astone in two, you do not have two halves of one broken whole but only twosmaller stones.3 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-194] ‘But,’ as Kahlerwrites, ‘any organic body, any living creature has form, indeed is form’, aremark with which Goethe would have been in total agreement.4[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-195]Form and its metamorphosis were, we know, of central importance to Goethe. Hewould recognise, as we all would, that if you cut a plant in half, you do nothave two smaller plants but one dead one. Given that humans, for Kahler, are ‘upto this point the most highly structured being’, we are, then, the ‘mostadvanced natural form of all’. This is because human reality ‘extends far beyondphysical existence into realms of psychic, intellectual, and spiritualreflection’ and ‘through memory and awareness of identity, into the dimension oftime, that is, into history’.5 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-196] Humanform, then, is not only limited to that of our physical bodies, but involves ourentire idea and significance of what it means to be human.Form, for Kahler, as it was for Goethe, is not static. He was not arguing forsome fixed idea of humanity, to be maintained against all change. ‘Whenever newspheres, new depths of existence are disclosed by a thrust into the unknown,’ hewrites, ‘these experiences will have to be integrated into a further completewhole’ which can lead to a ‘broader, more comprehensive, perfection of form’.‘Again and again the wholeness of existence must be re-established, a new, widerand more complex wholeness must be apprehended’.6[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-197] This effort entails the ‘intenserendering of some existential coherence’ which, ultimately, should lead to anincrease in consciousness.Consciousness, for Kahler, is defined as ‘awareness of self’ and of ‘thecoherence of the self within a coherence of its surrounding world’.7[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-198] Yet what Kahler saw taking place inthe twentieth century was the opposite of this. Instead of an increase inconsciousness through the assimilation of experience into a greater whole, whatwas taking place seemed to be an unstoppable ‘erosion’ of such awareness.Beginning with Dada and moving through Surrealism up to abstract expressionism,‘action painting’, and the ‘happenings’ of the 1960s, what Kahler saw was ‘thetotal destruction of coherence, and with it … the conscious destruction ofconsciousness’. It was an eruption of purposeful chaos, we might say. Lookingout on the landscape of modern art and culture, Kahler saw an ‘outspoken attemptto produce incoherence as such, devoid of any cause or purpose’. There was a‘veritable cult of incoherence, of sheer senselessness and aimlessness’.8[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-199] In the aleatory compositions of JohnCage, the ‘active confusion’ of the intellectual demagogue, Marshall McLuhan,who abandoned meaningful content with his dictum that the ‘medium was themessage’, and the sensory barrage of ‘multi-media’ overload – siphoning offaspects of ‘Scientism’ for artistic purposes – Kahler saw at work a deliberateattempt to undermine the whole conception of coherence in a misguided movementto break free of what it considered the restrictions of outworn, outmodedsensibilities. One of the main driving forces behind this demolition work,Kahler believed, was the increasing technological character of modern life.Today mechanisation ‘takes command’ and grows and grows ‘unimpeded, according toits own self-propelled rationale’, pushing it more and more beyond our capacityto control it. The fear Goethe had about a kind of knowledge that would not leadto the good life but to what was pernicious seemed, to Kahler, to have beenjustified.Kahler wasn’t the only cultural commentator disturbed by developments in modernart and in culture at large. In the same year that Kahler gave his lectures thehistorian Jacques Barzun published an article in which he remarked on the ‘nowstandardised virulence of the artistic temper, the desperate violence ofexpression resorted to as a matter of course’.9[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-200] Barzun suggested that the reason forthis de rigueur artistic violence – what Kahler called ‘creative vandalism’ –was the permissive society that arrived when the forces of Liberalism ‘no longerfound barriers to break down’ and the ‘last ounce of energy in emancipation’ wasgone. He quotes the existentialist writer Simone de Beauvoir, who said of herearly years: ‘We had no external limitations, no overriding authority, noimposed pattern of existence’.10 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-201] Suchfreedom – if that is what it is – Barzun believed leaves ‘nothing to pushagainst but the empty air’. This seems agreeable at first but it soon ‘ends bycausing the anguish of pointlessness – the horror of the absurd’.11[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-202] A few years later Barzun expanded onthis theme in talks he gave for the A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, underthe title The Use and Abuse of Art.12 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-203]Another voice concerned about what was happening to the modern imagination wasthat of William Barrett, an American philosopher whose book Irrational Man,published in 1958, was one of the first widely read popular works onexistentialism. Barrett had a good grounding in the absurd but by the early1970s, the forces of dissolution accompanying it seemed to have gotten out ofhand. In a work called Time of Need, published in 1972, Barrett noted that ‘theforms of imagination that any epoch produces are an ultimate datum on what thatepoch is’.13 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-204] If that was the case,then the epoch in question was something of a mess. Barrett echoed Kahler andBarzun by noting that ‘an observer from outside might very well say of our artof the last fifty years that there seems let loose in it a rage to destroy, asif the culture itself were bent on working towards conclusions that destroy itsown premises’.14 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-205] But where Kahler andBarzun focused more on what was disturbing about recent developments, Barretthit on an insight that Erich Heller had grasped as well.One of the reasons for the chaos of modern culture, Barrett saw, was that theolder, traditional symbols that once contained the poetic and aesthetic‘charge’, had been emptied out. Like exhausted batteries, they could no longerhold the energy required to make an artistic impact, to move the viewer or toreveal new dimensions of reality. Through over exposure, a decline in religiousand humanistic faith, the increasing mechanisation of life, or the growingcynicism of an audience who had seen it all and knew too much by half, the iconsand images of an earlier tradition were now little more than clichés,old-fashioned targets on which the irony and sarcasm of the avant-garde scoredrepeated bullseyes. Duchamp’s moustache on the Mona Lisa and Bunuel’s film L’Aged’Or are prime examples, but one could easily provide many more.15[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-206] This did not mean that the artist orpoet found no new forms to hold the energies of art. But these now seemedhaphazard and arbitrary, and in this he or she was spoiled for choice.‘Anything, and ever more anything’, Heller said of the artist, ‘invited his fairattention’, turning him into ‘the Don Juan of the creative spirit’.16[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-207] Heller quotes from T.S. Eliot whoasked: ‘Why out of all we have heard, seen, felt … do certain images recur,charged with emotion, rather than others?’ Eliot ran through a list of suchimages: ‘the song of one bird, the leap of one fish, … the scent of one flower,an old woman on a German mountain path…’17[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-208] While in novelists like Proust, forwhom a piece of cake opened inner doorways, or poets like Rilke, who offered hisAngel simple, everyday things – a house, a bridge, a fountain or gate – whattakes place is what the philosopher Arthur Danto called the ‘transfiguration ofthe commonplace’, in most other modern artistic expressions it is thecommonplace that is emphasised and not the transfiguration.18[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-209]Someone who also recognised this draining of energy from hitherto traditionalsymbols and the rise of the commonplace, if not the brutal and ugly, was thepoet and Blake scholar Kathleen Raine. Raine was born in 1908 in a suburb ofLondon, but a move north took her from the grey streets of Ilford to acountryside still untamed by the modern world. In her early years she was takento her grandparents’ home where she roamed free amidst the beauty of nature andthe years she spent on the Northumberland moors, on England’s Scottish border,during the First World War, remained in her imagination as a kind of paradise,an Eden of delight:I lived in a world of flowers, minute but inexhaustible … All were mine,whatever I saw was mine in the very act of seeing. To see was to know, to enterinto total relationship with, to participate in the essential being of each Iam.19 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-210]This time in nature taught her to see the world around her as a whole. ‘Streamand rock, tree and fern, down to the most minute frond is formed each by thewhole, and the whole by each’.20 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-211] Sheknew that ‘within that larger unity each centre of life unfolds its own unity ofform in perfect and minute precision’.21[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-212] With Erich Kahler and Goethe, Raineknew that ‘the whole of organic life – the soul of nature – is engaged innothing else but embodiment and unfolding of forms’. Even as a child sherecognised that ‘the whole is made up not of parts but of wholes’.22[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-213]This sense of wholeness, of coherence, of beauty manifesting in the forms ofnature and finding its reflection in the soul, rooted itself in the young girl.Raine was so fascinated by the intricate and delicate forms of nature that whenshe arrived at Cambridge in 1926 she read sciences, botany and zoology. She hadnot given up her dream of being a poet. Her father, who was against the idea,was an English teacher with a great love of Shakespeare and Wordsworth, andalong with nature her early years were filled with poetry and with old tales andlegends of her mother’s Scottish ancestry. Her mother encouraged her poeticambitions, but at that time science offered a greater purchase on the difficultbusiness of making a living than did the pursuit of the muse.Her high school science teacher had impressed her with her passion for thesubject, while Raine also felt that, although she loved it, she had no desire orneed to be ‘taught’ literature. ‘To be taught “about” literature,’ she wrote,‘which is itself the teaching, seemed to me a waste of time’. It was there, inthe books, to be read. Learning about the secret life of plants and themysterious world of animals could not be done through books. And so she chosescience, thereby making her father happy. But she had not abandoned poetry. LikeGoethe, she did not see a necessary clash between the two.23[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-214] For the time being science couldprovide an ‘immediate delight’, but her ‘secret poetic vocation’ had notvanished. She would merely keep it to herself.Such secrecy proved necessary, and not only in order to mollify a concernedparent. Raine quickly discovered that while her friends and colleagues atCambridge enjoyed reading, the kind of poetry that she loved and learned byheart was not their ‘thing’ at all. She herself looked in poetry ‘for thesublime,’ and in it ‘listened for that resonance of “the eternal, in and throughthe temporal” of which Coleridge speaks’. But the world she was entering now hadno place for the eternal; it was temporal, through and through, and acutely ‘upto date’. It had no time for Coleridge, or her other favourites, Keats, Shelley,Yeats and Blake. The new friends she had made were all au courant with whateverwas the fashionable thing, and the kind of poetry that made her heart leap withdelight and remembrance was definitely not it. Aldous Huxley’s acerbic novels,Ezra Pound’s Imagism, the Bloomsbury world of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey,Clive Bell and ‘significant form’. It was a smart literary world informed withthe new, anti-Romantic sentiment. Even a literary criticism all its own hadgrown up around it, the New Criticism of I.A. Richards, which was eager to mimicthe scientistic exactitude of the latest philosophical fashion: logicalpositivism.This ironically had grown out of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who in hismystical Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus had come to the conclusion that ‘what wecannot speak about we must pass over in silence’, something with which HermannBroch, who emerged from the same Vienna as Wittgenstein, would have agreed.24[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-215] Broch and Wittgenstein both knew therewas much of great, fundamental importance that could not be spoken about – inthe explicit, fact-based language of the sciences, that is. But both also knewthat in this ineffable sphere – what Francis Cornford called ‘the vague’– layall that was of meaning and significance in life. However, philosophers anxiousto receive the kind of intellectual prestige increasingly accorded to scientiststurned Wittgenstein on his head and took his admonition of silence to mean thatwhatever could not be spoken of with prosaic explicitness, was not only notworth trying to say, but absolutely meaningless.Scientism and its missionaries had reached even poetry. That ‘pernicioushumanist “honesty” which mistrusts all knowledge but that of the senses’,reigned supreme, and Raine felt she had to hide her true feelings so as to fitin.25 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-216] ‘The beauties’ she had hithertofound in Milton and the Romantics ‘were not of the imagination’ – Corbin’smundus imaginalis – but were now seen as only ‘imaginary’, that is, false.Poetry must now ‘conform to the new values of science’. It was a belief shecould not fully embrace, although for a time she accepted that ‘in discarding myown intuitions in order to learn a more “intelligent” way of reading poetry’,she thought that she was ‘taking the way from ignorance to knowledge’.26[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-217]She soon found that she had not, and had indeed achieved the opposite: aforgetting of the knowledge vouchsafed to those who remained for her the ‘realpoets’. The one poetic voice that reached her at this time did speak in the new,flat, prosaic manner, focusing on the banalities of life and alluding to someparadise that was indeed lost and irrevocably irrecoverable. But theunmistakable elegiac undertone and halting rhythms seemed appropriate. She cameto feel that she, and her friends, did inhabit T.S. Eliot’s Waste Land. Butwhile the others somehow did not seem out of place in the bleak modernlandscape, some remnant of Eden remained in her soul and made her an outsider.It was not until sometime later that Raine published an essay that captured theessence of what she had worked to forget in those early Cambridge years, and theloss of which had, she believed, turned her Eden of delight into a barrenness.In 1967 a collection of Raine’s essays entitled Defending Ancient Springsappeared. She had published poetry before this and in 1962 – a decade beforeJacques Barzun – she had herself given the A.W. Mellon Foundation Lectures inFine Art in Washington, D.C., on the subject of Blake and Tradition, later thetitle of her two volume critical magnum opus.27[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-218] But Defending Ancient Springs was herfirst book of prose. And along with essays on Blake, Yeats, Coleridge and otherpoets, one work on a more general theme echoed in Raine’s unmistakable way theconcerns of Kahler, Barzun and – if the reader allows a certain temporalflexibility – Barrett.‘The Use of the Beautiful’ voiced what the reader must assume were many of thehesitations Raine had overcome in order to swallow the ‘technical literary talk’she had imbibed in Cambridge. The essay asked a simple question: what place didbeauty have in modern culture? Raine’s answer? Practically none. We live in a‘beautiless society’, which for Raine was another way of saying that we lived ina culture that had lost its soul.28 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-219]As evidence of this Raine pointed to examples that would not have been out ofplace in the complaints of Kahler, Barzun, and Barrett. The fleeting andformless character of contemporary art had struck her too. She noted the‘instantaneous gesture which expresses finally nothing but its owninstantaneity’ and remarked that ‘all images have dissolved into the flux ofcontinuous transformation, so much so that form … can no longer be said toexist’.29 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-220] She also felt theexistential vacuum in which ‘all becomes trivial, and nothing significant, sincethere is no standard by which anything could be called better or worse’.30[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-221] The absurdity of it all was alsoapparent. ‘The arts,’ she wrote, ‘have become the expression of the veryincoherence and ignorance from which they normally provide release’.31[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-222]The arts, she argued, exist in order to provide such relief, or at least theyused to, because it was their purpose to remind us of another order of realitybeyond that of the material world. This was the knowledge possessed anddisseminated by the ‘real poets’ but which had been lost or, as in her own case,actively forgotten by a culture that had given itself over to a ‘materialistphilosophy’ that ‘precludes orders of reality and value other than thephysical’.32 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-223] What had taken placethrough the rise of Scientism was a revolution that had ‘reversed the normalhierarchy of values’.33 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-224] What was onbottom of the ancient Great Chain of Being – matter – was now on top, and‘truth’ meant the kind of attention to quantifiable detail to the exclusion ofall else – the new way of knowing – that Goethe had warned would lead to aspiritually vacuous world. ‘Truth’ now in the arts meant ‘true to life’, whichfor Raine and her sympathetic contemporaries meant ‘true to the lowestexpression of the lowest intelligence’, the kitchen sinks and unmade and oftensoiled beds of ‘realism’.34 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-225]Art in her time – and in ours – was ‘in your face’, confronting its audiencewith the sordid banalities from which, as Raine noted, it had once releasedthem. What use is such an art to the soul, she asked, which has no need to bereminded of ‘life’ – which, in any case, is unavoidable – but which desires andneeds reminders of ‘an order of perfection with which the common world is out oftune’?35 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-226] Decades before itspopularity, Raine predicted the rise of ‘reality TV’, pointing out that what ison the screen is often no different from the lives of those watching it.‘Viewers and viewed’, she observed, ‘could change places and nothing would bealtered’.36 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-227] If a work of imaginationhad once been a ‘magic glass in which we discover that nature to which actualityis barely an approximation’, it had become in our time a kind of brightly litbathroom mirror, in which all the blemishes and wrinkles of ‘real life’ weremagnified a hundredfold.37 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-228] It seemedthat not only had we lost beauty, we ignored it or even actively defaced it.Raine believed that at least some of this reaction grew from a resentmentagainst the high standard that beauty set. It was, as Rilke said, the beginningof a terror that we are just able to bear, and dismissing it entirely was morebearable than admitting that one could not live up to its demands.There was, she knew, a truth, a reality that was different from ‘realism’. Thiswas the reality of what she came to call Tradition and which was rooted in theteachings of Plato, Plotinus, the Hermetica and other forms of what has beencalled the ‘perennial philosophy’.38 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-229]This placed spirit or mind or imagination in the driver’s seat, with thematerial world as a necessary but subordinate adjunct, occupying the bottom rungof the ontological ladder. It was to this Tradition that Henry Corbin alludedwhen he spoke of the imagination’s need for ‘access to a cosmology structuredsimilarly to that of the traditional oriental philosophies, with a plurality ofuniverses arranged in ascending order,’ to keep it from losing itself in thewill-to-power and its horrible productions.39[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-230]Such a cosmology seems light years away from a culture that embraces Big Bangsand the meaningless universes they create, which sees human beings as, at best,merely a higher form of animal (and applauds every expression of the animal inus) and at worst a stimulus-response machine, pushed and pulled by theineluctable forces of cause-and-effect, whether on the mechanical, genetic oratomic level. Yet as Raine reminds us – and remembering is essential here – thisaccess lies within us and is there, ever ready for our call. As Plato, from whommuch of this Tradition emerges, knew, we possess a ‘latent knowledge’ of anorder inherent within reality and within our soul. This is the harmony thatPythagoras had taught and lived long ago and which informed one of the ‘twopermanent needs of human nature’ that Francis Cornford had recognised.We perceive beauty, the Neo-Platonic philosopher Plotinus said, when we perceivesomething that is in accord with our soul. Beauty is a possession of our souland we possess it most intensely when we are true to our being. This wassomething Raine found when she ignored the needs of her soul so as to fit in tothe intellectual atmosphere of Cambridge. There was no beauty in that world, notonly because it modelled itself on the requirements of positivism, but alsobecause there was nothing in it that resonated with her soul. Knowledge ofbeauty is knowledge of soul. It is self-knowledge, and when we discover beautywe are discovering part of ourselves. This was, as Goethe knew, the harmony ofthe hidden law in the world with the hidden law within ourselves.Unlike the rules of prosody that the scientific criticism she had learnedrequired her to apply in order to analyse the formal structure of a poem, beautyto Raine and to all others sensitive to it, appeared all at once. Knowledge andthe experience of beauty were one. We can learn of beauty only from beauty; noamount of theory can lead us to it, just as the most meticulously quantifieddescription of a flower remains categorically less than the act of seeing one.Like Ernst Jünger’s ‘master key’, the recognition of beauty is ‘immediate andintuitive’ and is achieved through a faculty ‘higher than discursive reason’.40[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-231] This is the Platonic nous, the Mindhigher than reason that is dormant within us but which will respond toreflections of itself in the forms of the beautiful.These are many. Unlike the ‘blank slate’ psychology which tells us that our soulis nothing more than a reflection of the outer world, beauty tells us that thesoul contains a ‘plenitude of forms’, is indeed those forms itself, seeingitself in Nature’s glass. (Contra Locke, nature is a reflection of the soul, notthe other way around.) While ‘realism’ in its many forms strives to depict thematerial facts of things, including nature, true art reaches to the true nature,the archetype, by finding it and its reflection in natural things. Hence Platoand Plotinus’ caution that to copy from nature is to copy from a copy. The trueartist is ‘original’, not by being shockingly novel, but by reaching to the‘origin’, the Urphänomen, from which all ‘copies’ arise. It is to awaken ourrecollection of these that poetry and the other arts exist. They hold before usimages that tell us of our lost home. And we know we are recalling it. Theassurance of this is the haunting sense of the familiar that overcomes us in itspresence. True beauty is nothing strange or alien but achingly familiar, likethe taste of Proust’s madeleine, which reminds us of what we already know buthave forgotten. All knowledge, Plato tells us, is such remembrance.The knowledge we receive in this way is not of fact but of quality, of value andmeaning. As Owen Barfield knew, ‘true poetry’, Raine tells us, ‘has the power oftransforming consciousness’.41 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-232] Weperceive beauty, are open to its presence, through a change in the quality ofour consciousness. Only like can know like. We must have beauty within ourselvesto see it in the world. The mind that denies the reality of the soul denies thereality of beauty and will never see it, although at times the nostalgia for aplace we have never been can seep through even the most stalwart reductionistdefences. But this place we have never been is with us all the time. It is thetrue imagination, the inner firmament beyond Mount Qâf, that Paracelsus,Barfield, Goethe, Corbin, Suhrawardi and others we have looked at knew well andvoyaged in.The knowledge Raine spoke of and sought in her ‘real poets’ formed what shecalled ‘the learning of the imagination’, a teaching that was not about theimagination but was the imagination itself. Its curriculum was made up of thesymbols, metaphors and images that informed her favourite poetry – with OwenBarfield she shared a love of the Romantics – and which constituted much of the‘hollowed out’ iconography that the modern soul misunderstood and often did itsbest to undermine. ‘Tradition,’ she wrote in her major work on Blake, ‘is therecord of imaginative experience’. ‘Traditional metaphysics’ – that ofPythagoras, Plato and Plotinus – ‘is neither vague, personal or arbitrary’, asthe learned dons at Cambridge had tried to convince her it was. ‘It is therecorded history of imaginative thought and has … an accompanying language ofsymbol and myth’.42 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-233] This is HenryCorbin’s mundus imaginalis, ‘a very precise order of reality, which correspondsto a precise mode of perception’: the true imagination.She had grown up with this knowledge and then had worked hard to lose it. But itcame back to her through another real poet who was not then the thing. W.B.Yeats had, she knew, been a Theosophist and had practised magic in the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn. He had studied Swedenborg and Kabbalah and spoken withthe spirits. Such things had worked against Yeats in the reigning positivistclimate. Yeats knew the truth of Shelley’s definition of poetry as the ‘languageof the imagination’, a language ‘not of definitions which measure, but of imageswhich evoke knowledge’.43 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-234] In his essay‘The Trembling of the Veil’, Yeats tells of his experience with the magicianSamuel MacGregor Mathers, then head of the Golden Dawn. Part of the Golden Dawnteaching was the training of the imagination, or of visualisation, to be moreexact.44 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-235] This entailed the use ofHindu tattwa symbols, representing the five elements: fire, water, air, earthand spirit. Mathers handed Yeats a card with a symbol on it and told him topress it to his forehead. When Yeats did, images appropriate for the symbol cameto him involuntarily. A red triangle symbolising fire evoked the image of ablack giant rising up out of desert ruins; this was of the order of thesalamanders, Mathers said, and absolutely correct. Yeats rejected the idea thattelepathy might be responsible when he later handed someone a card by mistakebut they nevertheless saw images appropriate to it, and not to the card theythought it was. Inspired by this experience Yeats anticipated Jung’s notion of a‘collective unconscious’ when he wrote of his belief that ‘images well up beforethe mind’s eye from a deeper source than conscious or subconscious memory’.Yeats affirmed his belief in a Platonic order of things in his poem ‘Sailing toByzantium’, which presents the ancient Oriental city (the direction of light inSuhrawardi’s gnostic Platonism) as a symbol of the mundus imaginalis, anarchetypal capital of the ‘human kingdom of the imagination’, a hub of theinterworld where the incarnate and discarnate, conscious and unconscious self,meet.45 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-236] Rejecting the world in whichwhatever is ‘begotten, born, and dies’ loses itself in ‘sensual neglect’, thepoet turns instead to ‘monuments of unageing intellect’. He abjures his ‘dyinganimal’, his body, the ‘portable tomb’ of the Hermetists, and reaches for the‘artifice of eternity’: timeless beauty.46[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-237]Other Platonic themes abound in Yeats. Like the ‘gyres’ that widen and widen,separating falcon and falconer in ‘The Second Coming’, and which represent themyth of the Platonic year, the cycle of ages from that of gold to iron, the Kaliyuga in Hindu thought, which Yeats and Raine felt was upon us.47[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-238] These vortices of time also informYeats’ undeservedly neglected attempt at a modern symbolic knowledge system, AVision, a work of ‘lunar knowledge’ that should be better known.48[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-239]Yeats learned much from the ‘real poet’ whose artifices of eternity providedRaine with a lifetime’s work. Imagination was all for William Blake. ‘The worldof Imagination,’ Blake wrote in A Vision of the Last Judgement, ‘is the world ofEternity: it is the divine bosom into which we shall all go after the death ofthe Vegetated body’. It is an Infinite and Eternal world, where ‘exist thePermanent Realities of Every Thing which we see reflected in the Vegetable Glassof Nature’. As Goethe did, Blake saw the Permanent Realities, the Urphänomena,and not only the physical shell. Imagination is the ‘true man’, the ‘DivineHumanity’, what Blake calls ‘Jesus, the Imagination’. It is the source ofeverything around us; ‘All Things Exist in the Human Imagination,’ Blake tellsus, echoing the ancient Hermetic philosophy which teaches that ‘within God’ –Nous – ‘everything lies in imagination’. As Blake wrote in Jerusalem: ‘In yourBosom you bear your Heaven and Earth & all you behold; tho’ it appears Without,it is Within, in your Imagination…’This ability to feel the world within oneself – the ultimate destination ofSuhrawardi’s inner journeys – is felt by all ‘real poets’. Keats, a less austerepoet than either Yeats or Blake, knew it. He knew nature ‘imaginatively’ in away in which it was not merely ‘cognised but experienced; not observed, butlived’. ‘If a sparrow come before my window I take part in its existence andpick about the gravel’, said the poet for whom truth was beauty and beautytruth.49 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-240]Blake too knew that we become what we behold, that we, as Barfield would say,participate in it. Men had fallen asleep, into what he called the ‘land ofUlro’, when they became ‘passive before a mechanised nature’, as his studentYeats knew. This was the result of Urizen’s – the intellect’s – usurpation ofpower from Los, the imagination. But Nature itself is the imagination, when seencorrectly, and it is men’s thoughts that create the ‘Satanic mills’, ‘chartedstreets’, and ‘mind-forged manacles’ that, to mix up our poets, make this eartha ‘dim, vast vale of tears’ (Shelley). ‘Birth, and copulation, and death’ washow Eliot summed up our existence here, but Blake denied this. He knew, as didHenry Corbin, that ‘the imagination is a purely spiritual faculty, independentof the physical organism and therefore able to continue to exist after thelatter has disappeared’.50 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-241] Thesensible world, for Blake, was really a ‘system of appearances … inseparablefrom the mind or consciousness’ that perceives them, and in so perceiving also,as Husserl knew, ‘creates what it perceives’.51[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-242]As Raine has pointed out, Blake imbibed much of his philosophy from Swedenborg,although in his Marriage of Heaven and Hell he had some hard words to say abouthis master. Raine has dispelled the picture of Blake as an untutored mad genius,spewing out incoherent mythologies like a geyser from Jung’s collectiveunconscious. Blake knew the Tradition, he was versed in the ‘learning of theimagination’, reading the Hermetica, Boehme, the alchemists and others. Butalong with uncovering the Blake of Tradition, Raine also rescued from obscurityone of his Platonic tutors.Thomas Taylor was saved from the dreary life of a bank clerk when he was askedto give a series of lectures on one of his favourite authors, Plato, togatherings held at the home of Blake’s friend and much more successful fellowartist, John Flaxman. Flaxman’s invitation changed Taylor’s life. Many ofLondon’s intelligentsia attended his lectures – Blake among them – and withtheir help Flaxman was able to secure a position for Taylor with the Society forthe Encouragement of the Arts (later the Royal Society of the Arts). So beganthe career of ‘the English Pagan’, Thomas Taylor, the Platonist.Taylor was born in London to a Dissenting family in 1758. Most likely he wouldhave become a minister like his father, but an unacceptable marriage cast Taylorout of the family fold and into the cold world. A love of numbers andmathematics – more Pythagorean than commercial – secured him a place as a bankclerk. Most of his life was lived in poverty. His health was never very good,and his quiet, unworldly character must have given the impression that he wasnot long for this world. He did have some ambitions, though. As a young man hecontrived an invention he called the ‘perpetual light’ – an apt name, given hisphilosophical predilections – that used phosphorus. Taylor may have thought thatthis eternal flame would bring him riches. Sadly, when he demonstrated it oneevening at London’s Freemason’s Hall, it blew up and almost caused a fire.Taylor had better luck with languages. He had a formidable memory and itinformed his peculiar talent for ancient Greek and Latin. He was said to haveconversed with his wife only in Greek; one assumes she knew it too, otherwise itwould have been a rather one-sided conversation. He discovered Plato in hisearly twenties and was immediately captured by the great philosopher. A readingof the Neoplatonist Proclus triggered a kind of mystical experience. Like thephilosophers he was reading, Taylor believed that we can know the divine only bybecoming divine ourselves; his reading of Proclus accomplished this for him. Theoutcome was what he described as a ‘perpetual serenity, unceasing delight, andoccasional rapture’.52 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-243]Taylor’s illumination led to a prodigious output. He produced the first Englishtranslations of the complete works of Plato and Aristotle, and made manytranslations of Plotinus, Proclus and the ‘divine Iamblichus’. Taylor also wroteextensively on the Orphic tradition and the influence Orphic mythology had onthe Neoplatonists. The late eighteenth century was not the best time, however,for Taylor’s inspired translations to appear. Mechanistic science was on therise and the quantitative mindset looked askance at what it saw as a muddle ofwoolly-minded mystifications. Taylor’s work was ignored or, at best, severelycriticised by the literary mainstream, but his real readers were moreopen-minded than this, and recognised in his writings a unique offering.53[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-244] They knew, Raine tells us, that Taylorlay before them ‘a great field of excluded knowledge which the schools,dominated by the materialist climate of the time, do not recognise’.54[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-245]Blake read and learned from Taylor, but he was not alone. Later poets likeShelley and Keats read him; Yeats too. Ralph Waldo Emerson ranked Taylor as oneof the ‘Immortals’ in his book Representative Men – Plato, Goethe and Swedenborgwere included as well – and claimed that he was ‘a better man of imagination, abetter poet, than any English writer between Milton and Wordsworth’. Otherimportant figures in the ‘learning of the imagination’ who appreciated Taylor’swork were Madame Blavatsky, co-founder of the Theosophical Society; hersecretary, the Gnostic and Hermetic scholar G.R.S. Mead; and the esotericencyclopaedist Manly P. Hall.To his audience at John Flaxman’s home Taylor spoke of Orpheus, Hermes,Zoroaster and the ‘perennial philosophy’, the ‘primal wisdom’ of the ancientswhich Plato had imbibed from the sages who preceded him. Taylor was a one-manPlatonic Academy, doing for the esoteric intelligentsia of late eighteenthcentury London what Marsilio Ficino did for the artists and poets of RenaissanceFlorence, with his Latin translations of the lost books of Plato and theHermetica.55 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-246] Taylor believed that thisprimal wisdom was ‘coeval with the universe itself; and however its continuitymay be broken by opposing systems, it will make its appearance at differentperiods of time, as long as the sun himself shall continue to illumine theworld’.56 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-247]One important efflorescence of this perennial philosophy appeared, Raine argued,in English Romantic poetry, whose symbols, imagery and aims, she maintained, arepractically identical with Neoplatonism. Through Taylor, Blake learned of theancient wisdom, absorbing the insight that the sages wrote obscurely, inmysterious images and arcane myths that needed to be read symbolically in orderto pass beyond their surface, literal meaning. Blake even suffered to learn ofmathematics from Taylor, but was too impatient a poet to do this for long.Contra Plato, he concluded that God was more an artist than a geometer. As Rainemakes clear in her essays on Blake and Yeats, Blake was more of a prophetic poetthan a Platonic one, and while Yeats turned his eye and hand to perfection ofform – Platonic beauty – Blake was more like a seer of old, driven by a holyenergy and demonic life.Another poet also touched by Taylor’s inspiration had a more philosophical bent.In his classic ‘study in the ways of the imagination’, The Road to Xanadu, JohnLivingstone Lowes points out that Taylor was one of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s‘darling studies’.57 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-248] Coleridge studiedTaylor’s translations deeply and, with much else, they fired his imagination,providing many of the ingredients that went into ‘The Rime of the AncientMariner’ and that most imaginative poem about the imagination, ‘Kubla Khan’. Ina kind of ‘wish list’ that Coleridge gave to a friend shortly before writing thepoem – which came to Coleridge in an opium-induced hypnagogic trance, only to betruncated by a visitor from Porlock – the poet asked for copies of Taylor’srenditions of Iamblichus, Proclus and Porphyry, as well as some titles byFicino.58 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-249] According to Raine, theperennial philosophy acted as a kind of thread, linking together with itsperpetual theme the many and varied images and metaphors that came together inColeridge’s haunting poem. ‘In the literature of Tradition – the learning of theimagination,’ she writes, ‘Coleridge was deeply versed’.59[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-250]Coleridge’s caves of ice, sunless seas and caverns measureless to man where‘Alph, the sacred river ran’ are, Raine argues, all in ‘strict accordance’ withthe ‘symbolic vocabulary of Neoplatonism’, and evoke in the sensitive readerthat strange nostalgia and familiarity with a place where we have never been butknow painfully well.60 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-251] The poem ‘bothis, and is about, remembrance’. Its theme, she writes, ‘is the imaginativeexperience itself’, and is ‘written in that exaltation of wonder whichinvariably accompanies moments of insight into the mystery upon whose surface welive’.61 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-252] As Plato said long ago, andas his readers Raine and Barfield knew, poetry is itself a transformation ofconsciousness, both for the poet writing it and for its proper readers.Coleridge was a ‘library cormorant’, reading perpetually in what he called ‘outof the way books’. Along with Taylor’s Neoplatonist works he was also familiarwith what was coming out of Germany, with Kant, Schelling and Naturphilosophie.Coleridge shared much with Goethe, but where Goethe kept his focus firmly onsensuous phenomena and claimed never to have thought about thinking – somethinghe scolded his fellow Germans for constantly doing – Coleridge at times seems asif he did little else. In many ways he should be considered England’s home-grownmetaphysician, in the classic German manner. And yet the comparison with Goetheremains. Where Goethe worked to achieve ‘active seeing’, Coleridge worked to dothe same, but with thinking. Both saw the process under their observation – orrather, with which they participated–as essentially creative, in the way withwhich many of the people we have looked at would have agreed.In Chapter XIII of his Biographia Literaria, Coleridge made his famousdistinctions between the Primary Imagination, Secondary Imagination and Fancy.Primary Imagination, he said, is ‘the living power and prime agent of all humanperception’, something with which Blake would surely have agreed. It is ‘arepetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite IAM’. When we perceive the world then, according to Coleridge, we echo theCreator’s creation of it. Our perception is itself creative, something Husserlknew.Secondary imagination, that of the artist, poet and creative thinker is an‘echo’ of the Primary Imagination, ‘co-existing with the conscious will’, anddiffering from the Primary Imagination only by degree. It ‘dissolves, diffuses,and dissipates, in order to recreate’. Its action is always and essentiallyvital, that is living, having an ‘inside’, whereas objects, as objects, arefixed and dead. In this it is identical to Corbin’s practice of ta’wil, whichsaves phenomena from objectification and idolatry, by returning them to thearchetype, or Goethe’s ‘active seeing’. Fancy, as we’ve seen, has only these‘fixities’ to play with and is ‘nothing more than a mode of memory emancipatedfrom the order of time and space’. It is not creative as the secondaryimagination is.62 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-253]This creative character of the imagination Coleridge called the ‘esemplasticpower’. Esemplastic is a coinage of Coleridge’s, and is itself an example of thevery process it defines. It means to ‘shape into one’, to take disparate thingsand through an act of creative imagination, unify them into a whole. Coleridgehad come across a similar term in Schelling, Ineinsbildung – literally‘in-one-shaping’ – which meant an ‘interweaving of opposites’ and he sought tofind an equivalent in English. There was none, so he invented one, taking hiscue from the Greek. It is this ‘shaping power’ of the imagination thatdifferentiates it from fancy. The result of using the esemplastic power, whichColeridge argues is a distinct action of the mind – indeed, its fundamentalaction – is a new perception, arising out of the creative unity of differentelements. For all its interest in ‘novelty’, fancy can only return to the sameold things. It is imagination which is truly ‘original’, because it returns tothe origin of all things, itself.The idea of a creative unity transcending the opposites from which it arises isat the heart of Coleridge’s insights into polarity, something again which heshared with Goethe. Coleridge claimed that if he were granted ‘a nature havingtwo contrary forces, the one of which tends to expand infinitely, while theother strives to apprehend or to find itself in this infinity,’ he could cause‘the world of intelligences with the whole system of their representations’ torise up before us.63 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-254] Coleridge’s twoforces are Goethe’s ‘systole’ and ‘diastole’ and Schelling’s ‘expansion’ and‘contraction’. They form the centre of what Owen Barfield, who wrote a bookdevoted exclusively to what Coleridge thought, called ‘polar logic’.Polar logic is behind Blake’s ‘proverbs of hell’ that ‘Opposition is TrueFriendship’ and ‘Without Contraries there is no Progress’. Polar logic is notthe same as having logical opposites. These are merely contradictory and onlycancel each other out. Polar opposites exist, Barfield says, ‘by virtue of eachother, and are generative of new products’.64[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-255] They are opposites as are day andnight, but they need each other to exist. They are radically different, butinseparable and are in a dynamic, not static, relationship. It is the tensionbetween them that provides the energy for creative transformation. Polarity, asBarfield says, is ‘the manifestation of one power by opposite forces’.65[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-256]Barfield admits that this may not be immediately understandable. In fact hewould even say that to try to understand it, in Coleridge’s use of the term‘understand’, would defeat the purpose. Defining polarity in Coleridge’s senseis as difficult and ultimately self-defeating as trying to define imaginationitself – or life or existence, for that matter – in explicit, ‘factual’ terms.Barfield asks: ‘how much use are definitions of the undefinable?’ Polarity mustbe grasped by the imagination ‘in a glance’ in order for us to recognise it andits importance. In this it has much in common with the symbolique of Schwallerde Lubicz, the ability to perceive contradictory meanings in the same object.Echoing Coleridge, Barfield even says that recognising polarity is itself ‘thebasic act of imagination’. In other words, one grasps polarity by experiencingit, just as one must experience imagination, or beauty, in order to know it.The fundamental polarity of our experience, Coleridge saw, is that of the selfand the world, the inner and the outer. He saw the mind as a kind of ‘current’,like electricity, running between the two.66[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-257] According to Barfield, Coleridgeargues that it is the task of the imagination to help us experience thispolarity, this current, immediately and intensely. As it is now, we don’t – orat least this is true of most of us. We perceive the outer world but are unawareof our contribution to our experience of it; that is, we are unaware of ourmind’s, through the Primary Imagination, participation in ‘the world’. Weexperience only one pole. Just as we are unaware of our perception as active, as‘intentional’, in Husserl’s term, we are unaware of the activity of our minds.We are aware of our thoughts, but not, Coleridge argues, of our thinking. Welack what he called ‘the mind’s self-experience in the act of thinking’.Using the medieval terms, we are aware of Natura naturata, that is ‘nature’ as apassive finished product (our thoughts), but not Natura naturans, nature as theactive cause of itself (our thinking). By thinking here Coleridge does not meanthe content of our thoughts, what we are ‘thinking about’, but the livecharacter of thought itself. We accept our thoughts and our thinking passively.Coleridge believed it was vital that we become aware of the act of thinkingitself. Imagination, he saw, was the way to do this.Imagination can do this because it in itself is ‘precisely an advance of themind towards knowing itself in the object’.67[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-258] Without imagination, we do not knowourselves in the objects we perceive. We are aware of only one side of our polarrelationship, that of the ‘objectified’ world. This is ‘objectified’, ‘fixed anddead’, precisely because we do not perceive it with imagination, but only withwhat Coleridge calls ‘understanding’.Understanding, in Coleridge’s use, is essentially the ‘new way’ of knowing wehave discussed throughout this book. It posits a completely separate ‘world’‘outside’ consciousness which it thinks ‘about’ in terms of conventional logic,and sees ourselves as separate and distinct bodies within this world.Understanding can analyse and manipulate the ‘objects’ in this world, and inthat sense is active. But it is passive regarding itself. As it sees only anobjectified, non-living world – because it perceives it without imagination –it, as Yeats said, becomes hypnotised before a ‘mechanised nature’. It becomeswhat it beholds.We can free ourselves from what is ‘essentially a sleeping relationship withphenomena’ and enter into a ‘waking one’, Coleridge tells us, by becoming awareof the other pole of experience, that is, our own minds.68[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-259] Until we do, we are subject to whatColeridge calls ‘the lethargy of custom’.69[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-260] This is our habit of seeing the worldaround us as ‘everyday’ and ‘ordinary’, of looking at it from the ‘naturalstandpoint’ and taking it for granted. Through the lethargy of custom we growused to everything. It becomes ‘uninteresting’. We become apathetic and torelieve our ennui we relinquish our active imagination entirely and giveourselves up to ‘entertainments’ devised to divert us from boredom, which, ofcourse, only weakens our imagination more.70[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-261]We can escape this sleep through an activity Barfield calls ‘completing’.71[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-262] Completing ‘unites clearness withdepth’ – rather like Jünger’s ‘stereoscopy’ – and ‘the plenitude of the senseswith the comprehensibility of the understanding’. It accomplishes this throughthe imagination, which impregnates the understanding with itself, thustransforming its mere surface awareness to an ‘intuitive and a living power’.72[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-263] In doing this, understanding istransformed into what Coleridge calls ‘reason’, which is an ‘organ of spiritualapprehension’.73 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-264] Such apprehension has‘objects consubstantial’ with itself for its perception.74[part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-265] That is, it is itself its own object.It is self-contemplative.75 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-num-note-266] By knowingthe world through imagination, it knows itself. And while this ‘spiritualreason’ cannot be understood by its less imaginative cousin, it can, like theimages that arose in Yeats’ mind, be evoked and expressed in symbols, which arethemselves products of this reason and a means of triggering the imaginativepower necessary to experience them.Coleridge understood – in his imaginative sense – that the relations between theelements of a polarity are dynamic. That is, they are in motion and changing.One pole cannot be without the other – this is why a term like ‘bipolar’ isredundant, as you cannot have one pole: if you had only one, it would not be apole. But Coleridge knew that it is the nature of a polar relationship that onepole can dominate for a time, and that the shifts in dominances between thepoles are the motor of all life and evolution, the ‘contraries’ that produce‘progress’.But what happens when one pole dominates for too long, so that the polarityloses its active, creative character and takes on a more hierarchical one, withone pole on top? What happens when only one of the ‘two permanent needs of humannature’ is satisfied, while the other is ignored and left to languish, or tomeet its needs as best it can? How is the imbalance corrected? And how isimagination involved?This seems to be where we walked in.NOTES1 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-192] Erich Kahler The Disintegration ofForm in the Arts (New York: George Braziller, 1968) p. 3.2 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-193] Ibid. p. 23.3 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-194] Although with crystals we see theintroduction of form into the inorganic, which gives rise to the speculation,common to Naturphilosopie, that at this level the organic and inorganic sharesome middle ground.4 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-195] Kahler 1968, p. 4.5 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-196] Ibid. p. 5.6 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-197] Ibid. p. 20.7 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-198] Ibid. pp. 27f.8 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-199] Ibid. p. 95.9 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-200] Jacques Barzun, ‘Liberalism and theReligion of Art’ in Critical Questions (Chicago, IL: University of ChicagoPress, 1982) p. 173.10 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-201] With Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone deBeauvoir was one of the leading lights of French existentialism. In his essay‘Anti-Sartre’, collected in Below the Iceberg (San Bernadino, CA: Borgo Press,1998), Colin Wilson tells the story of some students who approached Sartre afterhe had given a resounding lecture on freedom. This was soon after the liberationof Paris and the defeat of the Nazis. The students were enthused with Sartre’scelebration of freedom, and inspired by his words, they asked the philosopherwhat they should do with their freedom. Sartre replied, in effect, ‘You can dowhat you like’. The students walked away somewhat less inspired. Freedom is notenough. It must be joined to some purpose or aim to be of value. Sartre’s ‘dowhat you like’ encapsulates the moral vacuum in which his version ofexistentialism – the most popular – existed and is the equivalent of running outof barriers to break down with the resultant sense of pointlessness.11 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-202] Ibid. pp. 174f.12 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-203] Jacques Barzun, The Use and Abuseof Art (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1973).13 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-204] William Barrett, Time of Need:Forms of Imagination and Their Time (New York: Harper and Row, 1972) p. 10.14 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-205] Ibid. p. 23.15 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-206] Art vandalism, a step up from ironyand sarcasm, is a more intense form of defacing great works as an expression ofprotest.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9593748/When-art-gets-vandalised.html[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9593748/When-art-gets-vandalised.html]16 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-207] Erich Heller, The Artist’s Journeyinto the Interior (New York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1976) pp. 134f.17 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-208] Ibid. p. 135.18 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-209] Barrett recognised that thisapparent scattering of artistic energies may not be as troubling a sign asHeller believed. ‘From the oriental point of view,’ he writes, ‘the distinctionbetween grand and insignificant, high and low, belongs only to the relativeworld of practical realities.

Put briefly, whereGuénon and other Traditionalists refer to Tradition as a kind of authority, ‘theLaw’ as it were, that has become lost in the modern world, although remnants ofit may still be found in the major religions, Raine sees Tradition in the senseof a body of knowledge and symbols relating to what we can call the ‘reality ofthe imagination’. In an interview I did with Raine in 1997 she said as much,remarking that she felt that Guénon had no imagination.39 [part0009_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-230] I should mention that, as WilliamBarrett did, Raine realised that beauty could be found outside Tradition.

That is to say that with these phenomena ‘consciousness and its objectare ontologically inseparable’."},{"pageContent":"Chapter Six"},{"pageContent":"THE RESPONSIBLE IMAGINATIONI began this book by saying that a new way of knowing the world and ourselvesarose in the early seventeenth century and quickly came to occupy a position ofimportance and authority that now, some four centuries later, seems unshakeable.To be sure, many have questioned its authority and accuracy in dealing withaspects of our experience that it seems ill-equipped to address. We have seenthat even at the outset of this new way of knowing, the ‘spirit of geometry’ wasadvised not to forget its close cousin the ‘spirit of finesse’ and that itshould not dismiss its contribution to our understanding of ourselves and theworld. The person who raised this concern, Blaise Pascal, had the credentials todo so. He was both a mathematician and logician and a soul sensitive to thedeeper, more ambiguous significances of human existence. He could ponder thecomplexities of number theory and work out the intricacies of what later becameprobability theory, essential to our modern use of statistics, but he was alsoconcerned with the meaning of human life and the ever-present imponderables thatmake it a mystery.Many came after Pascal and one could write a history of modern Westernconsciousness from the point of view of the scores of important figures thathave echoed his concern. A list would include Nobel Prize winners, celebratedwriters, artists, poets and philosophers. By now it would include filmmakers.1[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-267] To tally it up would be tedious, butit could be done, and most readers I suspect could reel off a handful of namesif pressed. Even as towering a figure as Einstein comes down on the side of the‘other’ way of knowing. In an interview in 1929 with The Saturday Evening Post,Einstein said: ‘I believe in intuitions and inspirations. I sometimes feel thatI am right. I do not know that I am’. He said that when expeditions, financed bythe Royal Academy, were sent out to South America and Africa to confirm histheory of relativity – which they did during the solar eclipse of 29 May, 1919 –he was not surprised when he was proved right. ‘I would have been surprised,’ hesaid, ‘if I had been proved wrong’.2 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-268]When the journalist George Sylvester Viereck asked Einstein if he trusted hisimagination more than his knowledge, Einstein replied: ‘Imagination is moreimportant than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles theworld’.3 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-269]Not long after this interview, Einstein repeated this remark in his book CosmicReligion which appeared in 1931 with a preface by the playwright Bernard Shaw.At the time Shaw, like Einstein, was one of the most famous men in the world.Shaw was a great prophet of the imagination, seeing it as the driving forcebehind what, following the philosopher Henri Bergson, he called ‘creativeevolution’, as opposed to Darwin’s more mechanical variety. In Back toMethuselah (1922), Shaw’s anti-Darwinian ‘Metabiological Pentateuch’, Shawargued that a persistent enough will informed by a powerful enough imaginationand focused on purposes beyond its own – that is, on wider, impersonal values –could defeat even death, or at least keep it at bay long enough to increase thehuman life span considerably. Shaw believed we needed this extra time in orderto mature as full human beings and he himself lived to the age of ninety-six.‘Imagination,’ Shaw wrote, ‘is the beginning of creation. You imagine what youdesire; you will what you imagine; and at last you create what you will’.4[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-270]Einstein was not so forceful a prophet, but his belief in imagination as acreative power was no less than Shaw’s. In Cosmic Religion he wrote that:‘Imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth toevolution. It is, strictly speaking, a real factor in scientific research’.Einstein showed that he too had a copy of Ernst Jünger’s ‘master key’ when heremarked that: ‘At times I feel certain I am right without knowing the reason’.5[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-271]As we seen, those who follow the spirit of finesse – as Einstein is doing here –find it difficult, if not impossible, to explain how they know what they know.They cannot express it directly and can at best speak only in metaphor, analogy,or symbol. Einstein knew, but he didn’t know how he knew, or at least he wasn’table to say how he knew, in the kind of language scientists are supposed to usewhen they talk about their discoveries. They are supposed to carefully lay outall the details for everyone to see, and if required, walk us through the steps.Einstein knew in the way that scientists are not supposed to know. He knew inour ‘other’ way of knowing.Yet even with endorsements from Einstein, a Nobel Prize winner – Shaw was onetoo – imagination still takes a backseat to the more wieldy kind of knowing thatwe feel we are more familiar with. We think we are more familiar with this kindof knowledge but in a sense that is not really true. We know the other way ofknowing just as well and we use it all the time, often more than we do our‘official’ means of knowledge. But we don’t see it as a way of knowing. We sayit is ‘just imagination’ because we have been taught to do so. If we are morefamiliar with the quantitative way of knowing, that is because we are taughtthat this is knowing, and that anything else is wishful thinking and makebelieve.This has left us in the position that I described at the end of the lastchapter, with one side of a polarity dominating too much for too long. Thequantitative way of knowing, that treats the world as objective, neutral andabsolutely independent of our consciousness, seems to have gained an ascendancythat threatens to completely eclipse its necessary but marginalised moreparticipatory other half. The opposition that is true friendship has brokendown, and the contraries are not progressing. They are stuck in a fruitlesscontradiction and have been so for some time. But the situation is even worsethan this. One pole virtually denies the reality of the other. And if theconcerns of people like Iain McGilchrist are valid, this does not bode well forthe future. It may be the case that, as McGilchrist warns, what we have in storefor us is a kind of ‘twenty-first century schizoid man’, in the words of an oldsong.6 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-272]Proponents of the other way of knowing have been aware of this imbalance and aswe’ve seen, many of them have tried in different ways to rectify it. Goethetried to harmonise his science and his poetry. Suhrawardi directed his effortstoward those ‘who aspire at once to both mystical experience and philosophicalknowledge’, to intuition and logic, a goal that his modern interpreter, HenryCorbin, also pursued. Ernst Jünger sought to see things ‘in stereo’, as it were,perceiving their surface and their depths simultaneously. Kathleen Raine foundthe same beauty that haunted her in Romantic poetry within her studies of botanyand zoology. Pascal knew both the ‘spirit of geometry’ and the ‘spirit offinesse’. Jacques Barzun maintains that anyone can be taught to think likeEuclid and Walt Whitman.It seems there is no inherent barrier to both sides of our cognitive polarityworking together creatively. It may not be easy to do. But it is possible. Giventhis, what should be our next course of action?If it is the case that we are favouring our critical, analytical mind at theexpense of our creative, imaginative one, then clearly it would seem that whatwe need to do is to cut back on analysis and increase our imagination. That infact is what the students of the ‘learning of the imagination’ we have beenlooking at did. But even here there are problems and concerns. Imaginationalone, it seems, is not enough. Or to put it another way: will any imaginationdo, or are there limits and guidelines that imagination should follow in orderto bring a creative balance back into the polarity between our two ways ofknowing?We’ve seen that Henry Corbin saw the need for a tradition to keep theimagination from spilling over into ‘reckless wastefulness’. Without such atradition Corbin believed that the imagination could, in partnership with our‘will-to-power’, become a ‘never-ending source of horrors’. Goethe was carefulto ground his Primal Plant in what he saw as its ‘inner necessity and truth’.Otherwise it would have been merely an example of ‘the shadowy phantoms of vainimagination’. Paracelsus counselled that we need to stay close to the imaginatiovera, otherwise we would embrace the ‘madman’s cornerstone’ and find ourselvesengaged in an ‘exercise of thought without foundation in nature’. Coleridgerecognised the essential difference between an imagination infused into theunderstanding, which produces the ‘reason’ that enables us to grasp the livingreality of experience, and the ‘flights of fancy’ that propel themselves bywelding together the fragments of images and ideas inhabiting our minds intosome ‘novel’ arrangement which may amuse us for a moment but which lacks alltrue life.It seems imagination alone is not enough. It must be guided by limits andcriteria that in some way match the concerns of the students of the imaginationmentioned previously. The idea is not for imagination to take the place of theanalytical, quantitative mind, just as the analytical, quantitative mind shouldnot have pushed its intuitive partner out of the picture four centuries ago. Theidea is for them to work together, or at least to recognise the need for eachother, to see in each other one of our ‘two permanent needs of human nature’ andto work to accommodate both. Satisfying one need at the expense of the otherdoes not work, whichever need is in question. Starving the analytical mind wouldbe as much a mistake as the present marginalising of our intuitive consciousnessis. Indeed, we can account for the aggressive campaign against the intuitivekind of knowledge that was waged in the early seventeenth century at least inpart by looking at the damper the Church had held down on free intellectualinquiry prior to this.7 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-273] Let loose, thespirit of inquiry would not suffer restraint and so it worked to ensure it wouldnot be inhibited again. Hence the ‘meaningless’ universe we now inhabit,necessarily so, as ‘meaning’ is amenable to the intuitive mind, not theanalytical one. The analytical, quantitative mind has freed itself of theconstraints of religion or any other belief that would check its untrammelledgrowth. A by-product of that liberation is the sense of pointlessness thatpermeates our early twenty-first century consciousness. Had the new way ofknowing not had to do battle against such opposition – and had the Church notparadoxically joined forces with it briefly, in order to eliminate their mutualrival, the Hermetic sciences – then it is possible that the kind of knowledgeGoethe believed was good for us may have been the outcome, and not, as seems tobe the case, the kind that he believed was pernicious.8[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-274]Unfortunately, the creative polarity that is possible but not guaranteed in theindividual is even less easy to achieve in a whole culture, which is, of course,made up of individuals. With some important exceptions, that nevertheless showsuch a harmony can be achieved, what tends to happen is a kind of pendulum swingfrom one side to the other, with a build-up of reason and rationality triggeringa plunge into the dark waters of the unconscious, and a desire for clarity andlight then leading to a denial of those waters’ existence. One such swinghappened with Romanticism which gave way to Symbolism, then Dada, Surrealism,and the absurd. Another happened in the 1960s, with the ‘occult revival’ thattook place in that decade leading to the ‘counter-culture’ and eventually the‘New Age’ that has been with us now for some time.9[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-275] Both reacted to an excess of thequantitative mind-set; for Romanticism it was the Enlightenment and in the 1960sit was the buttoned-down ‘atomic age’ of the 1950s. And as these swings areneither precise nor controlled, in trying to compensate for the previous excess,they create excesses of their own. Getting it ‘just right’ as Goldilocks did,requires a kind of pinpoint accuracy – that ‘master key’ – when analysis andintuition, quantity and quality meet and produce something new, creative, vital,and which extends the borders of our consciousness and of our lives. That it canhappen is, as we’ve seen, entirely possible. That it doesn’t happen often enoughis the unfortunate thing.What can happen when imagination ‘in the raw’, without the kind of guidelinesI’ve been speaking of, lets rip, and tries to compensate for the imbalance onits own? I think the kind of concerns raised by Erich Kahler, Jacques Barzun,William Barrett and Kathleen Raine, that I looked at in the previous chapter,can give us an idea. There is of course a long history of how art becameassociated with revolt, nihilism and the rejection of such ‘bourgeois’ ideas asbeauty and harmony, and embraced wholeheartedly what we today call the‘transgressive’. I cannot go into that here and the reader can get a very goodoverview of this in Barzun’s lectures The Use and Abuse of Art mentionedearlier. Barzun and the others raised their concerns half a century ago, and thereader may wonder if things are still quite so bad and if these worries aren’treally out of date. I don’t see that in the time that has passed much haschanged. Artists today make fortunes displaying preserved sharks, unmade beds,or defaced walls.10 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-276] And as KathleenRaine predicted, the most popular television programmes today are some versionof ‘reality TV’ in which millions of viewers watch people ‘just like them’ doall sorts of things, usually having to do with sex and humiliation.11[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-277] There is much of the commonplace inall of this but not, I believe, much transfiguration.Of course, according to the demotic tone of our times, beauty, or its lack, isin the eye of its beholder and no doubt many people find these developmentsexciting and important. But my own taste falls more on the side of ‘monuments ofunageing intellect’ than on the evidence that proves Andy Warhol was right andthat ‘art is what you can get away with’.12[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-278]However, if overpriced and indecorous art is all we have to be concerned with,we could ignore what we don’t like and look for what we do, though it seems lesseasy these days to find ‘monuments of unageing intellect’ or transfiguringbeauty. What turns up in galleries and museums and generates enormous sums atauction is, as it were, only the early warning system for something that mayhave much wider consequences.13 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-279]Owen Barfield, we’ve seen, saw a need for a responsibility of the imagination.This grew out of the simple recognition that imagination can be either good orbad, to speak in the simplest terms. When the Romantics first rejected theconstraints of Enlightenment rationality, they believed that an unrestrictedimagination was in itself a good, just as the early rationalists held in checkby the Church, believed that indiscriminate knowledge in itself was a good. Bynow we can see that the early restrictions on both sides have long been overcomeand that each has been free for some time now to pursue their course. We havelooked at some of the consequences of that in this book. Barfield’s concernabout being responsible for and to one’s imagination was aroused by preciselythe kind of art that Barzun, Kahler, Barrett and Raine remarked on. But it wasnot so much that he didn’t like seeing ‘pictures of a dog with six legs emergingfrom a vegetable marrow or a woman with a motorcycle substituted for her leftbreast’ – he didn’t in fact – as that he was concerned that such things wouldstart to take over reality.14 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-280] Just asthe change in consciousness that he experienced when reading poetry required aneffort of imagination on his part, an effort of will, so too the people who dolike seeing such things will make such an effort to see them. Barfield wasconcerned that if enough people made that effort, or, through the ‘lethargy ofcustom’, let others make it for them and passively accepted the results, theworld would eventually come to look like that. Barfield made these remarks in1957, when Saving the Appearances was first published. I will leave it to thereader to judge whether in the sixty years that have passed anything likeBarfield’s concerns has happened.Like everyone else in this book, Barfield took the creative power of imaginationseriously. Paracelsus, we’ve seen, believed he could ‘stab and wound’ with athought, and he took for granted that the mind could make the body ill. Blakeand Coleridge have no doubt about the creative powers of imagination. For Blake,‘All Things Exist in the Human Imagination’, and Coleridge agrees, seeing inPrimary Imagination ‘the living power and prime agent of all human perception’.In this it is second only to ‘the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM’.That is, the imagination behind our perceiving the world is the same as theimagination that creates it. Coleridge even says it is a ‘repetition’ of thatact of creation. When we open our eyes and see the world we are at the same timein some way creating it, or at least are participating in our ‘finite’ way inits ‘eternal’ creation. Rudolf Steiner agreed with Coleridge. ‘Man is not onlythere in order to form for himself a picture of the finished world,’ he tellsus. ‘Nay, he himself cooperates in bringing the world into existence’. ‘Thecontent of reality,’ Steiner assures us, ‘is only the reflection of the contentof our minds’.We may think: Well, Steiner was a mystic, Blake and Coleridge were poets,Paracelsus was an alchemist. Weren’t they letting their own imagination run awaywith them? But we’ve seen that science and philosophy agree with them. Eversince Werner Heisenberg we’ve known that the observer alters the observed, andGoethe knew this before Heisenberg. And Paul Ricoeur, a rigorous Frenchphilosopher awarded many academic honours with no interest in the occult, hasargued that we can best understand Husserl (another difficult no-nonsensethinker) if we can grasp that ‘the intentionality which culminates in seeing’ –Husserl’s ‘perception is intentional’ – is a kind of ‘creative vision’. Each ofthese thinkers, and there are many others like them, believe that in a very realsense our imagination, our consciousness, is in some way creative, not only inart, poetry, music, but in reality itself. In some sense for them we do indeed‘create reality’, or at least are an essential agent in its coming into being.Imagination then is not about ‘make believe’ but about ‘make real’.Our rejected occult or esoteric tradition has long recognised this. ‘Don’t callup what you can’t put down’ is solid magical advice, and the overconfidentprotagonists of many occult horror tales have learned it to their dismay.15[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-281] Thoughts are things, very powerfulones, this tradition tells us, and it is prudent to be aware of their power.Goethe warned of the power of an ardent wish. ‘Be careful what you wish for inyouth,’ he advised, because ‘you will get it in middle age’. Yeats, we know,echoed him: ‘Whatever we build in the imagination will accomplish itself in thecircumstances of our lives’. The writer John Cowper Powys, whose mammoth AGlastonbury Romance is perhaps the most mystical novel in the English language,was so convinced of the power of his ‘evil eye’, his ability, like Paracelsus’,of causing harm at a distance, that he took enormous, complicated precautions sothat he would not, through some chance act of imagination and will,inadvertently harm those around him.16 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-282]According to the twentieth century’s most famous magician, Aleister Crowley,‘Magick is the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity withWill’.17 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-283] Crowley knew, as hiscontemporary Bernard Shaw did, that the will cannot work in a vacuum, and thatbefore we can apply our will, we must have a clear idea of what we are willing.That is the business of the imagination. It is, as Shaw said, the beginning ofcreation. Barfield’s concern is precisely this. He had no doubts thatimagination is powerful, as is the will. The question is: what do you imagine?What do you will into creation? Desire, Shaw said, starts it off. We imaginewhat we desire and then will to make it real. Of course not every stray thoughtor fancy is creative. There are, it seems, some safeguards in place; we shouldbe thankful for this, otherwise the world would be filled with the phantoms ofour inconstant desire – although in many ways our multiple modes oftechnological self-entertainment approach precisely this arrangement. But thequestion remains: what do we want?As evidence that his concern is warranted, Barfield points to what in effect wasthe ‘creation’ of Nature in the way we understand and experience it, by WilliamWordsworth and Coleridge with the publication of their Lyrical Ballads in 1798.Before the reader gasps ‘What?’ and points out that Nature existed well beforeWordsworth and Coleridge, consider this. In 1773 Dr Samuel Johnson and hisfriend and biographer James Boswell, embarked on a tour of Scotland, much ofwhich, at the time, was still wild and untamed. Johnson’s account of theirtravels, A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland (1775), is peppered withcomplaints about the mountains and lakes his carriage had to go around. Theymade the journey tedious and long he said. Johnson liked his nature wellordered, in gardens with neat topiaries and much preferred the city. Todaypeople spend great sums and make much effort precisely to get to the placesJohnson wished he could have avoided. Wordsworth and Coleridge and the otherRomantics taught their readers how to see Nature in a different way, as anobject of beauty and a medium of what Wordsworth called ‘unknown modes ofbeing’.18 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-284]People of course knew Nature before, but the idea of the wilderness as somethingof value in itself, and not as a wasteland to be tamed, was new. Until then,Nature was a force to respect, and a resource to master and use. Humans for themost part were up against it in some way, struggling to eke out a life from itand to protect themselves from it. Now poets were singing of its power to sootheand heal and inspire the soul. We can say that the way to this new perception ofNature began in 1336 when the poet Petrarch climbed a mountain in southernFrance just to see the view, something, until then, that few people, if any, hadthought of doing. Petrarch himself was considered mad for doing it.19[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-285] But slowly the taste for it caught on.We can say that when Petrarch made his ascent of Mont Ventoux, he had startedthe nature tourist industry.Four and a half centuries later, Wordsworth and Coleridge pressed the point hometo their readers. By now it has reached many more people and has altered notonly imaginations but also economies. As an example Barfield points out that‘the economic and social structure of Switzerland’ which is determined in nosmall part by its tourist industry, has the Romantics to thank for the fact that‘the mountains that twentieth-century man sees are not the mountains thateighteenth-century man saw’.20 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-286] Thephysical substance or ‘matter’ of the mountains is the same – although with thedevelopments in elementary physics, perhaps we may not say even that – but theway it is ‘represented’ is different. Twentieth-century mountains are moresymbolic than eighteenth-century ones because the Romantic movement taught us tosee in mountains something more than merely their physical forms. They meansomething more to us than they did to Dr Johnson, just as Petrarch’s mountainmeant something more to him than it did to the people who tried to dissuade himfrom scaling its heights.What turned non-symbolic mountains into symbolic ones? Imagination. And this hashelped not only the Swiss. Nature reserves, national parks and wildlifepreservation are direct outcomes of the alteration in our perception effected bywhat we can call the ‘imagination explosion’ that came with and produced theRomantics. I am not saying, nor is Barfield, that everyone who goes out into‘nature’ today and seeks out the ‘wild’ as a source of beauty has readWordsworth or even knows who he was. But I do think that the desire we have todo this is rooted in the change in our perception of Nature that the Romanticsbrought about.What are mountains and the wilderness symbolic of? For the Romantics they meanta kind of freedom, an untamed, expansive, mysterious living world not reduced tothe quantities and measurements of the new science. They felt this freedom inthemselves, and the untamed world represented it for them. It was as if the vastouter spaces that had stunned Petrarch led to vast inner spaces being discoveredwithin the human mind. Yet if these reflections on the impact of the imaginationon reality seem too abstract, consider a more direct example of how the innerand outer worlds can permeate each other. Although it wasn’t until late in hislife that C.G. Jung spoke openly about the phenomenon he called ‘synchronicity’,he had in fact been preoccupied with it for decades. Synchronicity is Jung’scoinage for what we can call ‘meaningful coincidence’, when the inner and outerworlds reflect each other with such accuracy and obvious meaning that to resortto mere coincidence as an explanation is useless. Jung tells the story of anextremely rationalist client of his, whose hyper-intellectualism made herdifficult to treat. She was telling Jung about a dream involving a golden scarabwhen Jung heard a fluttering at the window. He opened it and a green-gold scarabflew in. That is a synchronicity. Jung’s patient relented after that and hertreatment progressed.In 1951 Jung enlisted the aid of the physicist Wolfgang Pauli to try to accountfor the phenomenon of ‘meaningful coincidence’ by way of quantum physics. Theresult was their book Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle. Jung wastrying to provide some scientific anchor for the experience, hence the term‘acausal connecting principle,’ which, strictly speaking, means a causelesscause. Elements of a synchronicity are linked through meaning, not cause andeffect, as they are in mechanical processes. The dream about the scarab and theactual scarab were in no way connected, at least in no usual way. But that thescarab should appear when Jung’s client was recounting her dream seems to meansomething. To Jung it meant that his client’s inner world and her outer worldwere participating in each other. The impermeable barrier between them had beenbreached. The real scarab was telling her to take her dream scarab seriously.Or, rather than a barrier being breached, more likely the illusion that ourinner and outer worlds are strictly separate had dissolved briefly, and the‘unconscious’ – or whatever is responsible – had shown itself as an active agentin the so-called ‘objective’ world, and that it was taking a special interest inher case.I am convinced that synchronicities are real, true phenomena, and in my book onJung, I recount some examples of my own, as well as those of Jung.21[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-287] I have no idea how they happen nor amI convinced by any attempt so far to explain them in terms of quantum physics,as Jung and Pauli tried to do. But I am as convinced of their reality as I amthat of the desk I am sitting at and the computer I am writing on. In some waysI suspect that we will never explain them in any scientific way, except to saythey seem to be an experience in which what is happening in our heads and whatis happening in the outside world are directly related through meaning, and thatsome intelligence other than our own that knows more than we do is in some waybehind them. They are, I believe, related to a condition of consciousness thatat present we only experience intermittently but with which we will, with anyluck, become more familiar.But explaining synchronicities is not the point. I mention them as an example ofhow our inner world can affect the outer one. In some way that we cannot as yetunderstand, our inner world reaches out into the outer one, and arranges it sothat a synchronicity will happen. I find they are almost always beneficial andseem to be a kind of nudge or gentle push to move in the right direction, or anacknowledgement that I am already doing so. And as seems to be the case, theytend to happen more when we are optimistic and positive minded.22[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-288] And if optimism and a positive outlookcan stimulate synchronicities, then it is clear that our minds can affectreality.At this point, the notion that they can I think is more important to grasp thanhow they can. Perhaps the ‘how’ is only a mystery because we start from theposition of the natural standpoint, that is, with the belief that the world issomething ‘out there’ that our minds only reflect, and so there seems to be noway that they can in any way impress themselves upon it. As the ‘blank slate’school of psychology tells us, the exact opposite is the truth: it impressesitself on us. But with this we are back where we began.A.R. Orage, the literary critic and student of the esoteric teacher Gurdjieff,believed with Shaw that imagination is the propellant of evolution. ‘Evolutionis altogether an imaginative process,’ he wrote. ‘You become what you have beenled to imagine yourself to be’.23 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-289]Barfield would agree, but he would go one step further. Not only ourselves, butthe world too, becomes what we imagine it to be. The phenomena which make up the‘world’ are not independent of us. If as Blake tells us, we become what webehold, the opposite also holds true: what we behold becomes us. Mark Twain’shomely maxim captures this: ‘To a man with a hammer, everything looks like anail’. One of the strangest things Rudolf Steiner said was that the thoughts ofpeople today will determine the physical being of the world in the future, justas the thoughts of people in the past determined our earth today. Barfieldechoes this with a little more phenomenological finesse. ‘The future of thephenomenal world,’ he warns, ‘can no longer be regarded as entirely independentof man’s volition’.24 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-290] If we are whatwe eat, the world is what we think.I say this not to induce in my readers a state of panic and anxiety, a paranoidconcern about the thoughts in their heads, a worry that they shouldn’t bethinking the thoughts they are thinking. Such neurotic fear is the opposite ofthe effect I would like these reflections to have. The world we are living in atpresent is in a state of flux, with old boundaries breaking down without newcontours being established. There is a sense that anything can happen. Suchtimes are, I believe, especially sensitive to the forces in play and a slightshift in some element may have an effect much wider and influential than onewould have ever expected. There is, we can say, a kind of ‘butterfly effect’ inhistory, just as there is in the weather, with slight changes at one endresulting in larger ones at the other.25[part0010_split_001.html#rw-num-note-291]It is at such times that something like Barfield’s responsibility of theimagination is especially needed. This requires a calm, detached, but engagedawareness, the kind of ‘passive potency’ Swedenborg spoke of, an alert,self-possessed attention to detail and readiness to receive, with both ways ofknowing available for work. It is in such a state of wakefulness and purposethat what we may have learned of the lost knowledge of the imagination can be ofuse to ourselves and to the world. To paraphrase Blake, in the future, theworld’s face as it unfolds it, will depend on the minds that behold it.NOTES1 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-267] See, for example, Andrei Tarkovsky’sbeautifully disturbing existential science-fiction film Solaris (1972).https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/solaris-tarkovsky-science-fiction[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/solaris-tarkovsky-science-fiction]2 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-268]http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/01/einstein-imagination/[http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/01/01/einstein-imagination/]3 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-269] Ibid.

A tulpa is a kind of imaginedentity or being that is brought into existence through prolonged, persistent,and intense meditation and visualisation. In Magic and Mystery in Tibet thetraveller Alexander David-Neal tells a classic tale of what happens when onegets out of one’s control. An egregore is a kind of group entity that ismaintained by the belief, ritual, sacrifice, and imagination of its devotees.With enough of these, the egregore can take on a life of its own.

Rousseau and Goethe are here too. I am speaking, as Barfield did, ofthe change appearing in English literature. Even here Wordsworth and Coleridgewere anticipated somewhat by Mary Wollstonecraft. Her Letters Written During aShort Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796) display the kind ofcontemplative delight in nature and sensitivity to the ‘sublime’ – itsstrangeness and mystery – that Romanticism would make widely popular.19 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-285] Petrarch, ‘The Ascent of MountVentoux’ in Selections From the Canzoniere (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press,1985) pp. 11–19.20 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-286] Barfield 1988, pp. 145f.21 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-287] Lachman 2010, pp. 241f, 246.22 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-288] Lachman 2016, p. 171.23 [part0010_split_001.html#rw-ref-note-289] A.R.

How can consciousness be achieved? Gary Lachmanargues that consciousness is not a result of neurons and molecules, but isactually responsible for them.
