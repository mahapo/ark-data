Carl Abrahamsson will expand your doors ofperception of what the counterculture really is. His chapter on Anton LaVey cameto me as a revelation. I am filled with hope that a book like this can bepublished at a time like ours.”MITCH HOROWITZ, PEN AWARD–WINNING AUTHOR OF OCCULT AMERICA AND ONE SIMPLE IDEA“Occulture is a word that was inevitable. During the hyperactive phase of TheeTemple Ov Psychick Youth in the 1980s we were casting around for anall-embracing term to describe an approach to combining a unique, demystified,spiritual philosophy with a fervent insistence that all life and art areindivisible. At any given moment our sensory environment is whispering to us,telling us hidden stories, revealing subliminal connections. This concealeddialogue between every level of popular cultural forms and magical conclusionsis what we named ‘occulture.’ Carl Abrahamsson takes this rendering of an innatecultural dynamic and exposes a multitude of parallel creative Universes that dothat thing. So easy to perceive with hindsight but so invisible to the closedmind, he changes our means of perception—turning a straight line into anintricate spider’s web of possibilities and impossibilities combined. Heperforms magick; he concretizes meaning and brings forth revelation into hiscarefully focused vision.”GENESIS BREYER P-ORRIDGE, ENGLISH SINGER-SONGWRITER, MUSICIAN, AND POET“These days, too much occult discourse comes off as grandiose, needlesslyarcane, or desperately darker-than-thou. But decades of participant observationon the art-magic-transgression beat have given Carl Abrahamsson a moredown-to-earth approach. Streamlining Crowley, LaVey, and postpunk chaos magic,these talks and essays offer up accessible, pragmatic, and psychologically savvytakes on the intuitive potentials of creative individuation. This is not another‘system’ but sparkplugs engineered for your own magical engine.”ERIK DAVIS, AUTHOR OF NOMAD CODES: ADVENTURES IN MODERN ESOTERICA AND HOST OFEXPANDING MIND PODCAST“A sharp, frank, and level-headed exploration of some of the most importantfigures and movements on the current edges of occultism. Highly recommended.”RICHARD SMOLEY, AUTHOR OF FORBIDDEN FAITH: THE SECRET HISTORY OF GNOSTICISM“Carl Abrahamson’s Occulture is itself a beautiful example of the phenomena itdiscusses. Erudite and a pleasure to read, the collected essays have thepotential to nudge consciousness beyond the ordinary perspective of culture andhistory. A necessary read for students of culture or magick.”PHILIP H. FARBER, AUTHOR OF BRAIN MAGICK, META-MAGICK, AND FUTURERITUAL“Carl Abrahamsson—that curator and champion of everything in occulture that iscool, edgy, trendy, and artsy—inspires us with this mind-expanding collection ofessays: meditations on art, magick, sex, psyche, and society that collectivelytrace the supernatural’s proclivity to cross over from counterculture tomainstream, casting light on how we see and understand our world. Not to bemissed!”RICHARD KACZYNSKI, AUTHOR OF PERDURABO: THE LIFE OF ALEISTER CROWLEY“Through this collection of articles, essays, talks, and miscellanea, CarlAbrahamsson emerges as a dedicated communicator who shares concepts, histories,and ideas with insight and imagination.

The term is said to have been coined by the performanceartist Genesis P-Orridge sometime in the 1980s and is easily recognizable as aportmanteau word combing “occult” and “culture.” Abrahamsson agrees. It is ageneral term, he tells us, “for anything cultural but decidedlyoccult/spiritual.”Needless to say that covers a lot of ground. In recent years the powerful andinformative links between art and the occult have become a hot topic both withartists and occultists, but anyone with some knowledge of the history of bothrecognizes that the association between the two predates their currentpopularity by some time. Hermetic ideas informed the Renaissance, and theSymbolism of the nineteenth century was rife with notions of other worlds andintimations of strange, ethereal realities. The occult interests of theSurrealists are well known, but even before them the Russian esotericphilosopher P. D. Ouspensky was inspiring Cubo-Futurist and Suprematist painterswith remarks like, “In art it is necessary to study ‘occultism’; the artist mustbe clairvoyant; he must see that which others do not see; he must be amagician.”Yet although it has a fine pedigree reaching back perhaps into the roots of artand self-consciousness itself—the earliest known paintings, dating back somefifty thousand years, were made by our prehistoric ancestors in nearlyinaccessible caves while experiencing altered states of consciousness andjourneying in the spirit world—occulture is something more than an awarenessthat magic and art are strongly connected, notwithstanding the importance ofthis awareness. There is a purposive element behind the idea, aself-consciousness associated with earlier art movements, a need to defineitself against the backdrop of the ever-increasing plethora of information,entertainment, and distraction that characterizes our time. Yet while many, ifnot most, art movements define themselves by exclusion, cutting out andrejecting everything not them—André Breton’s banishments from the Surrealistfold are legendary—occulture works with a broader brush, embracing a wide and attimes contradictory assemblage of influences and interests. In this it sharesmuch with a movement within modern occultism with which it is often associated:chaos magick. As I understand it, in chaos magick, one need not stick to theprescribed rituals or pantheons but can make magick with just about anything,provided one’s imagination is strong and one’s will is in earnest. How differentis this from many forms of art since Duchamp, when the touch of the artisttransforms everyday items—even urinals—into mysterious portals of wonder?The wide lens of occulture is in evidence in this brilliant collection oflectures, essays, and articles aimed, in one way or another, at conveying thepeculiar aesthetic shared by its varied subjects. Where artists may have onceturned up their noses at trashy occult rubbish, and occultists peered confusedlyat some incomprehensible conceptual work, the occulturist is able to move easilybetween the two worlds. He or she is in many ways a response to seriousshortfalls in either camp. Occulture rejects the blasé cynicism and self-ironythat characterizes much postmodernism. It seeks in the commitment of the truemagician to his practice the seriousness that has evaded art for some time now.Yet in engaging with art and wider cultural expression—film, music, fiction,theater—occulture forces the often sequestered occultist out of his magic circleand into the broader fields of creativity. Magic can be performed in the cinema,on the dance floor, and in a comic book. And art is no stranger in the halls ofritual and ceremony. In occulture these occasional fellow travelers sticktogether for the duration of the journey, and they usually find some veryinteresting places to go to.What strikes a reader of these short, sharp forays into the occultural landscapeis precisely this breadth of interest and curiosity. I get the feeling from themthat their author is determined to find something fascinating in everything, tobe able to, like the magician or artist, turn what we might look away from intothe center of our attention. Having worked in many of the fields he writesabout—producing music, film, fiction, and photography (he is a kind ofRenaissance occulturist)—Abrahamsson is well equipped for his expeditions; thereader is in the hands of a good guide through a cultural terrain that is notwithout its pitfalls. Some of the pieces here focus tightly on magical practice,mostly of the Thelemic, that is, Crowleyan, variety, and some readers may need abit of background in this in order to get their full import. But the main ideasare clear and seem to fit in nicely with studies of dolls, dreams, magick as akind of “currency”—an occult Bitcoin—and the philosophy of Anton LaVey. A pieceon the similarities and differences between Aleister Crowley and Rudolf Steinerdraws some surprising comparisons, and one on Jung, mythology, and theirappearance in contemporary culture adds some new insights to an oftentoo-familiar theme.My own favorites were the pieces on Paul Bowles, Ernst Jünger, and YukioMishima, three writers who we would not immediately consider occult, but thatocculture’s wide lens can easily fit into its frame. The idea of the “expatoccultist,” a magician constantly on the move, as it were—as Bowles seemed tohave been—seems obvious, but I don’t think anyone pointed it out as such before;at least I haven’t seen it. Jünger and Mishima seem natural for a comparison.Both, in different ways, had a fascination with combat and battle; Jünger, ofcourse, was a decorated war hero, while Mishima was too young to see combat, aserious failing from his point of view that troubled him throughout his shortlife. Both developed fastidious, highly polished prose styles. And both were,again in different ways, on the right side of the political spectrum, althoughJünger’s contemplative detachment is a rather different affair from Mishima’shistrionic and fatal acting out.What is important here is that Abrahamsson is taking occulture down interestingnew routes, beyond the pentagrams and black leather that too often obscure itsmore subtle offerings and provide the uninitiated with kitschy reasons todismiss it. He is showing that the occulturist perspective can provide new waysin which to see literature and even the act of writing itself. But what thesewritings do fundamentally is what all good criticism should: convey the passionand delight that the critic found in his subjects, so that the reader can sharein this transformative bounty. This collection, I think, manages that admirably.GARY LACHMAN, LONDON, NOVEMBER 2016GARY LACHMAN is the author of twenty books on the links between consciousness,culture, and the Western inner tradition, most recently The Lost Knowledge ofthe Imagination, Beyond the Robot: The Life and Work of Colin Wilson, and TheSecret Teachers of the Western World.

This interdisciplinary lecture series*1[9781620557044_ftn.xhtml#ft1] is just one example of an emergence of topics andareas that used to be banned or shunned. Why is this? I’m going to take a lookat some possible explanations and shine the light on some current examples ofmagic, not only as a fascinating and exotic topic but as an active ingredient incontemporary cultural change.There are so many possible definitions that I think we’ll have to begin bynarrowing down. Many things, developments, and changes begin in the dark, so tospeak, whether it’s cultural, political, business related, or interest-grouprelated—and especially if these contain seeds or ideas that go against thecurrent status quo. So one treads lightly, evaluates, discusses with the alreadyinitiated, and develops the change in question. That seems to be a more or lessgeneral modus operandi. We are going to stick to considerably more esoteric oroccult ideas and methods this evening, meaning ideas contained within frameworksthat have traditionally been outside normal or accepted scientific orphilosophical discourse and methodology.It’s complicated to look at a topic that has been so integrated in humancultural history but retrospectively mainly through fiction and myth. The reasonfor the vague cloudiness has usually been a mix of internal and externalpressure. Esoteric groups or solitary magicians have kept teachings andtechniques secret to retain an intragroup dynamic, to “protect” the teachings inquestion. But they have also done it because of external pressure; because ithas simply been dangerous to display interest or activity within repressivecultures. Complicated codes, symbols, and initiatory structures have therebybecome both fascinating and terrifying to the outsiders, who have usually beenthe ones to confusedly codify what they’ve only heard about.One could say that the Knights Templar represented an occult counterculture.This order of military men and noblemen, active from the twelfth to thefourteenth centuries, initially supported the Catholic Church by helpingpilgrims reach the Holy Land. But as they grew wealthier and also traffickedwith the enemy, meaning Islam, in terms of hidden knowledge and science, thepolarity increased. The Catholic Church refused competition when it came toworldly power, and this increasingly powerful group that concocted secretrituals based on enemy sources had to go. To hell, that is. After a Catholicclean sweep, complete with human sacrifice at the stake, the Templars wentunderground along with their mysteries, only to resurface some four hundredyears later as Freemasons—according to their own myth, at least. Here we can seea continued countercultural streak, in that the Freemasonic republic of theUnited States disconnected from the strict Anglo-Saxon Church of Englandhegemony.Strange things were going on in Germany too. The mythical Bavarian Illuminatiand Rosicrucianism challenged hegemonic structures from the seventeenth centuryand onward, mythically empowered by occult Eastern sources and carrying anindividualistic impulse that was not looked upon kindly by either church orstate. There was always something going on beneath the surface but most often itwas based on small secret groups interested in self-development, radicalscience, hedonism, or simply liberty as a principle. Some individuals from thispara-occult background drifted into political movements, but many did not.The postrevolutionary Enlightenment of the late eighteenth century stressedrationalism and empiricism, and also brought with it a slightly more liberalatmosphere. And the pendulum kept on swinging. When industrialism, theinevitable child of the Enlightenment, hit hard during the nineteenth century,the irrational yearning of Pre-Raphaelites and symbolists brought forth abourgeois interest in altered states of consciousness, spiritualism, and Easternphilosophies. But still it was contained as specialized interests, with no realtangibility or credibility in the main cultural stream.This changed very much during the second half of the nineteenth century, formany reasons. One main reason was that esoteric ideas and magical work becamerooted in open-minded cultural environments rather than in insular fraternitieswhere intra-nepotism was more important than personal development per se. TheBritish Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn is one of the most famous occultgroups from this time. With culturally active people like William Butler Yeats,Aleister Crowley, Arthur Edward Waite, Arthur Machen, Florence Farr, and MaudGonne the environment itself attracted individuals who wanted both sides of thecoin: both an esoteric path of self-development but also techniques andstrategies to use in their own creative work. The thematics of occultism spilledover into their work too, thereby helping establish a wider interest.A parallel manifestation could be seen in the romantically Goethean world ofpost-Theosophy Rudolf Steiner and his Anthroposophical movement. Approaches andtechniques that not long before this were regarded as mere hocus-pocus with novalidity in a bourgeois society or culture now emerged as substantial parts ofpeople’s lives and creativity, and they continue being influential to this dayin ecological thinking and holistic teaching methods.However, one could argue that these were fairly soft “leaks” into the generalmind frame. An exception would be Golden Dawn–trained Aleister Crowley(1875–1947). But Crowley’s impact had more to do with his provocative, oftenscandalous personality and his need for attention rather than the core of hismagical-philosophical system of Thelema, which is essentially very creative andpro-individualistic. Crowley was also interesting as someone who tried to mergea scientific attitude with inner occult research. Seeing that so much of ouraccepted science today has its sources within the occult sciences, Crowley’searly methodological wishes may yet bring out some really radical finds. Today,it’s almost as if science itself has surpassed occultism, not only in using atruly esoteric language of its own, but also in its wild speculation andresearch about both inner and outer space.Considerably tougher strains of distinct counterculture popped up in slightlymore expected arenas: the art world. I’m thinking specifically of Dada ratherthan surrealism as a post–World War One psychological safety valve. Many of theprotagonists from both these scenes were interested in the then-emergingphenomena of psychology and psychoanalysis but also in more distinctly esotericthings.André Breton’s manifesto of the surrealists contains many interestingformulations:We must give thanks to the discoveries of Sigmund Freud. On the basis of thesediscoveries a current of opinion is finally forming by means of which the humanexplorer will be able to carry his investigation much further, authorized as hewill henceforth be not to confine himself solely to the most summary realities.The imagination is perhaps on the point of reasserting itself, of reclaiming itsrights. If the depths of our mind contain within it strange forces capable ofaugmenting those on the surface, or of waging a victorious battle against them,there is every reason to seize them—first to seize them, then, if need be, tosubmit them to the control of our reason.1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt1]If this is not a formulation of a magical Weltanschauung, I don’t know what is.John Moffitt’s book on Duchamp, Alchemist of the Avant Garde, also reveals manyhighly fascinating occult sources in the work of one of the giants ofcontemporary art. And there are many other examples.One thing that’s consistent in both the inspiration from and actual applicationof occultism is a strong sense of individualism, which may be a key ingredientin its presence in many countercultural phenomena. The history of magic showsthat even when integrated in sanctioned religious or societal contexts, magicalpractice has been driven onward by individuals with a unique set of experimentaltools. We’re looking at a refinement and empowerment of the individual through aprogression, symbolic and preferably real too, that will enhance not only his orher life, but also spill over in a general benevolence through wisdom. Theparallels to the work of the artist are obvious.When collective approaches are attempted, the process and results turn intosomething else: manipulations, politics, demagogia, power tripping, and soforth. Initial communal goals are one thing; a causal manipulation of the massesanother. The history of magical groups is a history of crash landings or slowdegeneration. Very seldom do we find success stories about fully developedhigher creatures who spread their inner light within group contexts and beyond.Very often it’s an all-too-human scenario of power struggles within groups andsecret societies that pushes the potential for self-development back into theshadows in order for ego inflation and chaos to shine. This has usually broughtforth a general marginalization of initially very interesting ideas. To a greatextent, I believe this has to do with the use of a language and terminology thatis too obfuscated, arcane, and symbolic. Instead of simply seeing what needs tobe done and how, many individuals haven’t been able to see the beauty of theforest because of all the trees in the way.A sublime symbol of the swinging-pendulum phenomenon in human history is theemergence at about the same time of atomic energy and LSD. The vast potential ofdestruction and the vast potential of reappraisal and creation were ushered inat the same time and unleashed paranoid and fierce global power struggles on onehand and major cultural shifts on the other. I’m not saying LSD has beensingularly responsible for the countercultural effects of the 1960s. But it wascertainly a key agent that helped initiate a wave of major changes in theWestern mind.Integrated in the psychedelic 1960s was a major influx not only of Easternteachings, yoga, and meditation but also of Western esotericism. The colorfulopen-mindedness of the times made young people question not only currentpolitical authority but also traditional authorities like the established worldreligions. Many people sought out magic and occultism—most in the sense of “popoccultism” and the integration of alluring symbolism, but some in a more seriousand devoted way. The environment was an overall experimental one, and youngpeople were suddenly no longer afraid to voice their own opinions.People like Crowley, Blavatsky, and Gurdjieff became icons. Young people soughtout their teachings, as the books gradually came back in print. And let’s notforget Carl Gustav Jung and Hermann Hesse, who were very popular among thisemerging generation, and who were both from a highly esoteric or spiritualbackground. This led to an integration of ideas based in the inner sphere and anempowerment that were all part of the same environment as antiwar sentiments,civil rights, women’s rights, environmentalism, and many other things we takefor granted today. The overall countercultural movement of the sixties unmaskedvarious hegemonies that had been temporarily emaciated by the Second World Warand its industrial atrocities. But it did so not primarily, as could beexpected, by a full-frontal attack using a similar language, but rather one fromvarious unexpected corners and in many different ways. One could say that it waslike a choir of messages and resistance, but composed of individually distinctvoices.The unmasking of this perhaps unnecessary existential dualism took differentforms in different media. In a general us-versus-them attitude (from bothsides), even general entertainment was infused with the conflicts to a higherdegree than ever before, from simple tales like the motorcycle movies The WildAngels and Easy Rider to slightly more philosophical and paranoid examples likethe wonderful British TV series The Prisoner. Again, a psychedelic sensibilityhelped change both form and content, sometimes to surprising degrees.In literature too, the themes and forms revolved around countering the oldrestrictions with something new, radical, and also philosophical-magicalfiltered through individualism. One example could be the early literaryexperiments of William Burroughs and his “cut-ups” and anticontrol stances.Burroughs was very interested in magic and experimented with his own system ofritually changing things, predominantly through his literary working process.Another illuminating example would be John Fowles’s The Magus, from 1965, abeautiful story of an individual fighting a world of illusions based onold-school power structures and morals. This was later turned into an incrediblypsychedelic film, starring Michael Caine and Antony Quinn. In a similar veinwould be David Ely’s 1963 novel Seconds, which is another intricate andultraparanoid insight into the relationship between a frustrated individual whowants existential change but is only offered it through a highly controlled,commercial, and moralistic organization. This was also turned into a beautifuland unnerving film, starring Rock Hudson.Many of the writers at the time were immersed not only in a contemporaryfascination with esoteric and psychological themes but also reached farther backinto pagan times for philosophical inspiration. Fowles wrote,We often forget to what an extent the Renaissance and all its achievementssprang from a reversion to the Greek system. The relationship between paganismand freedom of thought is too well established to need any proof; and allmonotheistic religions are in a sense puritan in tone—inherently tyrannical andfascistic. The great scientific triumphs of the Greeks, their logic, theirdemocracy, their arts, all were made possible by their loose, fluid concepts ofdivinity; and the same is true of the most recent hundred years of humanhistory.2 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt2]If we keep looking at the 1960s, another interesting countercultural angle isthe creation of Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan in 1966. LaVey’s flamboyant,hedonistic, and life-affirming group publicly declared their hatred of thehippies and psychedelic culture, thereby affirming basic values of conservativeAmerica. But still they bore the stigma of the satanic affiliation in publicopinion, thereby making them a counter-counterculture too weird and frighteningto deal with.In the early 1980s, Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth (TOPY) was developed byBritish artist Genesis P-Orridge (and associates) as a social, artistic, andmagical experiment. The term occulture, coined by P-Orridge, became not only adistanced and fascinating term but also a very active and integrated banner forindividual and group behavior rooted in magic. TOPY was like a mix of atraditional magical order, a hippie commune, an active think tank developingradical ideas, and a producer of very tangible culture in terms of products likerecords, videos, performances, concerts, books, booklets, and many other things.The overall goal was to help the human individual to liberate herself from thechains of her past, whether psychological, emotional, sexual, cultural,religious, and so on. The biggest change, though, was that the discourse waspublic and nonsymbolic. One made no secret about methodology, technology, orgoals. This audacity led to problems and stigmatization for the already infamousP-Orridge and eventually to the dissolution of the first phase of TOPY. Butstill the activities left shock waves and inspirations that carry on to thisday.The 1980s were a vital time for occultism in general. Various new branches andgroups popped up in Europe and the United States, integrating new technology,psychedelics, and radical politics in work that had previously been quiteacademic, intellectual, and soft-spoken. This was amplified further in the1990s, when we could see the emergence and integration of the Internet. If themagician needs a menstruum or an agent through which to send his or her desires,what better place than an invisible and far-reaching technological platform?Although the technology of any social media platform is not countercultural initself, the development of cryptological applications, deep webs, and otherhidden (occult) platforms by definition are. One of the most interestingexamples recently was the emergence of the Silk Road website, through which youcould order basically anything under the radar. In a way, it represented a totaland efficient individual freedom of choice using the same technology as thesanctioned market platforms. But as the market there was mainly for drugs,weapons, and other illicit items and services, it couldn’t last for long.Wikileaks and other phenomena like Anonymous are similar in attitude. One usesthe technology available and furthers one’s own goals through a non-sanctioneddevelopment of it. The multinational IT corporations are always there withtempting and lucrative offers for the most prominent hackers.Anonymous and also the Occupy movement’s use of the masked Guy Fawkes figurefrom the film V for Vendetta reveals an esoteric connection: V was originally agraphic novel created by Alan Moore, whose interest in the occult is well known.Moore’s integration of esoteric themes and personalities in his work has helpedmake several of them popular in new generations. An interesting detail is alsothat the film V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowski brothers, who hadearlier created the Matrix trilogy—a cosmic soap opera filled not only withtechnological-supernatural fantasies but also imbued with a distinctly Gnosticphilosophy of individual liberty. To further accentuate the contemporarymalleability of a traditional outlook, the Wachowski brothers have recentlymorphed gender and are nowadays the Wachowski sisters.During the autumn of 2015, some radical American occultist artists performed apublic ritual and exhibition in a gallery in Los Angeles. This was in order tocounter the Swiss corporation Nestlé’s attempts to increase business revenues byturning water into a commodity to a greater extent than it already is. Thisritual was even called a death curse and followed classic ritual methodology. Itis interesting not only because of its conscious use of visibility and theprovocation that brings but also because it uses magic-as-art-as-magic as aninstigator for change that would normally be handled in political orintellectual arenas of protest. It isn’t the objects or the art in itself herethat matters, but the overall goal that these individuals hope to achieve, notby petitions and public debate, but by highly irrational yet at the same timehighly structured methods.Also recently, a Florida candidate for the Senate by the name of Augustus SolInvictus admitted in international media that he had ritually sacrificed a goatand drunk its blood after a three-week fasting experience in the desert. Nomatter what will happen to Augustus I find his honesty and audacity remarkableand a very fine countercultural example of pushing the boundaries of what’saccepted within “normal” society.Femen and their bared-breasts shock tactics could be regarded in a similar way.There’s nothing specifically occult about displaying your titties in protest perse, but within the specific contexts of, for instance, protests against theVatican or fundamentalist Islam, the provocation transcends mere shock value andtouches critically upon millennia-long traditions of misogynistic, antihuman,and antilife behavior.It seems that the freer the world becomes, at least in potential, the quickerthe repressive forces reply. Saudi Arabia, so prosperous in many ways, stillsticks to Sharia laws and is one of the few countries in the world with anactive inquisition in the form of its antisorcery squad. People are still beingexecuted because they have been convicted of performing magic and witchcraft.Despite isolated local draconian attitudes like this, the debate within Westernacademia is whether or not a “re-enchantment” is in fact taking place in ouroverall global culture. Religious or narrower cultic behavior signals a deepdissatisfaction with a too-rational world containing increasing threats ofglobal annihilation as a result of shortsighted causality and hubristicempiricism. Is the emergence of thematically magical things within pop cultureperhaps just the tip of the iceberg that is currently melting?I would say that the reemergence of transcendental mind frames, sympatheticmagical thinking, and ritualistic behavior fully constitutes a re-enchantment ofthe human psyche and of culture. The emergence of the areas and topics withinacademia and public visibility does not. It is interesting to note, however,that they do seem to go hand in hand. This has to a great extent been madepossible by the fact that many academics and intellectuals have themselves beenformatted within various esoteric environments like magical groups and orders intheir youth. So here we see an example of how youthful experimentation canindeed lead to tangible adult presence if there is perseverance and if the timeis right, so to speak. But in itself, intellectual work on the topics does notconstitute a re-enchantment of our world.Today, we can just sit back and watch very interesting goings-on. On the biglevel, there are things like the touring Hilma af Klint exhibition that has sofar been seen by over a million people in Europe. She was hardly counterculturalby definition but was clearsighted enough to realize that her work was somagical and radical, so ahead of her own times, that she stated in her will thatthe paintings mustn’t be shown until at least twenty years after her death.Today, the time for appreciation seems more than right.The presence of magical themes in pop culture through Harry Potter and Lord ofthe Rings should indicate the same thing. In a dualistic, binary, andsuprarational culture, our need for mythic realms become evident and thereforeviolently saturated in commercial exploitation.On a more concrete and countercultural level, we can see beautiful bookmaking asa radical tool of effecting not only change but also acting as a safeguard topreserve valuable ideas and traditions. The work of publishers like ScarletImprint in the UK with making exquisite editions of very radical writings, andperhaps my own work with the Fenris Wolf journals, are some examples of goingagainst the grain of contemporary fragmentation and fleeting digi-culture. Ifideas can create change now, that’s great. But it’s equally important topreserve them for future generations in lasting formats. Despite recent almostincredible technological innovations, it seems that still the two most radicalinnovations in human culture are the harnessing of fire and the book.A vast amount of occulturally significant things are going on today: thislecture series, for instance, and international European Society for the Studyof Western Esotericism (ESSWE) conferences within academic esotericism studies,the Here to Go symposium (biannual) in Norway, the Equinox Festival (London,2009), the Occult Humanities Conference (New York City, 2016), thePsychoanalysis, Art and the Occult symposium (London, 2016)—across-fertilization between artistic and intellectual realms in real, tangiblehuman interactions. These are not countercultural examples at all anymore, butrather evidence that what was once counter was then countered by moralistic andrepressive tendencies and then eventually ended up as a constructive synthesisof beneficial ideas tangible in the real world. As in many other fields of humanendeavor, it’s conservative resistance to the radical resistance that makes theradical resistance strong. But if there’s one thing history teaches us,sometimes painfully so, it’s that life and culture are never static. Thependulum always swings."},{"pageContent":"2Splendor SolisLebensreform and Sexual Vitalism in GermanyOriginally published in the Polish magazine Trans/Wizje (no. 6, 2015).THE INTERESTING AND INFLUENTIAL TRAIL of alternative lifestyles and philosophiesthat manifested in Germany around the turn of the nineteenth to the twentiethcenturies has been well documented.*2 [9781620557044_ftn.xhtml#ft2]Nature-loving youth defied their heavy bourgeois programming andchanneled/conceptualized a whole movement, including vegetarianism, sun worship,nudism, fasting, and an assortment of creative health cures. Some of these earlyprotagonists moved on to America, specifically to the West Coast, and created aloose egregore that eventually gave birth to the hippies, and more.There has always existed a long tradition of alternative thinking, as well asnature worship, in Germany. Why is that? One could of course look to the paganpast of the region as such, where Germanic tribes were defiant in the onslaughtof Christian violence and propaganda. The tribal life rooted in nature wasn’tunique for the Germanic sphere of course, but the strength of their resistanceto change undoubtedly shows that they weren’t willing to trade their way of lifefor new, strange, and arbitrary philosophies stemming from Rome and beyond.One could easily say that one line of influence is simply tradition thateventually became mythic. The pagan past lived on, primarily in rural regions,both in stories and in the celebrations of the natural, seasonal cycles.Christians tried to revamp these cycles to fit their own ends (Christmasvis-à-vis the winter solstice would be the most obvious example), but theydidn’t fully succeed.Similar challenges arose again during the Reformation. Where the hegemony of theCatholic Church had been almost total for approximately one thousand years(Sweden was the last country in Europe to be officially “christened” in 1124),Martin Luther suddenly challenged the Roman Catholic Church, and successfullyso. This brought a democratization of the Christian faith and also a generalsense of independence, as biblical (and other) translations into German could atthis time also be distributed thanks to Gutenberg’s magical printing press.Ideas and concepts were now no longer imposed from above by an authority thatdemanded blind faith and strict obedience. The specifically Germaninterpretation was what mattered.The Reformation divided the German sphere into a northeastern Protestant partand a Catholic southwestern part. Although central Europe was divided intosmaller principalities, the German language and shared history brought togethera form of cultural identity that in itself was strongly authoritarian—meaningyou either gave orders or obeyed orders. The conservative rigidity eventuallytook on symbolic (as well as concrete) shape in the Prussian army and society,which was orderly and hierarchical to the extreme. When Germany was eventuallyturned into a single empire in 1871, the Prussian model served as an example forall these principalities.Within this highly structured and orderly society, the exterior developments ofindustrialism and progress within the natural sciences brought not only materialwealth but also increased pollution and waste, without forgetting increased illhealth in the wake of this pollution and stress.These parameters of progress constituted the basis for a diametrical movement—arevolt stemming from the children of the new German Reich (1871–1918). That thefocus now lay on health, nature, spirituality, and so forth is hardlyremarkable. That the contemporary focus on a profitable present and an almostsuperstitious belief in a science for the future should bring about a romanticlonging for distant pagan pasts is also almost a given. A similar phenomenon canbe seen in the British Pre-Raphaelite movement (ca. 1848–1870). In Germany, ayearning for an idealized state of mind and way of life became apro-individualistic safety valve in a culture immersed in collective progressand imperialism.Germany has always maintained an extreme psyche, in which societal and culturaldevelopments swing from one extreme to another. Usually, one form that containsrebellion in itself can be quickly integrated within its own opposite. Anexample of this would be the Wandervögel movement (groups of free-spirited andtradition-affirming hiking boys and girls), which was quickly turned into theHitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) movement after the National Socialist takeover. TheNazis had throroughly studied how the Catholic Church had gone about theirbusiness throughout the centuries, and tried to integrate similar “adaptations.”Their inclusion of runic symbolism, a longing for past glories (German onesonly, of course), solar worship, and so on all stemmed fromlate-nineteenth-century Lebensreform movement(s). With these attractive elementsheavily flaunted in their demonstration of power, plus the integration of theblind faith of Catholicism, the Prussian model of organization, a greatdemagogue in Hitler, and assorted scapegoating patterns to boot, the Nazisuccess was swift and efficient.The generation born in Germany in the late nineteenth century was fed up withwhat was being offered. What better way to protest than to just head out intonature in a highly romanticized state of mind? They also soon found out thatthere had already been precursors in older generations who had explored excitingphenomena like nudism and vegetarianism.Gusto Gräser (1879–1958), a young freethinker and nomad from Austria, had beenin touch with Lebensreform protagonists Richard Ungewitter (1869–1958) and KarlWilhem Diefenbach (1851–1913). These meetings contributed to Gräser’sformulating ideas about a colony in nature, where free love and healthyvegetarian diets could rule supreme. The Monte Verita community, established byHenri Oedenkoven and Ida Hofmann in 1900 at Ascona in Switzerland, soon became amelting pot for alternative lifestyles and attracted creative people from all ofEurope (Hermann Hesse, Carl Jung, Isadora Duncan, and D. H. Lawrence, to mentionbut a few). Gusto Gräser became a sort of wanderer-poet in residence andattracted a lot of starry-eyed visitors. Monte Verita became like a magnet forthe curious and open-minded, and also a generator for many spin-off ideas.The concepts permeating Monte Verita were a condensed mix that were part of thegreater movement called Lebensreform: a reformation of how life should be led,away from the big cities and the waste of aggressive capitalism. One could saythat the ideas were old (perhaps even mythic) and had been filtered for sometime through a general German health consciousness up until this critical erawhen a young generation of Germans simply started acting out rather than justtalking about change. It’s interesting to see how even basic concepts likehiking in nature became politicized in the Germanic sphere. The originalNaturmenschen, like those at Ascona, simply wanted to be free and to experiment,roaming the forests and hills. The Nazis immediately wanted to wipe off any kindof romanticism involved and focus on strenghtening young boys’ and girls’ senseof collective belonging (the perfect platform for propaganda). The also-presentSocialist stress on hiking focused on the health of the new class of industrialworkers. So, no matter which perspective, German nature was the stage ofpolitical agendas as well as of necessary reflection and soul searching for theentire nation.The artist most frequently associated with the Lebensreform movement, “Fidus”(Hugo Höppener, 1868–1948), painted rituals and idyllic frolicking in thesunshine, with nude men, women, and children. The images were often adorned withrunic or pseudo-runic letters, to tie in the fantasies to a glorious past ofpastoral pagan bliss. Solar worship is almost always prominent in his images.The idealized iconography of Fidus’s paintings often borders on cartoonishkitsch that brings to mind the later Nazi propaganda of Körperkultur (bodyculture). But seen in its own temporal context, Fidus’s art comes across asromantically idealistic.On a more structured level, interesting things were going on parallel to this inGerman para-Masonry. The Ordo Templi Orientis, founded and run by Austrian paperindustrialist Carl Kellner (1851–1905) and Theodor Reuss (1855–1923), integratedmysteries from the East, including sexual rituals for the highest degrees. Theinflux came from Indian tantrism and was then developed further as Britishoccultist Aleister Crowley (1875–1947) got involved. The merging of Crowley’sown religious text Liber AL vel Legis (The Book of the Law) with the structureof the OTO created a perfect vehicle for what he defined as a “solar-phallic”initiatory system. Reuss incidentally (or not) established an OTO presence atMonte Verita by, among other things, reviving the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light(a mystical order working with sex magic) and arranging a conference there in1917, which contained a reading of Crowley’s Gnostic Mass: his dramatic publiccelebration of solar-phallicism and the creativity of Eros.Where most of the individuals involved were regarded as freaks or morallydegenerate, some people managed to break the general ice. Pioneers like LouisKuhne (1835–1901), Benedict Lust (1872–1945), and Adolf Just (1859–1936) wrotebooks about their health-reform ideas that became bestsellers, with worldwidetranslations to follow. This in itself contributed to a similar wave of radicalhealth thinking in America. Rudolf Steiner created his Anthroposophic movementout of his own disappointment with Theosophy. He managed to convince thousandsof people—including quite a few wealthy ones—that a new and occult way oflooking at the world was totally possible to integrate in an otherwise normallifestyle and outlook. Soon there was an impressive study center outside ofBasel (the Goetheanum), newly formed Waldorf schools, teachings on how to farmmore consciously and grow organic vegetables (the origins of biodynamicfarming), and so on. Steiner was an enthusiastic and creative pioneer whoinspired others by synthesizing and rephrasing previously too-radical conceptsand making them understandable for common people. Where Monte Verita was aninspiration for curious outcasts and artists, Anthroposophy became more of anintegrated movement with a potential for substantial change.Not surprisingly, Steiner’s cosmology contained many insights into therelationship between Sun and Earth, between the human spirit and body:We must transform ourselves, through the light, into beings who no longerexperience their connection with the Earth, but feel connected to the cosmicspaces. Gradually, the contemplation of the stars, the Sun, the Moon, and cosmicspace must become as familiar to us as plants growing in the meadow. If we aremerely children of the Earth, we look down upon the plants covering the meadow.We enjoy them, but we don’t understand them, for we remain earthly beingsweighed down by gravity. As earthly beings bound by gravity, we have learned tostand on the Earth. But if we could transform ourselves, we could connectourselves with the widths of cosmic space—those meadows of the heavens, seededwith stars.1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt3]Steiner had been researching Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) atuniversity, and there’s really no way of escaping this master when looking atanything German. Goethe’s anti-Catholicism and pro-sexual attitudes, and notforgetting his reverence for nature as such, made him the ideal symbol for themore intellectually inclined Lebensreform people. Steiner wrote that “Goethe wasfilled with this yearning when he wrote his essay on the Metamorphosis ofPlants. Many of his statements were those a person would make who felt orientedto the Sun rather than the Earth—a person who felt that the Sun pulls the forceof the plant’s growth out of the Earth while it is still hidden underground.”2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt4]A typical phenomenon at the time was also a reformation of the view of the bodyin art and creative expression. Although there was nude revelry and dancing atMonte Verita, the most striking photographs are those from dance performancesarranged by Rudolf von Laban. Photographs of elegant human bodies clothed infree-flowing and strongly colored light robes still make an impression. Theyremind one of Rudolf Steiner’s system of physical expression: eurythmics. Thespiritual and semantic gestures and poses made by colorful robe-clad dancersmove the communication from the intellect to the human body as such.As we all know, things quickly changed when the National Socialists came topower. The healthy outdoors Sun gave way for the mystical Black Sun; theWandervögel became Hitlerjugend; fertility cults became baby factories, completewith Mutterkreuz (mother’s cross) medals (after eight German babies had beenproduced by the same mother); pagan sites of worship became centers forpolitical demagogy; and so forth. Using the Christian-Catholic method ofappropriation, Goebbels, Himmler, and company scouted the lay of the land andused what they found applicable to the chaotic German mind frame. The individualwas sacrificed for the collective, and yet many healthy elements remained. Theproblem was that everything needed to be prefixed with German, NationalSocialist, or Hitler—which of course excluded everyone and everything else.One should note too that many of the protagonists that inspired the Monte Veritaactivities were as steeped in Ariosophy and racial theories as many of theirpurely political contemporaries. Richard Ungewitter, although radical in hisnudism and vegetarianism, was a devout anti-Semite and associated with one ofthe publications favored by Adolf Hitler early on: Ostara. However, when theNazis came to power, vegetarianism could be condoned (the most famous vegetarianbeing of course Hitler himself) but not nudism. Ungewitter remained respected insome ways but was not allowed to be outspoken about his interests. HeinrichPudor’s nudism was even more adamantly tied in to racial theories, but hiscriticism of the decadent laxness(!) of the Nazis naturally created aproblematic situation for him.The clearest example of how Lebensreform permeated even the most conservativeenvironments in Germany is probably the physical educator Hans Surén. As acommander at the army’s School for Physical Exercise, he introduced things likemud baths and nude cross-country running for the cadets. Although politicallyaligned with the National Socialists, his ideas were simply deemed too extreme,and the cadets eventually had to get dressed in new and swastika-adorneduniforms.3 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt5]In socialist circles too, nudism was integrated in a political scheme, as hasbeen pointed out by scholar John Alexander Williams: “Like social hygiene, sexreform was a normative ideology that called on workers to transform themselvesinto more rational and disciplined human beings. Together, social hygiene, sexreform, and anticapitalism were all founts of socialist nudist ideology—a set ofintertwined influences that distinguished this branch of nudism from thenonsocialist branch.”4 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt6] Permeating most of thesecharacters and groups, loose or tight, was the explicit core need to return tonature and embrace the sun, symbolically in temples and concretely in exteriornature. The question then emerges: Why all of this solar and alternative forcein the Germanic sphere?It is interesting to note how the sun is a feminine noun in German: die Sonne.With the moon being masculine (der Mond), we see a distinct and early differencefrom the Latin and its later variants (French, Spanish, Italian, etc.), in whichthe sexual connotations are reversed. In a cultural sphere where the sun issuddenly a feminine, maternal energy and the nocturnal moon a paternal energy,one could draw some speculative conclusions: giving life and survival isassociated with fire, light, and heat, whereas paternal protection and strengthcome from a sphere of darkness and cold, reflected in a pale, poetic moon. Wherethe Hindu solar symbol, the swastika, gives the visual impression of spinningdeasil (with the sun, or clockwise), the National Socialist–Ariosophic variantspins widdershins (against the sun). This was carefully constructed to make animpression in the outer world and perhaps even on magical levels. The uniformsand insignia of the SS, black and with shiny metal death’s-heads, connote ashadow world rather than the otherwise so heavily promoted healthy living ofsolar “children” playing in nature without apparent order.Another interesting psychological trait is that Germans call their country DerVaterland (the Fatherland), whereas most other nations tend to regard theirnation as a mother or as feminine (as in Mother Russia, for instance, or laFrance).Many ancient fertility rites in the old German regions contained fire and solarsymbols. Midsummer and other seasonal peaks were celebrated with bonfires, andmany obejcts (as well as living beings) related to sowing or harvesting wereconcretely sacrificed in holy oak-fueled fire.J. G. Frazer recounts several fascinating and sexualized old customs in medievalGermany in his classic study The Golden Bough:At nightfall the whole male population, men and boys, mustered on the top of thehill; the women and girls were not allowed to join them, but had to take uptheir position at a certain spring half-way down the slope. On the summit stooda huge wheel completely encased in some of the straw which had been jointlycontributed by the villagers; the rest of the straw was made into torches. Fromeach side of the wheel the axle-tree projected about three feet, thus furnishinghandles to the lads who were to guide it in its desecent. The mayor of theneighbouring town of Sierck, who always received a basket of cherries for hisservices, gave the signal; a lighted torch was applied to the wheel, and as itburst into flame, two young fellows, strong-limbed and swift of foot, seized thehandles and began running with it down the slope. A great shout went up. Everyman and boy waved a blazing torch in the air, and took care to keep it alight solong as the wheel was trundling down the hill. The great object of the young menwho guided the wheel was to plunge it blazing into the water of the Moselle. . .. As it rolled past the women and girls at the spring, they raised cries of joywhich were answered by the men on the top of the mountain; and the shouts wereechoed by the inhabitants on the opposite bank of the Moselle.5[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt7]With the Nazi Machtübernahme (takeover), human sexuality was again restrainedafter a period of considerable freedom. The Third Reich brought functionalismand purpose back to sex. Women became lauded breeding machines for raciallysuperior children (future soldiers, no doubt). The cult of the athletic body wasmaintained to quite a great extent but always demagogically so. Free love wasnow literally a thing of the past. Although Monte Verita had already passed itspeak by 1933, the people still residing there must surely have felt lucky thatAscona was in Switzerland and not in Germany. The Swiss Anthroposophists musthave felt the same way. In Germany proper, Anthroposophy was duly banned afterthe Nazi takeover.During the first two decades of the twentieth century, there were basically tworadical movements in the Germanic sphere: one mental/ intellectual and oneintuitive/corporeal. Psychoanalysis, modernism, Dada, and a conscious, politicaldiscourse are examples of the first strain; Lebensreform is the prime example ofthe second strain. Seemingly, the strains were kept apart. Perhaps they wereregarded by everyone involved as incongruous? Had someone been able to merge thetwo, truly radical things could have happened. The greatest success story of thetime, and also the person whose philosophy carried the greatest potential formerging the two, Rudolf Steiner, was in every way spiritual-corporeal ratherthan intellectual-corporeal.In many ways one could argue that the National Socialists did indeed manage tocombine the two strains successfully: intellectual and corporeal. The problemwas that their concept as such came at a very high price: restricted individualliberty, the Second World War, and mass human sacrifice. And, let’s not forgetit, a totally devastated and fire-soaked Vaterland.The later concept of the “Black Sun” and its esoteric mysteries within apost-Nazi mythos is highly interesting in this regard. It’s an almost perfectsymbol of the dark side of a culture and history so utterly steeped in differentfacets of solar worship. Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke’s Black Sun is a fascinatingintroduction to this vast area of research:As in the case of the Ariosophists in the early twentieth century, politicalisolation in a hostile world committed to liberalism has led many neo-Nazi andneo-fascist groups to embrace occult notions of ancient Aryan wisdom. From the1970s onward, right-wing extremists began to repackage the old ideology of Aryanracism, elitism and force in new cultic guises involving esotericism and Easternreligions. In Austria and Germany, the former SS man Wilhelm Landig revived theariosophical mythology of Thule, the supposed polar homeland of the ancientAryans. He coined the idea of the Black Sun, a substitute swastika and mysticalsource of energy capable of regenerating the Aryan race.6[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt8]At the bottom of the main dilemma lies perhaps not only the sun as a symbol offiery and pagan motherly energies but also the more human aspect of life forcein Eros. Central to the Lebensreform ideas was a breach with monogamic behaviorpatterns. If everyone was in the nude and healthy, not only was there a“democratization” of sorts but also an underlying (or overt) sexual energypresent. This, of course, created tangible challenges in environments like MonteVerita, as among smaller communities of “amateur” naturists and nudists. It’snot surprising that family was militantly stressed by both sides during theWeimar Republic that followed after the First World War. The socialists wantedto create family units of a healthy working class and the National Socialistswanted the same, with racial motives on top.The eroticism of the Lebensrefom movement was always deeply rooted in nature andin rurally based fantasies about individual attraction and begetting new,sun-drenched life. In many ways, they were perhaps correct in their anti-urbanassumptions. The urban sexuality of early twentieth-century Germany seemedeither debauched and neurotic, as in the almost clichéd depictions of Weimardecadence in Berlin, or carefully constructed and controlled via the Nazis’eugenic visions of purity.Lebensreform’s moral breach with the oppressive Christian cult(ure), and theirfocus on the human body in nature (naked or not), vitalizing food, abstinencefrom alcohol and tobacco, as well as a romantic yearning for pagan days,basically sexualized an entire generation. As many of these overall themesalready existed in German culture, it was the sexual freedom that became themost radical aspect of this cocktail. Regardless if it was made manifest inmodernist art, intellectual theories, pre-hippie-esque “free love,” or asspecialized magico-sexual techniques within the OTO and similar fraternities,the extreme individualization of sex was the singular greatest threat to anyhomogenized “Germanicism.” The free-flowing energy of love was therefore thefirst victim as Eros drifted into Thanatos in not only National Socialist theoryand practice but also in its rich and powerful iconography. The youngsoliders-to-be of the Hitlerjugend, and the blond-braided beauties of theMädel-bünde (maidens league) were of course not encouraged to explore each otherto reach cosmic insights and unions of love, but simply to become obedientbreeders of racially pure Aryans.In August of 1903, an article on the goings-on in Ascona was published in a SanFrancisco newspaper, followed by many more. Some key people in the Germanmovement emigrated to America at about the same time. Perhaps the most importantcharacter was William “Bill” Pester (1886–1963), born in Saxony but from 1906and onward settled in California, where he lived as a “nature boy” (immortalizedby fellow naturalist eden ahbez in his song of the same name, “Nature Boy,”which was turned into a smash hit by Nat “King” Cole).The wisdom of the German and German-influenced nature boys, through newspaperarticles and radio broadcasts, influenced an American generation that was tobloom fully during the 1960s: the hippies. Hermann Hesse’s novels Steppenwolfand Siddhartha, steeped in concepts that he had integrated while visiting MonteVerita, became huge influences on this budding generation of Americanfreethinkers. It would probably be a simplification to say that the earlierbeatniks could fit the mold too. The beats were far too self-indulgent in theirown explorations of altered states of consciousness and life as a journey, comewhat may. It was the hippies who not only wanted to return to nature in peace,but also actively integrated many of the Lebensreform ingredients: free love,vegetarianism, nudism to varying degrees, and so forth. It’s no wonder that thisimported kind of pagan solar worship caught on in sunny California.This movement created a foundation for what we can see around us today in theWestern sphere: ecological awareness, organic and biodynamic farming, holisticperspectives within a dynamic and openminded spirituality, and an integratedliberal sexuality. Although totalitarian systems around the world tried toappropriate the key elements from the Lebensreform movement, it seems theelements still work best underneath the umbrella of individual liberty and underthe naked benediction of the sun."},{"pageContent":"3Abstraction Made ConcreteThe Occultural Methods and Mutations of Thee Temple Ov Psychick YouthOriginally a lecture delivered at Nekropolis Bogcafé in Copenhagen, Denmark,2013.I AM HERE TODAY to talk about an interesting phenomenon that existed forapproximately ten years, between 1982 and 1992. This phenomenon was like a mixbetween a magical order, a think tank, an archive, an experiment in intentionalart, and many other things. I’m talking about Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, orTOPY for short, which spread out of the UK and into the world and soon reachedthousands of members and/or subscribers to TOPY’s frequent newsletters andinformation.My own involvement in this began around 1984, when I started out as a humblesubscriber to newsletters and bought records, pamphlets, fanzines, and so forth,from TOPY’s own mail-order service in the United Kingdom. I was very interestedin all things occult at the time, and I immediately realized that TOPY wassomething brand-new. Everything I had read about magic and occultism alwaysdealt with something old, arcane, systematically symbolic, and quite dusty. Butnot so with TOPY. I was enthused and got involved. I started working with the UKpeople and set up a Scandinavian branch or “access point,” aptly calledTOPYSCAN. This later developed into TOPYEUROPE, which for me meant basically alot of administration run out of my little apartment in Stockholm.It was an incredibly creative time, I have to say. TOPYSCAN, TOPYEUROPE, and anaffiliated company I started called Psychick Release put out books, cassettes,CDs, vinyl records, and videocassettes and arranged workshops, lectures, filmand video screenings, concerts as well as more esoteric things like grouprituals and magical workshops for those really active within this highlypragmatic sphere.Some time in 1991 I burned out and decided to not carry on, as theadminsitration had simply become so overwhelming. Interestingly enough, the keypeople in the United Kingdom and the United States had felt exactly the samething at about the same time. We basically decided it was time to end TOPY as weknew it. A first phase of ten hyper-interesting years had gone by.So where do we begin when looking at this phenomenon? If we look to the UnitedKingdom, we can recognize some well-known people. Artist Genesis P-Orridge andhis collaborators at the time (like Peter Christopherson from the former projectThrobbing Gristle, and David Tibet, an Aleister Crowley romantic who also formedthe band Current 93) decided to try to create a group synthesizing their owninspirations in art and magic and at the same time commenting upon orinfluencing the harsh political climate of the United Kingdom.With magical mentors like Aleister Crowley, Austin Osman Spare, tribalshamanism, and the literary and artistic cut-up applications of WilliamBurroughs and Brion Gysin, and artistic seeds like the surrealists, Dada, mailart, situationism, sixties counterculture, and many, many other things, a coredeveloped that would grow to form Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth as a communaland quaquaversal entity rather than a hierarchic traditonal order withfollowers.At center stage of this new hybrid was a video group that also made music,called Psychic Television, or PTV. This was formed by P-Orridge, Christopherson,and musician Alex Fergusson, and David Tibet was in there too at an early stage.Taking advantage of the unlikely successes and infamy of the predecessorThrobbing Gristle, the group secured record deals with major labels like Warnerand CBS, which at the time was almost beyond fluke level. But it happened. PTVstarted recording music and making videos that soon became a very integratedpart of TOPY and its philosophy.There was a great deal of writing going on too, with the most well-known textbeing Thee Grey Book. What was it all about? What was the actual philosophy ofTOPY? Well, it’s clear to see that there was a great deal in it of CrowleyanThelema—that is, of Crowley’s philosophy of will and considerate subjectivism.But there was an amplification of this more general attitude of “Do what thouwilt” in the technical sorcery system of British painter and magician AustinOsman Spare and the cut-up methodology of writer William Burroughs and painterBrion Gysin—all latter-day TOPY saints of course. The core was one of sacralizedfree will, and an experimental technology was presented to root out bad habits,whether imposed by others or simply one’s own, and generate change through,quite often, artistic means.PTV was very productive, and also worked with other filmmakers like DerekJarman, John Maybury, and Cerith Wyn Evans, to create a cinematic or televisualcorpus of ritual footage, poetic propaganda, and psychedelic playfulness. Themusical side of things took the entourage on the road to many, many concerts allover the world. An example of this first phase could be my own first experienceof PTV live, which was in Stockholm in 1984. There was one video screening oftheir material at Konstfack, a college of art, on the first night and then aregular concert (which also included the videos) at a rock club on the followingnight. There was a presence in both worlds, so to speak.TOPY was not a hierarchical group or order. This was interesting, as most ofesoteric history comes out of very hierchical fraternities. It’s more correct tosay that TOPY was a meritocracy structured atomically. The proton would be a“station” or an “access point”—that is, local points in time and space—andaround these members and interested people constituted electrons and simplyrevolved.One key magical technique that mixed transformative potential with artisticexpression was the process called sigilization. Formulated well by Austin Sparein his books, it basically meant stripping the conscious formulation of yourdesired goal into smaller particles or denominators that could then becreatively readjusted into new and highly un- or subconscious forms during someform of ecstatic mind frame—most often of a sexual kind. This should be done inan as aestheticized way as possible, for instance on a sheet of paper, and alsoinclude sexual liquids, blood, and hair. This would then constitute one’s ownvery private and vividly symbolic manifestation of will.According to TOPY’s integration of William Burroughs’s mind-boggling romanticismconcerning the number 23, this sigilizing ritual should be performed on the 23rdof each month at 2300 hours. If you began that process, you were given a Templename: “Eden” and a number for men, and “Kali” and a number for women. If youcompleted 23 such sigils, you became elevated, not necessarily in rank butcertainly in respect. But it was also totally possible to keep this process asecret if you so desired.These special sigils were sent in to the TOPY stations (United Kingdom, UnitedStates, and eventually Europe), where they were filed in confidence. I don’tthink there has ever existed such a unique collection of heterogeneous yetphilosophically resonant magical art.This technique was the central one for active TOPY members. But there were alsoother rituals that were performed together, quite often for communal goals andprojects, but sometimes also for greater altruistic purposes; these were veryoften sexual in nature and method but not all the time. In the UK and UnitedStates, workshops were held with a Native American Indian shaman called Nomad,and in Scandinavia we did similar things with the Norwegian shaman ArthurSørensen and also with the percussionist and wizard-artist z’ev. This wasfocused on a more classical form of shamanism, with mind travels to thedifferent spheres or “worlds” and communications with what- or whoever was foundthere.Another overall method was filtering or stripping thoughts and sentiments fromthe past, so they could fit our contemporary times. Promoting forgotten geniuseslike Spare, beat iconoclasts like Burroughs or poet Harry Crosby, to mention buta few, catapulted these spirits into the psyches of a generation brought up ondespair and desolation. These pioneers had shown that it was possible, likeCrowley had prophesied, to “do what thou wilt,” but certain psychic barriers hadto be torn down or deconstructed first. TOPY helped administer some of thesetearing-down techniques.There were other magical groups of like mind around at the time. The Illuminatesof Thanatheros (IOT) generated a vortex of what they called chaos magic, with asimilar hardcore and pragmatic approach, often ingrained with scientific termsof the day, such as from quantum physics. The Order of the Nine Angles (ONA) wasa more sinister and dark group or, rather, collective, of individuals exploringSatanic motives and motivations. It is interesting to see that stagnantfraternal, traditional orders dealing with some kind of esoteric teaching orpractical magic, and a political climate that was based in a fiercelyconservative approach to handling things (à la Margaret Thatcher’s government)actually became fertile soil for truly thinking out of the box. TOPY was neverinterested in politics per se, but activley promoted individual liberty on alllevels and also fought for some pragmatic goals such as then-current wildlife oranimal rights issues.As this entire environment was deeply rooted in a postpunk or do-it-yourself(DIY) culture, the emphasis on a “cottage industry” psychology turned into greatsignal and very little noise. Almost every TOPY station or access point had itsown setup for producing printed matter, records, videos, and so on, alltalismanic and carrying a magical charge in their own peculiar way. Even if onlyfor internal distribution, the output was big and local distribution warmlytaken care of by devoted members.Hence the concept of occulture saw the light of day, as hundreds of TOPY membersdigested and divested arcane lore in new and pop-scientific ways to a DIYgeneration frustrated with lies, blunt propaganda, and mass-market ersatzcommodities. From the glamorous spheres of occultism and counterculture, therenow emerged occulture, containing sharp philosophies, magical technologies,kudos to those who had worked before us—whether in art or magic—and a generalsense of enthusiasm in reveling in the great mystery of life and existence. TOPYmade out-of-print books available in photocopies to members, and forgottenmusics were widely disseminated via cassette tapes. Ditto for forgotten yetinspiring films on VHS cassettes and pirate broadcasts. A lot of previouslyimpossible-to-find things were suddenly made available.This essential theme of availability became bedrock, an essential foundation.Pragmatically appropriating and recontextualizing hidden morsels of subversiveseed (and flowers) soon became a practical method, in which previous levels ofabstraction—not seldom placed there because of the need forself-preservation—became very concrete indeed. It was almost as if the processevolved smoother and faster exponentially—meaning, the more, the merrier.That’s one level of concretization: demystifying old codes, and spelling themout in an attitude of inquisitive analysis—“Can we use this for something?” Thiswas true within TOPY not only in breaking symbolic codes in traditionaloccultism and hermeticism but also in pop-cultural appropriations. An example:Burroughs and Gysin were demigods in the TOPY mythology. Lots of literature wasavailable, but there was more to it. Genesis managed to borrow 16 mm prints ofthe legendary Antony Balch films with Burroughs and Gysin from the 1960s. I thentraveled with these prints and showed them in Berlin and other places atindependent cinemas, thereby not only reverently resonating with our icons, butalso spreading them in a wider, cultural context. I also traveled with a filmprogram called “Visions of Occulture” in 1989, which had Benjamin Christensen’sbeautiful film Häxan (the Witchcraft through the Ages version, narrated byWilliam Burroughs) and some Jodorowsky films. The same was true here:intra-order mythology and pop-cultural expressions in a wider context—and at thesame time.Psychick Release also republished some out-of-print books about runes in Swedishby older scholars. This was relevant to our own availability in terms of thematerial. Rare book and manuscripts appeared, new contacts were made, and manyopportunities arose. This generated a field of dynamic creativity, in whichmany, many synchronicities appeared and greased the machine further.When the first TOPY phase ended something else immediately began. The Internetbegan, and with this a paradigm shift unparalleled in the history of humancivilization. Immediately there emerged a fiction-based subculture calledcyberpunk in which strains of the TOPY inspirations Burroughs, J. G. Ballard,and Philip K. Dick were established even more prominently than during the 1980s,when it was mainly singular key people like P-Orridge and Joy Division singerIan Curtis who brought attention to important instigators like this.A new cyberpunk culture emerged that both feared and loved the Internet.Magazines like the American Mondo 2000 questioned, codified, defined, andredefined culture in Internet times. One prime mover in the shadows was, again,Genesis P-Orridge, who had been exiled to California after the demise of TOPY in1991–92. As a result of those early cyber movements came the successful Matrixfilms, after which followed a massive infusion of general hocus-pocus in filmand in literature: Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Twilight, and so on. Blandmass-market expressions, yes, but still probably very indicative of a world inneed of some serious re-enchantment. Especially if we consider the enormoussuccesses of all these films and franchises.Schematically, the Internet is basically carrying on in a TOPY tradition,whether conscious of it or not: making things available, empowering an exchangeof ideas and thoughts, promoting human development, encouraging pioneeringpiracy rather than stale complacency—perhaps in some ways infringing, but in thehope that some kind of good mutation would happen because of it.A term like occulture is today widely used both within academia and in popwriting. Basically signifying the same thing as when P-Orridge coined the term:the sphere of impact in general society of building blocks or “memes” previouslykept hidden for various reasons and thereby becoming glamorous enough to drawattention to themselves. Occulture is also when a previously occulted behavioralpattern or technique for effecting change in accordance with will is integratedin general society and accepted as reasonable behavior. The past decades’ waveof pop yoga and pop meditation could be seen as examples of this.In 2009, a volume called Thee Psychick Bible was published by Feral House.1[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt9] The first edition also came with a DVD, with aselection of some of the early TOPY films. The book proper contains basicallyall documents and writings that were official TOPY teachings. What wassurprising was not that most of it had matured quite nicely and wasn’t as datedas I think many old-timers had suspected. The most surprising thing was theinterest in the market, so to speak. The first edition sold out, and a paperbackversion has been out since then, selling thousands of copies. This shouldindicate that there’s a respect for the TOPY phenomenon as such and that theideas presented back then are equally valid today—if not even more so.Psychic TV is still around, touring, making music and videos, predominantly as apsychedelic rock group called Psychic TV3. And I’m currently here in Copenhagento show a film based on or inspired by PTV’s seminal 1983 album Dreams LessSweet. I think it was American Apparel that earlier this year released a T-shirtwith the “psychick cross,” a logo trademarked by P-Orridge. That was quicklyremoved. But it’s still interesting that in the psyches of these industrialhipster designers this symbol somehow exists and feeds back something quitesubstantial, regardless of whether they’re conscious of it or not.Another interesting phenomenon today is of course the massive interest bothwithin the art world and academia for predominantly Western esotericism. I’m notsaying TOPY alone can take a bow for this, but, ending twenty-three years ago,there had certainly been a full decade’s worth of bringing out exactly that:artists dealing with topics spiritual, iconoclastic, or both. The recentexhibition of Hilma af Klint’s paintings has so far been seen by over a millonpeople. The Venice Biennale of 2013 was immersed in art and spirituality,displaying not only Jung’s Red Book but also Frieda Harris’s Crowley-designedThoth Tarot paintings. In younger generations of artists, esoteric themesoverflow, and when they backtrack in the more recent history of magic andesoteric art, they will surely find TOPY material or formulated thoughtssomewhere along the line. Occulture abounds.There is presently also a strong resurgence or romanticism when it comes tocottage industries, as in the emergence of a new cassette culture, vital vinyleditions, and fanzine publishing, including anachronistic use of Risographs andvintage Xerox machines. Again, we can’t say that TOPY deserves all the praisefor this movement, because that would simply be too grandiose a statement. Butthe occurrence in itself certainly points nostalgically to a time when there wasa massive and substantial pre-Internet expression of intimate philosophies,forgotten gems, as well as magical and/or marginal art rather than some kind ofsoulless mass-production manifestations."},{"pageContent":"4Over the Moon and Back AgainOriginally published in the Danish magazine Plethora (No. 5, 2016).If your head explodes with dark forebodings tooI’ ll see you on the dark side of the moon.PINK FLOYD, “BRAIN DAMAGE”IT ISN’T EASY BEING HUMAN. Although we live longer and are helped along bytechnology and pharmaceuticals, we have no guarantee for either happiness orunderstanding of ourselves during a lifetime of pressure and stress. Where tolook for guidance and insight? Well, there are basically two ways to go: in andout. Being introspective can certainly bring insights, but most often onlytouching upon the individual sphere. If we instead look outside and far away, wecan see. . . . Yes what, exactly?When the sun sets, we are wrapped in darkness and despair. Space is empty,black, enormous, containing myriad tiny, tiny starlights, and allegedly filledwith devouring black holes, threatening asteroids, and aliens. Although sciencecan explain things we can’t directly perceive with our senses, we are stillsensory driven more than anything else. Always have been, always will be. Whenthe sun rises, the senses are alerted. We can see what’s tangible, beneficial,detrimental, and we can make sober evaluations based on rational processes. Mostof us structure our active lives based on the visibility of the sun and thenretract when it’s no longer visible. One could say this is natural, in the senseof natural for optimal utilitarian use of the waking state.But of course there is light also at night. We usually don’t see it because ofall our own artificial lights. But the fact that it’s actually there providesprimordial comfort. The moon, reflecting the sun that is currently busyelsewhere, has been the true guiding light for humans all along history. Attimes, during full eclipses, we may claim to be fascinated by a phenomenon inthe sky. But in actual fact we’re instinctually terrified.The sun affects us by heat and light in very direct, tangible ways. We take thesun for granted and adapt our lives and cultures around it. The moon, however,affects us by reflected light and magnetic force—quite a different story. Thesun may permit life but the moon regulates it and thereby controls human destinyto a greater and more tangible extent.The reflected light of the moon isn’t brutally revealing but faint, suggestive,ocularly conducive to tricks and impressions of association and fantasy. Thisreflected light is also conducive to beauty in that it lessens contrast andthereby inherent dualisms. This has been well used in our own recent culturethrough the development of photography and cinema, in which lighting techniques(an entire science!) very seldom focus on harsh, direct light but rather onsubtle nuances of reflected light.Because the sun is simply too bright to watch, we have become accustomed towatching the moon instead. We cherish what’s visible and fear what’s invisible.And as we know, anything regular is a comfort to the human mind. In the case ofthe moon, it’s literally so. It’s not just a fairly familiar orb in the sky. Weliterally see the same side of the full moon most every time we watch it. Thefull moon always displays the same side to us as it revolves around its own axisparallel to its revolving around the earth, and that takes just about the sameamount of time. No wonder then we’re as fascinated by the dark side of the moonas we are by the dark side of ourselves.As the human gaze has gradually drifted from the macrocosmic to the microcosmicover the millennia, we have also downsized our capacity for understanding biggercontexts. For the sake of convenient storytelling, symbols in mythology used toconsist of the most powerful and potent forces dressed in human or godly shape.Today, sadly, we’re striving for a brutal demythologizing process throughtechnologies that allow neither longevity nor potent symbolism. Where is themythological moon today?All cultures have revered the moon, most of them as a feminine force in jointventures with the masculine sun. Of course there are exceptions to the rule: theGerman language has the moon as masculine and the sun as feminine, and in manyEskimo stories the moon is a strong masculine force and the sun a warm,life-giving feminine force (not surprising perhaps, if one takes theGreenlandish climate into account!).A key to mythological strength is the use of symbols within the stories told. Nowonder that the sun and the moon have been such strong presences in humanstories that most often retell sexual tales and death-and-rebirth mysteries. Anypantheon worthy of its name contains gods and goddesses attributed to thestronger forces out there in space. Moon goddesses abound. One of the firstoccurrences of moon divinities is actually a male one: the Babylonian god Sin.But from there and on, it’s been mostly goddesses.Speculation about why this is can essentially only remain speculation. The mostpredominant argument is physiological-biological. The cyclic nature of themoon’s presence and visibility has always been easy for humans to interpret(rather than that of, say, Mars or Jupiter). The menstrual cycle of womennormally sticks to a regularity of four weeks, and this fact must have beeneasily observable and transmittable very early on: hence an association thatextended into culture. The ebb and tide of the sea also became attributed(correctly) to lunar forces, and could easily have been extendedassociation-wise to the ebb and flow of menstruation and its ties to(in)valuable new life.The Mediterranean cultures worshiped the moon reverently through its goddesses.The Egyptian Isis, the Greek Selene, the Roman Diana, and so on,cross-fertilized at night over time in mythic minds, and other pagan pantheonsall over the world had already done that, and were/are still doing it. Aega,Aine, Anahita, Andromeda, Anunit, Arianrhod, Artemis, Arawa, Athenesic,Auchimalgen, Benids, Britomartis, Candi, Cerridwen, Chang-O, Coyolxauhqui,Dae-Soon, Gnatoo, Gwaten, Epona, Hanwi, Hecate, Hina Hine, Hina-Ika, Huitaco,Ishtar, Ix Chel, Izanami, Jezanna, Juna, Jyotsna, Komorkis, Kuan Yin, Lasya,Lucina, Luna, Mama Quilla, Mawu, Metzli, Rhiannon, Sadarnuna, Sarpandit,Sefkhet, Sina, Teczistecatl, Trivia, Xochhiquetzal, Yemanja, Yolkai Estsan,Zirna . . . The list may not be endless but it’s extensive enough to show howessential the moon goddess has always been in all insightful cultures. Oneindicative monotheistic demoting we find in the word trivial, stemming from theRoman goddess Trivia, and today indicating something unimportant and irrelevant.Another is the fact that the iconography of the powerful crescent moonassociated with Luna and Diana later on became a symbol of chastity in theVirgin Mary.The sexualization of planets via gods and goddesses is a language and process ofnecessity. If there is no myth circling around outer phenomena that are beyondour control, then despair quickly sets in. If there is no elevation oraugmentation of banal, human toil into divine shape, then ditto. The merging ofthe masculine and feminine principles stemming from the immensely powerfulcosmic forces and filtered through divine idealizations via myth is a safeguardfor the human psyche—one that’s presently and hopefully only temporarily lost.A higher awareness of the human mind itself, and of the necessity of an advancedopen-minded culture, flourished during the (mainly Italian) Renaissance. Art andliterature bloomed, and quite often with inspired strings attached toantiquity’s pantheonic health. Revitalized Neoplatonism catapulted both sciencesand arts into a zone of esoteric open-mindedness and optimism. Add somebook-printing progress to that, and the mythic reinforcement by cosmiciconographies added to the allure of what the Catholic Church had tried in vainto ban: a benevolent bouquet of human qualities rather than a monotheisticterror clutch. The richly detailed symbols of medieval alchemical imageryreintroduced the cosmic elements into human culture, and with that anappreciation of gods and goddesses rather than just one stern patriarchal force.Paintings commissioned or sanctioned by open-minded princely courts couldreintegrate an overt cosmic approach. The setting was usually simple: the sunand the moon affect human life, and we understand the connections via magic,astrology, and tolerance rather than via the Christian iconography of death andtorture. In many ways, the Renaissance was a cultural rebirth made possible bythe cosmic forces themselves, albeit in symbolic form.One of the most beautiful images depicting this cosmic revitalization isCristoforo de Predis’s fifteenth-century masterpiece De Sphaera (Of theSpheres). The section dealing with the moon depicts a beautiful naked womanwithin a concentric orb containing several other circular shapes. The biggestone, a foundation, contains a crab, symbolizing Cancer (the astrological sphereruled over by the moon). Covering the woman’s sex is a lunar figure, serene andmost often associated with the Greek goddess Selene. In her left hand is a torchsymbolizing the dark-moon goddess Hecate, and in her right Diana’s hunting horn.Around her orb we see sky and sea, filled with waves and ships dependent on hervisibility and grace for navigation and keeping time.Thanks to the regularity of the moon’s visibility, we have adapted ourstructuring of time itself around her. Although we now have a larger (solar)365-day calendar, we still live and work in lunar weeks, with four weeks makinga full lunar month, and the first day of every week being the Moon’s Day(Monday, Måndag, Montag, Lundi, etc.).But no matter what, nighttime is the right time. The beauty of nighttimeilluminated by the moon in any of her phases accentuates the feminineconnection. The dispersion of daytime’s contrast and hard shadows allows for amore poetic frame of mind, in which courtship, wooing, secret meetings, eroticpleasures, and so forth, are more likely to take place. All through humanhistory, the moon has been associated with poetry as well as both sexual andromantic love: a swarming and looser mind frame made possible by the cool,suggestive softness of the night sky.The negative aspect of the (mainly) full moon has been mythically captured indifferent cultures in the phenomenon of lycanthropy, that is, werewolves runningwild. In many ways, this is a balance, albeit uncontrolled, to the feminineserenity. Lycanthropy can in many ways be seen as a form of male hysteria, setfree by maximum exposure to the bright feminine light in the darkness, in whichthe primordial beast in the male goes on a rapacious rampage.Other kinds of moon madness also occur in slightly milder forms, and have beenvalidated throughout history in myths and accounts—but also in legislation. TheLunacy Act in England, formulated in 1845, “defined a lunatic as a dementedperson enjoying lucid intervals during the first two phases of the moon, and‘afflicted with a period of fatuity in the period following the full moon.’”1[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt10] Today, we instead apply a sociopsychologicalmodel/matrix to criminal behavior in line with our utilitarian, causal,anthropocentric worldview. But does this imply that the moon no longer affectscriminals (or others)? Of course not.The race to actually, physically, get to the moon is an intriguing piece ofhistory, preceded by thousands of fictional (and thereby mythical) accounts. Asscience fiction culture in pulp magazines, books, and their cinematiccounterparts boomed during the first half of the twentieth century, thegenerations growing up with it all were saturated by their own dreams turnedincentives. Everything begins in fantasy, myth, and fiction, and space travel iscertainly no exception from the rule. However, the actual facts make the mindboggle, jog, and spin like a rocket out of control.Adolf Hitler’s attempts to destroy resistance from the British Isles during thefinal stages of the Second World War saw the development of the V2 rocket (lateron mythologized in Thomas Pynchon’s techno-sexual absurdist drama Gravity’sRainbow). The main engineer behind this powerful rocket-missile was Wernher vonBraun. As soon as the war was over, the formerly pro-Nazi scientists of vonBraun’s team weren’t put on trial but rather safely escorted to the UnitedStates and given top positions to develop their craft further.In 1954, Walt Disney produced three films for his television series Disneyland,all focusing on space travel: Man in Space, Man and the Moon, and Mars andBeyond. The first show was aired in 1955 and was viewed by 100 millionpeople—half of the American population at the time. The consultants andtechnical producers of the show were Wernher von Braun, Heinz Haber, ErnstStuhlinger, and Willy Ley (a rocket aficionado who had actually fled from NaziGermany in 1935. Parallel to developing rocket theories and experiments in theUnited States during the 1940s, he was also an avid science fiction/space travelwriter). One of the 100 million people who watched this episode was Dwight D.Eisenhower, at that time president of the United States. He borrowed a copy ofthe film and showed it at the Pentagon. That in itself became the launch (pardonthe pun) of the American space program, in that it facilitated the developmentof the first ever American satellite—and then some! Government officials wereapparently as fascinated by the mix of rocket science and science fiction aswere many other Americans. And Russians too, of course. This was in the midst ofthe Cold War, and the potential scenario of being able to blast an accursedenemy from space was enthusiastically funded by governments, now that WaltDisney had set the stage together with ex-Nazi scientists.Moon and space myths now quickly became more and more advanced, reflecting theactual goings-on in labs and silos of secrecy. No doubt these were fueledfurther in the 1960s by mass consumption of LSD in younger generations, with theepitomical trip (again, pardon the pun) being Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 sci-fimasterpiece 2001. This film not only takes us into outer space but also intoinner space, and actualizes the dilemma that we today unfortunately exist in:what happens when computers start talking back and controlling us rather thanthe initial vice versa? The visual brilliance of this film led Kubrick,according to himself, into a quagmire of vanity mixed with dread.In July of 1969, the entire world (or at least the parts with access totelevision) sat entranced at images of the first moon landing. The Russianvessel Luna 9 had transmitted photographs from the lunar surface already in1966, and the United States followed suit with Lunar Orbiter 1. This was mainlyto check out the surface: Where would be a good place to actually land? InDecember 1968, the American Apollo 8, a manned spacecraft, reached the moon’sorbit and then returned home. The crew read from the book of Genesis on theirChristmas Eve television special—at the time the most watched television programever.2 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt11] This very likely in anticipation of whatwas to come. On July 20, 1969, new television records were set. A fifth of theworld’s population watched Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on themoon—allegedly walk on the moon, if we listen to Stanley Kubrick.Lunar ecstasy for certain, but the modern myths didn’t end with Armstrong’s“giant leap for mankind.” When Stanley Kubrick died in 1999, he died with asecret he had leaked just a little. According to his own myth, he had been hiredby NASA after the success of 2001 to fake the images being broadcast from thelunar landing. His visual acumen and dramaturgic brilliance apparently created avery convincing moon landing and moon walk. Whether this deception is actuallytrue or not is as unlikely to surface as the truth about 9/11. But in Kubrick’sparanoid mind, there was a discrepancy between leaking and fearing assassinationand keeping silent in deceit. “I perpetrated a huge fraud,” Kubrick revealed ina 1999 interview.3 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt12] And he then insisted theinterviewer not show this material until at least fifteen years after Kubrick’sdeath.Again, the moon had proven an instrumental part of human mythology and the(possible) illusion of progress. Again, the moon had been a reflective surfacespurring on poetic visions of power, regardless if truthful or not. Caspar DavidFriedrich and other German romantic “Sturm und Drangers” used canvas and paintto catch the suggestive power of the moon, setting it into contexts in which thehuman being was always very small; smaller than awe-inspiring life and thecosmos itself. With technology, of rockets and television alike, the perspectivehas changed, making human ingenuity (read: hubris) larger than life—possiblyeven larger than actual truth.The space race has become a phallic striving for triumph—not so much a quest forhuman ideals as a conquest of assets and resources. In many ways, the reflectivesurface of the moon has illuminated a technological lycanthropy in which spaceis the place and the television medium is still the message in itself. Massiveexploitation will take place but the main thing for the common folks will be thevarious reality shows broadcast more or less live from outer space, with themoon as the first network and space-shuttle service station.The moon doesn’t only teach us about our relationship to ourselves in space butalso in time. The very same reflective surface we look at today shone its clearlight on Novalis, Friedrich, Goethe, all the worshipers of moon goddesses,witches in dim groves, lovers in medieval sagas, covert conspirators who changedthe world, on Dion Fortune (Moon Magic), Aleister Crowley (Moonchild), KennethAnger (Rabbit’s Moon), and on the songwriters of “Moon River,” “Blue Moon”,“Harvest Moon,” “Fly Me to the Moon,” “Bad Moon Rising,” and so on.The few cosmic constants we have certainly put things in healthy perspective—ifonly we allow them to. If we don’t, and just take them for granted whiledrifting into artificialities and abstractions, their magic will wane and wewill be ostracized from the ebb and flow of natural processes and cycles. That’sessentially the curse of the human being: not seeing her right place in thetotality, and instead looking for causal shortcuts in petty power struggles. Thewisdom of the moon is obvious: life is cyclical and regular. The early humansrealized this as they learned how to survive by adapting to the cycles of theyear or, in the case of women, to the cycles of the lunar month. The basic factsof life still revolve around lunar forces, whether basic (a human embryo isdeveloped during nine lunar months) or cultural/religious:In 325 CE the Council of Nicaea established that Easter would be held on thefirst Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox.From that point forward, the Easter date depended on the ecclesiasticalapproximation of March 21 for the vernal equinox. Easter is delayed by one weekif the full moon is on Sunday, which decreases the chances of it falling on thesame day as the Jewish Passover. The council’s ruling is contrary to theQuartodecimans, a group of Christians who celebrated Easter on the day of thefull moon, 14 days into the month.4 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt13]These Judeo-Christian rites and celebrations are all remains of earlier pagancustoms, which just goes to show that the awareness of the moon’s presence andpotency was fully integrated in pre-Christian times. Today, it’s a differentstory, with the main reflective light coming from computer and televisionscreens. Contemplating a full moon on a clear night brings out/up things fromthe hidden strata of the soul. An electronic screen can never compete, becauseit’s relying on the content someone else places on that screen. The longer thedistance from the moon (in both time and space) that new generations experience,the less likely it is that the human contemplative ability will remain as such.If a capacity isn’t used and exercised, it will dwindle and die.That said, the moon might then actually be a seemingly passive yet covertly veryactive counterforce to this contemporary negation of life. Women in general,artists, sensitives, and poets throughout history have been highly aware of themoon and its relevance, and have adapted to it in humility and inspiration.Again, the lycanthropic filter needs to be applied. “Moon madness” of varyingdegrees and cultural shapes signifies the inability to handle certain aspects ofthe human psyche: sensitivity, inspiration, nonutilitarian creativity, and soon. The response becomes compensating and “solar-phallic” (as Crowley would termit): aggressive, rapacious, and feral. For the insensitive, the moon becomessomething pallid, useless, and terrifying in its mysteriousness, something yousleep away from in awaiting the return of the sun, which makes everything brightand simple again. It is interesting to note how the myth of the werewolf is alsosoaked in blood. This ferocity and bloodlust, essentially male in essence, incombination with a female shedding of blood presided over by lunar forces andrelating to fertility, would make Sigmund Freud and later psychoanalysts nodtheir heads. Perhaps not in approval of the phenomenon itself but certainly as avalidation of the theory that sex and aggression are two sides of the same coin.Where much has been written about human development and dietary habits in timeswhen vegetarians and carnivores coexisted, and somehow applying a simplifiedmatriarchy-versus-patriarchy filter, I believe that much of the werewolfmythology in relation to the moon simply stems from early human sexual trauma.Even somewhat peaceful vegetarian-agrarian tribes could defend themselves betterin the daytime against ferocious human enemies. But at night, with the serenemoon acting as an existential twilight, it was easier to attack, loot, and rape.The survival instinct is not a static constant. It keeps on developing and istransmitted onward, partly in DNA and partly through mythology, to help futuregenerations survive. The strong association between nighttime, the moon, blood,and sexual assault is not a consciously formulated fear or pleasure to takelightly. It’s ingrained deeply within us.The idea that it is “sinful” to shed the blood that is “life”—retained in thecourse of the transition from the vegetarian to the carnivore—and the beliefthat expiatory rites are required to avert the dangers connected with a practicethat it was never really intended to abandon, since its results had proved soadvantageous to the lupine pack, caused a consciousness of “sin” and a need forapotropaic ceremonies to attach itself even to the effusion of blood resultingfrom sexual intercourse with virgins. These the aggressive pack would, wheneveroccasion offered, kidnap and carry away from among the females of the weakerfruit-gathering tribes so as by this new practice of “exogamy” to avoid theotherwise inevitable, risky fight with the leader of the wolf-pack claiming forhimself the females of the lupine clan.5 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt14]Georgs Méliès’s short but incredibly beautiful film A Trip to the Moon (1902)not only blew minds at the time but is still in many ways emblematic of thehuman perspective: we can conquer the “challenge” by technology and enthusiasm,but we look at the process as a causal adventure more than as an opportunity totruly learn about ourselves. Méliès adapted his story from H. G. Wells’s TheFirst Men in the Moon (1901) and Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon(1865), and turned it into a simple story of naive optimism. In the film, agroup of scientists debate and discuss going to the moon. They build a rocketthat successfully lifts off, travels in space and then hits the man in the moonright in the eye, which serves as an entry point into the moon proper. The crewsuddenly find themselves in a cave filled with mushrooms (not unlikepsilocybin’shrooms), and are taken by force to the moon court by guards more orless dressed up as devilish skeletons. When these guards are attacked, they goup in a cloud of smoke, as theatrical illusions of sorts. It all seemsthreatening enough, and the crew escapes the same way they came: in theirrocket, through space and back to earth.As science fiction progressed parallel to the technical developments thatsuddenly and actually could take us to the moon, the perspective became moredystopian and bleak rather than the opposite (Kubrick’s 2001 is a philosophicalmasterpiece also in this respect). The mythological aspects carry optimism; thereal, a considerably darker hue. If we look at science fiction as the true seedand facilitator of actual space travel, this latter-day dystopian perspectiveshould be regarded as a prophetic warning of sorts. If myth and fiction alwaysprecede real developments, where are all the optimistic sunshine stories ofsuccessful life in space nowadays? Méliès may have displayed a prophecy in moreways than one, albeit in a humorous way. Yes, we can go to the moon (and back)but perhaps it’s after all best instead to look at the moon as a symbol ofdesire and reflective surface rather than think we can “master” it and then haveto face the skeletal cave dwellers of the unknown. Art not only reflects itszeitgeist but also amplifies what is reflected, for better or worse.The artistic reflection and brilliance of the Renaissance painters and medievalalchemical engravers, integrating cosmic wisdom for the sake of illumination viasymbols, is a peak in human culture that we’ll very likely never experienceagain. It is indeed very strange that although we have made such enormousprogress in the fields of science and technology, it seems as most of it isdesigned to facilitate a nonreflective, “easier” lifestyle and the vain hopes ofeither a longer life or life in space. The outer perspective thus takesprecedence. But history shows, as does mythology in general, that the innerroute may be the wiser one. The mere aspect of light seen through the symbolicshould make this clear. The stronger the light (as in solar), the stronger theshadow. This carries with it an inherent dualism that is certainly well-known tothe human psyche but, unfortunately, seemingly difficult to cope with. A faintlunar light decreases the contrast and thereby opens up the mind to innerinsights and deeper feelings than simply “fight or flight.”A reality show is currently being prepared for the journey to Mars. Without adoubt, the ratings will soar when the vessel eventually takes off into space.Ridley Scott’s The Martian (starring Matt Damon) shows the real dilemma in anüber-heroic way: What happens when things go wrong? What breaks downfirst—technology or the human psyche? The Martian is a demagogic example forsimpletons of wishful thinking, or the same kind of naive optimism that Mélièsdisplayed in regard to his moon. The mythological view has been abandoned forhuman hubris yet again, and nothing good will come of that. When things go wrongon that upcoming Martian vessel—and believe me, they will—the ratings of thatreality show will undoubtedly soar even more. Incidentally, it was RidleyScott’s amazingly dystopian Alien (1979) that was marketed with the slogan “Inspace no one can hear you scream”—a prophecy, no doubt, televised or not.As always, we believe what we see, but we need light to see it. Preferably itshould be reflected from an untainted lunar surface on a clear and starry night.That should be quite enough."},{"pageContent":"5Pokémon Go AwayOriginally published in the Norwegian magazine Kunstforum (No. 3, 2016).IN OUR POST-POSTMODERN CULTURE, the definitions of what can be deemed “art” havebecome more and more flexible. Where gradually wider creative phenomena likefashion, design, and architecture have approached and entered the arena ofaccepted art, art’s essence (instigating magical change through aestheticizedpersonal expression, thereby enhancing the experience of life) has become moreand more pushed away by superficialities and mass-market adaptation—no doubtreflecting the overall contemporary culture as a whole.This constitutes a problem, and not only on the level of terminology. Theproblem consists of a demoting of an essential sphere or phenomenon into acommodified area that mainly uses the rational mind to evaluate even aestheticor emotional spheres. To use an example closer to the core question: art is art,but the art world is not art. The rational handling of and trading withsomething stemming from the soul doesn’t make the actual handling or tradingsoulful. But unfortunately this is what has happened, and it’s continuing tode-enchant and demythologize the world as we know it.Art has been the main carrier of human mythologies, which is one reason why itcan be called essential. Without substantial and relevant stories created forinspiration, teaching, reflection, and resonance humans would still just bebase, instinct-driven animals. This mythologizing quality is essentially whatsets us apart from other animals (not forgetting the complex and in this casealmost paradoxical phenomenon of suicide). The meeting of human minds andstories is what defines the very concept of being human.There is also the tricky but ingenious aspect of art as a more general humanendeavor, which is something that has helped our contemporary confusion along.Creative skills have always been used for working in the now through organizedcrafts, which means creating memes that define the now. Fashion, design,architecture, and writing in general have been integrated as parts of active andcreative history writing, and definitely with the potential to tell mythologicalstories in a mosaic kind of way. But it’s only recently that these crafts haveattempted to invade a more substantial mythological arena. Why is this?I would say that technology is to blame, followed closely by greed. A newdefinition or packaging of an old phenomenon helps sell it again. The onslaughtof technology has drained human existence of genuine mythological force. Themassive commercial potential in the smaller, faster, cheaperconstructs/platforms, filled with smaller, faster, cheaper content, inevitablyaffects us all in negative ways. It’s hard to see the big picture on a smallscreen. I’m not in any way implying a conspiracy to dumb down humanintelligence, but unfortunately this is the inevitable result of a process thatreflects a species that has basically negated its libido and reshaped it into afrantic death drive.In his excellent book Creative Mythology–The Masks of God, Joseph Campbell oncelisted four key functions of mythology: 1. The reconciliation of consciousness with the preconditions of its own existence. Handling the often sorrowful realization that human existence is temporal. The creation of an ideal, the “other,” the holy/religious 2. The formulating and rendering of a cosmological image of the universe in keeping with the science of the time and of such a kind that, within its range, all things should be recognized as parts of a single great holy picture 3. The validation and maintaining of some specific social order, authorizing its moral code as a construct beyond criticism or human emendation 4. The psychological angle: shaping individuals to the aims and ideals of their various social groupsIf we look at the contemporary scene with the help of this specific model, andintegrate both what I would call “real” art and the more ephemeral creativecrafts listed above, it’s not a pretty picture. The escapistic longing of peoplefor definitive, holy, authoritarian, religious ideas has created a violentglobal instability, and the mythological expressions are simplified in extremedualisms of good versus bad. The previously helpful cosmological image no longerlooks at the inspiring as well as awe-inspiring grand-scale totality but at theever-smaller particles—an escapist analysis of the intangibly minute onlypossible via technology. Social order is maintained by ever-stricter control,either blatantly dictatorial or via diametrical manipulations (freedom ofexpression more monitored than ever, freedom of movement scrutinized bysurveillance, freedom of thought made ill at ease by the doublespeak ofpolitical correctness).The fourth point is perhaps the most interesting one. Although our Westerncultural sphere officially lauds equality and the nobility of mobility, thetools we use actually stratify more than ever before. Some decades ago, one usedto say that access to computers was a class issue. Today, the opposite istrue—the person who can afford to be out of reach of technology is at the top ofthe existential pyramid. Education via fiction, and this predominantly viatechnology, has created a greater class divide than ever before, as the need fornoncritical human slaves/machine operators increases. And as technology itselfis on its way to reshaping work life (more “free” time for humans means morepossibilities/time to consume and be even more enslaved) we will rapidlyapproach the pivotal moment that science fiction writers have been obsessed withfor centuries: the dreaded power switch when intelligent machines becomesentient and thereby ruled by self-preservation rather than human authority.A recent visit to New York provided much fodder for thought about this for me.This was not only in the usual and quite endearing American way (“Wow, this isthe biggest chocolate chip cookie ever!” uttered a child who received the cookiein question from the waiter when her parents were busy paying for lunch; thecustomer care that goes to any length, even potential diabetes, to ensure a safereturn not home but to the restaurant in question) but rather more of a morosekind. On a busy street corner I saw three boys and one adult man. They were allclutching their cell phones, staring into them and then nervously up at“reality.” “There!” one boy shouted. “No, there!” shouted another. The adultlooked as nervous and giddy as the boys. I realized they were playing PokémonGo, and after an initial fascination, the scene depressed me. Despite thefrenzy, the passivity was so total; their minds so completely immersed in adigital fantasy world alluringly mixed with so-called real-world landscapes. Theinvasion of the private sphere has now apparently gone public. It’s adissolution of human dignity and a fictional entrapment that I fear will not betemporary.When visiting the Museum of Modern Art, I was pleasantly overwhelmed by theexhibitions: a Bruce Conner retrospective, items from Tony Oursler’s trulymagical collections, Nan Goldin’s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency series, and adisplay of Tristan Tzara and Francis Picabia’s DadaGlobe material. It was such agreat display of art at its very best: evocative, intelligent, humorous,beautiful, transcending time, thought-provoking, and more. This visit wasunfortunately balanced out perfectly by one to its sister museum, MoMA PS1.Where MoMA is “modern,” PS1 is “contemporary.” Although I entered with an openmind, the entire experience was intimidating and even more depressing than thePokémon Go gang. It was floor upon floor of soulless displays of mentalconstructs. A lot of the works shown at the time of my visit supposedlycelebrated the origins of the PS1 “concept,” with a focus on 1970s performanceart. In this, the postmodern lingo runs amok in abstractions and explanationsthat shouldn’t really be needed if the art itself packed a mythological punch.But this is the arena not of visionary artists but of curators and collectors,defining spheres that really need no middlemen (or women) at all. It’s a steriledisplay celebrating superficiality and smartness rather than aestheticism andintelligence. Great art should need no externalized context.The displayed photos of Chinese artist Deng Tai nocturnally draped in a red flagare quite beautiful in themselves. But when they become contextualized and, evenworse, politicized, the mythology potential dwindles: “Deng is at once visibleand illegible, bare and costumed, a fugitive body enacting a private theater inwhich he is both performer and audience.” Papo Colo: “The MoMA PS1 presentationcenters around Colo’s Superman 51 (1977), in which he drags a collection offifty-one white pieces of wood behind him, tethered to his body with ropes, ashe runs shirtless down an empty stretch of Manhattan’s West Side Highway untilcollapsing from exhaustion.”Who are these descriptions for? Is it impossible for the works of art to beself-explanatory or communicate via a mythological language that bars that ofthe curators? Images and symbols usually make more sense than clarifications andelaborations. I kept thinking of the psychology of reality shows on TV, where wefirst see what goes on, and then have it explained to us by one or often severalof the participants. It’s a repetition of the already given that makes it hard(if not impossible) to make up your own mind. And perhaps that’s exactly thepoint of these dehumanized and de-enchanted pseudomythologies?Almost as if to humor my prejudices in regard to the scene’s condescendingpredictability, the main exhibition, Vito Acconci’s 1976 Where Are We Now (AndWho Are We Anyway?), is described with accentuations like “Since the mid-’80sthrough the present, Acconci has mixed with a design and architecture studio.”Why am I not surprised that this is stressed? Acconci’s hard work as aperformance artist becomes utterly trivialized as the curators sprinkleevanescent lifestyle terms. That’s what happens when self-serving academicssteal the show, and that’s exactly how essentially great art loses itsmythological punch-packing."},{"pageContent":"6What Remains for the Future?An Initial Attempt at a Comparison between Aleister Crowley and Rudolf SteinerOriginally a lecture delivered at the Lashtal Conference in Gdansk, Poland,2013.LOOKING BACK AT the twentieth century, we can see that it was probably one ofthe most intense centuries ever. Regardless which kinds of glasses we put on towatch our own contemporary history closer, it’s easy to see that the twentiethcentury was phenomenal and revolutionary in many ways.Aleister Crowley claimed that 1904 was an especially pivotal year, as that wasthe year he had authored or “received” his key text, The Book of the Law. Bydeclaring the Law of Thelema and the Aeon of Horus (the child) Crowleypositioned himself as prophet and interpreter through devoting his life andefforts to informing and, hopefully, enlightening others. He was pretty good atit, too. His efforts have actually brought us together here today, which isindeed a magical thing.However, Crowley was far from alone in the participation of this aeonic shift.Several others presented similar ideas: individualism, cosmic altruism, breakingaway from too-rigid cultural and religious structures, an integration ofalternative spiritual methods that had up until the shift been looked upon assuspect and heretical, and so on. On the whole, the zeitgeist included aholistic spirituality that integrated thoughts, ideas, and methods from othercultures, predominantly Asian. Theosophy was one main movement, that stemmingfrom Gurdjieff and his disciples was another.Crowley’s own Herculean labor of giving birth to this new aeon has recently beenwell documented in several biographies, and I think most of us know his storyfairly well: An initial curiosity about all things magical and esoteric, afirsthand experience of philosophical systems and religious approaches throughhis travels, a will to inform and enlighten through his Equinox volumes, inwhich he also divulged the secrets of the previous kings of the hill, theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and then working with the Thelemic orders theAimage [images/img_005.jpg]Aimage [images/img_005.jpg] and the OTO, as well aswriting ambitiously (to say the least).Although plagued by a great number of personal issues and problems, theimpression we get of Crowley is still one of great devotion and self-discipline.Whether Thelema will become a major religion or philosophy in the future we haveyet to see. But if we stick with the human being Crowley for now, we can seethat he is currently about as established as he can be. He is out there, presentin contemporary consciousness, but perhaps more for his fascinating life storythan for Thelema as a philosophy or religious system.Another important interpreter and innovator of the same New Age shift wasAustrian Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925). His Anthroposophy has many similaritieswith Thelema. I’m going to try to point out some similarities, and also somedifferences, in order to shine the light on how it is that these two movementshave both been quite successful but in very different ways and to varyingdegrees.Steiner for a long time contained his own individual enlightenment, which was aresult of thinking, feeling, and willing but also of contacts with a spiritualmaster/teacher earlier on. When the time came for him to eventually blossom,during his successful career within Theosophy, he bloomed with a great appetitefor sharing what he had experienced on the inner planes. He too became good atthat. Theosophy was soon no longer enough for him, and he created his own systemand school, Anthroposophy, just as Crowley had done after the Golden Dawnexperiences and the reception of The Book of the Law. Initially an academicspecializing in Goethe studies, Steiner gradually developed into a very creativepolymath who also had the ability to enthuse people to help him out.Crowley published his ten massive Equinox volumes between 1909 and 1913, underthe banner of Scientific Illuminism and the motto “The method of science, theaim of religion.” Steiner called his method Spiritual Science, and also wroteand lectured intensely to inform the interested. In this sense, both men werevery much alike. Crowley was certainly more of a rebel, but they shared anego-transcending will to improve mankind through the integration of nonrationalphenomena within a contemporary and very rational mind frame, thereby bringingoccult and spiritual ideas from both the outer and inner worlds into contactwith modern society and its empirical standards and critical demands.Essentially, their wisdoms are one and the same: * A human being has the potential to become enlightened and fully individual. One method of achieving this is to trust one’s own intuition and be guided in inner spheres by strata of consciousness previously unacknowledged. * A human being has the potential to set standards for others and inspire them to explore themselves through this process of self-trust. Altruism happens by proxy. * A holistic integration of various human expressions (science, art, culture, religion, etc.) into this overall philosophy will also benefit and further mankind by setting new stages and standards. * A pragmatic synthesis will result from the holistic integration of teachings from different cultural spheres. Examples include the integration of yoga and meditation within a basically Western mind frame (Christianity in Steiner’s case, Qabalistic mysticism in Crowley’s).Basically, we’re seeing a teaching that empowers the individual to see thebigger picture, something that will help others too, either by concrete measuresor by inspiration. Trusting one’s inner experiences and non-rational, esotericprocesses is of vital importance in both cases. These must, however, be testedby empirical research and validated by usefulness in spheres larger than themerely individual. Phenomena that had previously been regarded as hocus-pocus oreven superstitiously as the Devil’s work were now becoming substantial parts ofentire systems of philosophy for normal people from all walks of life.Communicating with angels, elemental entities, astral intelligences, and so on,were suddenly presented as not only matters of fact but also as recommendedpractices for better self-knowledge and development for modern people.Crowley used The Book of the Law and Thelema as springboards for applicationsand implementations on different fields of human behavior and existence butseldom got further than theoretical blueprints. Steiner, on the other hand,networked intensely with people who had both assets and ideas of their own. Forinstance, the collaboration with the altruistic cigarette manufacturer Emil Moltinitiated the first Waldorf school at Molt’s Waldorf-Astoria factory inStuttgart in 1919. Today, there are more than one thousand Waldorf schoolsworldwide. The construction of the first Goethanum building in Dornach(Steiner’s spiritual teaching center) was begun in 1913 but the buildingunfortunately burnt down in 1922. The building of the new Goetheanum, this timeconstructed of concrete, was finished in 1928. Work on biodynamic farming andgardening was also initiated early on, as were clinical, empirical experimentsin Anthroposophic medicine.Crowley’s legacy is basically owed to a handful of individuals who were close tohim at some point quite late in his life. I’m thinking specifically of KarlGermer, Grady McMurtry, Gerald Yorke, John Symonds, and Kenneth Grant. If itweren’t for the diligent archival obsession of Gerald Yorke, for instance, andhis donation to the Warburg Institute at the University of London, invaluableCrowley source material would be lost forever or scattered into the digitalabyss of eBay. If it weren’t for these other men’s exploitation of their ownCrowley association, there would be no substantial Crowley presence today. Thevalue of these few contacts, which were essentially uncontrollable for Crowleyhimself, has of course been enormous. The same is true for the value ofCrowley’s own publishing efforts.Gerald Yorke not only donated his vast collection of information and Crowleyanato the Warburg but also earlier on sent duplicates to Germer in the UnitedStates and Norman Robb in Australia. Despite this enormous foresight andbenevolence, things and papers disappeared along the way, as they tend to do. Itseems that the most important thing to leave behind are actually goodold-fashioned books.Incidentally, the first book ever that stirred Yorke’s interest in thingsesoteric was one of Steiner’s.1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt15]Steiner’s legacy, on the other hand, was carefully strategized by himself whilestill alive. The massive amount of lectures (4,941 lectures are documented, butI don’t know if that’s even possible; he started out fairly late, around theturn of the century within the Theosophical environment, and then hadapproximately twenty-five very active years, which would mean some 200 lecturesper year) opened doors to new environments and a constant flow of new people indifferent countries. If even a fraction of these turned out benevolent, it wasindeed a successful endeavor. The publishing of his ideas was more or lessimmediate through presses that were supportive of the movement. The integrationinto society in the Germanic sphere was of course important and a very logicalextension of several decades of German open-mindedness in various forms ofLebensreform movements. The Third Reich temporarily put everything in hiatus ofcourse, but not so much in neutral Switzerland, where the Goetheanum maintainedits status as the international center of Anthroposophy (which it still is).Steiner integrated a middle path that could but didn’t necessarily “involve apassionate ‘union of opposites’” (quoting Crowley in his description of the“magick of Horus”). However, Steiner was indeed aware of the transformativemagic of diametrics. His own schematic symbol for the ideal human being was astatue he himself carved out of wood, and which today is displayed at theGoetheanum: The Representative of Man: Christ between Lucifer and Ahriman. Thisgnostic Christ principle balances the ungrounded, spiritual loftiness of Luciferwith its ensuing pride and the gross, Malkuthian materialism of Ahriman. Anenlightened being who can balance these very human energies or temptations willhave gained insight by the mere effort. If we allow ourselves somephilosophically speculative slack within the Thelemic pantheon, the statue couldperhaps equally well be called “Ra-Hoor-Khuit between Nuit and Hadit.”Steiner’s progressive attitude to Christianity is without a doubt another reasonwhy Anthroposophy has been able to grow and mature without head-on collisionswith established powerful and intolerant dogmas. Early on Crowley took on apersona projected on him by his Christian fundamentalist mother: “the GreatBeast.” That became an image he himself nurtured throughout his life, and hisantipathy toward all things Christian became one of many controversialtrademarks.However, from the perspective of religious or philosophical studies, Thelema isa decidedly neo-Gnostic system. The incentive for and manifestation ofenlightenment is individual. Steiner intuited and put forth exactly the sameidea. But Steiner’s specific psychological fundament had no need of distancingitself from the religion that had prevailed up until the twentieth century, andnot infrequently through violence and oppression. Steiner analyzed the Christianmysteries and myths thoroughly and regarded in particular the human beingJesus’s Golgothan experience, when he was acting as an enlightened Christ, agnostic master, as the single most influential happening of the past aeon. Thisshould be regarded solely from a magical, transformative perspective though, nota dogmatic Christian one. Steiner and Anthroposophy are more in debt toNeoplatonism, pantheism, the Renaissance thinkers, and Goethe than to any kindof dogmatic Christian church.Interesting to note in regard to Thelema as a cosmology with a strong solarpresence through Ra Hoor Khuit is that the Christ principle in Steiner’smythology is imbued with distinctly solar force filtered through the archangelMichael. The Golgotha experience is, in Steiner’s eyes, not so much anindividual self-sacrifice to redeem other people’s “sins” as it is a conductionof solar energy into the earth.What remains if we look at their main ways of expressing themselves? Both menwere voluminous writers, and basically everything there is has been madeavailable for a hungry market—in Crowley’s case recently but very ambitiously,in Steiner’s case all along for decades. The availability of published worksthese days not only has to do with spreading the words per se but also withincome for the respective organizations. There is a substantial value in bothmen’s writings, and especially now that copyright issues are more complex andfloating than ever. The copyright holders are eager to maintain a presence onthe market. That the books are published in high-quality editions andtranslations secures both revenue and interest.Let’s not forget that both men were also visual artists. Steiner was inspired byGoethe in more ways than one and ambitiously tried to convey his own innervisions in visual form. Steiner’s paintings and sculptures certainly display hiswill both to communicate a higher system of aesthetics according to Goethe’sguidelines, and to have them used for instructional purposes. The mainauditorium of the Goetheanum is an impressive, almost incredible, display ofthis Gesamt (total) vision, in which architecture, stained-glass images, muralpaintings, light, and acoustics work together to tell a story, teach, andinspire. There are several books focusing on Steiner’s visual art availabletoday.For Steiner, the use of art was ultimately pedagogic and magically strategic:“Beauty is not the divine in a cloak of physical reality; no, it is physicalreality in a cloak that is divine. The artist does not bring the divine on tothe earth by letting it flow into the world; he raises the world into the sphereof the divine. Beauty is semblance because it conjures before our senses areality which, as such, appears as an ideal world.”2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt16]Crowley’s paintings, drawings, and the Abbey of Thelema murals at Cefalu werealso creative externalizations, although considerably rougher in execution, andthere seems to have been no other plan in painting them than simply to paint.Crowley’s visual works exist today in private collections, and once in a while,these are exhibited (London 1998, Paris 2008, Australia 2012). A substantialmonograph of Crowley as an artist has yet to be published.Both Steiner and Crowley were extroverts, but for different reasons. Steiner wasa distinct Apollonian character by Nietzsche’s defintion, and Crowley very mucha Dionysian one. Crowley wrote well but was inept at handling people notimmediately of use to him. Steiner was not the best writer but could deliverinspiring lectures. Crowley was lucky to have a few intelligent people aroundwhen he was about to die. And, not forgetting, Crowley’s publishing efforts haveindeed been talismanically successful. Steiner was more of a structured Germanicmind and basically worked himself to death to secure the immortality ofAnthroposophy. His bouquet is considerably larger than Crowley’s, and we are allmore or less exposed to it when we eat organically produced foods, for instance,or send our kids to Waldorf schools, or use Weleda products. The pioneeringresearch in Steiner’s Spiritual Science has definitely made an impact oncontemporary culture far more than Crowley’s Scientific Illuminism. At least sofar.If one wanted to be a little bit mean-spirited, one could present two parallelimages under the umbrella of spiritual centers of the 1920s. One would be arun-down farmhouse in a Sicilian fishing village, its walls painted with obscenepoetry and impressionistic demons; the other would be an architecturallyadvanced and radical building in the Swiss countryside, designed to transmit thespirit of Goethe into the cosmos.However, it’s totally unfair to measure these concepts or systems in terms ofquantity and visibility. Crowley’s system, after all, is either highly personaland secretive (Aimage [images/img_005.jpg]Aimage [images/img_005.jpg]) orintrafraternal (OTO). The Thelemic environment is more of a private sphere, inwhich a spiritual, magical attainment is encouraged. Whether that is of any useor interest to anyone else is not relevant unless stated so by the adept inquestion.While on the subject of the OTO, I think I should mention too that Steiner metthe head of the order at the time, Theodor Reuss, in 1906 in Switzerland—ameeting arranged by leading Theosophist Annie Besant. This was the pre-ThelemaOTO of course. These gentlemen found enough common ground to stand on thatSteiner became head of an OTO lodge called Mysteria Mystica. Steiner wascurious, as he had been about Theosophy, and also sought new environments inwhich to develop himself as a spiritual teacher. His engagement with OTO phasedout quite quickly though. Reuss, Hartmann, and the other early OTO protagonistshad a somewhat strange reputation because it was more or less known, even backthen, that OTO worked with esoteric tantric sexual rituals in the higherdegrees. Perhaps this became too much for Steiner, who was more or lesscelibate. Anyway, six years later Reuss knocked on Crowley’s door, and the rest,as they say, is history. And another reason why we are gathered here today.At Christmas 1923, Steiner announced to his followers that a new and moreambitious organization, the General Anthroposophical Society, had been set upand that from now on, the publishing of all his lectures was officiallysanctioned. Both these developments allowed for a much smoother, and much morepublic life for the philosophy itself and its many creative offshoots. He alsoannounced a College for Spiritual Science that would teach advancedAnthroposophy at the Goetheanum in Dornach and other places. The name alonemakes me think of Aimage [images/img_005.jpg]Aimage [images/img_005.jpg] as a“College of Scientific Illuminism.” There was apparently something in the airthat allowed for these teaching structures to manifest on similar lines,regardless of whether they were public or highly secretive.As the old Anthroposophical Society gave way for this new and better-organizedone, Steiner personally issued and signed membership cards for all the oldmembers—twelve thousand of them! And the first big thing to deal with was therebuilding of the Goetheanum, a large-scale process that actually continued interms of final decorations well up until the 1990s.The word general is perhaps a magical clue to the success of Anthropsophy afterSteiner’s death and, of course, especially after the Second World War. Steiner’salmost Taoist approach to merge with and augment, improve, develop, and neverclash with or use force, allowed for an easy integration into a general mindframe of general society. Sure, some of the ideas of Atlantean civilizations,reincarnation, cosmic farming, eurythmic healing, and so forth, may still behard to grasp for most people, but no one can deny the common sense of eatingbiodynamically or at least organically grown food, or the well-documentedsuccess of the Waldorf education system, or the Camphill environments forindividuals with learning disorders, and so on.Crowley’s attitude was almost diametrical to this: “The key to joy isdisobedience.” We can never find out if this was willed or if he was making avirtue out of necessity. But I suspect that his drug addiction was the biggestreal demon in his life. Not only because of the related financial and physicalstrains, but because of the will aspect. Although I’m sure he did want to getrid of the addiction, he simply couldn’t. We can rationalize and say that justmakes him all the more human, sure, but for the Great Beast himself, I believethe persona as the agent provocateur of a new era defined by will was ratherunwillingly upheld, and that he would much rather have been someone considerablymore welcome in the upper echelons of British society. Crowley’s head-onhedonism facilitated a media image that in many ways still lingers on, and it isfar from useful to Thelema as a general philosophy that has the potential totransform individual lives, with or without the technology of magic.It is highly interesting to compare these systems that are so alike in many waysbut also so very marked by their creators and their specific psychologicaltraits. And they were both aware of it, for good and bad, and of what laybehind. In both systems, the concepts of karma and reincarnation are present,and both men encouraged their adepts to research previous lives on the innerplanes, as they had done themselves. If this research wasn’t done properly, onewould perhaps have to make similar mistakes over again.Steiner was unusually clear when he wrote of these principles: “Through memory,the soul preserves yesterday; through action, it prepares tomorrow.” And: “As aspiritual being, I must be the repetition of one whose biography can explainmine.” And: “I must connect to what I did yesterday if my life is to have orderand continuity. Yesterday’s actions have become the conditions that regulatewhat I do today. Through my actions yesterday, I created my destiny for today.”3[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt17]There is in this integration of karma also an accentuation of the holistic.Despite the fact that we are individuals, and we can only really develop on theindividual level by gradual refinement, what we do also affects others, and viceversa. These were thoughts that had been around for a long time, even in Europe.John Donne, the seventeenth-century British poet described it well severalhundred years before Theosophy: “No man is an island entire of itself; every manis a piece of the continent, a part of the main. . . . Any man’s deathdiminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send toknow for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”4[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt18]Perhaps Donne is a good example in this case, as he too was in between faiths,so to speak. Having been born a Catholic in England, Donne and his family hadbeen exposed to intolerant harassment and even religious murder. When heeventually became a Protestant within the Church of England, he was suddenlylauded and could speak and write freely about almost anything he wished,including the need for tolerance and open-mindedness. It is in a way as ifrestraint brings an inherent desire for freedom. How this expresses itself hasto do mainly with the ego of the person expressing it. Donne was an intelligentopportunist who worked the system to his own benefit. That has benefited us too,as his works and ideas were allowed to remain and survive.Crowley formulated instructions for the Aimage [images/img_005.jpg]Aimage[images/img_005.jpg] concerning knowledge of previous incarnations, as that wasthought to be essential for magical development. In “Liber 913, Thisharb,” heconstructed a method for the mind to work backward in order to strengthen theindividual memory to the level of transcending the present incarnation: “Memoryis essential to the individual consciousness; otherwise the mind were but ablank sheet on which shadows are cast. But we see that not only does the mindretain impressions, but that it is so constituted that its tendency is to retainsome more excellently than others.”5 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt19]What remains if we look at other people’s memories of these gentlemen? InCrowley’s case it depends exclusively on the vantage point of the firsthandwriter in question. If Crowley was good to the writer, then the recollection isgood. If Crowley was bad or perceived as bad to the writer, then therecollection is bad. A prime example of subjective history writing, andsomething that was amplified by the fact that he was so infamous as a publicfigure in the United Kingdom.It is as if the impressions of the man Crowley are so predominant that more orless objective analyses of his work from his own time are nonexistent. His owndescriptions are literally hagiographic (as in his own Confessions), and thoseof, say Fuller or Achad, could easily be seen as hagiographic by proxy. It ismainly during the most recent decades that real Crowley biographies have beenwritten, and these have indeed been very ambitious and well-researchedprojects.*3 [9781620557044_ftn.xhtml#ft3]In Steiner’s case, it is almost as if the person Rudolf Steiner didn’t exist.There is, of course, a great deal of hagiographic subjectivity in his case too,but that certainly doesn’t stem from himself. He did write an autobiography atthe request of his followers, but it is very low-key and basically achronological recounting of meetings and projects. And, lest we forget, hedidn’t have the time to finish his own proper biography. It only goes as far as1907, and that was in many ways when things started to become really interestingin his life. So we are left with other people’s accounts of his life, and mostlyof the yea-saying variety.As we can see, there are many similarities between the teachings. Crowley waspredominantly interested in the technology of magic and in refining and handlingthe philosophy of The Book of the Law. Steiner was a magnificent visionary whoalso worked hard at trying the resulting ideas out and making them useful forothers. These gentlemen had similar goals but were very different in individualbehavior and attitudes. Perhaps we can allow ourselves to regard them as twoaspects of the very same phenomenon or entity, like a Horus and Set, a Luciferand Ahriman, a Christ and a Great Beast, where each facilitates a united dynamicenergy in which a human individual can have an uncensored look at him- orherself. This is undoubtedly a fascinating area of study and speculation thatrequires a lot more research and one that will be, I suspect, revealing andrewarding for both these cosmic philosophies of life."},{"pageContent":"7Paul BowlesExpat MagicOriginally a lecture delivered at the Here to Go symposium in Trondheim, Norway,2014.ONE WONDERS WHAT makes certain people appear at the correct time-spaceintersections to make a maximum impact. It doesn’t need to be loudmouthedenfants terribles forcing their way, nor fey, evanescent, and misunderstoodgeniuses generating emotional vacuums for others to fill. Some artists simplyleave a trail of very tangible history behind them. And they attract bothinteresting people and events as they go.It seems that conscious strategy is actually quite counterproductive in thissense. If you push too hard in the moment, you will be stuck there. You justneed to be, and preferably be yourself, in the flow of things, in between eventsand key people. That in itself creates a resonant life rhythm, in which thebeats are expressions and the syncopations the creative processes.One such very rhythmically conscious figure in twentieth-century Western culturewas the American author Paul Bowles (1910–99). His stern and elegant proseusually focuses on how people from one environment react in another. Bowlesshould have known, and did know about this, being a seasoned traveler andso-called expat for the greater part of his life. For him, being away from theUnited States was not merely escapism in order to find a nice secluded place towork. The place in itself—in his case predominantly Tangier in Morocco—soonbecame integrated not only in his writing but also in his general state of mind.Initially Bowles’s first love was music. He wanted to become a serious composerand worked hard to achieve that. He studied with Aaron Copland and traveled toEurope with him in the early 1930s, wrote music, and also had it performedsuccessfully. He was at one point accepted by Prokofjev as a student but was toorestless to pursue the invitation. Bowles wanted to be on his way, withoutreally knowing what that way or journey would bring.Bowles was in Paris in the midst of surrealism’s glory days and was mentored bylegendary art patron and collector Gertude Stein. It was actually Stein whosuggested Bowles should go to Morocco in the first place, which he did, in 1931.Shortly before this he spent time in Berlin, where he also left his mark in hisfriendship with Christopher Isherwood. Remember Sally Bowles in Farewell toBerlin or its classic movie musical adaption, Cabaret? She was named after PaulBowles.He wrote music criticism for the New York Herald Tribune during the 1940s. Theeditor Virgil Thomson’s strict orders were to describe what happened during theconcert, not to relay one’s own feelings: be sparse, economic, detached, butalways eloquent. This clear and concise mode of expression spilled over intoBowles’s novels and short stories.He married another author, Jane Auer, and the couple became some kind of centerof attention wherever they went. She was celebrated for her novel Two SeriousLadies (1943), and Bowles’s reputation as a cultured composer and writer ofreviews opened many doors in a postwar American environment ready forexperimentation of all kinds.The Bowleses traveled in Asia (where they even bought a small island outside SriLanka and then spent several months per year there), Central and South America,and Europe, but once they had established themselves somewhat in Tangier, itseemed impossible to leave. It was a cheap place to live, and its strategicposition as an international free-trade zone brought interesting people, drugs,and sexualities. Under the surface it was indeed a liberal place. That is, ifyou were a Westerner with money to spend. Noël Coward once called the city “asunny place for shady people.”Of course, the Bowleses were not alone here. Fellow expats with somewhat similarbackgrounds were Brion Gysin, a close friend of Bowles’s (they had met alreadyin 1938 in Paris), and William Burroughs. Although these two beat mentors havecontributed immensely to the glamour of Morocco, it was always Paul and JaneBowles who were the real royalty. They weren’t beat at all, but rather aloof yetwelcoming to this newer generation of Ginsbergs, Kerouacs, and others. WilliamBurroughs’s paranoid “Interzone” environment was a drug-filtered version of1950s and’60s expat Tangier. Tennessee Williams, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote,Cecil Beaton, Francis Bacon, and many other gay culturati flocked to the liberalcity they had all heard so much about. And Paul Bowles was undoubtedly king ofthe hill.Bowles’s presence was actually the reason for Burroughs’s coming to Tangier inthe first place.1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt20] Burroughs often called Bowles’sfirst novel, The Sheltering Sky, a “perfect” novel. When Burroughs originallyarrived, though, Bowles was out of town, which made Burroughs critical andmoody: “And don’t ever fall for this inscrutable oriental shit like Bowles putsdown (that shameless faker). They are just a gabby, gossipy simple-minded, lazycrew of citizens.”2 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt21] It took time before these twoexpats really met, and even then, it was slightly troublesome. Burroughs hadborrowed a bound original script of Tennessee Williams’s The Angel in the Alcovefrom Bowles. When he returned it, it was splattered with blood from Burroughs’sshooting up heroin beside the manuscript.3 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt22]Eventually, though, a friendship grew.As the decades passed, Bowles became an icon of sorts, someone you sought out inMorocco if you were a budding writer or artist. Knowing Bowles opened doors,although he himself just existed in the here and now and never really networkedactively in the way we think about it today. There seems to have existed somekind of aura around him and his work that attracted similar minds or at leastwannabe similar minds looking for adventure, allowing the imagination to bloom,seeing other parts of the world, getting high and getting away.Bowles continued writing until his death in 1999, always in the same style andusually on the same themes. After Black Sparrow Press anthologized his shortstories in 1979 (a volume that was introduced by Gore Vidal), a new interest inhis work emerged. Bernardo Bertolucci made a successful movie of The ShelteringSky in 1990 with John Malkovich and Debra Winger, which brought new generationsto Bowles’s work.As mentioned, Bowles died in 1999 and seemed not too distraught about moving on.On the whole, all through his life he seems to have been permeated by a realsense of detachment, a désinvolture not unlike that of German author ErnstJünger. He was diligent in his writing and made very sure life swirled aroundthe work, not the other way around.There’s no escaping that Bowles’s work has one underlying theme: gettingaway—either getting away from somewhere or to somewhere, but also getting awaywith things that are immoral or downright criminal. There is no sense oftraditional justice in his stories, and there isn’t really any kind ofdeep-seated moral code involved. There’s a pragmatism about life, a sense ofseeing what is possible. I believe this was very much influenced by Moroccanculture in Bowles’s case.Expat is short for ex patria: “outside the fatherland or nation.” This was ofcourse true for Bowles. But it can also mean outside the sphere of the father,and this was equally important, consciously or not. Bowles hated his father and,as he often expressed, couldn’t wait to get away. The young Bowles wasn’tallowed to see other children, and his compensatory and creative mind startedreading and writing and making up fantasy worlds, complete with maps anddirections. Quite often, his father literally destroyed these fantasy worlds ofthe confused boy.The imprint to rebel against authority and to be optimally free in mind and bodywas there already from the start. Music became the initial door opener for theyoung Bowles, and the 1920s in general was filled with a “Gershwinian” attitudeof experimentation, mixing classical structures with jazz and other experimentalapproaches. It’s no wonder that Bowles was attracted to this new wave of music:cosmopolitan, urban, free-spirited, open-minded, and playful. Clashing orcontrasting elements temporarily set aside normal conventions and apprehensions,which in turn opened up the mind even more.Although Bowles was never a literary experimentalist in the same way as he waswith music, the themes and environments bring out the same elements. There’s theknown and unknown, the right and the wrong, the expected and the unexpected,always in dynamic relationship. But the prose is most often clear and conciseand decidedly unemotional. Is that perhaps why it works so well in regard todescribing the protagonists’ often quite irrational behavior?Paul Bowles was an expat magician not only in the sense of being an American ina different world. He also used elements of contrasting mind frames:Western/Eastern, Christian/Muslim, male/female, sober/stoned, and so on. Andthese were often placed in environments where you either have to adapt orperish, no matter how confusing the experience. He further tricked his ownrational mind and its entrapments by being more or less constantly stoned oncannabis. Never zonked out of his mind but just enough to allow for a creativeauthorship to take charge of stifling “paternal” rationalism. So in many ways hesought out a creative liberation in mind and body, and this was also allowed toleak into his writings thematically and in terms of settings.I have been touching upon “expat magic” as a process, a euphemism of sorts for awriter’s need to displace him- or herself in the physical, outer world. Butthere’s also something very much more tangible in Bowles’s case, and that is hisinterest in the rituals and customs of the North African tribes, so differentboth in comparsion with “dark” Africa and Arab culture. The Maghrebi culture was(and perhaps still is) steeped in magic, curses, spells, rituals, talismans.Bowles first arrived at a time when the postcolonial attitudes among the localstried their best to erase all magic. No such luck.Bowles wrote about this everyday magic in many of his stories, and his ambitiousproject in 1959 of traveling around in Morocco to record tribal music andrituals is well documented and extremely fascinating.*4[9781620557044_ftn.xhtml#ft4]Always without formulating the concept, I had based my sense of being in theworld partly on an unreasoned conviction that certain areas of the earth’ssurface contained more magic than others. Had anyone asked me what I meant bymagic, I would probably have defined the word by calling it a secret connectionbetween the world of nature and the consciousness of man, a hidden but directpassage which bypassed the mind.4 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt23]One important function of art is creating a sense of “displacement”: the moreapart and displacing, the greater the effect. A negative reaction to, forinstance, abstract art simply means fear of one’s own personal displacement ingeneral. To be a part of expat magic one needs to immerse oneself in somethingelse, something different, the other, the unexpected. Just being in that stateof mind creates synchronistically conducive effects. Placing a fictional story in a different environment than one the reader knowscreates a displacement, a suspension both of belief and disbelief, a settingfree of the reader’s mind. Placing yourself in a different environment whilecreating a work of fiction or art amplifies that process and feeds back. This isespecially valid or potent when you blur or disintegrate the boundaries betweenthe concepts of tourist and traveler (something Bowles wrote about and definedseveral times). The tourist takes in but returns. Everything will return to thecasual balance of home. But the traveler goes on and never allows that return.This creates a more or less constant mind frame of displacement, one that canbring out entirely new ideas and emotions in the creative process, regardless ofwhether the ideas or emotions have to do with the specific geographical place ornot. “The tourist accepts his own civilization without question; not so thetraveler, who compares it with the others, and rejects those elements he findsnot to his liking.”5 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt24] A wise platitude oftenexpressed among travelers is the one where it’s “good to have a goal butessentially it doesn’t matter because in the end it’s the journey itself thatmatters.” It’s not the dreamed of or dreamed up Holy Grail that will reveal themagical secrets but rather the determined quest to find it.Of course this is not a prerequisite to make great art, or great magic. Butthere’s something to be said of the willingness to expose oneself to the outerworld, firsthand. The magician’s magician of the twentieth century, AleisterCrowley, traveled extensively throughout his life, to learn about religions,philosophies, and magical practices firsthand. His output would not have beenthe same had he been stuck at his desk in Cambridge or London. He was a de factoexpat meta-magician.Both Crowley and Bowles had an uncanny ability to be at the most exciting rightplaces at the right time, in terms of meeting interesting people. They were bothin Berlin in 1931, for instance, Bowles to study musical composition with AaronCopland and others, and Crowley to try to reboot Mandrake Press and exhibit hispaintings. Bowles found Berlin to be mostly a “gigantic slum, a monstruousagglomeration of uninhabitable builidings,”6 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt25] andalso filled with swastikas. His most rewarding experience there was thefriendship he had struck up with English author and fellow expat magicianChristopher Isherwood.At a dinner in London in 1949, Bowles met another British expat, SomersetMaugham. He was by far the most successful international author on the scene(meaning: gay, internationally inclined, and very productive/successful).Although Bowles, in his 1972 autobiography, Without Stopping, focuses mostly onthe fact that Maugham had very small feet, he also mentions that he helped mapout a five-week Moroccan trip for the mighty Maugham. Considering how distinctand well-known Maugham was in his role or character, and how successfully so, hemust have made an impact on the literarily budding Bowles.In 1938, Maugham published a slim volume called Summing Up, filled with thoughtsabout writers and writing:It has been said that good prose should resemble the conversation of a well-bredman. Conversation is only possible when men’s minds are free from pressinganxieties. Their lives must be reasonably secure and they must have no graveconcern about their souls. They must attach importance to the refinements ofcivilization. They must value courtesy, they must pay attention to their persons(and have we not also been told that good prose should be like the clothes of awell-dressed man, appropriate but unobtrusive?), they must fear to bore, theymust be neither flippant nor solemn, but always apt; and they must look upon“enthusiasm” with a critical glance.7 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt26]If this doesn’t sound like a perfect modus operandi or program for Paul Bowlesas an author, I don’t know what would. And there are other sections in Maugham’slittle gem of a book that could perfectly sum up Bowles “after the fact,” almostprophetically:The solipsist believes only in himself and his experience. He creates the worldas a theatre of his activity, and the world he creates consists of himself andhis thoughts and feelings; and beyond that nothing has being. . . . Life is adream in which he creates the objects that come before him, a coherent andconsistent dream, and when he ceases to dream, the world, with its beauty, itspain and sorrow and unimaginable variety, ceases to be.8[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt27]Well, Maugham would know. He was a prime example of an expat magician, allowingthe Asian South Seas to drag him along into very deep recesses of the human mindand its social Darwinist twists and turns, and not unlike yet another expat(British-Polish) before him, Joseph Conrad. I can see a distinct heritage fromboth Maugham and Conrad in Bowles’s work and general attitude.In 1950 Bowles and Brion Gysin went together to Tangier. Bowles was now suddenlyan international star because of the success of The Sheltering Sky, but Gysinwas depressed and confused at the time. He had tried writing about Morocco insimilar ways but never managed to have anything published. Gysin: “Much asMalaysia belongs to Maugham, Bowles’s Morocco is his own. I went back topainting.”9 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt28]The Sheltering Sky in many ways set the stage for the coming phase of Bowles’slife. Although the American protagonist in the novel actually dies in Morocco(whereupon his wife seeks solace and comfort in other arms and other limbs), afitting description of or term for Mr. and Mrs. Bowles’s life in Morocco wouldbe succumbing. They sucumbed to the culture, music, kif, lovers (men for Paul,women for Jane) but only so far as they could retain the diametrical energy. Ifyou don’t, according to my own analysis of Bowlesian logic, you succumb untilyou simply die and perish. You need to retain the charge by maintaining bothpoles.Another aspect of this lies in Bowles’s portrayal of Moroccan and also Arabculture. Today, it is a complete faux pas to describe different cultures from apoint of view that contains your own value judgments—especially when derogatory.Paul Bowles couldn’t care less—perhaps a sign of the times. In his classictravel writings anthologized in Their Heads Are Green and Their Hands Are Blue(1963) there are remarkable stories and descriptions that are not politicallycorrect by today’s standards but they are incredibly vibrant with life, humor,and spirit. Perhaps it’s necessary to be somehwat personal to describe somethingin a convincing manner? Is there even such a thing as objective history writing?I suspect that Paul Bowles’s description of environments and characters areactually more telling and revealing than any kind of social-anthropologicalstudy based in statistics-filtered objectivity. His writings truly take youthere, wherever there is.Bowles’s quite conservative appearance and fear of dirt must also have beeninstrumental in augmenting this dynamic of in-betweenness and tension. Why elsewould this experienced traveler almost always choose destinations sodiametrically unlike himself? “I relish the idea that in the night, all aroundme in my sleep, sorcery is burrowing its invisible tunnels in every direction,from thousands of senders to thousands of unsuspecting recipients. Spells arebeing cast, poison is running its course; souls are being dispossessed ofparasitic pseudo-consciousness that lurk in the unguarded recess of the mind.”10[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt29]Relevant to this phenomenon is the short story “The Wind at Beni Midar,”originally published in 1962. The protagonist is a young soldier who activelydislikes the rituals and trance dances of the djinn-possessed local people, inwhich ecstatic bloodletting occurs. One day, while out looking for small game toshoot, he’s so high on kif that he misplaces the gun he’s borrowed and returnswith a bad conscience. The owner of the gun actually finds it in the countrysidebut decides to pull a prank on his guilt-ridden friend. He hides the gun in hisroom, and then insists the kif-smoking protagonist ask a djinn to return thegun. Reluctantly he succumbs to this scheme and the gun is “miraculously” foundin the room. There is a double humiliation in that he is mocked after this, fornot understanding it was all a joke. The anger he feels makes him go to a localwitch, who prepares a poison. The humiliating soldier dies, and the protagonistfeels some kind of justice has been done.The story is permeated by this kind of highly ambivalent attitude toward magicand folk customs, most of which predate Islam. In a way it’s symptomatic ofBowles’s own attitude but also in general of Morocco’s, post colonialism. Apragmatic use of magic occurs whether one likes it or not. No matter howrational and “modern” one is, there is always the underlying fear that someonemight actually have cursed you!One could also extend the Moroccan view of the djinn to the way Bowlesconstructed his stories. The dramatis personae are like spirits he evokes tomove destiny onward, each with his or her own function but seldom endowed withany deeper aspects of will or emotion.I’m not interested in characters when writing books. The characters—the actionsI want were decided for them before they existed. For a given situation I needcharacters who will react the way I want them to react in that situation. . . .A character is what he does. I never have any idea what the character lookslike, if he is tall or short, fat or thin. A character speaks and acts. That isthe person. Apart from that he doesn’t exist.11 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt30]Later on in his life, Bowles had seemingly become more rigid in his attitudes.Perhaps the gradual Westernization of Tangier and Morocco in general hadaffected his younger years’ open-minded amazement and made him more prone torational analysis. In the final documentary film about his life, Let It ComeDown, he says things like “It’s absurd that there should be supernatural powers,it’s a rather mad concept”; and “Being in love is extremely abnormal”; and “Themeaning of life is inevitable death.”12 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt31] Thissounds more like crude existentialism than someone caught in an exotic andcreative in-betweenness. Perhaps the maps of the outer world that he was sofascinated by as a youth gradually faded, and the travels that had broadened hismind for decades were now but memories to be sorted out? What seemed left wasonly the stripped and quite often problematic relationships between humanindividuals, albeit situated in exotic locations.For all his colorful expat magic and his desire to stay detached, Bowles didreturn home eventually, literally and symbolically. Not only in the form of hisashes coming back to the family plot in the United States, but also in a morerational and intellectual approach to what he had once sought out. He was aprivileged and esteemed artist, neither beatnik nor bestseller, whose integritywas perhaps too solidly based in his detached stance vis-à-vis American moralswith regard to, for instance, homosexuality and the use of drugs. Paradoxically(or not) his active detachment contained an equally active attachment to hisformative years as a boy: a boy who wasn’t allowed to play with other children,who could read and write at age four, who loved maps, wrote violent stories,hated his father, and couldn’t wait to get away. He succeeded in great style onall accounts, so perhaps it was only natural that the final resting place wouldbe exactly where the journey began. A full circle. A full stop."},{"pageContent":"8Tangible EvanescenceOriginally published in the anthologyBooklore—A Passion for Books(edited by Alcebiades Diniz Miguel & Jonas Ploeger, Düsseldorf, Zagava, 2016).It is a remarkable thing when books call out your name from the shelf. If you’veread a book once, shouldn’t that be enough? The experience is already there inyour mind, evoking specific stories, characters, styles, and so on. But someworks of literature keep on beckoning and calling, and you return to them to beamazed yet again. This is, I guess, what constitutes the character of a favoritebook: one you simply have to return to, over and over again, without reallyconsciously knowing why.I have several of these titles on my shelves. But two volumes that always beckonloudly and to which I do occasionally return are Ernst Jünger’s On the MarbleCliffs and Yukio Mishima’s Sun and Steel. They are both slim volumes, yet tightand packed with both content and styles that are uniquely those of the authors.Between them, they contain so many similarities that I simply have to look atthem in this particular context as one. Perhaps not as one book, but certainlyas one experience. And so we begin by asking the question: Why?Jünger’s On the Marble Cliffs is a short tale about unrest and turmoil betweenopposing forces: one being traditional, rural, nature-inspired, andlife-affirming, and the other being oppressive, violent, power soaked, andvaguely political. The protagonist, a former soldier, leads an almost monasticlife in the service of a poetic approach to the natural sciences. The outercircumstances, with an approaching war and upheaval of order, seep into thisharmony where he and his companion enthusiastically analyze and catalog theflora of the region:Soon we felt our energies increasing, and a new sureness possessed us. The wordis both king and magician. Our high example we found in Linnæus, who went outinto the unruly world of plants and animals with the word as his sceptre ofstate. And more wonderful than any sword-won empire, his power extends over theflowering fields and nameless insect hosts.1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt32]Mishima’s Sun and Steel is not a novel at all but rather a coherent anthology ofpensées concerning the relationship between word and body. The author meandersintellectually about his own history and how he felt pressured to find a betterbalance between his intellectual side and his bodily one. This is basicallyfiltered through a highly romanticized death wish stemming from early eroticimprints radiating from images of the pierced Saint Sebastian:Nothing gives the armed forces so much attraction as the fact that even the mosttrivial duty is ultimately an emanation of something far loftier and moreglorious, and is linked, somewhere, with the idea of death. The man of letters,on the other hand, must scratch together his own glory from the rubbish withinhimself, already overfamiliar in every detail, and refurbish it for the publiceye.2 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt33]The similarities thematically are obvious. There is, in both books, an awarenessof temporal finality that is accepted as a fundament of existence. In Jünger’scase, his attitude as a historian of sorts makes his characters go through themotions of resistance (although seemingly futile) simply because that’s the waylife works, and the only redeeming possibility is one of noble and elevatedbehavior. This in no way indicates moralism or religious fervor, though. It’ssimply a way of helping ideas and ideals to survive beyond the cataclysms thatare already apparent and approaching.Mishima is also, like Jünger, at war with the outside world. Postwar Japan andits rapid infusion of both Western capital and culture (and its ensuingdecadence) made the budding writer a conservative force to be reckoned with.First as a writer and then gradually within his own little military society,which had sworn to be at the service of the recently emasculated emperor. In theintense training of his own body, Mishima not only prepared for new levels ofawareness as a writer but also ultimately for his own suicide in 1970 (Sun andSteel was written just prior to his death). That this suicide should be seen asa sacrifice is obvious.Mishima battles with the enigmatic force field between words as conveyors ofmorals and spiritual values and their equally seductive power to entertain, thisprocess being very much extended to and in the public persona of Mishimahimself. In this strange mix between aspiration, bodybuilding, and aromanticized death wish, Sun and Steel is like an intellectual tornado of both ahighly refined (wished for) control and a desperation to overcome weakness inorder to meet the inevitable on one’s own terms. It is a way of cheating death,yes, but only by tricking it ahead of time through one’s own design.Jünger’s protagonist—as is often the case, truly a reflection of the author’sown persona—is aloof and reflective, yet not passive and escapist. His botanicalstudies contain fodder for haughty philosophical speculation and even catalystsfor interpreting the threatening outside world. As with Mishima’s own body,Jünger’s lofty “naturalism” becomes both an extension of inner processes thateventually drift out and an entry into an even deeper potential introspection.When the protagonist leaves the sanctuary on the marble cliffs that contains allthe remnants and collections of years of study and reflection, he makes sure toburn it to the ground—thereby making it a sacrifice rather than having it soiledby the approaching oppressive forces. Order, beauty, and life itself seemevanescent and temporal, but within certain limits we can decide how to begin,how to develop, and how to end it all. Again, it’s a way of assuming slightcontrol before the inevitable occurs.These actions could of course be seen as vain, in vain, and illusory, but inboth cases I can’t see it quite so negatively. After all, Mishima did succeed inevery aspect in achieving what he wanted and is today what he hoped to be: asymbol of a poetic and traditional resistance to the Western “nothingness” andconsumerism that was already apparent in Japan (and elsewhere) right after theSecond World War. Jünger was lucky to escape the Nazi “bureaucracy of death” andGoebbels’s love-hate relationship with him. On the Marble Cliffs was publishedin 1939, and its criticism of totalitarian strategies, attitudes, and negativeeffects would have had any other author killed. According to contemporary Jüngermythos, he was basically saved or spared because Hitler himself liked Jünger asa type/character—impressions founded on Jünger’s initial claim to literary fame,the First World War novel The Storm of Steel (1920).Jünger himself classified On the Marble Cliffs as a general overview of thedynamics of tyranny and has stated that it wasn’t specifically about NaziGermany at all. Be that as it may, that angle of specific interpretation will ofcourse always be there. Mishima is similarly elusive. His own paramilitary“Society of Shields” made no claims to oppose anything but the general morass ofcontemporary life and culture. Yet Japan had been one of the Axis powersfighting side by side with Nazi Germany, and even more adamantly so for severalmonths after Germany had surrendered. In this we can find more similaritiesbetween the authors mainly, but also between these specific books. Jüngerrefused to adapt or succumb to the new regime’s “denazification” process simplybecause he had never been a Nazi. This of course initially led to problematicstigmatization for him in those truly dualistic times. It wasn’t until 1947 thatOn the Marble Cliffs was published in an English translation (incidentally, madeby a British officer, Stuart Hood, who had met Jünger right at the end of thewar). For Mishima the situation was even stranger, as his pro-nationalisticultraconservatism came much later, some twenty years after the end of the war.The romantic yearning for an idyllic society or era is fundamental in bothbooks, but both authors seem aware that it’s an evanescent pipe dream that canonly truly exist in a constructed memory or within the unlimited world offiction: “Anything that comes into our minds, even for the briefest of moments,exists. Even though it may not exist at the actual moment, it has existedsomewhere in the past, or will exist at some time in the future.”3[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt34]The pro-militaristic stance of the authors permeates both books. Jünger hadindeed been a soldier in both world wars and was imbued early on with achivalric Prussian attitude toward military life—one that never really left him.Mishima was a faint and fey aesthete during the war, and his pro-militaristicstance became part therapy and part mission much later on: “The thing that layat the far end of my dreams was extreme danger and destruction; never once had Ienvisaged happiness. The most appropriate type of daily life for me was aday-by-day world destruction; peace was the most difficult and abnormal state tolive in.”4 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt35] Where On the Marble Cliffs is a fairytale–like allegory of cyclic history and chivalric resistance, Sun and Steel isa more concrete report of a similar process, albeit individual. Both authorspositioned themselves outside contemporary concerns in almost anachronistic waysand relayed their philosophy through literature. What permeates both books is anelegant display not only of a personal approach (that could have ended withexecution for Jünger and possibly prosecution for Mishima) but also of a deepconviction and love for literature as such. Jünger found his vocation in lettersearly on, as did Mishima. Jünger seemingly had no qualms about it—on thecontrary, the audacity in his works is sometimes staggering and, to some,provocative. Mishima’s doubts lay not so much in his qualities as an author butrather in the self-esteem that the public persona as author made obvious to him.Both of these short books show so clearly how evocative and therebyinspirational writing can be, regardless if it’s a question of allegoricalfiction or a call to arms in regard to personal weaknesses.At the same time, both do battle with the very process of writing andstorytelling itself. Mishima’s struggle in Sun and Steel is an overcoming of theapparent contradiction of literary creation—at least his own. Hence, I assume,is the fact that it is not a novel at all but rather a straight recounting ofhis own call to arms—arms that were ideally to be part writing and part physicalexcellence in anticipation of death. Jünger experienced similar concerns. Heknew all along that to be free one has to be outside of polarities andattachments. More and more, he refined the anarch’s stance of being outside byintegrating the fable’s form as narrative and nature as such as the perfectallegorical platform for his various protagonists’ voices. It is as if they bothconstantly evaluated not only story itself but also storytelling. The awarenessof the dangers of verbiage, demagogic or not, was present in them both, but theyseemingly had different approaches in this regard. Jünger drifted methodicallyinto mythological evanescence and Mishima painstakingly into a physical one.Jünger wroteIf I do not describe the details of our work it is because we were busied withthings which lie beyond speech and which therefore elude the spell that wordsexert. But everyone will remember how his mind has labored in regions which hecannot portray, whether it were in dreams or in deep thought. It seemed as if hewere groping for the right road in labyrinths or sought to unravel the figuresamong the patterns of an optical illusion. And often he awoke wonderfullystrengthened. That is where our best work takes place, and so it seemed to us,too, that in our struggle speech was still inadequate, and that we mustpenetrate into the depths of the dream if we were to withstand the threatagainst us.5 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt36]And Mishima: “The cynicism that regards all hero worship as comical is alwaysshadowed by a sense of physical inferiority.”6 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt37]Both gentlemen are balancing on a tightrope between free-spirited, amazingindividual creativity and conservative demagogy. A little bit more (of anything)would have positioned them elsewhere, but this fine-tuned awareness, not only ofpersonal approach but also of literary skill, instead place them as steadybeacons in the reader’s mind.I had my hesitations about writing this short essay simply because I was afraidthat the process of analysis would create a de-attraction to both books.Sometimes the magic should remain unquestioned and just enjoyed. But I stillfeel attracted to them, so no harm done. In this wild speculation of mine, whatunites the books (and perhaps the authors themselves too) is the anachronisticoutsider’s advantage of being able to be free to create at will, undisturbed bytemporal concerns or, even worse, literary styles or trends. Their force liesnot so much in the themes written about as in the way they are written. Theyboth contain a perfect blend of style and content that was truly unique not onlyto “their masters’ voices” but also to the very lives they led. Perhaps onecould call it all a highly enjoyable tangible evanescence?To me, these authors, and these titles specifically, have been very inspiring.The meta-level of their language (extreme and literal in Mishima’s case; alludedto in Jünger’s) creates a totality that transcends mere fiction. Theirexistential positions as reflective anarch (Jünger) and active combatant(Mishima) in a world of utter complacency and existential nothingness fill mewith the energy I need to evaluate which is the best attitude for me. Asliterature is so fully integrated in my life, the books I’m attracted to help medecide on the outlook of the day. These two beautiful gems have helped me manytimes to cope with the astounding stupidity of our contemporary times. So Iguess it’s no wonder that I keep returning to them again and again."},{"pageContent":"9Anton LaVey, Magical InnovatorOriginally a lecture delivered at Nekropolis Bogcafé in Copenhagen, Denmark,2013.ASSUMING THAT THERE IS already a fundamental knowledge of Satanism in thisillustrious crowd, I’m going to allow myself to delve deeper into a fewspecialized sections of Anton LaVey’s contribution to contemporary magicalphilosophy.Let’s generalize a bit and say that the first half of the twentieth century wasall about synthesizing. East met West, and this was integrated into esotericsystems by intelligent structure makers. The Golden Dawn was one such group ofstructure makers. Theosophy under Blavatsky was another. Gurdjieff was anotherprotagonist, and Steiner yet another. Aleister Crowley was perhaps the mostwell-known one. They all made nutritious stews but basically out of alreadyexisting ingredients.The second half of the twentieth century was more violent and also more creativein many ways. As the recent structures had become established and theironce-so-pioneering key people had become accepted teachers or gurus, a new breedbred on first-generation Thelema, Golden Dawn splinter groups, and assortedpre-1960s swamis from the East concocted their own syntheses and groups, taking,however, considerably more contemporary fodder into account than previously.Science, psychology, irony and humor, art, speculative philosophies, and otherpreviously rare phenomena within occultism suddenly overrode arcane conceptslike invocation, banishing, Kabbalah, tarot, wands, astrology, mystical angeliclanguages and ancient demonic names, and so forth. Instead, the focus lay inspheres of experimentation, neurology, psychodrama, sexuality, and othernonsectarian core human phenomena. Old structures were dissolved in new ways oflooking at things.The Church of Satan was one of these precursors of radical change. Establishedin 1966 by Anton LaVey, the church’s first phase up until the late 1970s was oneof visibility and provocation. LaVey’s colorful presence made both him and hischurch celebrities. As a well-formulated and intriguing antidote to the mellowand essentially selfless hippies of the era, LaVey was cabled all over the worldinto news and men’s magazines, who found the naked women on his altar justshocking enough to print.During the second phase, from the late 1970s and up until his death in 1997,LaVey became much more of a recluse and solitaire. He was established, and hisSatanic Bible kept on selling and generated an income that meant he couldthereby devote his time and energies to one of the key concepts of the Church ofSatan: “indulgence instead of abstinence.” One of the things he enjoyed andindulged in was writing.Although his books The Satanic Bible, The Satanic Rituals, and The Satanic Witchare his most well-known, I would say that the later anthologies The Devil’sNotebook and Satan Speaks are much more substantial when it comes to his ownthinking. The Bible and the Rituals were basically assemblage volumes, in whichpragmatically chosen material was edited together and augmented further byexplanatory comments. But the two volumes of essays and maxims that followedmuch later, The Devil’s Notebook and Satan Speaks, genuinely contain the essenceof LaVey’s latter-day wit and creativity.The essays are also a great source of some groundbreaking magical concepts, bothon the “lesser magic” level (willed manipulation of everyday life) and “greatermagic” level (ritualized programming of a willed “Is to Be” situation ordevelopment).Already in The Satanic Bible, LaVey had shown considerable creativity. Conceptslike “psychic vampires” and the “balance factor” soon became household terms inAmerica and the rest of the world. His description of the ritual space as anintellectual decompression chamber also hit home outside the strictly Satanicperimeters. As did the slightly later term occultnik, signifying a person who islost within old structures of occultism without being able to see what’s reallyof use on a practical, material level.In The Satanic Bible we can also find an old-school method within occultwriting: creative appropriation of an older source. In this case, LaVey’s use ofthe Enochian keys originally written by Dee and Kelly via the biographer MericCasaubon in 1659 and then regurgitated throughout the centuries up untilCrowley. LaVey exchanged the final intonations traditionally translated as “thehighest” with “Saitan,” claiming the previous translations and vibrations hadbeen erroneous. “The barbaric tonal qualities of this language give it a trulymagical effect which cannot be described.”1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt38] Healso claimed that the nature of the scrying that Kelly as the “gazer” used hadbeen mispresented as via the grace of angels, when in fact, according to LaVey,it has to do with ocular and psychic “angles,” which can, metaphorically or not,open wide the Gates of Hell.The Satanic Witch was a primer in applied, practical feminism. It also broughtin concepts like the LaVey “personality synthesizer,” or the personality clock.This is a method to be used in various kinds of matchmaking, human as well aswithin other areas of choice and resonance, not as a spiritual oracle of somekind, but as a down-toearth method of applied psychology.There was also the important concept of ECI, or erotic crystallization inertia,meaning that our very first defining erotic moments, like the first orgasm forinstance, will be forever linked to the surroundings, emotional atmospheres, andso on, inside our psyche. That crystallizing moment will be with us forever andaffect us all throughout life. As it is an overwhelmingly emotional moment, forgood and bad, it can be tapped as a source of energy in magical workings. Aswith a general and honest definition of one’s own sexuality, the consciousworking with ECI brings several benefits to the magician.One telling example most of us can see within our own culture is the fact thatboth men and women seem to get stuck, time-wise and looks-wise, in the periodwhen they were most sexually active and attractive. LaVey pointed out someconcrete situations where ECI is usually unconsciously used but even morevisible. Solitary elderly people, like widows or widowers, usually becomedepressed and lacking in motivation. When in the company of people of the samegeneration, and in an environment that is created to evoke this sexual peakperiod of life, vitality and general health come back in almost miraculous ways.We’ll return to this in the form of another LaVeyan construct: the totalenvironment.One important aspect of The Satanic Witch was the development of what LaVeycalled “the law of the forbidden,” meaning that to attract a person or a desiredsituation, one needs to be genuinely aware of one’s own qualities (this is verymuch tied in to “the balance factor” mentioned earlier) and the alluring displayof sections of the body but not all of it. Showing a little bit of flesh bymistake can create a greater jolt and impact than quickly undressing andrevealing it all. “Nothing is so fascinating as that which is not meant to beseen.” There is even a chapter in The Satanic Witch called “The Secrets ofIndecent Exposure.” However, the dynamic need not be sexual at all. The law ofthe forbidden can be used in many different areas.Sexual honesty is paramount in the LaVeyan universe. Personal fetishes are alsoextremely important, whether sexual or emotional. To feel strongly aboutsomething that concerns no one else is to generate a force field that can betapped indefinitely. To feel strongly about something that concerns a multitudeof people is to generate leakage and distortion. To savor small items of activepreference in a fetishistic way thereby becomes a highly conscious magical act.Emulation is not a key to Satanism. Passion, on the other hand, is.What follows here is an overview of some further key concepts that can hopefullyinspire the student to delve further into the mysteries of him- or herself viathe Satanic grid.INTEGRATION OF THE EGOAlmost all previous magical systems were developed within a dichotomy that wasstructured around the relationship between “higher” and “lower,” no doubt havingto do with monotheistic religious imprints in which this life is insufficientand that some kind of idealized pie in the sky is better.The heavy influx of Freudian energy during the twentieth century revealed thepower of the conscious ego. LaVey integrated the ego as a valid and relevantcomponent in magical thought and thereby made void invisible moralisms that hadup until then permeated the world-view of practically all previous magicalconceptualists.Higher/lower is in itself a concept imbued with value, and that value stems fromcontrol systems stressing that the ideal can essentially not be reached withinthe span of one human lifetime. LaVey, on the other hand, stressed that theuncertainty of karmic relations possibly transcending this lifetime is toostrong, and that gratification of desires in the here and now is more of anatural given, and certainly more worth striving for.One also has to take into consideration that will is always expressed throughego, and that even demigod characters projected with selfless, altruistic, andspiritual existence (the Dalai Lama, Gandhi, other Eastern figures, gurus, thepope, et al.) all make choices through their egos.The LaVeyan perspective disrobes a great deal of hypocrisy in our zeitgeist,whether the proponents be political, religious, “magical,” or just generallyaltruistic. There is always ego involved in decision making, and if this is notrecognized and exposed, obstructing illusions will dominate the analyticalfaculties of those taking part. This illusion would only be deemed Satanicallysanctioned if the person in question allows him- or herself to be duped in orderto gratify his or her own masochistic need of servitude.The LaVeyan magical system favors the eloquent will of the ego—as well as itsunderlying libidinal and compensatory forces—as the most relevant ideal tostrive for. Whichever clothing this ideal is individually dressed in, it ridsitself of the illusions stemming from other people’s projections, as well asfrom their individual ego-based wills.Although LaVey and later LaVeyans have expressed a critical stance in regard toa concept like “spiritual,” the concept itself would be better off in adichotomy called inner and outer (thereby leveling out or at least decimatingany inherent value-based interpretations). We all work with processes ofthinking, willing, feeling, and so forth, and they could all be seen as beinginner and/or related to the workings of the mind. These processes are thenexpressed in the outer, filtered through the ego.If the inner is inspired somehow by what is traditionally stamped as spiritualor higher (adherence to a certain technical language or certain techniques likeyoga, meditation, or even specific religious thought or iconography) and this isexpressed through a conscious ego, the ball game is moved from an externallycontrolled or imposed field of values to the highly magical and ego-gratifyingfield of well-being in resonance.All altruism stems from decisions made by the ego, as does all non- oranti-altruism. This integration of a considerably more stripped attitude when itcomes to the human psyche and its motivations is probably LaVey’s most importantcontribution to magical thought.THE VALIDATION AND INTEGRATION OF EMOTIONWhere previous Western magical systems had been based on an intellectual andsystematized/structured approach, Anton LaVey brought in the emotional as a keyagent. No greater magical working can, according to LaVey, be successful withoutan evocation of relevant human emotions. Although this sounds simple enough, itbecomes a dilemma when the individual is armed to his or her teeth with fancyelemental weapons and a perfect intellectual understanding of how to perform atraditional ritual. But what about “Why”? Why is this ritual performed? Usually,it’s to “cause change to occur in conformity with will,” to paraphrase Crowley.That’s fair and fine enough, but if the magician in question works only within astrictly intellectual sphere with a rational approach, he or she might just aswell focus on “lesser” magic, that is, a Machiavellian manipulation of thesurroundings.Any working dealing with “greater” aspects needs emotional investment in theritual moment. LaVey’s term for the temple space—the intellectual decompressionchamber—pretty much sums it up. It is a challenge for most people to honestlyknow themselves and to have the courage, even in solitary settings, to displayweaknesses and emotions not in line with the desired self-image. But how elsecan you develop, overcome, or banish these weaknesses?A SENSE OF HUMOROf course, this was not invented by Anton LaVey. But few magicians have stressedit as an important quality and also a tool. “A Satanist without a sense of humorwould be unbearable,” he says in the documentary Speak of the Devil. The use oftricks, jokes, and pranks can be integrated in complex and highly seriousmagical workings, especially if it entails ridiculing a pretentious person orforce or strategically demeaning or belittling oneself to gain a betterperspective or position. The clown or the joker is indeed a powerful figure ortype.The Devil’s Notebook is suitably dedicated to “the men, whoever they are, whoinvented the Whoopee Cushion, the Joy Buzzer, and the Sneeze-O-Bubble.”Invariably, those with the most finely honed sense of humor find serious meaningin what everyone else ridicules. The very nature of the joke is its foundationof misfortune. The joke maker can spot the sham in acceptably serioussituations. Then, having called attention to the deception, he may stand forthas a Satanic tribune. Not so easy is the reverse. The same rebel who defends theunpopular and the ridiculed, plays to an audience whose only illusion ofstrength lies in its ability to ridicule. It’s interesting to observe how lowerman, while realizing the sadness of clowns, seldom pays attention to them whenthey have serious thoughts to offer.2 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt39]Incidentally, the Satanically important character of the villain by his veryantithetical stance also makes fun of the existing order and morals and hencefunctions as a liberating character—if intelligent and conscious about it.Scapegoating is an important and apparently necessary function in the humanpsyche, at least for egos that are not healthily gratified. To take on thepersona of the villified or the mocking catalyst requires an inner strength notoften found among the “herd,” according to LaVey.ARTIFICIAL HUMAN COMPANIONSInspired by his own misanthropy, nostalgia, and will to be in charge, LaVeyearly on started creating humanoid dolls, often as memories from his own youth.In the basement of his Black House in San Francisco (the house allegedlyimmortalized by the Eagles in their chartbusting song “Hotel California”), LaVeyhad a bar called the Den of Iniquity, complete with several artificial humancompanions. This environment and its denizens acted as an intellectualdecompression chamber as much as the classic black temple space upstairs or thekitchen where he kept his vast collection of synthesizers and other musicalinstruments. To be able to make small talk with the drunks, the bartender andthe old lady on the floor who was a drunken victim of LaVey’s own sexualfetish—watching women piss their panties—became a sanctuary and a zone free ofrational processes and expectations. Anything could happen. And often did.The emergence of commercially available human companions (for instance thosemade by the company Real Doll) not solely intendend for sexual use is a clearcurrent example of a LaVeyan concept manifesting outside of the strictly Satanicenvironment. (For more on this, please see chapter 11, “The ImaginativeLibido.”)I have great respect for those who pioneer their own artificial human companion,crude as they might initially be. They will have come a small step closer toplaying God and creating man or woman according to their desired image. With acreative outlet as cloaked in age-old taboo as this, innovation may now runrampant—more so than any artform man has yet known. The bizarre twilight worldof the ventriloquist, the puppet-master and the dollmaker can perhaps beunderstood through other than the minds of psychologists. The acceptableschizoid element in all of us—the one that selects our mates—has a fresh, new,open portal to pass through. Through surrogates the race will survive.Other comments from The Devil’s Notebook: “the prime appeal of the humanoid liesin its approximation of the purchaser’s ‘other half.’. . . Artificial companionsthat are pleasingly heard, smelled and felt also constitute positive sellingpoints. But that an artificial companion looks right is of primary importance.”3[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt40]THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTOne of the most important ideas or concepts along with that of artificial humancompanions is the total environment. Consistent in his exclusion of the herdthat provokes deep misanthropy and his inclusion of personal esthetics andfetishism, LaVey’s development of total environments are a key to understandingthe subtleties of his magic.In a world that becomes louder and louder and more and more fragmented, theexistence of a sacred space filled with perfection and maximum personalresonance almost becomes a heretical act. It actually is. Not only does itaffect you in beneficial ways like relaxation, excitement, and inspiration, butthere’s also the possibility of using these spaces (and times, if they are time-or era-specific) for creative magical rituals in many different ways anddirections.In The Satanic Rituals, LaVey stated that “Man’s ugly habit of elevating himselfby defaming others is an unfortunate phenomenon, yet apparently necessary to hisemotional well-being.”4 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt41] With the development oftotal environments and many of his other concepts, there was no longer a needfor LaVey to be a frustrated outsider in conflict with the herd. The Satanist’screative isolation in a space/time-warp-possible mind frame is one of silenceand subtlety, and one of the greatest tools in the Satanic trade.This, combined with honest self-knowledge and a proud appreciation of one’s ownkinks and complications makes for a good, solid Satanist. There’s always astrong focus of real-life material success too. But only based on the balancefactor and what is actually possible for an individual in that position.Self-deceit is not a popular quality in LaVey’s cosmos. “The most successfulindividuals throughout history have been the people who learn a few good tricksand apply them well, rather than those with a whole bag full who don’t knowwhich trick to pull out at the right time—or how to use it once they get itout!”5 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt42]The total environment encompasses many of the central LaVeyan concepts in oneconfined yet endless space. Personal preferences, aesthetics, the intellectualdecomepression chamber, fetishism, misanthropy, and possibly artificial humancompanions to share the magic with—it’s a sphere of clear-sighted yet romanticproto-creativity previously unheard of in “classical” magical lore.INTEGRATION OF MUSICLaVey was a skilled musician and loved music. No wonder then that he hadexplored magical aspects of tone, vibrations, rhythms, the human voice, and allof these things put together. His own rituals often included his own playingsuitable instruments. Sometimes the ritual itself was the actual playing of oneselected piece of music with heavy emotional gusto.Music is the most effective tool for evocation, as the entire body rhythm ishelplessly taken up by the pattern of life associated with the musicalselection. A meaningful idea never dies, nor does the emotional responsegenerated by certain compositions. If enough people are inspired or moved bythese compositions, the selections become sonic repository for the accumulatedemotions of all those affected by them. Becoming an all-encompassing sensingelement to the collective feedback of a particular composition can yield a totalevocation.6 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt43]Again, the integration of emotion is fundamentally important. There is probablyno art form more emotional than music. To get into the mood of a specificworking, the inclusion of a musical piece chosen for its evocative qualities isessential. If performed live, the emotional amplification will be even greater.In discussing these things, LaVey also mentions “emotional chording.” Thereseems, according to him, to exist one chord for each emotion. Animals respond tovery few: basically pleasure and pain. “Humans have added certain chords totheir internal lyre, such as sentiment, which sometimes appears as nostalgia—acombination of pleasure and pain. Humans’ internal chording is more complexbecause humans experience a wider range of stimuli than do other animals(though, alas, the reverse is often true).”7 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt44]THE VILLAINSatan was defined by LaVey as a symbol with the powerful potential of accusingand revealing hypocrisy and double standards. Satire, irony, and scathingintelligence here become magical qualities, as personified in LaVeyaninspirations like Mark Twain, Ben Hecht, and H. L. Mencken. Wherever there isdogmatic hypocrisy and attempts at control through intimidation, there will becounterforces. When direct causal balancing is not possible, then a sardonicstrike can do just as well.In all cultures, the antihero, rebel, or villain is usually more popular thanthe (self-) righteous hero running the errands of the corrupt. Even worse thanthe hero him- or herself is the person cheering on the righteousness imposed byothers. LaVey describes these people as those bearing a “good-guy badge.” Gathertwo or more of these together, and an intolerant lynch mob is never far away.The balancing force is the lone ranger—often a truly good and just person, butwith methods and an intelligence in direct opposition to the status-quo behaviorof the herd. “The more grandiose the villain, the more beneficient he is tosociety.” And “The greater one’s natural degree of nonconformity, the greaterare one’s magical powers.”8 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt45] This is no wayautomatically implies that nonconformers or outsiders are villainous or viceversa, but there’s something in the isolation from the herd or the collectivethat is absolutely central in the LaVeyan Weltanschauung.Besides the integrated sense of dark humor, there’s also the concept of “noir”justice in both Satanic and criminal environments. The antihero of hard-boiledcrime stories of the 1940s and’50s and his stern cinematic counterpart in filmsnoirs often represents justice but very seldom the legal system. And thecriminal world is truly one of Machiavellian strategies and the protonatural lextalionis that LaVey was such an avid advocate of.THE THIRD SIDEOppositional transcendence is a fairly new construct in Western magical thought.Where Chinese Taoism has always favored the both/and rather than the either/orstance, Western occult philosophy has up until the twentieth century been boggeddown by religious dualisms and simplified divisions.Aleister Crowley was instrumental in this transcendental process with his famousdefinition “The Magick of Horus requires the passionate union of opposites.” Itis not only a “magical” way of solving problems or looking at things but alsoacknowledges modern scientific thought. Where opposites either clash or unite,there is a great amount of energy set free. For the magician aware of themechanisms involved, the energy can easily be directed to do his or her bidding.What’s interesting here is what LaVey called the third side of any issue athand. This side he described and defined as Satanic because it challengesdim-witted dualism. Reality is always more multifaceted than a yes or a no, andespecially if one is on a pragmatic prowl for success and pleasure for oneself.Aligning oneself with either the “either” or the “or” is usually to take thesafe way out. The third side may be controversial, but that’s never a problemfor a Satanist. “The third side can be the crackpot stuff of conspiracytheories, or it can be the most logical and simple, yet deliberately neglectedconclusion.”9 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt46] In Satan Speaks, LaVey gives anexample of how this dynamic could work as a pragmatic magical formula mixing twoiconic almost mythic energies of twentieth-century life and culture: NationalSocialism and Judaism. LaVey himself was Jewish by birth and at times evenexpressed Zionist leanings, but at the same time he admired fascist aestheticsfrom both Italy and Nazi Germany.It will become easier and more convincing for any Satanist to combine a Jewishlineage with a Nazi aesthetic, and with pride rather than with guilt andmisgiving. The die is cast with the vast numbers of children of mixedJewish/Gentile origins. They need a place to go. They need a tough identity.They won’t find it in the Christian church, nor will they find it in thesynagogue. They certainly won’t find acceptance among identity anti-Christiananti-Semites who use noble, rich, and inspirational Norse mythology as an excuseand vehicle to rant about the “ZOG.” The only place a rational amalgam of proud,admitted Zionist Odinist Bolshevik Nazi Imperialist Socialist Fascism will befound—and championed—will be in the Church of Satan.10[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt47]Criticism of Anton LaVey and his genuinely creative concepts most often stemfrom blunt prejudice within the critic. When the individual feels safe andcomfortable within a system, even systems of otherwise radical and provocativeconcepts, the critical faculties toward that system become void, andscapegoating toward others begin. While often being brushed off as a con man ora charlatan by these kinds of critics, Anton LaVey still lingers on as animportant player in contemporary magical philosophy. He was decidedly a hereticbut perhaps not so much against the Christian Church and other monotheisticcontrol systems (these being already increasingly redundant and far too easy tomock), but more so in relation to the magical moralists all too happy to do someunconscious scapegoating and all too happy to flaunt their degree-studdedgood-guy badges.There are many other concepts that deserve a closer study: LaVey’s thoughts onmasochism in relation to beneficial slavery, the “law of the trapezoid,” and“lycanthropic metamorphosis,” to mention but a few. I hope this lecture has atleast laid a solid base as an overview for future interest and attention. Inclosing, here are some final thoughts from LaVey:When I think of all those who would rejoice at my discomfort, I am energized andstrengthened to the extent that I might overcome any malaise. It is not my lovefor mankind that sustains me, but rather mankind’s resentment of me. My disdainand contempt for the mediocre masses in general and those who calumniate me inpaticular angers me to regeneration.11 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt48]"},{"pageContent":"10Carl Jung, MythmakerOriginally a lecture delivered at Aniara in Gothenburg, Sweden, 2016.ON THE WHOLE, Carl Jung is already so well documented and well-known that it’salmost not worth talking about him. Jung is a superstar of a different kind thanFreud, despite the fact that they have both been important pioneers withinpsychology as we know it. The word pioneer isn’t even enough to describe them.They are both rather founders of modern psychology, which has now, in itsrebellious-teen independent phase, tossed them both out. Jung packed a strongerpunch, but not because he was less esoteric and less incomprehensible thanFreud—in many ways he was more so—but because he was taken in and integrated inthe surrounding culture much faster.Even early on Jung was part of culture. The Dada movement shared the sameenvironment as the budding psychology movement in Switzerland. Hermann Hesse washis patient, he visited the Monte Verita commune at Ascona, and he had acreativity of his own that he desperately tried to come to terms with. Jung alsointerpreted cultural phenomena in more general ways than Freud, whose focus wasusually on the individual and on isolated experiences. Jung focused considerablymore on the integration and analysis of myths, religions, customs, and symbols.In the development of concepts like “archetypes” and the “collectiveunconscious,” Jung not only looked at isolated myths in themselves but also attheir artistic expressions. He claimed that there is an impulse-generating layerin the psyche that is shared by all human beings and that can be directlyaccessed through introspection, dreams, the study of myths, and personal,artistic work. A certain culture can possess a more rational or “civilized”construction than another, but the basic psychological foundations are inessence the same globally. Jung’s travels around the world and his collection ofdata confirmed his theories and became an important part of his system.The general openness that followed after the Second World War—decidedly anecessary pendulum movement—was integrated in both Jung’s life and work in anenormous amount of material telling the story of what had so far gone wrong. Theindividual’s need to find him- or herself, a healthy individualism in a paranoidand collectivistic world, attractive myths with strong emotional resonances, theintegration of one’s own artistic process, and many other aspects eventuallycontributed to both a liberalization of Western culture in, for instance, thehippie movement—and later in what we today call the New Age movement—and perhapseven to a stronger presence of political liberalism.One can feel and think what one wants about all of these manifestations but noone can deny the influence that Carl Jung has had on our culture. It’s beenthere hand in hand with an overall need to find new ways that are not dictatedfrom above or even from the outside but that must be discovered by each andeveryone on the inside, in the spiritual and the occulted.When things are broadened, popularized, and integrated in a culture, theprecursors, pioneers, codifiers, and formulators are often lost along the way.Generalization becomes the norm, and old terms are used in new contexts inpragmatically simplified ways. What once originated in advanced psychologicalreasoning in an open-minded yet empirical method becomes vague sloganeeringfiltered through pecuniary potential. When there’s money to be made, necessaryhours on end on the analytical couch quickly become “success in just ten easysteps.”A pop-cultural book by Jung such as Man and His Symbols is filled with highlyrelevant material for a deeper understanding of Homo sapiens as a culturalbeing. But the main attraction lies in its accessibility and the opportunity toquickly get an attractive overview of the human psyche in an increasinglycomplex, confused, and fragmented world. One jumps over the conclusions andpreferably also the demands of critical thinking to instead find an alluring andirrational solution to personal issues through a very general kind ofinspiration. Where Jung claimed that many of our central myths told storiesabout essential things that each individual must process in a hard and quiteoften painful process of individuation, the modern interpretation, say from the1960s and onward, has become one of facing the path of least resistance andadapting to its attractive shortcuts. Where Jung wanted to make us aware of whatis already there, inside us, most people still keep looking for outside sources:I have called this wholeness that transcends consciousness the “self.” The goalof the individuation process is the synthesis of the self. From another point ofview the term “entelechy” might be preferable to “synthesis.” There is anempirical reason why “entelechy” is, in certain conditions, more fitting: thesymbols of wholeness frequently occur at the beginning of the individuationprocess, indeed they can often be observed in the first dreams of early infancy.This observation says much for the a priori existence of potential wholeness,and on this account the idea of entelechy instantly recommends itself. Butinsofar as the individuation process occurs, empirically speaking, as asynthesis, it looks, paradoxically enough, as if something already existent werebeing put together.1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt49]One could definitely say that Jung is the contemporary norm in these spheres.His terminology rules, if not within clinical psychology, then definitely withinpopular culture with terms like introvert, extrovert, synchronicity, anima,animus, and so on.Jung’s integration of myths as an expression of fundamental psychological truthsgot a push forward through American mythologist Joseph Campbell’s successfulbooks, such as The Masks of God, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, and The Powerof Myth. Here we also find an accessible focus on the analysis of myths, mainlyfiltered through religion, fiction, and popular culture throughout themillennia. Although social contexts constitute much of our lives, Jung andCampbell, as well as many other later Jungians, always stressed that developmentis an individual affair—that it could be no other way:It has been one of the really painful problems of the modern Western individualto gain release for his conscience from this Levantine assurance of a separationof spirit and nature (mythic dissociation), together with its correlativetotalitarian dogma (social identification) of “society”—almost any quorum, itseems, will do: a “people,” a “Church,” even a trade union, or anything callingitself “the state”—as the only vehicle of value, through association with whichan individual can achieve worth: when actually the truth is the other wayaround, that whatever human worth a social group may claim, it will have gainedonly by grace of the great and little individuals of its membership.2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt50]In the 1960s, even structuralist philosophers like Roland Barthes began writingabout contemporary times from a mythological perspective. He showed thatphenomena like Greta Garbo, Einstein’s brain, and even striptease must beinterpreted in a mythological way. Like Jung, Barthes claimed that myth isessentially a language. Where Jung wrote that this language in itself alsoconstituted an essential content for personal development, for Barthes themythological language became more of a convenient tool for his own contemporarycriticism.But the very term mythology was brought forth again and no longer strictlywithin academic fields like the history of religions or anthropology. From apsychological perspective one could say the concept of myth was made consciousby Jung and his later interpreters. Suddenly it was around in a wider and morepublic context.With this, the terms myth and mythology gained more meanings. Where the termsused to signify a group of behaviors and stories that had lived on orally or hadbeen written down and could be focused on, today they have become diluted andcan signify anything from a lie to a feeling: “No, that’s not correct, it’s justa myth,” or “That felt totally mythical.” This dilution is of course a part ofcontemporary Western culture in general. One could almost say that ourcontemporary mythologies to a large extent consist of upheavals. Not just of oldkinds of tradition but also of how we experience them, how we value them.Perception certainly hasn’t been sharpened (which some technophiles like toargue) but rather dulled, and the material we experience consists ofimpoverished and diluted versions of what once transmitted somethingsubstantial.An example: Our Western dramaturgy is based on what’s usually called a Homericstructure. It ties in to Homer’s stories about Odysseus’s travels towarddistinct goals. During his travels Odysseus faces problems and challenges thathe, either alone or with others, deals with and solves. This is a very simplesetup and yet seemingly endlessly fascinating. The same story has been told inso many ways and in so many different media that it’s mind-boggling when youthink about it. The reason for this is very likely the actual weight oftradition. You tell your kids the same story that you were once told yourself.These stories are more important than most parents seem to understand.But two main things have happened since the days of Jung: technology-driven massmedia is one, and the commercialization of shared public space the other. Bothof these have contributed to the fact that the amount of fiction has increasedin relation to one’s own thinking. Where previously we chose fiction in acompartmentalized manner and actively took part in it, today we are overrun byTV, the Internet, movies, and commercials of all kinds, and this mainly happenspassively. I have stated before (and I’ll do it again) that we now live more inand through fiction than we do in so-called fact-based reality. Fiction hastaken over. If we want to break it down one more level, we can say that our ownmythologies need our voluntary submission to too much content, too many stories,and all too quickly. Unfortunately, that’s when we leave the original functionof myth—education, teaching, and explaining things that are conducive to one’sown mental health—in favor of being driven into a wall of technological rule andperceptual deficiencies at an exponentially increasing speed.How would Jung interpret our contemporary times? I can of course onlyspeculate—and I gladly will. I believe he would have called it reversion. Wherehe claimed that the answers lie within ourselves on individual but alsoculturally integrated levels, and that one needs to work hard to reach thesedeeper levels, everything today is basically reversed or contrary: we encounterattractive tsunamis of empty promises in commodified and disposable identitiestogether with fictions filled with immediate but evanescent saturation. And, toadd insult to injury, these stories are told in narrative structures that“retardify” the partaker: we see what happens, then we see at least twoparticipants retell what just happened as if we can’t get it ourselves. It’s abreaking down of the barriers of human intelligence and dignity.The result is a kind of anti-Jungian abyss. Stress and existential anxietyincrease and are not treated therapeutically, but pharmaceutically. The humanbeing is allowed to believe in whatever she so desires but doesn’t reallybelieve in anything at all. And those who actually do believe in something seemwilling to kill all those who don’t share their specific belief.If you simply exchange a cluster of well-tried and well-meaning myths forarbitrarily created (and often quite non-altruistic) pseudo-myths, then perhapswe simply can’t handle it? The contact with the deeper layers of the psyche mayactually be literally essential for the individual. That’s what Jung claimedanyway. No outside structures can act as substantial substitutes for the gnosticand direct contact the individual needs in his or her development. One parallelexample could be the fact that we can’t survive if we can’t or aren’t allowed todream.One important part of functional myths is relevance. The reason why certainstories still live on is that they’ve transmitted definitive and engagingknowledge and wisdom. What is relevant today? And how should we preserve that insuch a fragmented existence as ours? Very likely we’re looking at oraltransmission, possibly amplified by physical books. All the so-called digitalstorage media are highly ephemeral gadgets, and we all know it. They won’t last.And what will actually be told? What’s going to be relevant for those who comenext?Desperate attempts at contact with our own (hi)story and a permeating anxietyabout the future are what’s defining a good deal of our contemporary historywriting. I recently re-watched the first Planet of the Apes films, and they arelike a contemporary mythological gold mine, despite the fact that they arealready forty to forty-five years old. At first, some humans led by CharltonHeston land on a planet that reveals itself as earth in the future. The planetis now run by intelligent, talking apes who keep the remaining human populationas slaves. This is a simple science-fictional and mythological presentation: youtravel in time to show a nightmare scenario. But the interesting thing aboutPlanet of the Apes is that the story goes on. The reason for the power switchbetween apes and humans in the future is that some of the more benevolent apesin Heston’s company actually go back in time on earth—as intelligent and talkingapes—to an existence where they are caught and maltreated because they stir up ariot among the lower kinds of apes. However, their genetic offspring develop,take charge, and eventually enslave the humans. That is, until Charlton Hestonshows up several thousands of years later. It’s a very simple yet efficienttime-warp–potential-loop scenario in which we are exposed to the problems ofxenophobia, anthropocentrism, vanity, and the worship of technology infairy-tale form. It is a beautiful and substantial myth. Similar examples existin Lord of the Rings, which very much contains Tolkien’s filtering of medievalEuropean myths spiced with plenty of xenophobia.Jung’s friend and colleague, the Romanian historian of religions Mircea Eliade,basically shared and amplified his views: “An object or an act becomes real onlyinsofar as it imitates or repeats an archetype. Thus, reality is acquired solelythrough repetition or participation; everything which lacks an exemplary modelis ‘meaningless,’ i.e., it lacks reality.”3 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt51] Thearchetype is, as we know, a strictly Jungian term and concept. Archetypes arethe forces or symbols that individuals can meet in the inner world, in dreams,visions, and in daydreams and that clearly reflect, if only symbolically,variants of current existential issues. This leads to the question: Do Eliadeand Jung mean that those who haven’t yet acknowledged the archetypes lack asense of reality, or that they themselves are unreal? It’s a highly relevantquestion for us today. If we are actively opposed by flamboyant superficialityand angst-ridden identity crises, then we can at most reflect each other: thinsurfaces that reflect other thin surfaces. When this is passed on to newgenerations the result is an increasingly accentuated weakness.Eliade also claimed that basically all relevant myths retell the original storyof creation, regardless of which culture tells it. There is a need to be reborn,and one does that by acting out ritualized creations, or “active symbols” asJung would call them. This is also interesting from our contemporaryperspective: exactly which story of creation is permeating our culture andindividual interpretations? Although it’s tempting to answer “none,” I thinkit’s more interesting to look at one main current theme: active dissociationfrom the earth. In fiction, the threat has always come from beyond (the bend,outer space, another country, etc.). We create and enjoy life here, in our ownlittle paradise. But as the threats of real life increase (terrorism, pathogeny,asteroids, etc.) and thereby disturb the smooth recreation stories in/ofparadise, the current expressions (mythic or simply escapist) also reflect thatincrease. Hence we are flooded with stories of space dystopias (us going out,“them” coming in), supernatural creatures disrupting death (zombies, vampires,etc.), urban malaise, sexual confusion, more and more superheroes, and so forth.Entertainment not only reflects but also actively leads the way. Acclimatizationto inner voices and spiritual helpers is regarded as a facet of insanity, whilePokémon Go takes off like wildfire.We are permeated by an illusion of empowerment. One example could be the firstHobbit film. It’s a distant part of a genuinely interesting work of Tolkienbased on mythology. The first trilogy of film adaptations found a strongresonance with the zeitgeist and became an immense success. But in the firstHobbit film there are scenes that are distinctly plucked from anothermedium—that of the computer game. The dramaturgy, aesthetics, and experiencetranscends the story in itself to create a comfort zone in an abstracted toolor, as it’s called today, a platform. It is storytelling without a real story.Is there any difference between that film scene where Legolas is jumping up anddown on moving blocks and the one in the computer game? The difference is one ofillusory empowerment: you can “be” the character in question in the game. It’slike when children play: “I’ll be this one and you be that one.” The differenceis that it’s still a passive existence inside the computer game, without anyconnection to active imagination, daydreaming, associative fantasy, and so on.It’s not a therapeutic process but rather just a dulling one. Hence it’s not amyth but just mere escapism.So how can we awaken the power of mythology if we believe, like Jung did, thatit’s beneficial for health and existence? Well, the mere study of myths isfascinating and rewarding. Jung can be hard to read at times, but there’s noescaping that Man and His Symbols is a great introduction. Joseph Campbell too.Campbell created pop culture out of subjects previously reserved for academicspecialists. In reading Jung, Campbell, and even Eliade we understand the weightand importance of mythology, which opens us up to looking at the world with newand wider eyes, and makes us connect even the smallest things with largermeanings. The fairy tale is the child’s first contact with an abstracted worldbeyond the immediate family, and thereby a strong contribution to how one dealswith one’s own life later on. If, instead, you press an iPad or a cell phonewith a blinking, buzzing game in the hands of a child to silence him or her, howwill that turn out?For Jung himself, being an ardent empirical scientist, it was difficult to openup to the inner visions he experienced early on in life. At times he evendiscarded them as “psychotic incidents.” But gradually he trusted his ownintuition and began work on the book that may be his most important: the “red”book, or Liber Novus. It was simply a book he wrote and illustrated for himselfand which grew and grew with time. It contains religious writings, visions, andsymbolic images all stemming from his own depths. We can’t really say that Jungwas a traditional Christian but he was most definitely a Gnostic. Many of histexts are Gnostic, in the sense of early Christian writings that claimed it wasperfectly possible to maintain a direct contact with God without proxies likepriests or churches. Jung didn’t want Liber Novus to be published or even shownduring his own lifetime, but when it eventually was, in 2009, it became obviousthat the work on the book had been extremely influential for many of histhoughts and theories. And that he was actually a very talented visual artisttoo. It was during the work on this book that Jung developed his ideas on thecollective unconscious, the sphere that he claimed all specimen of Homo sapiensshare, like a general DNA of the soul, and to which you can return to accessboth information and inspiration in life.By far the most fruitful attempts, however, to find suitable symbolicexpressions for the self were made by the Gnostics. Most of them—Valentinus andBasilides, for instance—were in reality theologians who, unlike the moreorthodox ones, allowed themselves to be influenced in large measure by innerexperience. They are therefore, like the alchemists, a veritable mine ofinformation concerning all those natural symbols arising out of therepercussions of the Christian message. At the same time, their ideas compensatethe asymmetry of God postulated by the doctrine of the privatio boni, exactlylike those well-known modern tendencies of the unconscious to produce symbols oftotality for bridging the gap between the conscious and the unconscious, whichhas widened dangerously to the point of universal disorientation.4[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt52]Unfortunately, I don’t think Jung will reclaim his well-deserved central statuswithin the field of psychology. Psychology is a phenomenon, just like historywriting, that is at times too affected by its own environment and contemporaryinfluence. But I do believe that Jung’s thoughts and ideas will take on newforms and carry on within art, literature, and other expressions of culture.Because we don’t really need more existential manuals or more neurochemistry,but rather intuitive incentives, in which we see the totality and our own storyclearer, to be able to make our own decisions. Causal, empirical science justisn’t good enough for that, so we need fairy tales, poems, and dreams, as wellas old and new myths, to be able to act intelligently on both individual andspecies levels."},{"pageContent":"11The Imaginative LibidoOriginally published in the Polish magazine Trans/Wizje (No. 4, 2013).IT’S EASY TO SEE how dolls and playing with miniatures are attractive tochildren, whose imaginations are not yet repressed by the demands of adultbehavior. However, the externalizations or projections onto talismanic objectsare of great value also for the psychic hygiene and well-being of adults. Itseems that the times are changing in favor of an integration of a widerdefinition of play and, as an extension of this, of artificial human companions.The child who plays with miniatures is regarded as “normal.” Indeed, the childseeks an externalization of fantasies in tangibly bestowing objects/proxies withmagical life in a phase where confusion reigns and there’s simply quite a lot tolearn about how to behave and when, and so on. Traditionally, girls are equippedwith dolls and household items, and boys with tools of various kinds (cars,weapons, machines, fellow soldiers, etc). Whether this is all tradition and amanifestation of imposed gender patterns from anxious parents or somethingcompletely natural, we will leave for another discussion.Mimicking adults close by can of course be both good and bad, depending on whatthese adults do. At best, parents can serve as good examples of balanced andcreative decision makers. At worst, their own destructive behaviors can becontagiously transmitted into the psyche and behavior of the child in question.Using dolls in these formative years is a way to relate to and structure thechaotic aspects of childhood, both as amplification of positive emotions andexperiences and as exorcism of bad ones.Suffice to say here that dollhouses, garages, pastel-colored stables for cuteunicorns, replica weapons, dress-up cutouts, grand landscapes with miniaturetrains and roads or even battlefields are integrated parts of growing up formost Western kids.Dolls and toys in general have always existed and always will. Under direstraits, a stick and a pinecone can do the trick and get you to the “zone.” Inmore well-to-do circumstances, advanced and expensive mechanical miniatures willhelp saturate the imagination. The value seems to not have to do with cost perse but rather with invested emotional and imaginative energy. Your own favoriteteddy bear may not have been the most lavish, costly, or elegant but what doesit matter? It was yours and you felt an intense emotional resonance with it.This dynamic relationship can be so strong that the mere thought of that teddybear can evoke a feeling of warmth and nostalgia later on in life.There are several wonderful museums for toys in the world. One of the best whenit comes to dolls, teddy bears, and dollhouses exists in the old town in Basel,Switzerland. On well-visited floors are thousands of items, all beautifullypreserved. It is almost like entering a shrine somehow, the way the dolls andother items are meticulously showcased and looking out at you from behind glassboundaries.Not only is there an impressive display of technical craftsmanship (now probablylost forever) but also of the very essence of dolls and proxies; yes, they aredead but they can easily come to life (of sorts). This becomes especiallyevident when looking at the multitude of mechanical dolls and constructions thatmove, either wound up or electrically. Although their movements are likely to bejerky and stiff, the mere action itself does indeed tilt one’s imagination. Itis quite often an uneasy experience and one that provokes a light sense of fear.Probably that’s because it mimics our own behavior or environment but in adisturbingly flawed way.On display at the Basel museum are many dollhouses that provide an insight intothe behavioral programming of nineteenth-century Switzerland (and, surely, otherequally civilized regions of the world). Everything is orderly, all the boys andgirls are well dressed and well behaved (at least on the surface and duringopening hours) and there is an ample display of exquisite miniature itemsbelonging in the spheres of home, school, and work. That this was not strictly amatter of toys for fun quickly becomes evident.Technology and craftsmanship dictated the shape of these important learningplatforms of the era in question. In Switzerland of the late nineteenth century,where 10 percent of the gross national product came from exports of mechanicalmusic machines, it’s no wonder that expertly constructed and fine mechanicalworlds of wonder were presented to Swiss children.Today, entertainment has taken over the same function. However, there is a bigdifference. Today, kids are educated in passive modes by a never-ending flow ofentertainment. Where active fantasy and playacting used to be key ingredients inthe mental, moral, and emotional development of children, today there is asaddening prevalence of introverted staring into illuminated screens of varyingsizes.This is also why prefab household robots, for instance, can’t fulfil the sameneeds as artificial human companions. Their robotic presets and cold, distinctlynonhuman behavior leaves very little for the imagination to work with.The fear of dolls in general is called pediophobia, and constitutes part of agreater cluster of fears called automatonophobia. The considerably moreenthusiastic attitudes toward the same phenomenon are called pediophilia andautomatonophilia.The eerie and sometimes even terrifying encounter with glassy-eyed porcelaindolls or even mute teddy bears, especially when one sees many of them at thesame time, clearly distinguishes the thin line between death and magical life.By mere will, an inanimate object can go from being a scary zombie or voodoohorror-film-nightmare item to something that is “cute,” “cuddly,” and—notforgetting this—“mine.” And then also integrated in harmonious playing, alone ortogether with friends. It’s what the human imagination invests in the objectthat makes it come alive.Historically, the projection of life onto or into inanimate objects belongs inmagic and protoreligious spheres. Children have always played in this sense, butadults have also to a varying degree been allowed to do this. Rituals andceremonies in all cultures have been creations by proxy, either for keeping acommunity together by sharing a belief system, or for making substantial andsympathetic changes in a willed direction. The use of totems, dolls, proxies,and so forth, has always been integrated in this process.Imagination in itself shouldn’t be forgotten either. This is a quality oressence that is so fundamentally human that when it is discouraged (“Stopdaydreaming and get back to work!”) it creates severe emotional imbalances inthe individual. For children, using toys and acting/playing is considerednatural. For adults, however, rigidity and obedience are encouraged.Interestingly, this is a process or projection that usually sets in as theindividual becomes sexually mature. There seems to be a link in there somehow,one that demands that the two protohuman phenomena of sex and imagination shouldnot be allowed in the same psychic sphere. Now, why is that?There have been many pioneering psychologists and intellectuals who’ve focusedon these phenomena, Jung being but one. His integration (not least in his ownlife and creativity) of the imagination and his trusting of his own intuitionremain groundbreaking when looking back at the twentieth century. Several of hisdisciples have carried on researching this, including Marie-Louise von Franz:In a way, one must be potentially “whole” already in order to enter the drama;if one is not, one will learn to become so by painful experience. Activeimagination is thus the most powerful tool in Jungian psychology for achievingwholeness—far more efficient than dream interpretation alone. . . . In contrastto the numerous existing techniques of passive imagination, active imaginationis done alone, to which most people must overcome considerable resistance. It isa form of play, but a bloody serious one. . . . We also know that manyalchemists used an imaginatio vera et non phantastica in their work, which was aform of active imagination. This gives us the satisfaction of knowing that weare dealing here not with a weird innovation, but with a human experience, whichhas been lived through before. It is actually a new form of one of the oldestforms of religio, in the sense of “giving careful consideration to the numinouspowers.”1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt53]The American Satanist and philosopher Anton LaVey wrote and talked a lot aboutsomething he foresaw as a great business and phenomenon of the future:artificial human companions. What he meant by this was the integration in dailylife of life-size dolls, with which you talk, hang out, or even have sex. LaVeyhimself had an entire room designed as a 1950s bar, complete with furniture,musical instruments, a bartender and life-size guests that he had built himselfover the years. The possibility of venting anger or indulging in prurientfantasies (and behavior) in this strictly private sphere LaVey saw as somethingthat could become not only psychologically healing but also a revolutionary bigbusiness.Time has definitely caught up with this thinking. Where previously storemannequins were modified by a few pediophilic Galatea aficionados, now an entireindustry has bloomed that makes life-size dolls, complete with natural-feelingskin, various hair- and eye-color options, racial features, and physicalendowments. As with so many aspects of the development of human technology,sexual needs have been instrumental in this. Companies like the American outfitReal Doll manufacture dolls for sexual use, but they can of course equally wellbe used for polite conversation or whatever else floats your boat.If you think it’s strange that people of both sexes would indulge eroticallywith dolls or toys rather than with real people, think again. The predominantlyfemale use of dildos has been with us since time immemorial and is perhaps themost common example of adult talismanic use in our contemporary culture. The useof a proxy penis not only gives sexual and sensual pleasure but also activatesthe adult imagination immediately. Also, try to remember what you yourself (Godforbid!) or your friends did when you got a new doll in your hands. Wasn’tBarbie more or less immediately defrocked and examined between her legs? Dittowith Ken? The curiosity and relationship has been there all along.There is nowadays a gigantic global industry that has surpassed its cousin,pornography, and that is sex toys. That’s right: “toys.” And dolls constitute alarge portion of this industry of adult toy making. Does this mean that adultshave suddenly become more infantile? No, it very likely just means that themarket now acknowledges a deep-rooted human need to act out fantasies inisolated spaces that allow for not only a sexual but also an overall psychicrelease.As soon as you so desire, the pediophobic aspects of dolls in general aremagically removed, and these become alive and someone you can talk to orintegrate in your own and possibly your friends’ interactions. That is, when youyourself make that happen by opening up your mind to a reality slightly lesscausal than the normal, waking adult state of mind. The doll then becomes verymuch alive. If it’s only in your own mind or not is irrelevant. In thesubjective sphere, subjectivity rules supreme. The pediophobic quickly turnsinto the pediophilic at the very first realization that you are now alone withyour new artificial friend.One usually says that size doesn’t matter, but of course it does. Small dollsare for small humans, meaning children. But what happens when the dolls grow insize along with their owners? Well, they need to do what adults do, of course.Or what adults would like to do with other adults but for various reasons don’t.The primitive inflatable dolls with washable plastic orifices or attached dildoshave been an interesting part of human culture from the 1970s and onward. From apsychoanalytical perspective, it’s very revealing. You fill a doll with your ownbreath (of life)—or perhaps use a pump—then fuck it or are fucked by it, cleanup the mess, and eventually deflate it again. How is that for an analogy of theWestern narcissistic libido and its shame-based repression?With a new generation of life-size and life-like dolls designed for variouspurposes (basically with or without orifices), we are going to see a change inprivately controlled psychic hygiene for adults. When Anton LaVey prophesied andin a pioneering way built his own best friends, he consciously and willinglypaved the way for a potential quantum leap in human behavior:I have great respect for those who pioneer their own artificial humancompanions, crude as they might initially be. They will have come a small stepcloser to playing God and creating man or woman according to their desiredimage. With a creative outlet as cloaked in age-old taboo as this, innovationmay now run rampant—more so than any art form man has yet known.2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt54]What the kids do with their dolls is their business. What the adults do withtheirs, ditto. Those who can’t, won’t, or simply refuse to realize the potentialof pediophilic power will eventually have to find themselves becoming unwillingpuppets rather than (self-inflated) puppet masters. Interhuman communication isbecoming more banal and strenuous with each day that passes, which is in part aresult of intellectual depletion by technology. Why not rather live to thefullest and explore all the intimate facets of life together with a companion(or several) that is not terrifying and dead (nor banal and strenuous) butrather filled with exactly the kind of life and style you prefer and arestimulated by?"},{"pageContent":"12Formulating the DesiredSome Similarities between Ritual Magic and the Psychoanalytic ProcessOriginally a lecture delivered at the Psychoanalysis, Art, and the Occultsymposium, London, England, 2016.It seems to me that one is displaying no great trust in science if one cannotrely on it to accept and deal with any occult hypothesis that may turn out to becorrect.SIGMUND FREUD, “DREAMS AND THE OCCULT”1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt55]IN A SPECIFICALLY WESTERN MIND FRAME, we can see many similarities betweenritual magic and the psychoanalytic process. A lot of it has to do withformulation, lack of formulation, or, possibly, misapplied or misdirectedformulation. We are creators of our own worlds, and they in turn create theirown, on their own. Usually, for balanced individuals, the interaction betweenthe formulating strata of the psyche and the formulated expressions is welladjusted. There are also many gray areas in which there is a discrepancy betweenthe two. One such area is lying—or should we say “white lying”?—which could beseen as a minor offense of desired manipulation. Another more pathological areawould be a phenomenon like Tourette’s syndrome, in which there is a distinctlack of control of expression of key strata terms.No matter which perspective we choose to regard this interaction from, there areanalogies within the fascinating spheres of occultism and magic. I’d like tonarrow that down to a specifically Western mind frame, meaning: fairly rational,decidedly intellectual, and to a great extent ego based. Different systems couldbe looked at here: Western ceremonial, chaos, witchcraft, and so forth. I’d alsolike to narrow it down to the individual perspective. What does the individualmagician do or express? With this in mind, the equivalent of a white lie could,for instance, be a misdirected expression of will, meaning one that’s not rootedin thought-through, individuated reasoning but something perhaps more immediate,ephemeral, or reactive. And the Tourette’s angle could be the equivalent ofmagic as a lifestyle attribute rather than an essential, transforming toolthat’s perfectly valuable even though it’s not visible and frequent on socialmedia platforms.Human language is both a blessing and a curse. Nowhere is this so apparent aswhen one is talking about oneself or expressing what one wants in ritual. Well,it’s apparent in politics too, and in device-instruction manuals. Theformulation seems to take place right after the need to express has encounteredthe comfort-zone filter, and substantial things are usually lost in thistranslation. It becomes a compromise that makes perfect sense to the ego, asignal filtered out with safe noise.The destinations in terms of psychoanalysis and magical practice are basicallyone and the same: in order to change negative behavioral loops and hindrances,we gradually work on small steps and changes, very much through formulation, andhopefully learn more about ourselves while doing that. But in both cases, theroad to insight is paved with eloquent defense mechanisms and delusions ofgrandeur. In both, the underlying problematic emotional or psychic cluster isprotected by expressions of what seems to be will. That is, a desired direction.But usually it is not ingrained existential will based on a 100 percent genuinehonesty (if there is such a thing) but rather momentary bursts of what appearsto be genuine will.I am not a psychoanalyst but was in Freudian analysis for four and half years,five days a week. So if you’re tired of my voice already now, try to imaginewhat it was like for me back then! Endless verbiage, swinging from lowself-esteem to perfected hubris. But what gradually dawned, as it does, was theinsight about the verbal mind’s capacity to cheat in order to be safe, to beescapist in order to stay put, and to be intellectually alluring to stayemotionally remote. This insight was of great help in many ways, not least inthe magical work, because I eventually realized that formulation is truly thekey to development and success in this field too.If I say something like, “It is my will to resolve this current problematicissue by changing these related things,” which is what one often does early onin the magical career, as well as in psychoanalysis, this presupposes that Iknow, first, exactly what the issue consists of, and second, how theinterrelated things are actually connected. But is this usually the case? I cananswer only for myself and say that initially, I was very quick in bothdefinition and formulation, meaning that I assumed that my formulations werebased on insight and genuine will. Thereby I was very intellectual, specific,and causal in my approach. But I’d say that two-thirds of the time, in bothritual work and analysis, what was formulated was mere regurgitation of currentaffairs, frustrations, and haphazard attempts at solution rather than honestexpressions of a deeper will to change myself, which would incorporate variouscausal changes in daily life. I wanted the world to spin around me, but that canonly happen when I’m perfectly still and balanced.Here is an example from both spheres. In magic, I wanted to boost a creativeproject to manifestation in a climactic ritual state of mind, and focused onthat in a distinct mental-verbal expression, with high causal hopes. Inanalysis, I wanted to counteract then current topics of low self-esteem inrelationships by becoming more extroverted and socially active in a quite forcedway.A wiser approach would have been, in the case of magic, to express this littlespecific need through a filter of much deeper resonance: “I want this project tobe successfully manifested because that would give me a greater visibility in afield in which I honestly feel I belong on emotional levels.” And in the case ofanalysis a better approach would of course be to not counteract but instead tryto constantly get a deeper insight into why the low self-esteem was there in thefirst place, and resolve the issue. Basically, you can always go deeper andfarther and when you do that in an honest way, the perfect solutions for minorissues will become evident.In the Western sphere of occultism there is a concept called the holy guardianangel. It’s integrated into many systems and often called by different names.This relates to a principle that is either a more elevated level of your ownconsciousness that guides you, or an external principle that guides you,depending on which cosmology you ascribe to, or subscribe to. Regardless ofwhich main field we look at, it’s an intelligent principle of externalization,not necessarily as a kind of mirror (as in the case of friends in a conversationwhich can evoke a “third mind” of creative epiphanies) but rather as an idealthat nudges you in intuitive, personal ways. It’s like someone with a biggerpicture not only of where you come from and where you are, but also of where youshould be going based on who you truly are.Does that ring a bell? In analysis, this would be the analyst who remainshidden, out of sight, and who, after an initial period of bonding,passive-aggressiveness, and transference, subtly hints or suggests where to gobased on the level of sincerity of the horizontally positioned verticalaspirant.This leads on to the question if it’s at all possible to be alone in the processof self-knowledge? Do we all need a holy guardian angel and/ or a therapist? Ofcourse we’re all social animals with needs of different kinds of interaction;but what I mean is if it’s at all possible to develop alone in spiritual,magical, or therapeutic contexts? Very likely it’s not. Even the sternestgnostics and shamans need to contextualize, share information and insights, andcompare the personal findings with those of others, to refine a process that ispotentially endless.One area that’s usually at the attractive center of modern magical life, or theappreciation of modern magical life, is that of dreams. Magicians have tended tosee dreams as prophetic or as a similar kind of interactive sphere as that of aninner core, as active imagination/ daydreaming, as visions during scrying orastral travel, that is, as a considerably more active phase than the standardFreudian approach to dreams as reminders in symbol of unresolved issues. But theemphasis is there in both environments—a validation of a psychic sphere thatdemands a third of our lives, and which contains valuable information or fodderfor development. We usually refer to the dream sphere as a magical one, meaning,I suspect, that it’s devoid of mental, intellectual, and verbal shenanigans.Other, deeper forces are at play.The complex symbolic language of ritual magic and occultism may be filtered downpictograms from dreams, passed down throughout the millennia. If we accept theinterior interpretation of the holy guardian angel concept, including gradualaccessibility to Gnostic wisdom, then all of the stuff comes from the psyches ofour ancestors. Before the book form, and before formulated written language, itwas easier to contain a lot within fewer symbols. Is that, perhaps, when thecorruption and self-deceit began, that is, when we left the inherent meaning ofpictograms or symbols in favor of abstracted letters? And is that the reason whymany of them linger on in specifically magical spheres, that is, as a neededcounterforce to the more recent mental particles of formulation?From an analytic perspective this would make sense too. As we develop asindividuals through anal and oral phases and close ties to the mother,formulation is actually what sets us free and makes us able to interact withmore people than the mother. Spoken and then written language is what we use toconstruct identities apart from the merely biological ones. But it’s a two-edgedsword. Because if we have the power to define through formulation, we also haveto power to cosmetically adjust and redefine ourselves in different contexts,like playing out daddy against mommy to please your immediate ego, or vice versaif that’s what matters just then. The symbols of dreamland here become nonverbalsoothsayers and truth sayers, and the pain of confrontation with certain dreamsstands in parity with the degree of actual validity.Freud’s sexualization of human behavior, as compared to the more cosmicinterpretation variant of Jung, also finds its expression in traditional ritualmagic in the Western sense. We usually see ritualized behavior based in adramaturgy that mimics male sexual expression: intellectual outset,transcendence into an encompassing energy, increasing frenzy, ecstatic upheavalwith exclamation of more or less formulated desire, and a meditative aftermathin which the wand is laid to well-needed rest. Much of traditional ritualcontains symbolic recreations of the original creation. Almost like playacting aGenesis or big bang for personal purposes. This can be expressed in innerpreparations through invocations or evocations of third-party helpers, or inouter mapping of complex yet conducive symbologies (astrological, elemental,planetary, etc.) where the magician becomes a seed sower for a specific goal.One problem with this dramaturgy as well as with Western systems and traditionsis that they’re all alluring, complicated, challenging, and mentallystrenuous—which means “perfect” to the Western psyche. This goes for both ritualmagic and psychoanalysis. Where there’s a system that requires method, devotion,knowledge, and a lot of time (and in the case of analysis, a lot of money), yougo to master it, with the causal hope of receiving a degree, a funny hat, or adeclaration of good mental health at the end of the process tunnel. But still,the system in itself is not the refining or magical matrix. The gradual wakingup to self-deceit is.Freud’s schematic model of the psyche stems from a hierarchical culturaltradition, in which the motivating desires and drives are “sub” conscious andthat which guides us is “above” us. This is a prevalent model for most of humanlife and not even specifically based in a Western sphere. It’s thereby nosurprise that causal, hierarchical models appear in ritual magic contexts too.Whether in group settings in elaborate temples or solitary workings in the mind,there is the magician at the top, commanding the sub-forces via the centeredconsciousness of formulation. Even angelic beings within a romanticizedpseudoreligious context are commanded by words of power and elaborate symbolicstructures of correspondences in time and space. The more complex it becomes,the more complex it becomes. If the formulation of the will isn’t founded ingenuine self-knowledge, things can easily get topsy-turvy. Because a human driveis always stronger than a human intellectual concept or structure. Externalizeddualistic concepts with projected or invested moral qualities can absolutelybite back if what you exclaim doesn’t resonate with your own genuine morals.In a more analytical language, you could say that that striking out incompensation or projection may not resolve the issues at all. It very likelywill not. What’s needed is self-reflection and soul stripping in a chamber withdifferent kinds of reflective surfaces; many of them will be symbolic. If you’rediligent and honest, all mirrors will crack and there will be no moreself-images to see because you have become the sole soul-seer. That’s also theresult of the magical process. You may have wallowed through endless systems andinitiations (and related power trips) but when push comes to shove comes tocompensatory quaquaversalism comes to final stillness—hopefully!—there is onlyone unique and noise-free mind that is resonant with all other minds. On thatlevel, a brand new magic is available, with no hocus-pocus needed whatsoever.My advice both in terms of ritual magic and analysis is to dig deeper beforesomething is eventually expressed in an intellectual decompression chamber thatallows for things to manifest. The causal manifestation of something desired istotally fine as the cherry on top, but the cake as such is usually baked withconsiderably more complex and not seldom painful ingredients. That goes for boththese areas. If you strive for the cherry but can’t properly make a greatchocolate cake first, you may instead end up with steak-and-kidney pie, andensuing disappointment."},{"pageContent":"13Zine und ZeitOriginally published in The Fenris Wolf, nos. 1–3 (2011).TRANSMISSIONS OF ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE have been handed down to us over thecenturies in basically two fundamental ways: orally and in written/printed form.As for the oral transmissions, it’s usually in their very nature to be secretand secretive. One could argue that general-educational wisdom (stuff having todo with raising children, for instance, and conveying ethical codes) has beentransmitted orally through multiple generations without these demands ofsecrecy, but it’s equally true nowadays that even these invaluable everydaypieces of wisdom can be found in printed form. Or on the Internet. That doesn’tmean they become more tangible and applicable, though. General human behaviorcodes simply seem best transmitted orally.As for specific, “real” magical knowledge, I would say there are absolutelystrains and lines of wisdom that continue to be passed on—and who knows wherethey originally came from. I have encountered reliable “witnesses” possessingsuch knowledge, and I have myself been given some teachings from nonwritingmagicians that I know for sure don’t exist in any duplicated form. Given theirsecret nature, I will leave those oral aspects right here. If you wanteso-exoteric blabbermouths, please consult the Internet.In terms of the written and in various ways duplicated word, it’s literallyeasier to look at, and especially when it’s “close to home.” I think many of usshare similar sparkplugs in our esoteric engines: magical books would probablybe the most common one, that is, books that either have a strong evocativepotential or books actually dealing with magical subjects, or else a mix ofthese aspects. We hear of things, we read things, we investigate and becomeinspired. And then we read some more. The books can in themselves become genuinetotemistic objects too, if there has been a substantial charge ofinspirational-emotional energy in the reading process. This charge can last alifetime (and possibly longer) and can also be fetishistically enhanced by, forinstance, an autograph by the writer in question, or knowing that the book haspreviously been in the hands of someone important.The esoteric journal or anthology containing various minds becomes amultifaceted gemstone, with condensed expressions of human thought. The marketin general is swamped by a plethora of books containing all sorts ofcompensatory epiphanies and claims of revealing the inner mysteries of both thisand that (thank heavens book covers pretty much correspond to the contents—itsaves a lot of precious time!). But the journal, be it occult or not, has thepotential of at least displaying one or two facets one can resonate with, beinspired by, and, if one is lucky, allow to be integrated into one’s own usablewisdom. It’s a format that awakens curiosity and encourages taking a stand, proor contra. It’s a format that awakens further interest and makes you think andreflect. One crappy page of a book can be a reader killer. If you happen to findone in an anthology, just flip to the next article.Thoughts like these were going through my mind while originally working on thefirst three issues of the Fenris Wolf between 1989 and 1993. Essentially, mygoal was to collect the writings of the people I had more or less access to atthe time, and/or that I had been inspired by. “What has inspired me will verylikely inspire others too.” This is a fundamental link in the chain of thehistory of human ideas. Stuff that doesn’t really work will of necessity bediscarded. Powerful ideas and energies will be cared for and nurtured and passedon, perhaps even slightly improved. I’d say that this is one of the reasons whythe history of persecuted ideas is so endlessly fascinating. If someone iswilling to kill you because you have a dissenting idea in your mind, you canrest assured it’s a good and vital idea. Many of the occult teachings and ideashave been occult for a very good reason: self-preservation. But when the time isright, the flower in question will eventually bloom.Also, there is one very substantial thing that I learned while working withvarious music fanzines earlier on: the world is malleable to a greater extentthan what we’re raised to believe—another very important magical insight. It’snot impossible to penetrate new environments or cause change to occur in“conformity with will.” It’s not impossible to ask someone for something.Actually, my experience tells me that the answers to my requests have beenaffirmative and supportive more often than not.These two aspects—a will to relay/transmit and a realization that it is actuallypossible—became the cornerstones of my youthful folly in the wonderful worlds ofgarage rock, sleazy films, experimental art, and worn-out antiheroes. Chat andsnap, cut and paste (I mean that literally), print or Xerox, and distributeyourself (again, literally) at concerts and record stores. Very primitive stuff,but it worked. In fact it worked very well, and for each new issue, more doorsopened. In my mind, there was already a formulation that what I was doing wasmagical in that sexy, supra-causal sense. As I drifted more and more into thehocus-pocus quagmire, my first priority was not to secure a gallant robe or anextravagant wand to zap the cosmic forces. No, the first priority was to createan occult fanzine, through which I could weave my own magical spells. If youhaven’t guessed it already, it was the birth of The Fenris Wolf.Have you been aroused by a blog lately? I’m sorry to say I haven’t. I don’tthink I ever have, come to think of it. But when I flip through old issues ofChaos International, Starfire, Nuit-Isis, the Cloven Hoof, the Black Flame, oldTOPY newsletters and fanzines, or the Cincinatti Journal of Ceremonial Magic, Ican feel a tingle that is sometimes decidedly more sexual than cerebral. Why isthis? It’s because the tiny magazine or fanzine in question has been chargedwith intellectual or magical energy, best summarized as a will to share radical,substantial human thought from a unique vantage point. This energy sort ofradiates from the pages, no matter how poorly printed they are. I hope the firstthree numbers of Fenris Wolf emit that same goodwill (some would say completeevil will). I think they do, but I’m probably too partial.The return of the book-book is apparent these days, no doubt a backlash againstdigiculture, e-books, and toilet-paper paperbacks. For more on magical aspectsof bibliophilia in relation to the grimoire tradition, please read Peter Grey’sexcellent piece in the fourth issue of The Fenris Wolf, “Barbarians at theGates.” It really goes without saying, but I feel compelled to say it again:tangible quality will last. Ephemeral digi-snippets of the contemporary will notlast. If you want to share something and make some kind of impact while doingit, share it either straight (live) into people’s hearts and minds or intangible, multidimensional forms. So far, the printed book has proven itself aworthy winner in this regard. I strongly suspect this will remain so for a long,long time.And when this long, long time has passed, I suspect that the impression of ourown written magical transmissions will be a fragmented jumble of disparateexpressions, each with distinct suggestions on how to cope with an array ofproblems and challenges—that is, a more or less exact reflection of the times wewere living in then (now), albeit garbed in esoteric lingo.I think the historic hocus-pocus traces will be obvious (in many ways, theyalready are). In or about the mid-1970s, a mere decade after the Aquarianpsychedelic big bang, a huge release of creative energy settled in while we were(re-)evaluating those historic traces. Some have since preferred theconservative, museal, and cerebral approaches, while others have embraced a moreanarchic, intuitive one, and then a zillion other approaches on top of that.However, what unites all serious expressions is that they will be regarded asserious down the line too.One group or splinter fragment can’t tell the entire story, as historians sowell know. The more parts we have from the same totality, the bigger thepicture, of course. Firsthand sources have a tendency to die, but secondhandones have so far lived on for thousands of years, through the blessings ofdiligent monks (and others who could write and duplicate texts) and primitiveprinting presses. The more firsthand experiences that will be correctlydocumented and relayed, the clearer the overall picture. And here’s exactlywhere will-fueled initiatives like magical publications, be they “order-biased”or not, have a huge advantage over academic writing, as they not only can butrather inherently insist on expressing emotion and wonder as well as merechronological, factual accounts and further bibliographic references. Thatholistic dynamic of enchantment is required to fully “get” the picture. Historyas such, esoteric or otherwise, is never objective in its creation.If a piece of writing doesn’t express some sort of subjective emotionality or adistinctly personal experience, we have to cock an eye at its validity ashistoric “meme.” If there’s a too chronological or too distanced an approach, wecan be certain that there’s been an adjusted editorial process in action,usually in the name of objectivity. A peer review can just as easily be spelledpeer pressure. And this, paradoxical as it may sound, is of course always biasedand partial.Don’t forget that the biggest chunk of the word history is story. The moresubjective stories we have, the better we can create our own synthesis, our ownindividual Gesamt-evaluation.Magical experimentation in various fields of natural sciences, arts, music,literature, and so forth have later on become fundaments of “established” dogmain these fields. Perhaps what we have to consciously take into account now isthe importance of “scripting” the future through various magical publicationsand shared efforts. Some aspects of science seem to be catching up a bit, butthe magical sciences will always be way ahead when it comes to human potentialresearch. I believe that all of the idealistic fanzines and small publicationsfrom these past decades will later on be looked upon as seeds, as sperm, waitingand waiting to fertilize some human mind-womb of the future. The ejaculatoryprocess is swift and violent; human development not quite so.I can sense (vague, I know, but deliberately so) that there has been an increasein occult diplomacy during the past decade, circa 2000 to 2010. This has,according to me, very much taken place through an energy-level increase inperiodicals, books, and human interaction (symposia, conferences, festivals, andso on, not forgetting the integration of esoteric subjects and courses withinacademia, which has been a great step forward).The Internet hasn’t really turned out to be a garden of occult wisdom (not thesame as information), but has certainly become useful as an extended addressbook and PR tool. Traces of the networking and sharing of resources, asexperimented with in Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth in the 1980s, for instance,shifted shape and did indeed become a digitized storehouse of potential, albeitstill dressed in the emperor’s new clothes. The exchange of pompous,Masonic-looking certificates of mutual recognition has been replaced by a morethorough exchange of substantial information on grassroots levels, a merging ofminds through tangible means, and a pragmatic occasional union based ontolerance. If the general objective is to further the individual in her attemptsat elevation, of necessity tied in with a larger planetary need for survivalstrategies, then sectarian approaches and retentive affiliations might not bethe best idea. Am I deluded when I claim that a new wave of occult publishershas been very instrumental in this Mercurial greasing process?If Aleister Crowley hadn’t worked so hard on publishing his occult writings ingood, solid editions, he would very likely have been remembered merely throughreferences from the gutter press of his time—like a vilified footnote in thehistory of British debauchery. Crowley’s ambitious efforts not only at writingbut also at publishing his thoughts and ideas, and his Herculean labor ofhustling copies (truly the “Great Work” for us all!), in many ways constitutethe foundation of the extremely vital journal- and book-publishing environmentwe enjoy at the beginning of the twenty-first century, and which, in turn, willhelp change minds, perceptions, and cultures now and in the future to a muchgreater extent than, I suspect, Crowley could ever foresee.And let’s not forget the magnificent entertainment aspect of occultpublications. Idealism really is a lovely thing. There doesn’t need to be aconflict between substance and lack of distance. No arena of human endeavor hasbeen more touched by divine(?) madness than occultism. Delusions of grandeur inunchecked contexts create a splendidly entertaining stratification process. Butwhen it’s only spewed out in ugly and eye-draining Internet fora, who reallycares? I see a very bright future for printed matter containing idealisticexpressions, and one of many reasons for that view is that it takes real effortand real knowledge to create something that others want to touch and be touchedby. Immediacy and complacency are usually very snug bedfellows.Within this spectrum of efforts, there is one very usable common denominatorthat is also one of the cornerstones of magical practice: you use what you haveand you use it to the maximum. You can’t use more than you have in magic. Ifyou’re deluded and think that you can, it will very soon be made clear that youcan’t. Ritual magic and its synchronistically sparkling mind-universe isn’t acredit-based economy. You are what you are and you have what you have. If youcan play with that, it’s likely that you can change certain things for thebetter. That mere potential of change is of course also exactly what attractsthe Napoleon-Cleopatra contingent of “spiritual” loonies, that is, those withouta solid firmament of substantial self-knowledge. But today they are more likelyto ramrod online than to make books and magazines that require hard work andslightly more than an imagined crowd of admirers.Looking back at the post-punk era and its spontaneous expressions, we find thatthe ones that have lasted, in the sense of still having a tangible presence, arethose with a genuine will to express something, and then an intelligence toexpress and shape that into a form that speaks to its desired audience. As we’remainly book nerds here on these pages, I will leave the immense spectrum ofmusic. Suffice to say that the DIY ethic, from the 1960s and onward (and with aparticularly forceful impetus in the late 1970s), has created a great manycottage industries producing truly unique musical works, packages, products,concerts, and so forth. Most of these instigators used what they had access toand nothing more. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way.” Is there a lesson here,why those products today (usually) fetch a higher secondhand price than a“top-ten chartbuster” that was issued in a gazillion copies? Of course there is.And the same goes for books, periodicals, and artworks.Many thousands of years ago, the proper development of papyrus (Egyptian waterreed) enabled a more elaborate and extensive writing process. A focus onreligious and magical topics in writing was of course prevalent all over theMediterranean hotbed of philosophy and spiritual speculation. The esoterictransmission may still have been oral, but as the Christian tyranny grew infervor and indiscriminately killed off philosophers and burned manuscripts, theneed for duplication and documentation became painfully obvious. The symbol ofAlexandria’s library burning (possibly the most vile act of terrorism ever) isrelevant in the history of magical writing.And then, there was . . . Well, I think you know that story quite well. Andperhaps it’s more interesting to start thinking about the future, now that wecan safely study how the history of human ideas and creativity has been soeminently safeguarded by many wise women and men of various shades and shapes.Is it perhaps now our turn to face the future and leave something inspirationalbehind?The magico-existentialist punches remain the same: Who are you? What do youhave? What do you want to express? Find out in a genuinely honest way and you’rehalfway there already. As for the future: script it and script it well!"},{"pageContent":"14The Mega Golem Is Alive and WellOriginally published in the Canadian magazine Pillars (forthcoming, 2018).A man and a woman were hanging round each other’s necks. Nearer and nearer drewthe corybantic throng; louder and louder the sound of the shouting. But my braceof revellers had turned now into one single form, half male, half female—ahermaphrodite, seated on a throne of pearl. On its head was a crown of a brightred wood, on which the Worm of Destruction had gnawed mysterious runic figures.Pattering blindly behind came a flock of miniature sheep, in a cloud ofdust—perambulating provender that the strange apparition trailed in its wake tofeed its train of dancing dervishes.GUSTAV MEYRINK, THE GOLEM1 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt56]ONCE UPON A TIME, as my loathing for the art-world subspecies phenomenon“curator” grew and grew, I philosophized a lot about the nature of art. Is it atall possible to define what art is or means? If possible, for whom would such adefinition be beneficial?The more I thought about it, the closer I got to the very roots of humanculture. Initially, art was tied in with magic, which was tied in with lifeitself. “Instigating magical change through aestheticized personal expression,thereby enhancing the experience of life” was the closest I could get in my owndefinition. Whether this just rang true as a justification for my own disdainfor soulless, postmodern, intellectual art or actually works as a generaldefinition, I don’t know. But it made me think of the possibilities involved. Somuch (basically all) of primordial art consists of integrated talismanicessence. If art needs to be magical to be art and magic always inherentlyexpresses itself through art, then it’s just a matter of being (sub)conscious inthe execution, isn’t it?The classic concept of the golem arose from the depths as I first actuallyassociated the word talismanic with jewelry, smaller objects, sigils onsurfaces, and so on. But the grand scale, in which externalized forces actuallycome alive and move about, is sometimes more alluring than the miniature world.Another aspect intruded: tangibility versus intangibility. Where so much ofcontemporary art is produced in order to be not only tangible and visible butalso commodified in adaptation to a market, wouldn’t it be interesting to createart that is intangible and invisible? And that despite this moves about andmanifests change?I remember vividly how greatly I was affected by Gustav Meyrink’s classic “morePoe than Poe” novel The Golem in my youth. And that film trilogy by Paul Wegenerand Henrik Galeen from the 1910s (The Golem: Monster of Fate, The Golem and theDancing Girl, and The Golem: How He Came into the World) was truly mind-bogglingstuff that helped solidify a romanticized pop notion of what a magical golembeing is, and totally on par with Dr. Frankenstein’s more well-known creation.But Meyrink’s book contains deep implications beyond the merely “fantastic.”Integrated in a fairly muddled narrative are facets of dreamscapes, multiple (orshould we say interchangeable?) personalities, upheaval of linear time,reverence for the hermaphroditic, and distinct magical thinking. The golemitself thereby becomes more than a feared mythological projection in history,and instead becomes a representation of a dynamic human psyche outside theconfines of order and waking, rational rigidity—which is basically what artshould be a projection out of/from—at least under the umbrella of my own,above-mentioned definition. I realized that I wanted to create a soulful “megagolem” as a counterforce to postmodern intellectualism and commodified, tangiblesurfaces.I have given the subject much thought, and the nearest I can get to the truth ofit seems to be this: that once in every generation a spiritual disturbancezig-zags, like a flash of lightning, right through the Ghetto, taking possessionof the souls of the living to some end we know not of, and rising in the form ofa wraith that appears to our senses in the guise of a human entity that once,centuries ago, maybe, inhabited here, and is craving materialization.2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt57]So how to apply a celebration of the golem as concept on concrete execution andtasks? In my own case, the first phase contained less thinking and more doing.In 2011, British artist Vicki Bennett invited Cotton Ferox (that is, ThomasTibert and me) to make a piece of music for a program called “Radio Boredcast.”As we had already been experimenting with magically charged texts within theconfines of charged music, this turned out to be a very natural progression. Thedifference was that this became the first “Mega Golem Official Transmission.”The text was written as the first investment in the “corpus”—in this case theMega Golem’s cock and balls, a suitable place to begin when creating something.I wrote the text, recorded it, and integrated it in the Cotton Ferox album (andfilm) A Mega Golem Official Transmission:A Mega Golem Official Transmission (Penis & Testicles)image [images/img_003.jpg]The following is an official Mega Golem Broadcast Transmission of Cock and Ballspresence and a declaration of moral independence in the digital ether. May theMega Golem live long and prosper!I’m envisioning time right now. Time is slow-moving, a soft staccato when wewatch it, like the slow motion of the film and television segments we have grownup to love. We only see parts of the image flow we’re supposed to in ourmechanical sensory hegemony, and instead our minds try to patch up the fragmentsand make a new, more or less cohesive sequence; one that appears to be slow,regardless of whether the “measured” time from beginning to end is the same ornot.Measuring doesn’t in any way indicate or display objective truth. Measuring isjust a language in itself for those who speak measurian. Remember, for instance,that in the old days, sports used to be competition between individuals or teamsof individuals. Today it is very much a self-righteous romance of measurementfrenzy. Fractions of measured items and units are compared. Achievement is nolonger a human trait of triumph but rather something that receives existence bythe measurement and integration into the technology of statistics. Are werobots? Are we not? Well, they certainly are.Let us therefore measure no more. The proof is not in the pudding any more thansize matters. What matters is charge and discharge, passion, contrast, conflict,energy, ejaculation, emission, the strength of the moment in its own dissolving.There are no more supernovas or black holes in the universe, only an endlessmulticolored flow of energy that is a reflection of subjective truth. What’s notto love about that? In fact, you can absolutely be that dissolved momentyourself. Please take some time—the slow kind—and think about it.People seem happy to talk about the concept of the attention span but then theyimmediately forget why. If one more advertising campaign tells me that theirproduct can simplify my life, I will have to use force in my decline of theiroffer. Nothing complicates more than new simplifications. Want simplicity? Well,begin by discarding all those simplifying tools. Want an attention span? Well,stop thinking about it. Want more time? Well, cease your agenda chopping. Want aslower time? Well, do less.Time and time again, timeless time, philosophers have suggested remedies.They’re all good in their own peculiar way. Do less doesn’t mean that, literallyor necessarily, but just do less in that contemporary manner that fragments yourview into tiny pieces—all measurable of course—and instead do more in painting abigger picture: your own picture. Reclaim your own mind and everything will betotally fine. You will be disillusioned and slightly bitter of course becauseyou will realize that you have wasted exactly what you have now reclaimed: TIME.However, in the end nothing matters. But until then, some things do. Your ownmind, for instance, and your own time.So, okay, freedom is actually here now. It’s a joy, a blessing, an existentialgoodie bag of options. Will is here too. Hi, Will! How are you? Doing well, Ihope. Actually, I know you’re doing well. I’m happy about it. We’re meshed inthe afternoon and around the clock of measured time. And outside the circles ofthat other time too, of course. “Love lifts us up where we belong.”So many options. So many potions. Diligence has paid off . . . doubt.Perseverance has paid off . . . persecution. I’m now in a position that isblessed, fully integrated in a Mega Golem’s cock and balls. What a magnificentprivilege. There will be others in the same position after me, I’m sure, butright now it does feel like a genuinely pioneering exploration of possibilities.My will be done! My will in the Mega Golem’s cock and balls. Right-o, here wecome!The writing is read and the reading is right. Never have I been able to expressmyself any better than in that little sentence. It’s like a prison sentence ofan immeasurable freedom, a sui generis je ne sais quoi of a fait accompli thatreally sums me up. If I could tap and sell that, I’d be a gazillionaire. But ofcourse it’s neither tappable nor for sale, and I like that. And I’m still agazillionaire of sorts.Which brings us to pecuniary possibilities. They overflow. I am amazed. Havemoney? Here I am. Thank you very much. I’m polite and grateful and you have justbeen in contact with someone you probably needed to be in contact with. Simpleas that. Every situation is a potential win-win situation and that’s why thepecuniary flow passes through me but also leaves a staggering residue ofaffluence and a more-than-enoughish taint. Best to invest with zest at my ownbehest!Now, what exactly is it that I do? Am I in the right position? Well, I look andsee and then I recount in my own way. This has happened, take it or leave it. Iused to think this was escapism or a psychological-emotional fulfilment, butit’s not. It’s about making a contribution to the unlimited collage, the QuantumQuilt, that is the overall human existence on this planet and in this omniverse.History-writing in four or even more dimensions. Yes, I write, I read, I cast anoccasional spell, I aspire, I inspire, I take pictures, I make pictures likereflection surfaces, I’m the Mega Golem’s cock and balls—a really privilegedposition to be in, I should add—and I enjoy it more than I dare to even admit(probably for superstitious reasons).The activities and methods are fine and decidedly well modeled. A nice andfunctioning structure, on the whole and in the hole. The applications andimplementations are being retuned and re-focused, with great success. Diligence,perseverance, the ability to move slowly at a fast pace, self-discipline,honesty, and so forth. The usual suspects and ingredients are present.The words affix themselves to the worlds. The worlds filter themselves throughthe words. The images are parts of the imaginations, the nations of images, allseeking each other out like grounded magnets, polarities, or cruising sybaritesof the night. If we stop and look, we can see a pattern. Others can too, and arecertainly willing to pay dearly for the privilege. Thank you very much. Thepattern is a mind pattern and that pattern is mine. Imagination is the essenceof the apprehension of truth that includes possibilities and makes everysituation a potential win-win situation. Come to think about it, imagination isthe only truth, with dreams a close-sniffing second: a brother in arms in thewar against mechanical minds and the slaves of measurement and the slaves oftheir own uncut umbilical chords of empiricism. Fuck them until they fallasleep. Fuck them until they wake up. That’s the task of the Mega Golem’s cockand balls: to impregnate them with what they fear most: a reflection ofthemselves and everything they have denied themselves. Thank you very much.But, please, let’s not be dogmatic about it. Not polemical. Many of those whohave trod in similar shoes before have failed because of the dogmatic, polemicalaspects, the needs in themselves to compensate for their own essentially weakegos and neuroses. Much better to set a good example of self-preservation andsuccess—and so much more enjoyable!—than to rant away mechanically until no onecares to listen.The Mega Golem’s cock and balls, ever ready, hard, and fertile. The orifices ofyour own ears have just been penetrated. It felt quite good, right? “Anothertime, another orifice”—that’s my motto now. Free will. Free love. Responsibilityto the responsible and good times all around!“Adieu, adieu, parting is such sweet sorrow.” But it’s not a parting per se.It’s only a parting of the veil. It’s a new opening, a new orifice. It’s just atemporary farewell, a little rest before new battles begin and new mind fieldsare ploughed. We can patch up the fragments now and slow things down, actingfast while appearing totally and irrevocably still. Still, moving. Still, life.Not long after this film and spoken-word piece were finished, Cotton Feroxplayed in Warsaw, Poland. Knowing that this meant an excellent opportunity to go“full throttle” with the butterfly effect via sonic amplification, I decided togive birth to the actual Mega Golem being. Before this I had also extendedinvitations to artists I knew who are perceptive enough to understand theconcept. I told them that if they wanted to, they could contribute a piece ofart (any kind) to the Mega Golem. It could be a thought, a sentiment, or a pieceof its multi-gender/hermaphroditic body. It could be visible, invisible, orindivisible. And they didn’t even have to tell me about it either.With the film being projected on stage, and with Thomas Tibert and Dr. Zarazacreating suggestive soundscapes behind me, I put on my red plastic devil maskand entered the birth pangs by reading the following poem:MEGA GOLEM (BIRTH)Mega GolemHere you areMega GolemBright new starGrowing strongerBy the dayGrowing longerHere to stayimage [images/img_002.jpg]Limbs of forceAnd fury tooNo remorseOne love—or twoArt by artPiece by pieceYou are smartAnd still at easeMega GolemDo your thingMega GolemIn the swingOf things to comeThe Is to BeFeared by someRevered by meSo it is done!And indeed it was! I felt elated, excited, aroused, and intensely satisfied. Nowit was all beyond my control (such a wonderful feeling!). I had set the creaturein motion, charged with my will, and I could now no longer perceive it with myown senses and sensibilities. The Mega Golem was born.Some of my artist friends got in touch to learn more. A few let me know thatthey had indeed created something for the Mega Golem but didn’t want to tell meexactly what. Which was perfectly fine. The project had already turned into apsychic, transdimensional exquisite corpse, and I could feel anothercontribution was forthcoming from myself. The following Cotton Ferox concert, inStockholm in May 2014, offered another chance to go beyond the predictablespoken-word experience and instead ejaculate more Golemic seed. As there was nowalready (at least) a cock and balls, and life, there needed to be a continuedbreathing process. I put on the devil mask again and indulged in this:ART SET FREE (BREATH)Heed the lettersHeed the booksHeed the moneyFeed the looksA web of wondersNear and farA clearer pictureOf who we areAnd can becomeThe Is to BeAnd will becomeThe life in meOpen up the doors of marketsOpen up the doors of artOpen up the doors of mind framesThis is just a humble startThe trap is dissolvedAnd art set freeFor those involvedBoth you and meimage [images/img_002.jpg]In it goes and out it comesMultiplying possibilitiesDisinformationDisinterestDisintegrationDisposabilityDisseminationDistributionInto the world we comeAnd it feels goodSo mote it be!Suddenly, the Mega Golem not only existed but started breathing regularly, stillout there and still seeing all the worlds and dimensions. The next keyingredient of its system should then be the ability to not only livemechanically/predictably but also to appreciate and enhance life by creativity.Next stop: Libido! This was manifested in the spring of 2016, again in Warsaw,and again embraced by the sonorous safety of Cotton Ferox. No devil mask thistime, but still in the same spirit:UNFOLDING (FOR VANESSA) (LIBIDO)Rising up from the deadThe sleeping, resting, waitingOnce again in material formTemporarily in transitWaiting to be delivered yet againWelcome the possibilitiesAnointed with witches’ oilA sublime transdimensional expressionOf LoveWelcome backMay it unfold in a life-enhancing way for us bothAnd for all involvedOne step at a timeWill fix desireIt constrains the mobility of desireThere are no existential safety netsWhen you don’t existBring it onAs alwaysUnfoldingEnhancingUnitingCreatingIn the best possible wayOccupy both and all positions at onceLet’s applaud being too privilegedFor what has already beenEternal thanksFor what isEternal thanksFor what’s yet to comeEternal thanksGratitude is sometimes not enoughBut it is a currency that mattersIn the big picture of lifeBeing blessed should not be taken for grantedOr lightlyTime breaks down barriersAs we break down the barriers of timeThe wheel continuesA hypnagogic triumphA hypnopompic truthA ruseTotal allusionA simileAn edge that pierces the crustIt eludes usAnd instills within us all that we needTo knowTo dareTo willAnd to be silentShortly after this, an important contribution also appeared from the outside.The talented American occult philosopher and writer Kadmus sent in a poem for myannual occultural journal The Fenris Wolf, which gave the Mega Golem a healthyand steady heartbeat. This vitalized the creation as such, and I reinforced thepoem by reading it out aloud on the launch evening for the publication in Londonin September of 2016.A FRAGMENT OF HEART (A CONTRIBUTION TO THE MEGA GOLEM BY KADMUS)Something stirs—Where once rivers flowed,Where the ghosts of trees restUnremembered.Something wakens—From concreteOnce mossy banks,And blinks.It cherishes—How the crows used to gossip in the branchesJust so,And the stones of the river winkedWith hidden quartz.It shelters—The echoes of days without timeWhen walks went on foreverAnd we watched clouds play tagWith our backs bruised with grass stains.Something smiles—Where slim stalks will growAnd angry voices will rise in joyTo demand life for the earthThe voiceful windThe wine-dark seaThe shivering waveThe silken skyOnce more.Something remembers—The songs we will strikeLike bonfiresIn the fields at the end of history.You can hear its voice calling us togetherHidden in the folds of the breezeIn the corners of the nightWhen no tread paces.“Golem?” it asks,“Call me Hope.”And this is where the Mega Golem now resides in time and space; alive, vital,sexual (to my knowledge, it currently has one penis and two vaginas—oh, luckycreature!), and willful. I have no idea where this will end, and actuallysuspect it never will. It definitely contains my charges, and possibly others’too, so it’s preoccupied all right.

It may someday contain a part of you too, extended into the realms ofmagic, fantasy, and dreams—that is, the sphere of the ultimately real.Hear and understand.

That was true of him as a persontoo, of course. On many levels, he was a synthesizing occult pioneer whoinitiated changes that would later become very important. Of course, he wasn’tan isolated force during this general liberalization of the twentieth century.There were many individuals, things, and movements that opened up many radicaldevelopments.Crowley’s own environment and background, post-Victorian and bourgeois, wasn’tonly attacked by him but also, slightly earlier, by Oscar Wilde and his loverAlfred Douglas. This public scandal brought forth stronger reverberations thanthose Crowley would later create—much to his disdain and frustration of coursey.But the Wilde scandal was an interesting development at the time, as it brokenot only sexual conventions but also other, more deeply rooted ones—specificallyan audacious visibility in the public sphere. A certain sexual tolerance towardthe cultural sphere has always existed, even in Great Britain.*5[9781620557044_ftn.xhtml#ft5] If you cross more lines than the accepted quota,there will be conflict. But out of conflict something new and vital alwaysarises.The First World War was obviously a revolutionary force. The effects of fouryears of brutal war on European soil created an ever-faster swinging pendulummovement between a strongly defined and developed liberalism on the one hand,and a strong and elaborate totalitarianism in communism and National Socialismon the other. Women’s liberation and their right to vote spread quickly in thedemocratic countries. Woman as a distinct member of society was now suddenly aforce to be reckoned with.For Crowley, who was born in 1875, this surely meant positive feelings on aphilosophical level but perhaps slightly less so in the private sphere.Crowley’s attitude toward women were about as complex as he himself was. When itcame to abstracted individuals in a philosophical context every man and everywoman was a star with the potential to find out his or her own voice and will.But when it came to his own relationships, things were, as it’s nowadays said,complicated.To a great degree, Crowley worked within a utilitarian mind frame, especiallyfrom the 1910s and onward. Regardless if we talk about longer relationships orbrief rendezvous, Crowley literally wanted to use women as ejaculators ofenergies that can be directed and create new life in different forms, way, waybeyond the conventions of petit bourgeois sexuality. For him, everything wasritual, regardless if the sexual partner in question was aware of it or not.In Crowley’s central text, Liber AL (The Book of the Law) there are manyreferences to sexual mysteries and an all-encompassing new set of morals. At thetime of the writing of this allegedly channeled text, Crowley wasn’t initiatedinto sexual mysteries. The text confused and attracted him at the same time. Buthe did have an intuitive comprehension of how magic works, and he, according tohimself at least, was a magical natural force that had appeared in order tochange this planet’s destiny in overturning ways. It wasn’t until the 1910s,when he had been in touch with the German fraternal order Ordo Templi Orientis(OTO), that he and this group could create a synthesis of what both parties wereinterested in: sexual magic.Liber AL is a cryptic text, difficult to interpret, and furthermore with anofficial decree that only Crowley in his position as scribe is really allowed tointerpret it. The book consists of three chapters, each one clothed in Egyptianterminology. The first chapter, dedicated to the goddess Nuit, describesinfinite cosmic potential. In this potential there is pleasure, beauty, andattractional force, but it’s not tangible or perceivable before you have adirection, a goal. This constitutes chapter two, dedicated to Hadit (not to beconfused with the Hadith, the prophet Muhammad’s moral codex). When Nuit andHadit meet in union there is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, which traditionally is an aspect ofthe main solar deity Ra. In this union exists an aggressive energy with thepower both to create and destroy. This trio is what constitutes magicalpotential in Crowley’s cosmology.In the text there is implicitly a formulation or formula that replaces previousmagical formulas stemming from Judeo-Christian sources. This is called 0 = 2 or,by simple mathematical logic, 2 = 0. Crowley explained it like this: “Every actof ‘love under will’ has the dual result 1) the creation of a child combiningthe qualities of its parents, 2) the withdrawal by ecstasy into Nothingness.”1[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt59] Just as division of a unity leads to two parts,these two parts can create not only a new unity but also a dissolution in andthrough the unity in question. Where classic magical formula making up untilthen had been built on a literally familiar order of succession (Yod, He, Vau,He, Father, Mother, Son, Daughter, new life, etc.), we can now see aconsiderably more Asian attitude in Crowley’s mind.Most of us are aware, both on instinctive and personal levels, that sex is themost potent form of energy a human being can experience. There is not only thepossibility to create new human life but also, at the moment of orgasm, to be anactive part of a transcendental experience without comparison. Sex has alwaysbeen present in magical and religious contexts as a very fundamental part.Either as liberating or enslaving, depending on the society, culture, orreigning power structure in question.There were other interesting things going on at this time than Crowley’sawakenings and fascinating Oscar Wilde scandals. Within physics the terms fusionand fission were clarified and codified. That is, the setting free of energy inthe interaction of atoms, either through merging or splitting. Put simply: thestronger the attraction is between or within atoms, the stronger the energy setfree in the meeting. The Danish scientist Niels Bohr’s work with establishingwhat was to be called quantum mechanical principles in the energy flows of atomsled to his Nobel Prize in 1922. The German scientist Karl Heisenberg was anothergiant who received the Nobel Prize in 1932 for the development of quantummechanics. The relationship between quantum mechanics and magic as aproto-science is so strong that you can almost say that it doesn’t appear to berandom that both magic and radical physics developed so quickly and in such aparallel way during the early twentieth century.We can talk about it on a human existential level, on a microlevel in atomicperspectives, and on a larger, cosmic level. The sun and the stars simply existand generate so much energy that it makes our lives possible and facilitates mystanding here talking and you listening. Crowley was well aware of thesefundamental scientific basics and often referred to a scientific, empiricalmethod in his works. He also called his system “solar-phallic.” The sun is inmany ways the highest divine principle and it’s fueled by fusion energy. Thehighest tangible level or mirroring within the human being of this solar-phallicpower is sex, and its main representative, according to Crowley, the male sexualorgan.However, this is not synonymous with phallic worship, which has been aconsistent part of human religious history. The interesting thing from amagico-anthropological perspective is that phallic worship seemed to cease ashumans left a holistic attitude within fertility cults and natural religion, notseldom containing hermaphroditic ideals, in favor of a dualism in which man isregarded as active and woman passive—decidedly an Abrahamic, monotheisticmetaphor for power structures rather than sexual dynamics per se.Crowley formulated that the emerging aeon was in need of new magical systems:“The true magick of Horus requires the passionate union of opposites.”2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt60] This also goes well beyond the merely sexualmetaphor. Passionate doesn’t necessarily mean loving or even benevolent. Bigpolitical cataclysms during which opponents clash often lead to constructivethird-side solutions, either through compromise or unexpected quantum leaps. Andthey can certainly be passionate. It is within the unique moment wherediametrical forces clash that energy is set free. If you have insight,understanding, and respect it’s absolutely possible to direct this energy towardnew goals.Crowley felt overwhelmed by Liber AL, meaning “honor and duty bound,” andobligated to interpret the mysteries of the text. His entire magical work andauthorship would soon focus on the creation of Thelema, a philosophy stemmingfrom Liber AL. And that’s basically how it continued all the way up until hisdeath in 1947.The OTO contained a more concrete structure, which attracted Crowley. Thesources of the group’s teachings and mysteries have later been criticized forbeing not only mystical but also mythical. According to this possible myth theorder received both textual sources and oral teachings and initiations from Asiavia the Middle East. These thoughts or streams were in no way new but rathersigns of a budding cosmopolitan knowledge and interest at the end of thenineteenth century, via an opening up of Asia Minor as well as Major. Perhapsthis was in many ways a romanticized current, but that in no way makes thephenomenon less substantial or valid. The OTO quickly became an attractivefraternity among Freemasons who were lured in by the sexual mysteries themselvesbut also by the pretty relevant fact that here, even women were allowedinitiation. Eventually, a synthesis of both parts was created: the Germanorganization with a distinctly Freemasonic, albeit open-minded, structure andthe chaotic Great Beast Crowley’s Thelema philosophy and its magical excellence.The books Hymns to the Goddess and Tantra of the Great Liberation, written byArthur Avalon (John Woodroffe) and both published in 1913, brought in Hindumagical aspects to Western minds. The slightly later Shakti & Shakta (1918) andThe Serpent Power (1919) carried on Avalon’s popularization of terms or notionslike tantrism and kundalini yoga. Another parallel strain was the German RichardWilhelm, whose translations from the Chinese were relevant in this context. HisSecret of the Golden Flower was published in English in 1931, with anintroduction by Carl Jung, and was an important insight into sexual aspects ofTaoism. Taoism had become increasingly important for Crowley after aspecifically Taoist epiphany or illumination in America in 1918: “Whoever seekseternal life must search for the place whence human nature and life originallysprang.”3 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt61]Crowley’s integration of the I-Ching, the Book of Changes, maybe didn’t have adistinctly sexual importance, but it’s indicative of an openness to cultureswhose work with sexual magical techniques had up until this time been fairlyunknown, or “mythical.” It was as if the time was now ripe for universal secretsconcerning proto-generative energies to emerge from the depths and bereformulated by Westerners, either through translations (Wilhelm) or synthesis(Crowley, OTO). This didn’t necessarily mean instant explanations of everythingfor an unenlightened mass of people but definitely an availability of materialand thereby an opportunity for proper studies.Crowley’s Gnostic Mass, written in 1913, became central in his life and systemwithin the OTO, and still is. The idea was that this ceremony would be ascentral within the OTO and Thelema as the Catholic Mass within the RomanCatholic Church. For Crowley and his followers, the ceremonial performance of anintimate act, loaded with sexual symbolism and secrets from many differentesoteric traditions, became a celebration of the proto-generative force in asublime and aestheticized form. Crowley, who was scientifically inclined, wasalso concerned that he “would neither make nor imply any statement about naturewhich would not be endorsed by the most materialistic man of science.”4[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt62]One section in the Gnostic Mass is the honoring of what Crowley called thegnostic saints. This is a long and thorough list of mythical and actual personswho directly or, most often, indirectly, helped out with the development ofThelema. Remarkably, the list consists only of men, which has led to manyinteresting debates and discussions within the Thelemic environment. Should onehere simply regard Crowley as a child of his times, or was he actually just amale chauvinist pig? Or could it possibly be, as has been claimed, that thepotential of women lies far beyond and above these worldly men’s destinies andmanifestations? In an aggressively gender-baiting intellectual climate like oursit’s not surprising that this issue stirs up emotions. But at the same time it’seasy to see who is actually placed on the altar in the ceremony and who isworshiped not only as a concrete life giver but also as a metaphorical catalystfor all creation. Perhaps this is best expressed in the famous words of wisdom:“If you want something said, ask a man. If you want something done, ask awoman.” (Margaret Thatcher)The list of possible female gnostic saints could of course be quite long.Perhaps it wouldn’t actually contain Margaret Thatcher, but most definitely thewoman who uttered “Is that a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?”(Mae West)Sexual insights, techniques, and rituals were incorporated in the existinghierarchical degree system of the OTO. Crowley explored all of this intenselyafter he had received a carte blanche to study the degrees, and also to developthem. In this fervent work as not only a magician but now also a sex magician,Crowley naturally needed someone to work with. Perhaps his German Freemasonbrothers weren’t the most attractive candidates in this sexual context. The needfor willing women became clear and urgent, women who were either attracted bythe “Great Beast” in Crowley, by his reputation, or who simply didn’t have aclue what was going on on the astral planes during these cosmic sexualcongresses.For Crowley, who in his bisexuality was a submissive homosexual, it was naturalto experiment with homosexual energies within ritual contexts. And here we cometo an interesting magical crossroads in this reasoning and story: How dohomosexual activities work in a so-called sexual-dynamic polarity? The answeris, in exactly the same way as during heterosexual congress. There may be aninitial sexual confusion (for outsiders) on the energy level, meaning there aretwo men or two women having sex. But what it all still boils down to is that twodistinctly different energies have to meet to maximize the discharge with itsinherent transcendental potential. The homosexual meeting can also in itself betranscendentally liberating if you look at it in the context of, for instance, aprejudiced or condemning surrounding. In that conflict, there is also adiametrical challenge that can be overcome and used creatively.Crowley formulated this magical principle in the term Babalon. Going back to theromantic notion of the Whore of Babylon in the so-called Revelation of theChristian Bible, he created an attractive rebellious principle that appealedboth to his own fantasies and to women with a need to free themselves frompatriarchal stereotypes. But the term contains much more than his own poeticdefinitions of personal preferences. The Babalon concept is a central part ofthe sex-magical teachings and techniques within the OTO and also within otherorganizations. The formula I mentioned earlier, 2 = 0, is an important key tothis. Two parts, or rather two poles, make possible a temporary setting free ofenergy in transcendence, which can be used in ritual contexts. But it’s far tooeasy to get stuck in stereotypes or stagnant concepts in which rebelliousarchetypes quickly become reactionary.*6 [9781620557044_ftn.xhtml#ft6]One clear example of an intellectually based sadomasochism that was typical ofCrowley exists in Leah Hirsig’s oath to Crowley during the early 1920s atCefalu, where Crowley had created an Abbey of Thelema, a monastery of sortswhere Thelemites could develop themselves. Hirsig was one of Crowley’s main“scarlet women” or magical partners. They worked ritually together, imbued bythe Babalon concept and inspired by the force set free in their sexualescapades.I dedicate myself wholly without stint to the Great Work.I will raise myself in pride:I will follow Ra-Hoor-Khuit in His way:I will work the way of wickedness:I will kill my heart:I will be loud and adulterous:I will be covered with jewels and rich garments:I will be shameless before all men:I, for token thereof, will freely prostitute my body to the lusts of each andevery Living Creature that shall desire it:I claim the title Mystery of Mysteries, BABALON the Great and the Number 156,and the Robe of the Woman of Whoredoms and the Cup of Abominations:Witness mine Hand. Alostrael5 [9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt63]The question now becomes: How much of this is (a) a genuinely intuitive yetwilled magical formulation; (b) Crowley’s sexual fantasies; or (c) Hirsig’s ownsexual fantasies?Crowley’s life is undoubtedly a story of complex relationships to both men andwomen, sexually as well as emotionally. It’s easy to criticize too harshly andclaim that he used people financially and sexually. But at the same time wemustn’t forget that his work as a philosopher and author shows a considerablymore altruistic, albeit distinctly post-Nietzschean, side that encourages allmen and women’s undeniable potential and right to individual liberty. Crowley iscertainly not alone in creating a great pathos of freedom and benevolence on atheoretical plane while he himself at times had obvious problems with theimplementation on practical levels.Aleister Crowley was a child of his time, whose emotional cluster was built on ahatred of his upbringing in general and of his mother in particular. Hisintegration of a feminine sexual role in the homosexual contacts and a rough,dominant masculine role in the heterosexual contacts seems to indicate some kindof dissolution of core identity. As these behaviors were integrated before hismagical awakenings and initiations, we must suppose that these laterintegrations of the roles as distinct magical energies to a great extent were expost facto constructions—albeit very creative and usable ones.Crowley was a genuine researcher who unfortunately quite often drifted intoeither benevolent hedonism or malevolent addiction. It’s perfectly legitimate toask oneself whether his own experienced shortcomings were necessities he turnedinto virtues. I’m thinking both of his flamboyant bisexuality and his abuse ofdrugs. Maybe the related stigma at the time was easier to deal with on apersonal, emotional level if he created an intricate raison d’être that turnedboth these areas into constructive building blocks in a personal, magicaluniverse? I have a hard time believing that the specifically transcendentalaspects of both these traits were used or integrated by him fully all the timeand totally consciously.This entire line of reasoning also leads to a metaphysical speculation about theneed for development. If the distinctly magical—that is, the potentiallysupra-creative—lies in the discharge between diametrical poles, thenroutine-based “normal” polarities should eventually become dissolved orweakened. A concrete example of this could be a human relationship that isdiminishing after the sexual element within the relationship has weakened.Crowley’s Babalon concept is not built upon the assumption that all women mustbe loose or emancipated on terms dictated by certain men. It is rather based onrebellion within context. Everything that moves on in routine is eventuallyweakened and loses its right to exist. The stereotypical image of the Babalonarchetype we can see in the Lust card in the Thoth Tarot deck and within theglobal Thelemic community, with a naked woman straddling a lion, is far from ascontroversial today as it was a century or even longer ago. The sexual neurosesand bad trips of the biblical authors for a long time created enormouspossibilities for magical work inside the sexual-dynamic polarity andprovocation. There and then, the “scarlet woman” was a potent symbol ofemancipation. The more rigid and strict the conventions, the easier to rebel andthereby set free energy for magical purposes.This leads on to the question: What or who is Babalon today? I don’t think it’sfeminists with bright neon hair colors and hundreds of university degrees ingender studies. Nor is it politically correct Net-based hipsters and socialmedia rabulists and fabulists who usually, paradoxically, are completelyintolerant toward anyone with a divergent point of view. A Babalon today, asalways, is simply the person who dares defy the current norms or hegemonies,regardless if they exist on private, sexual planes or general, existential ones.The opposition you encounter within a restrictive sphere is the actual tool thatcan liberate enormous energies in favor of your own creativity and success.This also leads on to an important aspect that must never be forgotten. We allexist within individual contexts. Crowley’s Thelema philosophy is aboutindividualism, about an enlightened egoism in which you assume responsibilityfor your own life and your own choices. All collective processes eventually leadto philosophical and moral stagnation. Unfortunately, it’s in the unenlightenedhuman nature to proceed and advance at the cost of others. What could be easierthan to hide behind a group or a collective ideal and become a spokesperson forother basically free individuals without asking for permission first? Regardlessif you’re a man or a woman or something else, and no matter what you fight for,I think it’s important to remember that you are only you. That personal spherein itself is an enormous responsibility."},{"pageContent":"16The Economy of MagicThere’s No Free Lunch or Free Magical SuccessOriginally a lecture delivered at Nekropolis Bogcafé in Copenhagen, Denmark,2015.IN SEVERAL SEQUENCES of the TV series Carnivale we can see the protagonist BenHawkins heal wounds and even bring people back from the dead. It looksimpressive, but the process takes a toll on the young, almost unwillingmagician. It’s because he knows there’s a price to pay. Around him, the vitalenergy needed for the operation at hand is always sucked from someone orsomething else. Human beings, fields of crops, and birds perish when hetransfers that energy into the dead and the injured.The equation is obvious and brings us to the quintessential magical dilemma: Youget, you give. You give, you get. It’s there in that classic Faustian deal andit is there as a basis for all kinds of sacrificial rituals, from the smallestof cults to the greatest of the world’s religions. And we can look at it fromthe smallest level of personal need or greed and up to global or even cosmicinterrelationships.Although this is essentially a well-known axiom or equation all through variousmyths and teachings, I still notice that many young occultists within a Westernsphere school themselves, or are schooled, in a kind of smash-and-grabmentality. This undoubtedly ties in with a general Occidental mind frame inwhich it’s apparently possible to just get and get and get. But we all know thatsomewhere in a third world country or at sea rests the toxic debris and waste ofthat attitude, which in turn is or will be eventually impossible to escape foranyone residing on this planet.For the Occidental occultist mind, quite often with no ties to larger moral orreligious clusters, it seems possible to command spirits, demons, or other kindsof forces merely because it’s his or her will. The Occidental presents endlessseries of demands, in which the mere opening of the door and greeting shouldbring success and manifestation. It should be made clear, though, that this isnot how things work. Not on the smallest of small levels, and not on thegrandest of grand scales.Whether looking at outer or inner process, there’s a balance that needs to beset. The equation of supply, demand, and cost is all-pervading. Everythingrequires something to be able to produce the force or item that’s desired. Thecomplicated web of outer productivity seems banal but serves as a good example:someone spends time and energy to make something that is then sold to a buyer,who pays for it with the magical energy of money, that in turn has been procuredsomehow in other generative circles.This is the most basic example of a relationship that permeates everythingaround us and in us. It’s almost as if it’s a general fundament, a prerequisiteof civilized life. The mere demanding without willingness to give anything backis then a suggestion of massive potential or actual failure.If we begin on the grand scale, which is no less magical than theincense-clouded personal temples, we can see that in the major myths, there hasalways been some kind of existential sacrifice involved. Two main examples: thehuman being Jesus became a christic force by sacrificing his life withdetermination and free will. This created a phantasmagoric residue, a psychopompthat was then integrated by the Christian power structure as myth. The focus wason the deed itself and its implications.” Jesus died for your sins,” implying atransference of sacrificial magical energy beyond the realm of the personalhuman being Jesus. This, handled by a clever organization, can apparently workwonders too.A second example: the Buddha reached enlightenment by realizing the necessity ofbalance, where neither death-related ascetic behavior nor sensual debauchery wasfavored. In samsara, the world of the senses, it was necessary to renounce theseextremes and also important to embrace the concept of karma, meaning in thiscontext not “you will get good things and possible release from samsara if youdo good things” but rather “if you do good things, you will get good things andpossible release from samsara.” Although both positions are logically the same,morally they’re not.Long before this, a similar concept was in use in Egyptian mythology. The heartof a deceased person would be weighed on scales against the feather of Maat, thegoddess of truth, by Anubis, god of the afterlife. If it was pure, everythingwas fine, and the deceased could move on to afterlife. If not, the heart wouldbe devoured by the demon Ammit. The heart’s purity was defined by the moralstandards of the day, and the tool used was a central one in economy and trade:the scales.As a cosmic principle, karma could be said to exist—meaning the books need to bebalanced or there will be extra taxation or perhaps even investigation of fraudor tax evasion. Water always finds its own level. On a personal level, though,karma is mainly a cultural concept that has seeped into the West from the East.The term itself thus becomes entangled with both religious and moral issues,which creates an unnecessarily complex overview. In its place in this context Iwould therefore like to substitute the term magicoin. Sure, magical currencycould be another suitable term, but this easily becomes semantically entangledwith other kinds of concepts within the magical sphere (the 93 current, theSetian current, etc.).In our Western sphere, self and will rule supreme. And this is as it should be:without self-knowledge and will, we get nowhere; or perhaps, at most, we getshuffled around by others who are more eloquent in defining us and who therebycan use us for their own ends. But if self and will are there, firmly rootedwithin the individual, we have a good, solid foundation to learn about how magic(and life) works. If we stay on the level of “I want” without furtherunderstanding of genuine magicoin principles, there will be debt. If we workwith agents like spirits or other nontangible, inner forces, we can only go sofar with a steady flow of demands—just as with credit cards.It’s almost easier to understand the magicoin principle when looking at itoutside the sphere of magic. Money is one very clear sphere; human relationshipsanother. If we take something and don’t pay, that’s called stealing. If we usesomeone else indefinitely for our own ends, that turns into abuse and, verylikely, confrontation. That’s why we don’t do those things if we see the bigpicture and understand our own position within it.Why is the dilemma even there? That is, why is it that magicians in the Westernsphere so seldom understand these basic principles? I think the problem istwofold. One is that magical practice is usually compartmentalized in time andspace and seen as an activity separate from the overall flow of life. This is abig error. If magical practice is fully integrated in one’s life, for instance,by applying one’s own terms and interpretations rather than rehashingtraditional, dogmatic, symbolic, and arcane ones (and thereby also increasingthe potential for a better understanding of the concepts), there won’t even beany dilemma left. Hermes Trismegistus’s dictum of “As above, so below” will ruleon all levels, both outer and inner.The second aspect is that I perceive that many young people begin with magicalpractice before they’re fully individuated. That is, before they fullyunderstand their own relationship to everyone and everything else. Magic ismistakenly regarded simply as something you do at certain times and spaces, notsomething you are 24/7 and wherever you go or stay. Magic is mistakenly regardedsimply as something you do to achieve your own ends in fairly nonrational ways,not something that ties you together holistically with the universe.It’s a bit like cramming in school. Students can mechanically or automaticallyrepeat what’s been taught in class and thereby give a semblance of knowing.Which can, in bad schools, actually produce good grades. But these are gradesthat are misleading as indications of real understanding. Any challenging orunexpected question to the student will quickly reveal that it’s just a matterof regurgitation or repetition.By being, we carry potential. By doing, we achieve. But by achieving, are wealways successful? What we do affects us on the inner planes, and also thetotality outside us. If we disregard any overall karmic concepts as beingstrictly moral ones, and instead just look to the economy of the processes, itis my experience that if there’s a conscious and willed balance in the magicoinbooks, there will be success.It’s always healthier to generate funds than it is to deal with credit—this issomething most of us recognize from everyday finances—and how we generate is byoffering first and asking later. It’s interesting to see how the word offer eventies in etymologically to this. To sacrifice means “to make holy.” The Germanword for “victim” and for “sacrifice” itself is Opfer (in Swedish “to sacrifice”is att offra; cf. “make an offer”). The word victim is originally Latin, andmeans exactly the same as in English. Its roots can be traced to a “sacrificedanimal.” Another synonym for something sacrificed is hostia, as for instance inthe “host” of the Christian communion, and as in the English hostage, somethingor someone being offered in return for something or someone else.Is magical success equal to the concept of profit? That is, if we generate morethan what we spend, is that a sign of specific magical success? The answer isno. Profit and surplus are in our minds predominantly an economic, culturalconcept within a tradition, not an existential given. Of course, one could arguethat financial profit and its residues are necessary as status indicators andthereby of natural stratifying processes. However, the magical process is alwaysan individual one. It can never be collective. Magical success equals thebalancing of the individual magicoin books. One exception would be when advancedmagicians actually contain more magicoin energy than they need for their ownindividual purposes. This can then be shared with others. If someone notadvanced enough tries to do the same thing, there will be depletion and chaoswithin his or her own magicoin system.Goethe’s Faust is an often-referenced work of art in this regard, as isMarlowe’s earlier play and a hundred different variants of the theme. Making apact or a deal with the so-called devil is merely succumbing to a credit-basedslavery situation. The same goes for working within traditional esoteric systemswhere so-called external forces are called forth to presence. If and when themagician declares his or her will to the force in question, but forgets toexplain the possible dividends or even to add a please or thank you after thedeclaration, the odds are likely that the outcome will be more expensive thancould ever be imagined.What this means in real life is of course not that some occult force pops up atnight and demands to be paid back in full or that some fantastic devil tries todrag your soul to some monotheistic vision of hell. But what it could mean isthat you, after a successful ritual, find that its manifested goal may containproblematic aspects too, previously not considered. Had the preritual overviewbeen crystal clear (the equivalent of an economic budget that balances out),problems could have been foreseen and possibly dealt with even before theritual. An example: you perform a ritual to secure one more or less constantsexual partner. This manifests in a perfectly sexually compatible woman and sheis very nice indeed. But she’s also a human being with emotions and a will ofher own that might not be compatible when she’s making demands for a deeperrelationship than one merely carnal. Or that as a result of the volatile andintense lust she’s able to provoke, all according to your fantasies, you makeher pregnant.Another example could be an even more youthful or naive one: A young magicianwants a gadget that he can’t afford right now and performs a ritual for thesituation. The train of events leads to that a good friend of his, equally poor,actually steals two gadgets and gives him one. This could be seen as a beautifuland successful operation from the magician’s perspective. However, the friendwas caught on CCTV and is later charged with the crime. The attraction of thatgadget very soon loses its potency.It would be much better to generate the energy needed oneself and then send itoff on adventures of manifestation. If well directed, it not only becomes anappropriate legitimate expense but also potentially an investment—that is, anexpense that furthers the cause, broadens the base, facilitates creativeexpansion. In the example of the fencing young magician, things could have beenchanged for the better with mere expression of intent. If he had integrated theexpression of desire in a larger context of self-development for instance, inwhich the gadget could play a tangible, creative part, the result could havemanifested in a different way, and his using the gadget lead to an improvedskill rather than a bad conscience.As in our normal economy, there is also a meta-level in the magic business. Wenormally talk about a stock market that trades in worth, loss, and potential inexisting companies. Translated into our own sphere of hocus-pocus this wouldcorrespond to the lucrative area of magical books. They carry potential forchange on their pages, and attract by symbolism, poetry, promises of power, andso forth. They deal with magic and they deal in magic. Thereby the entiremetasphere of magical literature and its writers becomes the stock market ofoccultism, a realm of speculation in worth and potential. If more people investin one writer rather than another, even though these writers may be writingabout the same kinds of magical phenomena, then his or her value increases andeven more investors show up. This could also strengthen related power structuressuch as magical groups or orders behind the writer in question, which could thenbe seen as an actual or an advisory board for the writer/corporation inquestion.When the Catholic conquistadores entered Central America and were shocked by thehuman sacrifices performed by the Aztecs, they apparently forgot about theessence of their own religion. The Aztecs tried their best to appease their mainsun god and other minor gods and goddesses by ritually killing human beings. Intheir own minds they succeeded, because the sun did come back. Every day, infact. And crops and harvests were for the most part plentiful in that fertileregion. So in a way they existed within a brutal and blood-soaked logic ofsuccess. The very same logic was then applied by the conquistadores, whoslaughtered and eradicated the Aztecs and their behavior for their own profitand for Catholicism. They also succeeded: the Aztecs were killed off andCatholic success and affluence followed, which meant the remaining convertscould now instead partake of communion consisting of blood and flesh from theinvaders’ own sacrificial proxy, Jesus Christ.Today, human sacrifice is not condoned, if we exclude fundamentalist Muslimterrorists and some retrograde tribes in remote jungles. The challenge today, ifwe stick to our young hubristic Western magicians, is rather to deal with aculture of fragmentation and oversaturation. If we already have everything andstill want more, wouldn’t the most rewarding sacrifice have more to do withbehaviors and attitudes rather than with tangible objects or life-forms?Cleaning up internally first, so to speak? Getting rid of destructive behavioralpatterns and shortsightedness? Sacrificing external pollution and internalmalnutrition?An interesting yet considerably more speculative area of magicoeconomic researchcould be whether the magical currency (NB, not “current”) is exchangeable oruniversal. Would it, for instance, be meaningful to use Scandinavian heathenmagic in central Africa, or would one need to somehow exchange the terminologyand the forces used for a successful operation? Would American Indian magic workwell in Tibet? Aboriginal magic in the Vatican? Or vice versa?Interesting things are also going on within the highly abstracted sphere of highfinance in regard to Mother Nature’s capital, which in many ways is permeated bypowerful sources of magic. Where an old-fashioned economic thinking simply gotwhat it wanted from the planet without returning anything at all (a very blackform of magic) and thereby facilitated incredible fortunes out of many magicaland sensitive ecosystems, today the phenomenon of “mitigation banking” is a newgrowth market in the undertow of ecological consciousness (or simply a badconscience). It works like this: A bank buys a huge piece of land that needsprotection for the sake of, for instance, biodiversity. Rapacious corporationscan then buy or lease a small segment to exploit, quite expensively, and part ofthe bank’s revenue then goes to actual further bioprotection. It’s a verystrange setup, almost illogical, but it’s now making huge profits for allconcerned. And yes, to perhaps a greater extent than in recent decades, wildlifecan now be better protected. But it does have a strange, almost eerieaftertaste. It’s like a bank suddenly owning a previously raped woman, and now,in the name of her overall protection, sells long-term leases on her body to herprevious rapists. Translated into a magical setup, it’s like a mitigation madeby a wise magician for an assortment of unwise magicians, who all want to haveresults immediately but cannot see the big picture or the role they play. Theycan use the force but only when sanctioned by some other magician who is therebygetting morally and inexorably entangled in whatever it is that’s going on. Ahealthy setup? I think not.On a stricter and more concretely generative level, we can always return to themain mysteries of magic—the sexual ones—for both metaphor and concrete food forthought. The theory is usually divided into psychosexual and physical-residualparts. Isolationists say the creative force lies in one but not the other, andother, more holistically inclined theorists say it’s a mix of both. That is,that the magical force lies in the ecstatic moment itself, which can be chargedand directed, or that the dissemination and direction of theultra-proto-generative force in the physical sperm and egg is what matters.It’s interesting to note, though, that the physical sacrifice of sperm inejaculation carries almost unlimited potential when it comes to generating newhuman life. Even if there is conception, that was made possible by the parallelsacrifice of a billion sperm-buddies. Male generative sacrifice is usuallyassociated with intense pleasure. Female generative sacrifice is usuallyassociated with intense displeasure. The sacrifice of an unfertilized egg inmenstruation is not such an apparent joyous occasion, but it does facilitate theplacement of new egg, ready and willing should a vital sperm drop by.Considering the potential these generative sacrifices contain, both as states ofmind and body, both as ecstasies and physical residue, it’s no wonder that theyconstitute prime magical currency. With this very basic insight in mind, itshould be easy to see that a credit-based magical economy might not be the bestplace to begin your own magical career.Essentially, it’s very simple: plus and minus need to add up to zero, in magicaloperations and in life in general. That’s quite enough. If we can learn tochange from looking at sacrifice as a painful noun to looking at it as apleasurable, constructive verb, we have come a long way."},{"pageContent":"17The Magic of Dreams Made RealOriginally a lecture delivered at Aleph in Skopje, Macedonia, 2014.IN OUR CONTEMPORARY CULTURE the dream sphere has been moved to a mystical andstigmatized corner. It’s a sphere that we usually try to understand bysimplified interpretation models and a superstitious rationality. One of thoseinterpretation models is the hierarchic one. This doesn’t merely come from Freudbut from a much larger background and perspective. But if we stick with Freud’spowerful legacy, we recognize the hierarchic structure: id, ego, superego, andso on. It’s a model we’ve grown accustomed to, as we have with his dreamtheories, claiming that the subconscious lies beneath and occasionally stirs upthings when we let our guards down, reminding us of wishes, desires, fears, andfrustrations. One central element in this model is that the rational mind runsthe show when we’re awake.But there’s no escaping the fact that we sleep and thereby dream approximatelyone-third of our lives. That’s a lot of time and a lot of energy spent onsomething that is generally regarded as passive and irrational. Strangelyenough, this perspective seems predominant even within contemporarypsychology—at least that’s how it’s being taught today at American universities.The focus here seems to be on clinical experiments, neurology, andneurochemistry. But that in itself contains the same fundamental dilemma as mostof the natural sciences: the beauty of a flower cannot be understood bydissecting it over and over again and trying to find out which chemicals areinvolved.Quoting the American psychology professor Roger Knudson, a critical voice:“American psychology majors learn that dreams are meaningless by-products ofbrain processes. This is taught by every textbook in introductory psychologyused in our department over the past decade.” Also: “Imagination is mainly asource of error in memory and therefore is not to be trusted.”1[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt64] Freud was a child of his times, and theauthoritarian, hierarchic thinking was in his case based both on his ownreligious environment and the overall European culture of postindustrialrationalism. Of course, we can absolutely not say that Freud regarded dreams andtheir importance as insignificant. Quite the contrary. But he worked within acontext where focus on order was essential. Otherwise, in the dualistic logicthat reigned supreme, everything would turn into chaos and inner disturbances.Parallel to Freud’s work were other manifestations of progress within thenatural sciences, some of which unleashed enormous energies, for good and bad.The atomic structure theory, with its protonic center and a varying amount ofelectrons in orbit, quickly generated metaphysical speculations concerning thesimilarities with the structure of the universe. The atomic model ofinterpretation of both an inner and outer world is in many ways more usable inmost contexts. It seems as though the hierarchic one fits best in processes thatare rigid in their focus on pecking order, that is, ascribing to something arelative value: the higher is worth more than the lower, and so on. That kind ofvalue-related thinking doesn’t really exist within the atomic model.We’re going to stick with the atomic here. If we begin on an overall human leveland look at the protonic center, we might as well call that core the individual.Around the individual many important phenomena and energies spin in orbit andmake up the individual’s makeup, so to speak. One model could be time andfunction based: one-third consists of awake work, one-third of awake sociallife, and one-third of sleeping/dreaming. Another model could be the sleepingthird, where the proton could still be seen as the individual and the electronscould be physical repose and different types of dreaming. Or even differentspecific dreams.On a very basic level our existence is all about reproduction and pushing lifeonward within our own species. That could seem to be a quite dull and hopelessexistence but the human being, as an advanced cultural phenomenon, can at leastfind comfort in personal qualities and traits as the foundation for individualharmony. We apparently nurture a need to feel meaning and purpose. And to avarying degree we also do have the possibility to achieve these in our lives.What it all boils down to is survival. Our bodies need to survive for as long aspossible, and our greater collectives too. And on the individual level it’sequally important to feel substance and meaning to be able to surviveemotionally.With this in mind we can see how our two waking thirds are very adapted forsurvival. We deal with what needs to be done to provide nutrition, protection,and shelter, and we work together with greater or smaller collectives to createa solid base for survival.Is it then unlikely that the sleeping and thereby dreaming third is also a partof this survival strategy? Of course not. In fact, this could be the mostimportant third of them all.Sleeping isn’t merely a passive resting but allows for the physical organism tovery actively repair itself after two-thirds of stressing, wearing, and tearing.And consciousness enters another and higher gear to facilitate for other formsof information exchanges and reasonings. This too is to facilitate the survivalof the totality.To consider dreaming as a merely neurological process of order after a day ofexposure to fragmented impressions, possibly with some unfulfilled desiresthrown into the dream stew, is a presumptuous and demeaning example of how ourcontemporary times denigrate individuals to utilitarian units inside a soullesscollective.However, we’re not supposed to be dealing with zeitgeist criticism here. Notthis time. So let’s stay with the function of the dreaming. Just as wecommunicate with our near and dear ones, work colleagues, and others during thetwo waking thirds in specific and conventional ways, the very same things happenwith other consciousnesses during dreaming. The function of the dreaming iscommunicating, reflecting, reasoning, and instructing.The questions then arise: With whom? From whom? About what? The most commonpiece of criticism is that it’s not possible to prove that the dream sphere ismainly instructive since empirical experiments haven’t been created to validatethe theories. Well, not yet anyway. On a realistic level, though, this criticalperspective fails. Only a fraction of all users can in detail explain how theInternet works on an empirically acceptable level, but that certainly doesn’tstop them from communicating with each other, not seldom with entirely strangeor new acquaintances and in new ways, and not seldom with the conscious purposeto learn about something or someone, and while at it also learn more aboutoneself.A fragmented dream recall is a big problem and it’s predominantly a culturalone. In many cultures where dreams and dreaming in general are given a higherstatus, the recall is more detailed, denser, and longer. In our own sphere, weoften wake up via aggressive cell phone signals and thereby lose out on a softhypnopompic agitation. If one is aware of it, there’s always the possibility toadapt one’s waking up a bit. Softer alarm signals and clocks with pulsatinglight are a few examples. It’s interesting to see how this has recently beenimplemented in transcontinental flights. Instead of brutally just switching thelights on in the cabin when it’s time to prepare for landing, soft, pulsating,and psychedelic multicolored lights now bring the passengers “back” to a wakingstate. Incidentally (?) these airplane models are called “dream liners.”It’s totally possible to approach one’s own dreaming. The first step is simplyto value the meaning of the dreaming in itself, not merely as an intellectual ormental perspective or approach but by integrating the process as beingabsolutely essential, that is, necessary for living. A dream diary or notebookby your bedside is good, or perhaps having a little tape recorder that you canjust talk straight into. That is interesting for the sake of dream substance butalso because you consciously leave the hypnopompic comfort to be able to“report” to yourself. It’s a self-disciplined method that leads to increasedrecall on all levels: frequency, intensity, length, and so on.Another central aspect of valuing is the interpretation process. We live in themidst of a post-Freudian and sometimes post-Jungian world of interpretation, andmany of their theories and models are totally dominant today. Many of them arestill useful, but the most important thing is simply that you interpret your owndream. The analyst or therapist hasn’t dreamt your dream. You dreamt your dream.If the interpretation isn’t mainly yours to as great an extent as possible,there will be an inherent level of distance and abstraction that complicatesdeeper understanding.If you’re aware of and accept that all dreams are instructive, the process initself becomes an incentive to work harder. It’s not only fun, fascinating, andexciting but also potentially essential when seen in relation to the survivalinstinct. In this “cosmic ultraholism” you, as the dreamer, communicate with anoverall and permanent life force or intelligence through your own active filter(being a synthesis of concepts like human being, individual, sleepingenvironment, cerebral and emotional processes).There are good reasons why dreams often use symbols or aestheticized seed inthese instructive displays. The pioneering intuitions of Freud and the earlypsychologists were correct: the two waking thirds are based on programmedbehavior and a hierarchic structure. It’s a simplified way of thinking and asimplified communication that’s based on nuance-less causality. Here, onlystraight messages work, and if one message contradicts another, the vaguer orweaker of the two will give way, even if you know on a deeper and moreemotionally resonant level that that option was actually the right one. This iswhy there is another kind of language in the dream sphere.We can extract this level of “anotherness” to an esoteric sphere of varioushuman exploits in history, not seldom focused on extraordinary innerexperiences: occult science, initiatory rituals and teachings of fraternalorganizations, magical societies, individual psychonauts, and so on. Humansymbolic worlds have been consciously created (or translated from the dreamsphere) to bring a certain knowledge or tradition onward in as pure a form aspossible. That is, as untainted as possible by vague and causal human language,which also has a tendency to change with time.The hypnopompic state (that is, when you drift out of sleep and into waking) isgenerally more difficult to control mentally than the hypnagogic (that is, whenyou drift from the waking state and into sleep). The reason is of course thefeeling of pleasant well-being that sleeping means to most of us, and theenormous attraction of the dreams themselves.Another way of increasing both recall and a general contact with the dreamsphere is to express it in an artistic form. This doesn’t mean that the methodcan only be used by artists but that you use methods that are suitable to giveform to what you’ve dreamt and your own interpretation of that. The dreamnotebook could be seen as the most primitive example, but an interpretive textcan lead to more. It’s the same for drawing or painting—the recreation of thedream sequence in images. The reason is, as mentioned before, twofold: you get abetter reflection surface for concrete interpretation and you thereby value theprocess as such.In one’s own interpretation of the dream lies also the possibility of changingthe perspective. Consider that the dream you have experienced and rememberedperhaps wasn’t dreamt by you at all but that it is something that was presentedfor you from the outside, like an existential gift.To give an outer form or shape to something inner is classical magic. To giveform to something desired through artistic work like poetry, drawings,paintings, sculptures, or whatnot is to awaken life within the desire. That goesfor nightmares too, although hopefully the other way around: the expressioncreates a catharsis of the undesired. The creative externalization of dreamsapparently has therapeutic qualities of many kinds; this has been integrated insome segments or schools of psychology in different forms of art therapy.The question is if it stops there, if it only stays at this “phase one,” meaningthat it’s liberating to see what you’ve dreamt in a new way. I would like toargue that both frequency and intensity in this process increase thedream-sphere contact interface in itself. Recall becomes easier, whichfacilitates more efficient interpretation work. It also brings an increase ofgeneral existential stimulation in the form of fascination and joy, which Iabsolutely ascribe to the literally essential function of dreaming. An analogy:you can eat various kinds of junk food under stressed circumstances or you canconsciously eat good and nutritious food under relaxed circumstances. What youchoose will affect life as a whole, not only the alimentary system and its workas a purely physiological phenomenon.We often appear in our own dreams. This indicates not only a personal presencein a kind of poetic flow of irrational wishes but can just as well indicate aninstructive process. What you experience in the dream is meant for you and noone else. The identity and recognition of one’s own presence is a language thatactivates receptivity for messages from the dream sphere.Under normal circumstances we awaken with and in dream frag-ments, fascinatingand attractive for sure, but they fade so quickly in that we often unwillinglyapproach the waking state. We are quite often so stressed already here that wedon’t even have the time to treat the frustration concerning the evanescence ofthe dreams. But do the dreams still linger on somewhere inside us? Are alldreams stored like our sensory impressions, in an enormous dream bank? If dreamsaren’t just loose fragments of memories but, as I argue, very concrete andindividualized transmissions from much higher frequency levels, then perhapsit’s possible to improve one’s reception and simply receive more? The ether isfull of an enormous amount of frequencies and messages that our senses cannotregister, but they’re still there: radio, television, wireless Internet,telecommunications, spy signals, and many other things. In that sphere, it’s aquestion of adapting existing technology to be able to receive what is relevantto the communication in question. Our receiving technology when it comes to thedream sphere is the brain, and it can definitely be trimmed and calibrated toreceive and interpret more. A lot more.As often in life when it comes to mind-expanding or potentially life-changingexperiences, modern individuals have a hard time taking their own experiencesseriously enough to allow them to become concrete and meaningful parts of a lifein creative flux. In the dream sphere, it becomes doubly problematic: we areraised in a culture in which this sphere is not given a high priority, yet theword itself indicates many ideal forms for us—dream girl, dream boy, dream team,dream scenario, and so on. And we’re all on very deep levels endlesslyfascinated by the attraction of the dreams but generally powerless inapproaching them. We also live like slaves in the digital dictatorship ofentertainment, in which we’re swamped by symbols and dreamlike films and images.This is something I perceive as distinctly weakening our own dreaming.It’s not unusual that creative people have a good and active relationship totheir own dreams, regardless of how concretely they work with them. We shouldn’tjust mention the strict, sleep-based dreaming here but also active imagination,daydreaming, hypnagogic states, hypnopompic states, and deep forms ofmeditation. Again, this is not only for or by artists. Many scientists,engineers, philosophers, writers, and others who live by thinking in new waysoften feel a kinship with the attraction to the abnormal within dreaming. On ageneral level though, these people are exceptions rather than rules.But it hasn’t always been like that. Even in the West, dreams used to be moreintegrated. During antiquity, Greek physicians often consulted dreams in theirdiagnostic and healing work. Plutarch’s stories of antique Greek and Roman livesare filled with integrated dreams, on religious as well as personal planes. Alot of people probably associate this systematic or prioritized dreaming withso-called primitive cultures, as is the case with magic in general. A bigdifference between then and now is that dreaming used to be collectivelyintegrated in almost all the world. Today we dream alone. Well, at least in ourcultural sphere. In Tibetan scholastic Buddhism advanced dreamwork is integratedin meditations and other forms of inner work, with basically the same goal asfor everything else that is striven for: to see through the dream mechanisms andtry to leave these and everything else behind in an enlightened state ofnirvana.Mark Twain and many other inspired authors have claimed that telepathy iscompletely normal and that the dream sphere is that place in consciousness whereyou can travel freely as you will, even in time. All that’s needed is basicallythat you (a) value the process, and (b) start working with it.The engineer Edison was close to addicted to his hypnagogic moments, as helearned early on that his best ideas came while in hypnagogic states of mind.After having worked in a very high tempo mentally he usually allowed himselfwhat he called catnaps. He sat in his office chair with two steel balls, one ineach hand, then drifted off. When he fell asleep properly the balls fell to thefloor and the sound woke him up. Very often he had a new idea clear in hismind then.Quite often these eureka moments come after an intense intellectual work processthat the person in question then sets free in a dream sphere. Einstein had beenthinking about his theory of relativity for ten years, and when his epiphanicmoment eventually arrived, it arrived after a dream that drifted into ahypnopompic state. Here we can see an analogy to traditional magical thinking,in which a work of will culminates in a ritual, after which you set the desiredeffect or result free to find its own manifestation where and when it’ssuitable.Goethe, Wagner, Brahms, Puccini, and hundreds if not thousands of otherprominent artists of different kinds have all admitted their debt to eitherdreaming proper or hypnagogic states of mind.Kekulé, the man who discovered the benzene molecule in 1890, did this in arevealing dream in which a snakelike being moved around in a, to Kekulé,molecularly applicable way. The facts were already inside his rational intellectbut he needed to have that final detail presented to him under irrationalcircumstances. It’s interesting how these key moments are never spelled out, soto speak, but always come in a symbolic form that makes the lock unlock. Itseems as if the symbolic world of images is richer and often more efficient thatrational clarity.Art history is of course filled with people who’ve created remarkable things,and I think most of you know this sphere better than that of benzene molecules.We have to mention the surrealists, who not only jumped out of dreams in termsof inspiration but also to a great extent externalized the dreams in theirartworks. This may have increased their personal dream contacts. But they alsohelped to undermine the conservative, destructive, and postindustrialconsciousness of the Western world. The strong and often erotic surreal imagesand texts, to a great extent inspired by Freud and psychology in general,created a higher level of tolerance of “inner spheres” and “dream languages.”A more contemporary example would be David Lynch, whose surrealisticinspiration, and that stemming from his own transcendental meditation and hisown dreams, has contributed to so many masterpieces. When Audrey Horne in TwinPeaks starts dancing at the diner and says “Isn’t this music dreamy?” it becomesa little piece of a mosaic of a new use of language. When something is strange,eerie, irrational, and dreamlike, we say today that it’s a “Twin Peaks moment”rather than using a stricter reference to a dream atmosphere.It can indeed be dream promoting to be exposed to other people’s dreams andtheir creative externalizations of them. You get rid of some negativerationality under controlled circumstances in a cultivated comfort zone. But theeffect will be much greater when you actively start working on and with your owndream sphere.Let us now finally toy with the idea that what we do during our two wakingthirds is simply to move the biological being onward. We add nutrition and workfor survival and at the same time get really tired, all of this simply to makepossible and optimize the most important third of our lives—that of sleeping anddreaming.Some of us are more or less individuated and we feel a harmony in our lives andwork. How can that be? Isn’t it possible that it has to do with an optimalplacement of individual capacity in a greater totality of a life-affirmingmovement? Aren’t we all actually receiving information about these things in theinstructional moments of our dreams? Is the basic problem simply that a weakrecall obstructs an increased awareness about our own capacity and our ownexistential potential? I would absolutely say so.Summing up then: * Dream recall is possible to extend by an increased valuing of dreams by immediate notes, interpretations, and artistic externalizations. * It’s extremely important that the interpretation of the dreams is your own. * Consciously prioritized dreamwork in general brings increased dream response (frequency, strength, resonance). * The dream sphere is not only made up of fragments of memories or wishes that the brain as a neurological composite tries to process to recreate “order” during sleep. Dreams are not exclusively irrational expressions of subconscious desires. * The dream sphere is beyond time and space and outside causal, logical (that is, man-made) structures. * The dream sphere contains directed individual messages containing information and advice in regard to behavior on individual and collective levels. A simple analogy is ether-based media and wireless Internet, where you have a sender and a receiver, and which requires a specific technology."},{"pageContent":"18Collective MysticismIt’s Probably a MythOriginally a lecture delivered at the Babalonium Gathering, Skåne, Sweden, 2014.WHEN WE BEGIN TO LOOK at the term mysticism, which we can allow ourselves to usefor the lack of a better one, we soon realize it is probably the most importantthing there is within this exciting area of research we work in. There are manyentry points and motivations to begin with some kind of esotericself-development process, but it’s often the same kinds that become trulydecisive. In the “inner”—regardless of where we wish to place thatsphere—things, emotions, information, and advice appear that can be lifechanging. The methods may vary: meditation, ritual, chemo-gnosis, sex, consciousexhaustion, and so on. In mind frames where our rational police force istemporarily short-circuited, things, symbols, intelligences, spirits, and beingsquite often pop up. Some may be ephemeral or just entertaining, whereas othersmay tangibly affect us and the rest of our lives. It is almost like we’recontaining a large amount of relevant truths and insights but that we’re fearfulof taking part in it all. Why? Because it would considerably affect thecontrolled rational reality of daily life.Mysticism exists in all cultures, all religions, all esoteric societies. Theexperience and its insights may then be clothed in cultural or religiousclothing, but it’s always a highly personal phenomenon. Most cultures early onindoctrinate against this kind of experience and call it unreal or evil ordevoid of meaning. Now we’re talking about power structures, that is, collectivedefense mechanisms of organisms and processes. If someone within a givencollective randomly experiences or allows him- or herself to experiencedifferent and overwhelming things on the inside, free and without assistancefrom established and sanctioned professional proxies, there might be a chancethat others would want that too, which could complicate things enormously.We’re living in a culture where most of the inner experiences are rationalizedaway as hocus-pocus. We don’t risk death or too heavy stratification if weexplore these things, but a sense of ridicule and stigmatization is totallypossible if you don’t adapt and conform to the comfort-zone control.What this is really all about is taking oneself seriously. This is veryimportant. You have to take yourself seriously. You have to take your impulsesseriously and interpret them through your own, individual filter. Even withinspecialized esoteric systems there are equally hindering and stigmatizingfunctions that contain the very same ingredients as outside: structures andpower. And then there is the mighty prerogative of interpretation. The aspect ofinterpretation becomes especially difficult as having overwhelming experiencesin the inner is something most people actually want to share with like-mindedpeople. But within all structures and hierarchies there’s the risk that youdemote yourself at the cost of someone else’s validation or interpretation. Thisis very counterproductive.It could be that collective systems in general, despite meaning well, actuallyoppose the individual flow of inspiration, thoughts, and ideas. I’ll say “couldbe,” as I have no evidence of it. And the reason for this is simple: I don’twant any evidence of it, nor of the opposite. And the reason for this is evensimpler: I value my own flow and my own source, so to speak, higher than manyother things in life. In my own interpretation model it simply doesn’t work toapply “mine” to “yours” or vice versa.Now we’re getting closer to the core of the dilemma. Could it be that there issomething distinctly un-Thelemic—even within the Thelemic magical “system”—thatin the outer consists of a distinct power structure with interpretationprerogatives, and that also contains techniques that try to integrate empiricismin something that basically consists of single epiphanies in an ultrasubjectiveand highly irrational individuation process?Is it at all possible to methodically work to achieve epiphanic states of mind?I’m sure it is, but it’s far too easy to be drowned in a “systematism” or inrepeated, rational hopes as self-fulfilling prophecies. What works for onedoesn’t necessarily work for another. Yes, there may be a collective unconsciousà la Jung, and maybe we all essentially experience the same mythical symbols ina certain state of mind that can then also be shared. And yes, there may beintelligences and beings that pop up like dogs when you call them by their rightnames, over and over. And yes—who knows?—there may even be cosmic forces thatneed our help as individual human beings, and vice versa. But the questionremains whether all of these techniques and collective perspectives in totalitysignify a devaluation of the decidedly individual principle of intuition.The mystical experience can probably only be validated through the effect it hasin the moment or in the process of integration. Does it affect life? Itsdirections? Does it linger? We can see many parallel things within the dreamsphere. We all know that dreams are amazing and we are inspired by them,terrified by them, we enjoy them and respect them. But yet they’re not fullythere when we wake up, that is, wake up to the benevolent tyranny of therational mind. Epiphanies and reception of esoteric energy and information takeplace in a different state of mind that is not a dream state. And even herethere is the usual devaluation of the value itself, even with those who’veactually experienced it all: “It was just a weird thought or perhaps it was adaydream. No matter what, it wasn’t for real. . . .”But this doesn’t really concern us here, because we belong to those who takethis seriously. Yet new and critical thought processes always occur. It is as ifthe rational at every cost must protect normality and its power structures. Yes,perhaps it was a revolutionary personal insight but still it needs to bevalidated through a specific magical system to be able to be sanctioned as being“real” or “relevant.”It is the safety functions of the collective environment that have developedrationality and so-called normality. Its tool is a language that’s usable forone sphere but not for the other. It’s enough to communicate basic informationand emotions but not in deeper (or higher) composites or clusters. Instead, art,poetry, music, and other creative expressions have been responsible for thatimportant interface function throughout the millennia.One of the main critical arguments against language, for instance in Buddhism,is the tendency to not be able to avoid the fact that it inherently contains onesubject and one object; there is an inherent structural dividing line betweenseer and the seen. If language isn’t enough it is of course incredibly difficultto convey something outside the causal and the already known. As D. T. Suzukiput it,We cling to language and think that it is the thing which it represents. Thishabit of taking the symbol for reality does a great deal of harm in our dailylife. Language is a most useful instrument, perhaps the most important means ofcommunication that we humans have ever invented, but we frequently fail tounderstand that because of this usefulness, language enslaves us.1[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt65]To listen to a stoned individual eventually becomes quite depressing, regardlesshow amazing everything seems to be for the person in question. In the case ofEastern philosophy, the platitudes can become almost ridiculous: “All is one,”“All is love,” and so on. Perhaps all is one, but what does that really mean?And how can you integrate an insight like that without becoming like anoncritical member of a cultic egregore? Of course you have to experience ityourself to be able to understand and interpret. Perhaps you choose to formulateit in a similar way, and perhaps not.The human being has a fundamental need to share both inner and outer experienceswith others, not infrequently to claim territory and strengthen his or herposition of experience. But the sharing can also take place because of genuinealtruism or because one simply can’t help oneself. When the need to sharebecomes stronger than the ability to empathically feel if someone is interestedin listening or not, complications occur. But the sociopathic comedy (ortragedy) that can take place at moments like that doesn’t necessarily mean thatthe original personal experience is without value or meaning. The challenge liesin the language one uses, and when.Let’s take a look at Crowley’s elaborate system and well-known slogan, “Themethod of science, the aim of religion.” The method of science? This basicallymeans repeated experiments—so-called empiricism. But why should a singleexperience that will never come back (despite repeated attempts with the verysame technique or ritual) be devoid of meaning or value? Why should its effectbe looked down upon? Why should the technique or the prerequisites be lookeddown upon simply because they can’t be perfectly repeated? To strive for arational exactitude and analysis of things that belong on completely differentplanes is, in my opinion, to repeatedly hit your head against a wall of dull andpainful concrete.The method of science? Perhaps. The risk of spiritual imperialism becomes atangible threat. The aim of religion? Perhaps. The risk of fanaticism andfundamentalism becomes an equally tangible threat.Good ideas never need to be tested empirically unless the application of theidea within a certain environment demands it. Usually ideas get a life of theirown as soon as they’ve reached the surface. And all ideas are definitely notutilitarian; that is, they’re not there to be used systematically and rationallyat all. If you encounter an intelligence or different kind of being in a higherstate of consciousness, isn’t it then a bit condescending (or even rude) to comeback after this and ask for the same answer or the same insight again? Theremust surely be a risk that the intelligence or being in question will end upbelieving that you are mentally challenged. But if you take that unique epiphanyseriously, things could indeed get interesting.Many scientists, both well-known and not so well-known, are as conscious of themysteries of the origin of ideas as mystics or artists. It’s always a questionof a eureka moment—a distinct leap of progress, a quantum step, a caprice, aflash—despite the fact that the daily grind may consist of methodical,trench-digging, empirical work. It is the mind frame of the immediate momentthat facilitates the growth and blossoming stemming from a seed that may haveexisted underneath the surface for a long time. One of our most brilliantscientists during the twentieth century, Nikola Tesla, wrote a lot about his owncreative processes. It’s fascinating when an extremely rational individual andscientist accounts for the details:Back in the deep recesses of the brain was the solution, but I couldn’t yet giveit outward expression. One afternoon, which is ever present in my recollection,I was enjoying a walk with my friend in the City Park and reciting poetry. Atthat age I knew entire books by heart, word for word. One of these was Goethe’sFaust. The sun was just setting and reminded me of the glorious passage:The glow retreats, done is the day of toil;It yonder hastes, new fields of life exploring;Ah, that no wing can lift me from the soil,Upon its track to follow, follow soaring!A glorious dream! though now the glories fade.Alas! the wings that lift the mind no aidOf wings to lift the body can bequeath me.As I uttered these inspiring words the idea came like a flash of lightning andin an instant the truth was revealed. I drew with a stick on the sand thediagrams shown six years later in my address before the American Institute ofElectrical Engineers, and my companion understood them perfectly.2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt66]I believe that the key to this is simply that you immediately take your ownexperiences and impressions seriously. An impression isn’t worth more or lessbecause it is diligently being analyzed by a rational mind frame. Safety is anillusion. Conviction always contains the seeds of fanaticism. Messianism is aromantic relationship to the denial of solipsism, where you take for grantedthat someone else cares as much as you do. Quite often it is a misdirected hope.Each and everyone’s truth is unique, just like in the cases with the centralterms will and love. As far as I know, will can’t be rationally analyzed. “Ifwill stops and asks Why, invoking Because, then Will stops & does nought / IfPower asks why, then is Power weakness,” and so on.3[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt67] The same for love, unless you break down the termitself and its emotional cluster into strictly biochemical particles. But thatisn’t really something one does, is it?Structures always mean safety in authority. This is something most people needon some level. But valuable realizations usually come when you actually breakthe norms, structures, authorities, and safeties—at the least one’s own. It’snot exactly like an end in itself, but almost. Let’s not forget that the healthof a structure or organism is also kept up and vital by allowing a certaindegree of rebellion. If that isn’t allowed, the immune defense system can’tstrengthen the totality, which eventually could be fatal.Paradoxically, we live in a culture that doesn’t fully encourage irrationalityand intuition via usable, essential techniques but still happily provides themvia demagogic proxies like fiction and entertainment. Rational and criticalprocesses are dulled by passive reception of irrational signals and mind-numbingprograms. That which is supposed to facilitate communication and an exchange ofinformation usually leads to the opposite. Today, we’re learning through fictionrather than through fact, and this via technical platforms rather thanintuition, curiosity, and inherited wisdom. Even here we can see an interestingand dynamic sphere between the individualistic and collective perspective. It’snot the technology or the scientific triumphs that constitute the problem initself. On the contrary; these are excellent for individual learning andinspiration. The problem lies in the collective and commercial application ofthe technology. And in the latter, there’s usually an integrated set of moralsthat undermines individual initiatives and the individual’s reliance on his orher own intuitive motion. This perspective thereby reminds one of therelationship between the subjective, esoteric process of individuation andexisting systems, structures, and groups. The possibilities for revolutionarypersonal change are within reach, but they are drowned in prepackaged solutionsthat, of course, are sold for a hefty fee.But “different strokes for different folks.” In the valuing of one’s own paththere must always be a tolerance in regard to others. No matter how crazy orabsurd other people’s paths may seem, there simply are no templates that areapplicable for everyone. But when you’re genuinely on your own path you’re notsupposed to have either time or energy enough to criticize others. It’s a factas certain as the one that shows that the frequency of auspicioussynchronicities increases when you’re on the right path—that is, your own path.Is there then no evidence in favor of a more homogenous and collectivistic view?The one closest to hand is scientific, in the sense of “biologistic.” If we areequipped with filtering and defense mechanisms that are the same for all of usas a species, then the direct, gnostic, epiphanic experience and its physical,biological prerequisites could be too.One symbol within Hinduism and later on within psychedelic mythology is thethird eye—the eye that facilitates inner visions and insights. On a purelyaesthetic-mythological level, the eye of Shiva has been a perfect symbol for thehuman desire to see more. But in actual fact there’s more behind this than meetsthe eye (even the eye of Shiva!). The third eye has been isolated and defined asthe pineal gland, which is situated between the brain halves in the front sideof the brain, as a kind of bridge. This gland is actually the remnant of anactual third eye. One living example of (and possible evidence for) this theoryis a New Zealand lizard, the tuatara, that has a section at the middle top ofits head with a third eye inside it. This parietal eye is no longer connected tothe sight center of the brain but has started to function as a gland. Already inthe nineteenth century a conclusion was made that our own pineal glands had atone time been exactly like this.The hormone that is secreted from this gland in mammals is called melatonin. Werecognize the name from the little pill you take when you’re jet-lagged andtrying to normalize the sleep cycle (which of course regulates the dream cycle).Melatonin is created in the gland after having been triggered by serotonin: theagent or substance that sends nerve impulses via the synapses. Humans have moreserotonin than other mammals, and this has led to advanced, abstracted thinkingand creative impulses, making it a highly significant key to our own evolution.If we posit that the gland was actually an eye once upon a time, or existed asan even stronger gland with higher levels of serotonin, it is highly likely thatearly humans experienced much stronger visions. It can’t be ruled out that ahigher dose of melatonin from the pineal gland affected sleeping in a much moredream-inducing way. We should also add here that psychedelic agents likemescaline and LSD are highly releated to serotonin. LSD is basically a“serotonin blocker,” but it’s in the cerebral chaos when the serotonin againcreates synaptic “order” that we have the psychedelic experience and all of whatthat brings. The consumption of alcohol effectively blocks production ofmelatonin. Consumption of cannabis increases it.The third eye within us is a real, scientifically proven gland and function thatis on the one hand followed by synaptic speed (a prerequisite of all cerebralactivity) and on the other hand connected to visionary states of mind. Itsmythological status as an all-seeing, inner eye is thereby not purely fictionbut rather a preserved Ur-memory.There has also been research done into the relationship between the pineal glandand sexuality. There seems to be a tight connection between them. A reducedfunction of the gland leads to both larger genital organs and a stronger sexdrive. This could indicate that visionary tribes and cultures had less sex andtherefore dwindled, and perhaps also that an increased sex drive and thecontemporary insane level of breeding is a contributing cause to a poorervisionary culture on a global level.One beautiful myth within Buddhism is the one in which the Buddha reachedenlightenment under the famous Bodhi tree. The enlightenment came via sensoryimpressions, as he, according to the myth, was looking at the Morning Star, theplanet Venus (later on associated with Lucifer), and that the brightness of thestar, and the eye and brain in conjunction, brought him to an illuminated stateof mind and an ensuing superconsciousness. For detail’s sake, we should add thatthe fruit of the Bodhi tree (Ficus religiosa) has the highest level of serotoninof all fruits on this planet.All the great mystics who have left substantial traces behind have consistentlypreached a direct, personal contact with the higher (or deeper). These ecstaticmoments themselves may have been violent or peaceful, but what unites thesemystics is a kind of self-imposed distance that defies the norms of their times.They have intuitively felt that the time is ripe for something new and they havefollowed that intuition until the illumination appeared. The collectivestructures that followed suit have all been defined by their own contemporaryneeds and expressions, for good and bad, but that still doesn’t cloud theessence of pivotal personal moments and mystical impressions that, if theindividual takes them seriously, will contribute constructively to themultifaceted mosaic called life.Despite the fact that everything may eventually just be a big cosmic joke or anillusion, I still believe it’s worth taking seriously. That’s why I’ll saygood-bye with a hope that your third eyes will now reawaken to new,enthusiastic, and flirty life."},{"pageContent":"19Challenging Inertia and EntropyOriginally a lecture delivered at the OTO Croatia Conference in Split, Croatia,2014.WE KNOW, or at least assume with certainty, that everything is in flux,movement, motion. Our senses and interpretations provide us with this data, asdoes our immediate memory. We also have a tendency to ascribe cyclicaldirections to the movements in question. Energies revolve and life force isexactly that: a revolving force that helps or initiates further movement. Onvery tangible levels most of us have seen, heard of, or perhaps experienced thatdeath means exactly the opposite: a lack of force and thereby movement. And whenthat process sets in, new energies are immediately set in motion to decomposethe formerly so-alive vehicle or body. So in a sense, there’s no real stasiseven in death.In the history and mythology of magic, terms like energy and direction havealways been essential. It seems that extroverted and directed energy, set inmotion by will, is the common denominator in all systems, schools, andtraditions. Even mystical systems, schools, and traditions are involved in thevery same thing; the only difference being that the direction of the energy hasbeen changed, going inward instead of outward into the cosmos.Can we then simplify and say that magic is (a) a knowledge of the energies inquestion, and (b) a harnessing of these so that they can be directed as willed?I think so. Most of what we can see in the history of magic is schematically thesame. There may be different names and motivations and degrees of complexity,but we’re still talking about consciously willed use of what already existswithin and around us.But what happens when routine sets in? Lack of motivation and will? When aformerly effective ritual turns into a dutiful ceremony? When a formerlypleasing situation turns into mere run-of-the-mill diluted experience? When anorganism merely exists, apparently without meaning?Here’s where and when we encounter the terms entropy and inertia. They alwaysset in sooner or later, perhaps as a necessary movement of decay before anactual decomposition, or, if we’re lucky, as an eye-opener and instigator forchange. When we are alive and somewhat conscious, we can make decisions aboutthe direction of the energies. That’s a beautiful trademark of what it means tobe a human being. But still, far too many humans accept defeat, decay, anddecomposition far too easily, although it’s not at all necessary.Entropy is a word that comes from thermodynamics and means, in simplified terms,energy that is isolated, unconnected, nonmoving. Following the second law ofthermodynamics, the entropy of an isolated system always increases. This is notexactly the same as stasis, in which everything is still, but signifies energythat is contained and thereby not creating heat anymore.Inertia is also a term borrowed from classical physics and, again simplified,means that a thing continues in its motion and direction, in a kind ofunwillingness to change—or an inability to change.Many people suffer from entropic states as well as from states of inertia, andsometimes these can be found in combination, for instance, in someone who isself-contained and therefore just keeps moving in the same direction. Thissituation might just as well be called a lonely force of habit. And of course,this phenomenon can also exist in groups or societies.One way of angstfully repressing an approaching state of inertia and entropy isby positional rigidity, meaning that the person in question sticks with what wasonce meaningful and valuable to him or her, and gradually devalues everythingelse. This process can be seen in any kind of fundamentalism, as the views andperspectives become more and more narrow in the glorification of the safe haventhat perhaps once provided a necessary fuel for a continual personaldevelopment.Any kind of fundamentalism is always a sign of inertia and entropy on theindividual level. On the larger scale, though, active mindlessness and activeobedience from the, for instance, religious or political parts can greatlyvitalize the larger group, entity, or even state. But it’s still fed by elementsof individual inertia and entropy.I believe that the individual has the power to change things, and thatcollectives are essentially void of power unless there is one individualperspective that is commonly or communally backed up. That said, an individualcould then potentially change an entire collective or organization sufferingfrom inertia and entropy. But, sadly, that is more of an exception than a rule.When do inertia and entropy set in? I’m sure a million answers could be given,but one of the most relevant could be “When the will to change on one’s ownterms becomes subservient to personal comfort, relying on ideals and systemsbased on other people’s authority and inherent responsibility.”So how does creativity fit into this puzzle? Well, it’s not as simple as sayingthat all you have to do to break a force of habit is start painting or write apoem. That can surely be therapeutic for some but also constitutes a kind ofescapism if you’re not really inclined to paint or write.Everything begins with an idea and all ideas come from somewhere. Regardless ofwhether it’s immediate solutions to everyday problems, big inspirational waves,or the big bang of a holy guardian angel encounter, the blooming of an idea isprobably the most joyful and potentially habit-breaking phenomenon we experiencein life.If we allow ourselves to generalize, we can say that there are four maininstigating moments: 1. Stillness, as we know it in meditation or hypnagogic states. 2. Sidetracking or diversion, as we know it from those moments when we look for something forgotten and temporarily leave that frustrated train of thought. 3. Transgression, which is a more forceful variant of number 2, and means being aware of something that lacks an idea and yet working on something completely different, for instance something diametrical. 4. The third mind; for example, in conversation and troubleshooting with others, the creative feedback generated and shared can make unforeseen ideas manifest, as if a third creative party or mind were present.It seems that ideas are not very likely to appear when pulled, but rather wantto push themselves, which is quite a beautiful symbol. This is elegantlyconceptualized in Taoism by the method or attitude of wu wei, confusinglytranslated as “doing by not doing.” This means basically working away atsomething but not overzealously or with too big a pulling effort; in a way, it’snot attaching too great a rational energy to whatever needs doing. The resultingpleasant work mode is today usually called a flow.Both inertia and entropy are hard nuts to crack. One requires a nudge or perhapsa smack and the other a break of isolation. It seems then that number 3,transgression, would be the most appropriate method for both. Not only is itchallenging to do something that is not “you”; doing so most definitely setsthings free within you. It’s a chaos generator, if you will. This in no waymeans that you should go against your will for the sake of it, but rather lookat it as a technique that makes you more aware of what your will actuallyconsists of. Because true will is never embedded in inertia or a staticposition. It changes along the years, just like your physical organism-vehicledoes. There is a light that never goes out, of course, a center of youruniverse, but it’s very important to keep questioning yourself and your motivesin the process. Because the processes of yesteryear are not the same as thepresent ones. If you cling dogmatically to what was once magical, you are likelyto suffer from inertia and an entropic state of mind, which, in a worst-casescenario, can bring dogmatism or fundamentalism.Originally, I had in mind to not mention Crowley or Thelema at all in thislecture. That in itself was quite a huge challenge. Perhaps it’s a form ofentropy to always have to rely on good old Uncle Al in Thelemic settings. In away, I believe that’s actually true. However, when we’re on this subject thereis such a brilliant example of the attitude I’ve touched upon in one ofCrowley’s greatest and most entertaining texts. I’m referring to an essay inKonx Om Pax with possibly the greatest title ever: “The Synagogue of Satan.”1[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt68]Basically, the text is a humourous display of practical advice based on what wecan call diametrical dynamics, meaning that if you’re prone to or compulsive inone kind of behavior, you need to at least try the exact opposite in order tobreak any kind of entropic or stagnant state of mind, or lifestyle. Put anotherway, the goal is to eventually unite the opposites, energized by thetranscending or transgressive movement.The real title of the piece is “Thien Tao.” It is interesting that thisphilosophical treatise hints at Taoism, as does the text in itself in many ways.Konx Om Pax was first published in 1907, eleven years before Crowley’s majorTaoistic enlightenment on Esopus Island on the Hudson River that was sooverwhelming that he, the very logos of loghorrea, couldn’t express what he hadexperienced properly—probably for the first and last time of his life. But therewas a reason for the Taoist presence. The year before, in 1906, Crowley hadspent time in China and was well acquainted with both the Tao Te Ching and otherChinese classics.The story is very simple: A sage, Kwaw, as in Kwaw Lee, we can assume, givesgood advice to a comfort-zone-inclined ruler. Everyone in his ruling classes isrecommended to go in an opposite direction for two months each year.There are men who make a fetish of cleanliness; they shall work in a fitter’sshop, and learn that dirt is the mark of honourable toil. There are those whoselives are rendered wretched by the fear of infection; they see bacteria of thedeadliest sort in all things but the actual solutions of carbolic acid andmercuric chloride with which they hysterically combat their invisible foemen;such would I send to live in the bazaar at Delhi, where they shall haply learnthat dirt makes little difference after all. There are slow men who need a fewmonths’ experience of the hustle of the stockyards; there are businessmen in ahurry, and they shall travel in Central Asia to acquire the art of repose.2[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt69]Crowley wrote that the text “gives my solution to the main ethical andphilosophical problems of humanity with a description of the general method ofemancipating oneself from the obsession of one’s own ideas.” This is prettyradical I think, for a Crowley post–Liber AL reception but prior to any majorLiber AL analyses. And it ties in pretty well with what I’ve touched upon,namely that any situation, moment, or phase will turn to inertia and entropy ifnot eventually challenged and kept in motion, so to speak. The force of habit isenormous in the human psyche, and the greatest compensation for all ills andweaknesses is seeking comfort. I’m not saying everyone has to go completelycrazy from time to time and oppose their own wills—that’s absolutely not thepoint—but sometimes it’s better to give oneself an active wake-up call than toreceive it from someone or something else.So how does creativity help in all of this? Does everyone need to try his or herhand at painting, like Crowley actually did? Of course not. I’m not saying thatart in itself is the key to this. But creativity is. No matter which field youwork and perhaps occasionally get stuck in, being creative is always an option.This means sometimes taking some time off, standing back, looking at things froma new perspective, “outside of the box,” as people say nowadays. In a mind framecompletely diametrical to what you’re used to, new things appear. These thingsand insights can then be applied to your normal life and work. That’s beingcreative.An artist is used to being inside associative mind frames and intuitive flows.But that does not in any way imply a perfect mental health or balance. Evenartists or traditionally creative people can be victims of inertia and entropy.They often are. They should allow a new method that is rational, strict,divided, stratified, and so on, to see what comes out of that. Perhaps nothingat all. But the mere jolt of looking at the world with new glasses should bringplenty of insights to integrate into one’s own creative process.Most of us, even devoted magicians, are stressed human-being ants, going fromhere to there and often forgetting to stop at times and evaluate. Thecontemporary human being needs a huge dose of stillness and quietude to be ableto even focus a thought or two. And focus, we should always keep in mind, is notthe same as singlemindedness. Meditation and yoga are invaluable in this regard,as is sleep of course. And being in nature, where chi is flowing freely.The stillness and silence most of us desperately need should of course not beconfused with either inertia or entropy. Balance never means passivity. Althoughthe physical system may temporarily shut down, the inner meditations may driftin active flights of fancy. Or, if the meditation is actually totally still,deeper strata will be activated and leak messages and ideas to the higherstrata. This could be called an ultra-creative state. As mentioned before,everything we create in any field of life stems from ideas, and ideas come fromsomewhere. When you find that link, use it well.You can’t force ideas to appear. If you can, you’re probably too advanced for ushere. Even in the magical process there is an analogy to this. Once the seed ofwill has been sown in ritual, it’s always best to focus on something compeletydifferent, to let it bloom in peace. Great ideas usually pop up like flowerswhen you’re not thinking about the problem or challenge in question. It’s almostas if it’s a force that needs to be rerouted to appear. It should push itselffrom the inside and out, and not be pulled from outside.If there are signs of fundamentalism or demagogic stagnancy in someone orsomething, you can rest assured it’s a matter of inertia and/ or entropy. If noone or nothing challenges this, sooner or later a crisis point will emerge, inwhich a kind of death occurs and decomposition sets in. My suggested remedy, asfrom Crowley and many others, is simply to stay aware of these mechanisms andkeep them at bay with continual personal challenges. Of course, the sameattitude should be encouraged in group dynamics too.All of this sounds simple. But in real life it is very hard indeed to notsuccumb to the already known and comfortable. The more we think about that, themore painful it usually becomes.It’s wrong to be specific on a personal level when it comes to other people.“Every man and woman is a star,” and so forth. Pointing the finger at someoneelse is usually a blunt camouflage of one’s own inadequacies. The same goes forgroups of people. If there are no challenges within the group structure todevelop on an individual level, one should cock a very critical eye towardpossible ulterior collectivisms, which are always un-Thelemic by definition.There is a lovely book called The Tao of Art by Ben Willis that I can stronglyrecommend for those who are interested in these dusty and abstract topics. Iwould like to end this talk by quoting from that book. It sort of sums it up,and even hints at our own cherished proto-mysteries. That is, if mysteries canactually belong to one specific entity:Every act of true creativity is the utilization of Tao energy and of the Taonature which is inherent in the intuitive mind and foundational being of man.Indeed, such creativity is indistinguishable from that spiritual mind and fromthe Tao, for they are one, and of the same substance and nature. The creativeforce is the energy and flow of life—it is life itself.3[9781620557044_nts.xhtml#nt70]"},{"pageContent":"20Memes or SchemesOriginally a lecture delivered at the Occult Humanities Conference, New YorkCity, United States, 2016.THIS WONDERFUL CONFERENCE is very symptomatic of the times we’re in.*7[9781620557044_ftn.xhtml#ft7] One thing leads to another, and people’s appetitefor phenomena and expressions beyond the merely causal and rational seemsinsatiable. But are we looking at a meme, that is, a small or large contagiousbuilding block in a large construction of a potential future, or a scheme, thatis, a conscious strategy that has already been willed? That is something I willhumbly address today.The occult is a romantic and fascinating part of our cultural history. It hasalso been the breeding ground for ideas and concepts that have later on beenintegrated in the natural sciences, religion, and psychology. The occult is alsoa cluster of promises containing a small, valuable signal of transformation atthe center of an enormous nebula of symbol-induced noise and psychologicalcompensation. If not impossible, then at least one could say it’s very difficultjust to say what it is. However, as a keyword or catchphrase in contemporaryculture, we have seen it take more and more place both within fiction and fact.Pop culture has been heavily immersed in occult and fantastic themes of variouskinds, via Hollywood and TV, in literature, and in music for more than a decade.Exactly parallel to that, academic interest in predominantly Western esotericismhas boomed, with relevant chairs appearing at universities almost yearly. Dittowithin the sphere of art, where the fantastic, mythological, spiritual, andintuitive is more and more visible on a larger and larger scale. And the sphereitself, that is, magic and occultism as a mix of philosophy and behavioraltechniques, some traditional and some entirely new, is also on the increase viathe Internet on one hand and beautiful publishing of both old and new works onthe other. There is no longer a heavy stigma, and there’s certainly no shortageof information for those who are interested in these fascinating areas of humanexistence.It’s not so strange that a phenomenon such as this occurs, that is, has apresence in culture. That has happened many times before, often during liberaland humanistic phases of cultural mutation, although often also heavilystratified and moderated by general attitudes of religions and morals. Usually,it’s the artists of different kinds who have carried the seed of human potentialand expressed whatever they have found, either to enthusiastic freethinkers orantagonistic conservatives. Today, it seems to be a different ball gamealtogether. We live in an era that is saturated and amplified in every possibleway, but most of all via popular media and social media.How do we look at this? Is it a genuine liberalization and so-calleddemocratization via the mere availability? Or is it a conspiratorial strategy toflood both the Web and the market with things to keep the masses pacified andconfused? One way of looking at it could be to use the concept of a meme. Theterm was originally coined by evolutionary biologist and anti-religionistRichard Dawkins as signifying a cultural counterpart to the gene, the smallestbuilding block of life, in constant flux, development, and possible mutation toattempt maximum survival. Dawkins’s comparison is not bad at all. Because morethan ever, we are no longer mere biological creatures causally striving to avoidthe eventual certainty of life, which is death. We are cultural human beingsimmersed in a flow of information, views, sentiments, and reactivity. In thislies the possibility of choice, especially within cultural spheres that allowindividual choice. If I understand Dawkins correctly, a meme is then a seed ofsorts, a protoconcept that can be either symbolic or literal, but thatinstigates actual change when it is integrated in a larger context by contagion.As most of the larger contexts are willed, that is, defined by one or more humanbeings as having a chosen direction, we can call these schemes. One needs theother: a meme only becomes tangibly potent within a scheme, an environment ofreception, interpretation, and integration. Schemes need willed concepts,originating as simple memes (ideas, notions, frustrations, key terms). The pointwhere the meme is integrated into or transformed into a scheme is one oftranscendence that sets energy free. For example, sniffing a perfume of someoneloved that is missed can bring forth an evocative presence, releasing wellbeing;or simplistic political sloganeering can lead to a particular outcome in anelection. They seem to belong together, in the same way a gene and a chromosomedoes, or a chromosome and a human existence. Or a human existence and greaterculture as such.Social media has great potential to mislead, confuse, and obfuscate, not onlythrough the conscious strategies of lobbyists and organizations but also throughgood old-fashioned human error. A funny and recent example here in the UnitedStates was a call to solidarity in regard to the Powerball $1.3 billion jackpot.Someone created a meme/ post encouraging the winner to share, based on acalculation that with 300 million American citizens, everyone could get $4.33million and poverty would be eradicated immediately. More than a million peopleimmediately shared the original and very altruistic post without thinking. Theonly problem was one of miscalculation: with the sum and the amount of people,each citizen would actually get $4.33, which today unfortunately is not enoughto eradicate poverty. But it certainly showed a contemporary behavioral patternthat is very eager to share an opinion—even though it’s objectively a wrongone—and a sentiment in great numbers. The meme turned into a seeminglybenevolent scheme that then became a new meme—this time of unfortunate scorn.The borders between fact and fiction are increasingly blurred these days. I havestated before that fiction is the new fact and has superseded traditional waysof learning, which leads to great uncertainties in terms of quality control,academic standards, and values. In our fantastic little occult corner ofculture, which we can call the suprarational and truth seeking, we can be amazedat not only the potential mutations but also marvel at the already existinghybrids. An example: Some of us remember the X-Files from the nineties, a TVseries integrating not only UFO-related mysteries but also a lot of occultismand paranormal phenomena. It was total pop, yes, but still highly entertainingand interesting, specifically considering creator and producer Chris Carter’squestioning of nontransparent governmental organizations. This led to both proand contra conspiracies: the TV series was, on the one hand, flaunting anattitude based in and on individual rights and a wider possibility of strangephenomena, many of which could be labeled occult. On the other hand, it wascriticized by more radical elements as being a conspiracy in itself, asmokescreen to divert serious attention from covert activities. Recently, as I’msure many of you know, a brand new season of the series has emerged. The firstepisodes were even harsher in their criticism of governmental conspiracies thanthe original ones, which were pre 9/11. The CIA has now almost humorouslyresponded by making available UFO and other material from their archives,presenting them as their X-Files and making references to the fictionalcharacters of FBI agents Mulder and Scully: “Mulder would have loved to get hishands on this.” This blurring between fact and fiction and interexchange ofmemes (within possible schemes) has never been as manifest as now. Entertaining,yes. But from a conspiratorial point of view, it’s dangerous. If people consumemore fiction and readily accept memes on social media without criticism, thenthe field is literally open to modify the memes as the controllers see fit—whichis basically the same as what’s going on in the empire of genetic research.In the midst of quite heavy entertainment on occult themes, whether inspiring orconspiratorial, there lingers still a slight sense of ridicule, which in itselfcould be both another smokescreen or a safeguard for inspiration turning intosubstance. If we consider the American Horror Story season called Coven, theexistence for the teen heroine witch can’t be easy, as she kills the men she hassex with. That symbol of a young vaginal two-edged sword is both potentiallyrepressive and liberating, and the mere existence of it within mainstream TV Ifind remarkable. At the same time, the common media phenomenon of teen witchesusually calls these women “twitches.” Sure, a slightly humorous play on words,but also a term signifying quite blatantly a nervous disorder symptom.From the literally occult or gnostic meme-versus-scheme perspective, there iswhat I would call an advantage. Chris Carter’s slogan “The truth is out there”or Agent Mulder’s “I want to believe,” or even Agent Scully’s “I want todisbelieve,” all reflect a causal, rational, sensory-based approach based onempiricism. The gnostic memetic schemer knows that the truth is already “inhere” and that it’s not possible to want to believe: one either does or doesn’t.This accepting vantage point can indeed be amplified by empirical research ifone so desires, but it’s only interesting from a schematic point of view: thatis, if you have something to sell—philosophy, a method, a book, a workshop, andso on. But it’s certainly not necessary. There were many reasons why occultismas such was kept stigmatized and hidden in varying degrees over the millennia.But one factor rarely addressed was simply that this kind of work is personal,individual, intuitive—gnostic, by definition. The more systematized andobjective something becomes, the greater the risk of it becoming part ofpsychosocial circuses, petty power struggles, and essentially non-altruisticschemes. However, the creative possibilities of the opposite always remain:whenever a meme morphs into a scheme, it becomes transdimensional, sets energyfree, and thereby becomes inherently magical.In the exhibition The Language of the Birds we can see examples ofinterpretations and expressions based on individual filtering of non-rational,nonintellectual stimuli. Whether these come from within, from without, or frombeyond is quite irrelevant. The artworks affect us in varying degrees based ondeep resonances. This is of course valid for non-occult art too. Something in aspecific artwork makes us stop, feel, reflect, and integrate. It is a languagein itself based on the emotional or sentient rather than the intellectual,mental, or word based. But the distinctly occult art acknowledges the power ofmyth and symbol for what it is: an absolutely essential ingredient of life andthe individuation process. Reconnecting with a primordial sphere viaaestheticized expressions is not only personally liberating but also possiblyhealing for others.Things always seem to emerge in culture for which there is a need. On the moregeneral level, superheroes in fiction always seem to appear when there is anabounding sense of powerlessness and fatigue. Antigovernment conspiracies appearwhen the gap is simply too big between citizens and rulership. LSD appeared atabout the same time as the atomic bomb was developed and unleashed. Vaccines aredeveloped when an epi- or pandemic is threatening. And the occult literally popsup when the normal, scientific explanations become too abstract, distant,redundant, or elite. Art and entertainment reflect, yes, but always also containnew memes, quite often beyond the comprehension of even their creators, andquite often very vital in their seeking new hosts to mutate.If we look back at human civilization, what remains to be analyzed and evaluatedare basically the works of art. Writings and artworks tell a story of not onlywhat people did but also what they felt and how they looked at their own world.This has proven to be invaluable in understanding human development. In thefuture, the analysts of our times won’t be let off so easily. Not only willthere be more concrete stuff in the rubble: mountain ranges of technologicalwaste, organic-plastic hybrids at sea, and urban wastelands to penetrate, butany evidence of written history will most likely be nonexistent because of dataevaporation. And contemporary art, if someone will be able to find it, willmostly be abstract on many levels: either as strictly formal and therebyredundant, or as needing an intellectual explanation, such as an interpretationor instruction manual.Artworks that contain a pure intuitive filtering and expression—no matter howformally competent or incompetent—have the ability to convey sentiments andmessages to the future. Not infrequently, we can see that these artists alsoshare a similar subconscious approach to life in general: a susceptibility tointuitive survival modes beyond the personal ego. Even in the bleakest dystopianvisions lie seed or memes of great potential change. Even in the most shallowNew Age pastels can be found diamondlike facet spectra, filtering indestructiblelight and energy. I think one key to relevant art is that it doesn’t presentprefab solutions but rather distinctly resonating surfaces for furtherindividual introspection. It encourages speculation. The same I think is true ofthe cluster we call occultism. What we see on the surface we can either regardor disregard. But if we shut down the defense systems temporarily, we can allowan influx of life stemming from another mind, whether contemporary or ancient.Memes that are eventually integrated don’t lose potency, but sometimes they doneed to be looked at in a new context. The genetic comparison is again quiteuseful. We are not only now. We have already existed, through our genetichistory, for a long time and will hopefully continue. Perhaps not in exactly thesame kind of human form, but still. . . . The truth is in here.The lure of occultism shares many traits with other human idealized “isms.” Oneis the romantic notion that there are hidden masters working for improvement viainitiating structures, with colorful teachers disseminating specific teaching inorder to cultivate the ennobled individual. This is no different from auniversity, a military organization, a religious organization, a politicalmovement, or an artistic institution. The schematic analysis is basically thesame. But occultism differs slightly in regard to what is contained: an activerefinement of the inner spheres rather than the outer. And with suggestedtechniques that have not yet been accepted as science by the contemporarydefinitions or standards. That said, one could argue that contemporary occultismis no longer about performing arcane rituals using traditional elemental orplanetary symbols but rather about experimental art, cognitive psychology,neurology, and applied physics—preferably all of these in union. This is what’snow considered as potentially liberating, in the sense of “empowering,” andthereby also potentially threatening to the pacifying forces, similar to the wayKabbalah, tarot, meditation, and yoga were looked down upon not that long ago.Another different trait or quality is that the memes received in so-calledoccult theory and practice don’t need outer recognition to be validated. What’sreceived and integrated comes from deeper or hidden aspects of oneself, and theonly relevant validating force is the individual him- or herself. To be able todo that, one needs to be a stable and secure individuated human being. Solidinternal memes should be the building blocks within distinctly individualschemes. The Delphic motto of Nosce te ipsum (“Know thyself!”) has never beenmore relevant than in our era of massive and simplified homogenization. In thissense, occultism can also become a romanticized trap, offering endlesspossibilities of escapism, compensation, and counterproductiveself-aggrandizement. It’s not enough to know yourself: you also have to assumeresponsibility for what you find. Otherwise the memes you discover or codify maynot match any greater schemes at all.Is there an actual equation or a relationship here? That is, is the allure ofthe potential scheme tied to the incapacity of the partaker obsessed by thememes themselves—as I actually perceive many occultists to be? Does it fulfillan escapist, compensatory function rather than a tangible, transforming one?With no further likenesses intended, perhaps we could look at the differencebetween athletes and sports fans; the inspiring memes of sports and fiercelybrave competition attract those who long for physical, existential change intheir own life schemes that perhaps seem impotent or just comfortablycomplacent, but how many actually transform the original memes into tangible,life-improving schemes?The current magical revival in popular culture is in many ways symptomatic of aWestern malaise and frustration with the given options, in which the individualis placed within either a materialistic collective or a reactionary monotheisticreligion, or possibly a combination. Both are mere substitutes for a genuineexistential worth and meaning that can only come from within, defined throughactive individuation. My theory is that the solutions are always a lot closerthan we think. In regard to global environmental problems, it can certainly betempting to long for outer space. But perhaps it’s more intelligent to lookaround on our own fine planet instead, at cultures who have actually managed tosurvive through crises in history, either via still-existing, living indigenoushumans or through remaining works of art. If we can assimilate instead of just“exoticize,” we will find that there are many distinct traits in common, suchas, for instance, a validation of inner, intuitive processes of gatheringinformation, and a holistic approach to their implementation. This is beyondreligion, occultism, philosophy, or magic. It’s just common sense, in whichmemes from inner nature become schemes in outer nature, and possibly vice versa.I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s all essentially the same thing and that afree-flowing circulation will help mutate existence to ensure maximum survival,both on memetic and genetic levels.In recent years, I’ve suggested exchanging terminologies between thetraditionally occult and the traditionally artistic, thereby helping theassimilation of potentially transformative techniques and attitudes bydiscarding the arcane and often incomprehensible symbolic world in favor of aprotocreative, perhaps even undefined, rationale of sympathetic behavior andstrategy. A new generation of “artists of the soul” would need no formaltraining within either pseudoreligious groups or so-called art schools. It’s alla matter of integrating an inner process of self-knowledge, desire, and, let’snot forget, will, within an outer process of communicating the findings orresults in a literally enchanting form, not just containing a willed expressionbut rather an expressed will. To paraphrase Dawkins’s “selfish gene,” I hopethat artists will develop more selfish memes, in the sense of art ingrained withpersonal intention. With that perspective in mind, I think it’s clear to seethat our culture contains almost unlimited possibilities of self-expression andcommunication. For those curious and brave, it’s no longer a question of memesor schemes, but rather one of a natural, intuitive merging of the two into acreative synthesis that transcends philosophy, art, literature, the occult, andso on, in jolts of further inspiration and advancement."},{"pageContent":"21Intuition as a State of GraceOriginally a lecture delivered at Overgaden in Copenhagen, Denmark, 2014.IMAGINE A PERSON fiercely focused on the creation of an object. He or she isundisturbed, and the surroundings are optimized for this specific creation. Thevision is clear, sketches or preparatory fragments have helped the gearing upfor the moment of execution, amplified by suitable music and perhaps evenspecial clothes for the occasion. The tension increases, the work is begun, andwhen it’s over, a great sense of well-being and release becomes overwhelming.Did I just describe an artist or a magician at work? Did I just describe someoneexternalizing inner creative concepts or someone programming the cosmos? Well,both of course, as they’re essentially the same in method and approach. Thislittle talk today will focus on the conceptual similarities of the creativeprocess involved in art and magic. As we’ll see, there are considerably moreaspects that unite them than set them apart.This is not implying that the one always perfectly corresponds to the other. Butthere is more than enough common ground to see that the creative processinvolved is highly similar. What makes the two areas differ is usually one ofpurpose and potential-in-extension.The common ground is not surprising. At one point in time, art and magic werebasically the same, intertwined and necessary for tribal well-being. Cavepaintings, ritual dances, evocative music, programmatic poetry, talismanicjewelry, charged weapons were all part of a creative process with a distinctpurpose: to make something desired happen and to make something undesired nothappen.As with many things in human cultural development, major existential shifts tookplace and things became specialized and compartmentalized—a process still goingon today, for good or bad. The mystically spiritual and ecstatic becameorganized in religions with professional proxy-priesthoods. The previouslyintegrated artistic expressions as agents of willed change instead becameparticular professions for individuals with a specific talent. But where didthis talent originally come from?In our human progress, evolution, and development, we contain everything that’spassed before us in our DNA. We are like cosmic tape recorders in anever-evolving process of refinement and adaptation. Special qualities needed forsurvival are passed on in tradition, myth, and genetic mass. This is still beingconceptualized and expressed by artistically creative people in many fields.That’s their function, so to speak: to move everything onward and bring the goodstuff along.As mentioned before, this creative strain was divided into specialized skillsand professions. Some became scientists, some historians, and some continuedmanifesting their own personal visions in externalized artistic forms. Thesehave been some of the main sanctioned expressions and professions within humanculture. But there have also been those who’ve retained a traditional yet highlyexperimental labor in working with the unseen and immeasurable. Sometimes thesehave been more or less integrated in society, but most often not. The magicianshave most often worked on their own or in small groups of like-minded souls.Dealing with basically the same behavioral methods and questions but usuallywith an added ingredient: personal will—meaning that what is created alsocarries a charge that helps change things in unseen, immeasurable, and presentlyunknown ways.When art as such became integrated as a more or less necessary but commodifiedfield of work, it was still an expression of this same human need. We need artand culture as reflective surfaces, personal catharsis, and release, assomething to initiate existential conversations and thought fodder—essentialfuel for progress and development. Everyone knows that, and it’s always there.The amount of people actively dealing with art (as opposed to dealing in art) isminimal today compared to the totality of human beings, and yet the status isstill high—that is, if the artist in question is successful. Even in the mosttotalitarian of societies, there is art to amplify the condoned, allowed, andencouraged agenda.One should perhaps also enter the very sensitive question here: What exactly isart? There have been so many definitions over the centuries that one gets tiredby the mere overview: Berenson’s life-enhancement angle; Tolstoy’s egalitarian,almost antibeatific angle; Goethe’s and later Steiner’s spiritual angle; Beuys’ssocial sculpture angle; Gurdjieff’s objective angle; Duchamp’s sardonicallydetached angle—it’s all one big mess or mesh of contradicting yet eloquenttheories and postulates. It’s really no wonder that contemporary art theory isso ephemeral and elusive. Basically, the definitions seem to go intimately handin hand with whatever tradition or school will soon be obsolete. The only commondenominator that really seems to permeate all of them is art’s originalfunction: a magical one. But that aspect is seldom looked upon with admiringeyes by our civilization’s defining minds.What then of magic? It’s almost as chaotic there but more muddled and oftenquite vile. I think Aleister Crowley came up with the best definition so far:“Magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity withwill.” All other attempts seem quite futile compared to that.Even in the most well-ordered and confined expressions the artist often feels aneed to go beyond the formal norms and normal forms. Art history is packed withindividual examples that have led themselves straight into Draconian measuresbecause they felt some kind of need to. The same is the case in the history ofscience. The pioneers are seldom praised until the masses catch up. And thenit’s usually too late to enjoy it. The deviators, rebels, iconoclasts havealways been able to sneak at least some degree of seed sowing into works of artotherwise condoned and integrated in a wholesome totality of a “greater good.”This can vary from a new stylistic touch to an unseen piece of content, as inhidden symbols, or even conscious subversions of content or form, and so forth.Basic psychology tells us that the artist needs to express him- or herself,almost compulsively, putting feelings, desires, skill, excellence, or evenself-doubt in a form that touches people enough to cause them to react. Thereaction becomes a validation not only of the process involved but also ofcourse of the person and mind behind it all. When that’s not there, thefrustration of invisibility and poverty abounds. When it is there, on the otherhand, a deep-rooted sense of bliss and meaning takes hold. This vulnerability ofthe individual supports a strong system of market and moral control, which issomething artists have far too often adapted to.For reasons having to do with traditional stigma or ostracism, the magician hasup until recently been quite content with working in silence or in a hiddensphere. Let’s not forget that the word occult means “hidden” in Latin. That,however, doesn’t mean that magicians and occultists have been less susceptibleto personal sensitivity, weakness, and ego compensation. It’s quite often thecontrary. But there’s one thing that usually sets their work apart from that ofthe artists. It’s the concept of defined will. A magician has a distinct senseof purpose, a (hopefully) well-thought-through plan and a goal for the work inquestion. If it’s a matter of a ceremony, it’s to uphold a balance andatmosphere. If it’s an active ritual, it’s to change something specific in thesmall or grand arena of life. The creative process then acts as a means and notan end in itself.It’s interesting to note that magicians usually avoid the limelight, as the workitself holds precedence. The artist, on the other hand, can use both negativeand positive visibility to his or her own benefit. That’s simply because oursociety needs scandalous individuals and outsiders in general to relievecollective tension. A successful and media-conscious artist works equally wellas a movie star. At times, magicians appear who take on celebrity or notorietystatus, but they can only expect flack or negative exposure. Aleister Crowleyand Anton LaVey are two well-known examples from the twentieth century.So what unites these two protohuman endeavors that were once wholly intertwined?Some principal ties are: * Irrationality as key or necessary agent. The rational mind frame hampers genuine creativity. * Imagination and visionary ability. You trust what you perceive and not what others tell you to perceive. * Heavy emotional engagement in the creative process (as opposed to purely causal, detached labor). If you don’t feel and believe in what’s going on, everything will be a barren and soulless endeavor. * Externalization of inner processes. New life comes from within and moves outside. * Creation as an umbrella for a supra-ecstatic flow: more than mere “joy” in working. Elevated states of mind, ideas, and epiphanies as results of the mind being in neutral gear, so to speak. * Manifestation as building block or aggregate of experience. “A life’s work.” One thing leads to another, and if one is conscious of and grateful about it, many life-enhancing synchronicities will follow. * Integration of the symbolic. Naturalism is not possible and only pleases the rational mind. Where schooling within a tradition is often necessary, the development of one’s own language or code is crucial for maximum impact. In magic, this means, for instance, being schooled in one specific tradition like Western ceremonial magic and then drifting off into your own devices and methods. In art it could be schooling or being inspired within, for instance, surrealism, and then moving on in personal integrations of, for instance, scientific symbols and codes. * An integrated breach of the previous stage: tradition is transcended, not seldom aggressively. Rebels rebel in both instances. Hiccups and revolutions are necessary for overall health because the most radical and extreme occurrences always end up as rigid and conservative environments. Iconoclastic bowel movements.There is also another common key ingredient in this magical art-soup:intuition—that lovely nonrational flow of existence so cherished by Taoists andcreative people. What exactly is it? It’s a temporary freedom from causal bondsand rational thinking that sets inner creativity and happiness free. It’s awell-known but pretty undefined positive state of mind that helps us a lot indecision making and creation. What would art be if intuition weren’t there? Amere outer construction work of ideas or concepts. What would magic be withoutintuition? A mere reading of a cosmic user’s manual. Trusting one’s intuitionmay be the most important ingredient there is. Especially so in an overallculture that is increasingly binary and dualistic in both outlook and method.An artist in our sphere of the world usually works in a much more causal andcommodified structure than a magician. In your studio, you create. That’s highlysatisfying, but you also know that you have to get by by going through manymotions to secure sustenance and exposure of your creations. That’s because ourculture as such only really allows “approved” entrepreneurs and manufacturers ofacceptable influx through complex systems of exhibition, appraisal, validation,criticism, and financial compensation. If you play the game by the rules you’remore than welcome to compete for your place in the sun of recognition andappreciation.This is, of course, a generalized view of the situation, but no less true. Mostartists unnecessarily restrain themselves by adapting to a very clearly definedset of rules. You fight and get bitter and disillusioned if you don’t succeed,or fight and get happy if you do. In a way, the outer circumstances dictate theinner feelings because there’s an outer arbiter or commander commenting andjudging whether or not what you make has any value or merit as such.But the direction should be from the inside outward. Yes, a filtering ofexternal influx is inevitable and perhaps even essential. But it needs to befiltered on the inside, in the alchemical oven, in the fire, in the womb. Seedscome from the outside in, but the new life comes from the inside outward. Thatsexual or procreative analogy is a central one in both art and magic. Or shouldbe. We should remember these kinds of very basic wisdoms from many bright mindswithin philosophy and magic, but perhaps specifically Buckminster Fuller when hedeclared: “Mimic nature and you can’t go wrong!”Let’s zoom back to earlier phases when art was still ingrained with magic andvice versa. That is, when it had the power to change and not only entertain.When the power of the artwork, object, or performance wasn’t measured bytransactions validating the creator in question but rather by whether theoutcome of its charge was successful. The worth of the artist then lay in theability to systematize and charge chosen artistic expressions, like a sculpture,dance, song, painting, and so on. Success in that sphere guaranteed an elevatedstatus within the tribe or commune.In my experience, however, it’s as if contemporary magic and its practitionersare lost in a maze of conservative content and very rigid traditional approachesto form when it comes to applying this ancient, primordial science and art to amodern world. It’s similar to the way art as such has been pushed back to beingan aestheticized, commodified world of forms filtered through desperate andpetty egos and their external commanders, with too much content and energy onthe one hand and too much form and intellectual nervousness on the other. Itseems both areas have become victims of our binary times, with rigidity and lackof courage as banners. The result is that positions become heavier and heavierin the choking illusion of safety, with occasional volcanic, psychic outburstswhen the respective intellectual decompression chambers aren’t working as theyshould. There should be a healthier balance.It seems I can’t deliver a lecture without returning to one of the most potentand beautiful metaphorical scenes ever in movie history: Mickey Mouse as thesorcerer’s apprentice in Disney’s Fantasia. In youthful enthusiasm yet amplelaziness, Mickey uses magical tricks to make cleaning house simpler. This is tocatastrophic results. But he learns his lesson well from the returning and veryangry magician: one needs to know not only the tools of one’s trade but also tobe very clear in what one wants to achieve with these tools.What if a young generation consciously connected the currently separated ends ofthe power cable of meta-programmatic content and alluringly suitable form? Andwhat if they not only joined forces but actually joined the very life forceitself? It’s a very challenging thought and potentially a dangerous one.During the past decade, a keen interest in esoteric protagonists, movements, andartists has seeped into the art world. We have, for instance, seen a revitalizedappraisal of masters like Swedish painter Hilma af Klint. The exhibition thatwas at the Louisiana Museum (outside of Copenhagen) last year has been seen byover a million people all over Europe. That hardly sounds like an esotericexhibition. In 2008, the Centre Pompidou in Paris housed an enormous exhibitioncalled Traces de Sacré (Traces of the Sacred), which was an overwhelmingcelebration of art and the occult. The Venice Biennale of 2013 was packed withworks of an occult nature, ranging from Lady Frieda Harris, the woman whopainted Crowley’s Thoth Tarot deck, Carl Jung’s Red Book, Borges’s imaginarybeings, and on to Xul Solar’s collages. There are, nowadays, academic symposiafocusing on the intersection between art and occult history. The term occultureis now almost mainstream and indicates previously esoteric themes as having beenaccepted and “exotericized.” Also, new generations of artists are reexpressingand integrating occult, religious, or spiritual themes in their own way, both inform and content. This could vary from using Goethe’s color schemes, listeningto inner voices, experimenting with higher states of consciousness, allowingexperiences in nature to shape one’s expressions via inclusion of distinctlyoccult iconography in images and other kinds of works. Quite simply, thecolorful gray area between art and the occult is established and ever growing.To a greater extent than ever before, young artists tend not to separate theprocess from the product, so to speak. The process can be magical, and the artobject then becomes something that carries a charge beyond the merely estheticor personally cathartic. In fact, in these times, an increasing number ofartworks become talismans. They are the results of a consciously willed yetintuitive process, and they contain remnants not only of that process as aresult but also energy that has been set in motion in a desired direction.Whether the partakers realize or know this is irrelevant. But that artists workwith this kind of thinking and making is in fact highly relevant and healthy.Where art for so long has touched upon attribute rather than on essence, thereseems to be a shift going on in which the positions are being diametricallychanged. The essential meaning becomes more important than that of the attributeof aesthetics and commercial value. This of course brings us back to primordialtimes when it was indeed more important that the artwork contained power than anattractive surface. When language gradually took over, rationality and structurefollowed suit. Yet the need for the primordial, magical expression has beenthere all along and now seems to finally resurface within its own perimeters.This is without a doubt an effect of a too-rational culture gone overboard. Inour desperation to survive as a species, let alone as individuals, differentremedies are needed than the ones prescribed by a status quo complacency. Thisis an all-permeating and anxious movement in our present times. So it’s hardlysurprising that art shrugs off some superficiality and assumes theresponsibility it once had. Art should not only inspire us to live more fullyand think free thoughts and feel free emotions. It should also present solutionsand alternatives beyond the many rationalistic, materialistic, binary fallacieswe have already experienced or committed. But the beauty of it all is that thisis not going to happen in dogmatic, intellectual ways or through an abstract,postmodernist discourse. It’s going to be more direct, vibrant, alive, poetic,emotional, violent, and expressive. Although perhaps shaped in entirely newlanguages and codes, it won’t be hard to interpret at all. It’s going to beguided by intuition and survival instinct and not by faint references toprevious “isms” or demagogic simplifications to alleviate bad Westernconsciences. Individual intuition may be that original state of grace sobrutally shoved aside by monotheistic religion to pave the way for hubristicself-destruction. The art that catches this drift and integrates protohumandesire and behavior will become the talismanic art that will literally help savethe world as we know it and love it."},{"pageContent":"Footnotes*1 [9781620557044_c01.xhtml#fn1].
