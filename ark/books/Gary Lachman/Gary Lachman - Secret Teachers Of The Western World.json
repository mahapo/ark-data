They form, as the historian of the occultJames Webb called it, a body of “rejected knowledge,” the intellectual refuse wehave discarded as we abandoned the superstitions of the past in order to embracethe science of the modern day.In some ways this is an accurate if incomplete assessment. Yet as I have triedto show in earlier books, this “other” tradition, however disparaged, refuses todisappear, and it remains in different forms available to us today. Why is thisother knowledge rejected and why does it refuse to go away?The central reason this knowledge is rejected is that it fails to meet thecriteria of “real” knowledge set by modern science. Since its beginnings in theseventeenth century, modern science has focused on the kind of “facts” that canbe grasped by the senses and proven by measurement. It abandoned the religiousexplanations for the world, which posited an unseen God behind the universe;accepted only that which it could see and touch; and brought an acute analysisto the phenomena of the physical world. Gradually, and with increasingcertainty, it came to the conclusion that the only knowledge worth knowing wasthe kind that could be quantified. Physical laws that could be observed andmeasured would, it believed, account for everything, and the belief thatanything else was needed or that anything could escape the necessities imposedby these laws was abandoned. The results of this belief we see around useverywhere, from the computer I am using to write this book to the probes wehave sent out into space in order to explore the mysteries of the universe.To say that this kind of knowledge is good and useful is an understatement. Asmore than one historian has pointed out, because of it the world has advancedmore in the last few centuries than in the millennia that preceded them. Thisknowledge is absolutely indispensable, and because of it we today, who profit byit, live lives undreamed of by our ancestors. But is it the only kind ofknowledge?The esoteric tradition says no. There is another kind of knowledge. It is notone of physical facts, nor can it be quantified and measured. It is a knowledgeof our inner world, not the outer one, a knowledge of what we used to call thespirit or the soul, that invisible, intangible something that animates us andleads us to ask questions about who we are and what our place in this mysteriousworld can be. It is essentially concerned with the meaning of our existence, aquestion that the other kind of knowledge cannot answer or rejects as nonsense.For our scientific kind of knowledge, the spirit or soul are superstitions,delusions, as neither can be detected by the senses. Who has seen the soul orspirit? For the esoteric tradition, the physical world available to the sensesthat science affirms as the only reality is only a small part of a much greaterreality, an invisible, inner reality, that informs the outer world and gives itlife and meaning.For those who have a sense of this invisible, other reality, the answers tolife’s mysteries offered by modern science are inadequate and unsatisfying. Theyare unable to accept them and they find themselves seeking something else.For most of our history, mankind in some way believed in the existence of thisother, invisible world, inaccessible to the senses. It is only in relativelyrecent times that we have rejected it as unreal and placed all our faith in thetruths of modern science. Yet not everyone has been happy with this conclusion;traces of this other knowledge remain and many persist in trying to understandit and what it can tell us about ourselves. The proponents of modern scienceinsist this is a mistake and assure us that we must reject this false knowledgein order to gain the truth. Yet the feeling that this other knowledge hassomething to tell us persists, and despite all the attempts by modern science toeradicate it, it stubbornly remains.For different people in different ways there is a nagging, insistent sense thatsomething is missing, and that for all its undeniable achievements and advancesin understanding the physical world, the explanations for themselves and theuniverse offered by modern science lack something important. There is thefeeling that somewhere, in the background, there is something that would helpmake sense of it all, but that we can’t quite put our finger on it. Theknowledge offered by the esoteric tradition may be rejected, but the feelingthat without it we are somehow incomplete is something that simply won’t goaway. Whether we like it or not, we seem to be stuck with it.In 2011, I came across a book that led me to see this rejected knowledge in anew and very suggestive light. It was The Master and His Emissary (2009) by thepsychiatrist and literary scholar Iain McGilchrist. The Master and His Emissaryis about our two cerebral hemispheres, the right and left sides of the brain,and the differences between them. What exactly our having two brains has to dowith the western esoteric tradition may not seem immediately clear. But if thereader will bear with me, the connection—a very important one—should become lessobscure as we go along.OUR OTHER SELFAs everyone today knows, the cliché idea about the left and right brain is thatthe left is a scientist while the right is an artist. In the nineteenth century,this neat dichotomy was summed up in a handy formula: “left for language, rightfor recognition.” The fact that we have two brains has been recognized formillennia—Greek physicians in the third century B.C. speculated aboutit—although exactly why we do has never been clearly understood.1[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber0] The left, the story goes, deals with language,logic, and sequential thought and has an acute sense of time, while the right isattuned to patterns, intuition, sees wholes simultaneously, and seems to residein a kind of eternal present—at any rate it has a poor sense of time. The leftcerebral hemisphere deals with language, it is the home of our ego, the verbal“I” with which we identify. Next door to it—or “us”—separated by a bundle ofneural fibers called the corpus callosum or commissure, resides, for all intentsand purposes, a stranger. This stranger does not speak but communicates insymbols, images, intuitions, hunches, even physical sensations, and may, as sometheorists have speculated, be involved in paranormal phenomena.One of the most bizarre findings of split-brain research is that when, for somereason, the corpus callosum, which facilitates communication between thehemispheres, is severed—sometimes in order to inhibit epileptic fits, which area kind of “electrical storm” within the brain—the result is that the patientliterally becomes two people. For some unknown reason, the right side of thebody is controlled by the left brain, and the left side by the right. When theconnection between the hemispheres is broken, the oddity about this arrangementbecomes clear. Experiments with patients with severed commissures producedextraordinary results.For example, our right visual field is controlled by the left brain, and ourleft visual field by the right (each eye has a right and left field, but forconvenience’s sake I will speak of the left and right eye). A patient whosecommissure was severed was shown an apple with his right eye, connected to theleft, verbal brain, and an orange with his left eye, connected to his speechlessright brain. When asked what he had seen, he replied “apple”; when asked towrite with his left hand—connected to his right brain—what he had seen, he wrote“orange.” Shown two different symbols—a circle and a square—with each eye, whenasked what he had seen, he replied “square.” When asked to draw with his lefthand what he was just shown, he drew a circle. When asked what he had justdrawn, he replied “a square.” A patient might bump into something with his leftside, connected to his right brain, but not notice it. He didn’t notice itbecause “he” lives in his left brain and so really did not bump into anything;it was the stranger in his right brain who did. One woman was shown a sexypicture with her left eye and blushed; asked why she was blushing, she repliedquite accurately, “I don’t know.”2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber1]Some split-brain patients find that they have become a divided self, literallybattling with their other half. One patient complained that doing groceryshopping became an ordeal. “I’d reach with my right hand for the thing I wanted,but the left would come in and they’d kind of fight.” Even dressing became astruggle: the two sides had different tastes and a patient might wind up wearingthree outfits at once.3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber2] Yet there are times whenthe right brain comes to the aid of the left. The neuropsychologist Roger Sperrytested split-brain patients by flashing red and green lights randomly at theirleft eye and asking them to guess which color they had just seen. As the patientcouldn’t have seen anything—“he” lives in the left, verbal hemisphere—theresults should have been fifty-fifty. Yet more times than not, a patient wouldsay “red,” then suddenly start, change his mind, and answer “green”; his rightbrain had heard the incorrect answer and metaphorically kicked his other halfunder the table. We all have had the experience of having a name or word on “thetip of the tongue,” but not quite being able to remember it; the French have aterm for this, presque vu, “almost seen.” What may be at work here is that theright brain somehow knows what we want to say, but can’t tell the left. Yet weare right to think that we do know it, as our other half does, and it may try togive us clues.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber3] Goethe famously wrote in Faustthat “Zwei Seelen wohnen, ach! In meiner Brust” (“Two souls, alas, live in mybreast”). It seems that Goethe was right.Yet with all this fascinating material, neuroscientists soon began to loseinterest in studying the split brain. One reason was that, with increasingresearch, the neat localization of functions in either side of the brain did nothold up. Scientists soon realized that although one hemisphere may be moredominant in some processes—as the left is with language—both sides of the braindo the same things and are involved in practically all our activities.5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber4] The neat separation into localized functionsunraveled and scientists began to wonder if there really was anythinginteresting in the fact that we have two brains. Some even joked that we have asecond one as a kind of spare, in case the other is damaged.Another reason research into our two hemispheres dwindled is that most “hard”scientists disapproved of the popularizing of split-brain theory by “soft”self-help psychology and New Age gurus, and understandably wanted to back awayfrom it. Peer pressure, professional prudence, and the recognition that therewere no significant functional differences between the hemispheres meant thatmost serious neuroscientists made a discreet exodus from our twin brains. Theone legacy from the early days of split-brain theory that remained enshrined inmainstream neuroscience is that the left “logical” brain is dominant. The right,it believed, was “minor,” a kind of slightly helpful sidekick who tags alongwhile the boss deals with serious matters. The right brain was the “spare,” itseemed, while the left was the main set of equipment, something thatMcGilchrist, with a daunting amount of research, set out to disprove.DUAL REALITIESThe Master and His Emissary is important because it revamps the split-braindiscussion, and it does it in a way that opens up whole new areas ofinvestigation, some of which, I believe, throw new light on our rejected,esoteric tradition. There is an important difference between our two cerebralhemispheres, McGilchrist argues, but it is not a difference in what they do, butin how they do it.6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber5] Both sides of our brain maydo the same things, and be involved in the same functions, but each sideperforms these functions differently—very differently, in fact. Our two brainshave radically different approaches to our experience and the world; indeed,McGilchrist even suggests that they are different personalities, somethingsplit-brain patients have discovered for themselves, with their “other” brainhaving different tastes in food and clothing. McGilchrist argues that thedifferences between our cerebral hemispheres are so great that “for us as humanbeings there are two fundamentally opposed realities,” an insight that, indifferent ways, is shared by our rejected esoteric tradition.7[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber6]The right brain, which, McGilchrist tells us, is older and more fundamental—itis the “master” of his title—presents reality as a unified whole. It providesthe “big picture” of a living, breathing Other, that strange, ambiguous worldthat exists outside our minds. It is geared toward the new, the unfamiliar, andwith what we can call the immediate “is-ness” of things, the Istigkeit of themedieval Rhineland mystic Meister Eckhart. It is concerned with implicitmeanings that can be felt but not pinned down exactly; it is partial to what thephilosopher Michael Polanyi called “the tacit dimension,” the implied, intuitedmeanings of which, as Polanyi says, “we can know more than we can tell.”8[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber7] Poetry, metaphor, images, and symbols are someways in which we try to communicate what the right brain shows us, and themeanings these forms of expression convey share in this implicitness. Goodpoetry has an aura of suggestiveness around it, a sense that it reaches outbeyond the dictionary meanings of the words it uses; it alludes to asignificance that we cannot express specifically, but which nonetheless touchesus.The right brain is geared toward engaging with living things, McGilchrist says,and with recognizing overall patterns, meanings, and relations. It is attuned tothe network of connections that links everything with everything else. Itsfundamental attention is to the “whole,” which it takes in simultaneously. It ismore geared to perceiving the forest, we might say, and not the individualtrees.The left brain, on the other hand—literally—is geared, McGilchrist argues,toward breaking up the whole that the right presents. It turns the right brain’sunity into bits and pieces, which it can then manipulate. Its job is to analyzethe big picture presented by the right and reduce it to easily manageable parts,which it can control and arrange to suit its purposes. These are generallygeared toward survival. Where the right is open to “newness” and appreciates the“being” of things-in-themselves, the left is geared to representing reality assomething familiar and sees things in terms of their use. The left brain has autilitarian approach to reality, whereas the right just accepts things as theyare. The left brain “stands apart” from experience, it distances itself from itin order to master it, while the right brain is in it. We use the left brain to“cope” with the world, as it were, while it is through the right that weappreciate it.McGilchrist explains that the right brain needs the left because its picture,while of the whole, is fuzzy and imprecise. The left brain “unpacks” the wholethat the right brain presents, and brings its details into sharper focus. Theleft, on the other hand, needs the right because while it can focus withdazzling clarity on discreet bits, it loses the connections between things andcan find itself stranded in a fragmented world. One brain can lose itself in avague, hazy perception of the whole; the Other, in a narrow obsession with thepart. One brain gives us context, the other detail. One looks at a panorama, theother through a microscope. One brain presents everything “allatonce”; the otherin bits and pieces “one-at-a-time.” If we think of a camera and how its lens canbe focused on either the background or the foreground, we can see how these twoopposing perceptions of things complement each other. In life, we need to seethe forest and the trees, often at the same time, and this can prove difficult.It would be impossible for one brain to do this, McGilchrist contends, and so wehave two.9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber8]WHO’S THE BOSS?Probably the most controversial argument in The Master and His Emissary isMcGilchrist’s contention that the right brain, rather than a superfluoussidekick, is really the boss, although the left brain generally refuses torecognize this. As mentioned earlier, the right brain is older; its form ofperceiving and interacting with the world is primary. We would not, McGilchristargues, have a “world” for the left brain to carve up and manipulate if it werenot for the right brain’s “presencing” of it in its unadulterated wholeness.In fact, McGilchrist sees the relation between the two hemispheres as a friendlybut serious rivalry. Throughout our history, he argues, they have been engagedin a system of cerebral checks and balances, with each inhibiting the other’sexcesses in a neurological embodiment of William Blake’s dictum that “Oppositionis true friendship.” As we have seen with split-brain patients, this friendlyopposition can get out of hand, with the two sides canceling each other out. Butfor the most part, McGilchrist says, our two brains have complemented each otheramiably.Until recently, that is.McGilchrist argues that since the Industrial Revolution, this power-sharingagreement has broken down, with the left brain assuming an increasingly dominantposition. It was at this point that the “Emissary” usurped power from the“Master.” The situation is rather like that of the Gnostic creation myth, inwhich the demiurge, or craftsman, employed by the “true God” to create theworld, comes to believe that it is really in control, that it is the supremedeity, and enacts a coup d’état, with disastrous consequences. The left brainlikes to deal with what is familiar, with what it knows, and in modern times ithas been busy turning the world around it into what it knows best: a machine.Its demand for precision, clarity, definiteness, and parts has created a worldthat is more and more like itself. This means, McGilchrist argues, that there isless and less of an “other” for the right brain to “presence,” becauseincreasingly all it can reflect back is the world the left brain has created.Modern cities, vast industrialized areas, the seemingly unstoppable digitizingof experience—think of our growing demand for the “lifelike” presentation ofentertainment, of HD television and 3-D films, that represent to us inelectronically enhanced detail a “natural world” that is itself steadilydiminishing: all of this points to an increasingly left-brain world. Accordingto McGilchrist, for the last two centuries, the left brain has been busycreating a mechanical environment, a world of parts, bits, and pieces that itcan manipulate and through which it can fulfil its utilitarian aims and goals,at the expense of the whole.One result of this left-brain takeover is that the materialist, reductionistscience which it informs increasingly diminishes the right brain’s contributionto our understanding of the world. One example of this is mainstreamneuroscience’s contention that the right brain is “minor,” “secondary,” and,ultimately, unimportant. On a wider scale, the overarching belief that we livein a purposeless, meaningless universe, within which we ourselves are equallypurposeless and meaningless, has come to dominate our consciousness. The onlykind of “meaning” the left brain can grasp is explicit; it is the kind involvedin a “how-to” kind of question, not the “why” variety, or the kind provided bymeasuring devices, graphs, and figures (as you might expect, the right brain isa music lover; the left has a tin ear). And it can only assimilate it in an“either/or” context—the binary 0 and 1 of our computers. This being so, it cansee no meaning to our existence, and that seems to be the general assessment. Asthe astrophysicist Steven Weinberg famously remarked, “The more the universeseems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.”10[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber9] Comprehensible to the left brain, that is.LEFT-BRAIN AGGRESSIONThere was much in what McGilchrist said that interested me, but here I want tomake one point. There is a fundamental aggressive character to the left brain’srecent bid for power. To be sure, there is a fundamental aggressive character toleft-brain consciousness to begin with. This is clear in its propensity foranalysis, for breaking up the whole into separate pieces, for manipulatingreality. It is, as it were, our tool for attacking reality, for shaping it toour needs. In The Alphabet Versus the Goddess, Leonard Shlain argues thatleft-brain consciousness developed in male hunters because of their need tofocus their attention tightly on their prey, excluding everything else; rightbrain “field awareness” developed in female gatherers/nurturers, who needed tobe more aware of their surroundings.11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber10] As thepoet Wordsworth wrote, “We murder to dissect.” All of this is necessary. Theleft brain is our indispensable tool for surviving in the world, and it isbecause of it that we have become the dominant species on the planet.McGilchrist is certainly not saying that we should get rid of the left brain andreturn to a right-brain–dominated world. We need both in order to, as the poetW. B. Yeats says in “Under Ben Bulben,” complete our partial mind, as well asour “partial reality.” But if, as McGilchrist says, our cerebral hemisphereshave distinct temperaments and personalities—something split-brain patientsexperience at first hand—then it makes perfect sense to wonder if the left brainwould purposely try to undermine the right. If it is involved in a competitionwith its rival, we can assume that it would go out of its way to diminish theright brain’s input, or to eradicate it completely.With this in mind, I began to wonder: is there some expression of right-brainthinking, of a right-brain view of the world, that would be a prime target forthe expansionist aims of the left brain? Is there a body of “right-brainknowledge,” so to speak, that the left brain would certainly want to topple, orat least to cast aspersions on? Is there some right-brain tradition, thereputation of which the left brain would like to undermine?McGilchrist was not the first to suggest that the left brain had aggressivetendencies toward the right. In The Alphabet Versus the Goddess, Leonard Shlainargued that the rise of literacy—a left-brain development—and its focus onlinear, sequential thinking led to the decline of the earlier, right-brain,image-oriented goddess religions, as well as to the rise of monotheism andpatriarchal forms of society. Left-brain literacy, Shlain contends, is malefriendly, while right-brain imagery is more feminine. The subtitle of Shlain’sbook is The Conflict Between Word and Image, and as we’ve seen, the left brainworks with language and logic while the right is more at home with symbols andimagery. Shlain makes a strong case that, since the rise of literacy in thesecond millennium B.C., the left brain has increasingly gained greater andgreater dominance, and has, at times, fought a highly aggressive campaignagainst its opposite hemisphere. “Speech,” Shlain writes, “gave the left brainthe edge to usurp the sovereignty of the mind from its elder twin”; Shlainagrees with McGilchrist that the right-brain form of consciousness is primary.12[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber11] Whatever we may think of Shlain’s argument—in ASecret History of Consciousness, I point out some of its drawbacks—he does showthat at different times in history, “left-brain consciousness” seems to havewaged an often ruthless war against its right-brain counterpart.13[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber12]If the left brain has waged a smear campaign against the right, would it takeother forms than Shlain’s “conflict between word and image”? Would it, as itwere, open up other fronts? One target of left-brain aggression, it seems to me,would certainly be the western esoteric tradition.ESOTERICISM AND THE RIGHT BRAINThe more I thought about this, the more obvious it became. For one thing, theesoteric tradition deals in imagery and symbols, the meanings of which are oftencomplex and multiple, and which elude the left brain’s demand for clarity anddefiniteness; they are more attuned to what McGilchrist calls the right brain’s“both/and” approach, rather than the left brain’s “either/or.” Indeed,imagination, linked to the right brain, is one of the central pillars of theesoteric tradition. As the historian of esotericism Antoine Faivre writes,imagination is “a kind of organ of the soul, thanks to which humanity canestablish a cognitive and visionary relationship with an intermediary world,”what Faivre’s fellow esoteric scholar Henry Corbin called the “MundusImaginalis,” the “Imaginal World,” an inner yet nonetheless objective symbolicterritory, having its own rules and inhabitants. Imagination, Faivre argues, isan indispensable “tool for knowledge of self, world, Myth,” and he makesimagination one of the “four fundamental elements” of esotericism.14[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber13] In the same sense, the poet and essayistKathleen Raine, who has written about poetry and its links to esotericism,speaks of a “learning of the imagination.” The esoteric tradition is alsointuitive, focusing on our subtle, inner worlds, rather than our obvious outerone. It believes in a living, organic, spiritual, even conscious universe,rather than a dead, mechanical, oblivious one. It is also concerned more withthe whole than with the part, with the “correspondences” between things—the“network of connections that links everything with everything else”—than withwhat separates them. It is also more attuned to the kind of simultaneityassociated with the right brain than with the sequential thought associated withthe left.It is also rooted in what it calls “ancient wisdom” and is less concerned withthe future. As mentioned, McGilchrist believes the right brain predates theleft—it is older—while the left, he argues, has an often manic self-confidenceand “forward-looking” fixation. The esoteric tradition is more focused on beingrather than doing, on inner change rather than controlling the world. And it isless keen on maintaining the strict subject/object, “I” and “not-I” relation tothe world than the left is. A key insight, in some form or another, in theesoteric tradition is that “all is one,” and that the usual sharp distinctionbetween inner and outer worlds that the left brain is at pains to uphold is notas secure as it seems. Lastly, the esoteric tradition is concerned with thetimeless, the eternal; it is involved with the mythic character of ourconsciousness and even speaks of a “perennial philosophy.” The left brain, weknow, is obsessed with time.There are other characteristics of the western esoteric tradition that wouldsuggest that if the left brain was planning an assault on the reputation of theright, it would turn its sights in its direction. We know that with the rise ofmodern science in the seventeenth century—a development clearly linked to thetemperament of the left brain—the esoteric tradition lost much of its prestigeand that, in order to maintain itself, it had to go “underground” and become, asit remains today, a kind of “counterculture.” In my book The Quest for HermesTrismegistus (2011), I speculate that Hermeticism’s loss of prestige in theseventeenth century was related to what philosopher Jean Gebser calls the“deficient mode of the mental-rational consciousness structure.”15[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber14] There are some important similarities betweenGebser’s ideas and McGilchrist’s and, if the reader will allow, it is necessaryto touch on some of them here.STRUCTURES OF CONSCIOUSNESSThe German-born Swiss philosopher Jean Gebser is little known toEnglish-speaking readers; this is unfortunate, as he is one of the mostimportant thinkers of the last century. His life reads like an intellectualadventure story. He was a child during World War I, saw the rise of the Nazis,just missed being killed in the Spanish Civil War, escaped Paris on the eve ofthe German occupation, and finally settled in Switzerland, where he becamefriends with C. G. Jung and took part in the famous Eranos Conferences overwhich Jung presided. In 1932, while working on a book about the Austrian poetRainer Maria Rilke, Gebser had an insight whose implications were stunning andwhich he devoted the rest of his life to grasping. In Rilke’s poetry, Gebserseemed to see evidence that a change was taking place in western consciousness,that it was somehow becoming different. A new kind of consciousness seemed to beappearing in the West, Gebser believed, and he began to see evidence for this ina variety of fields: in science, art, literature, philosophy, as well as otherdisciplines. Gebser spent the next decade and a half collecting materialsupporting his insight and collating his data; in 1949, his magnum opus, TheEver-Present Origin, appeared; it would not be translated into English until1985.The central argument of The Ever-Present Origin is that human consciousness isnot static. Throughout its history, it has gone through several changes—whatGebser calls “mutations”—before arriving at our own form of consciousness. Thesemutations transform consciousness from one “structure” to another. There havebeen four such structures so far, what Gebser calls “the archaic,” “themagical,” “the mythic,” and the “the mental-rational,” ranging from ourprehistoric ancestors to modern times. Gebser also posits a fifth “structure ofconsciousness,” what he calls “the integral,” which is an integration of theprevious four structures, and he believed that we, in the late modern world,were beginning to experience the effects of the shift from the mental-rationalto the integral structure. These effects, Gebser believed, had to do with ourexperience of time. Gebser offers a sometimes daunting amount of evidence forhis structures of consciousness and for our current passage into the integralstructure, and in A Secret History of Consciousness, the reader can find myextended account of his ideas.16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber15]The basic idea behind Gebser’s structures of consciousness is that they arecharacterized by an increasing separation and distinction from what he calls“Origin,” an atemporal, nonspatial ontological source, which is “before alltime,” yet which is also “the entirety of the very beginning.”17[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber16] “Origin,” Gebser tells us, is a “preforming andprimal paradigm of Being,” a kind of timeless “matrix” out of which all thingscome into existence.18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber17] If the reader finds thisa bit confusing, he is not alone. Readers of Gebser soon become aware of afrequent difficulty with his terminology; this is because he is forced to useour everyday language in order to express insights that transcend the everyday.Georg Feuerstein, in his book on Gebser, speaks of “Origin” as “the ever-presentreality . . . by nature divine and spiritual” out of which our differentconsciousness structures emerge, and that seems a workable enough definition.19[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber18] One thing to note about Gebser’s “Origin” isthat it is very similar to Gnostic ideas about “the Pleroma,” as well as toNeoplatonic and Hermetic notions about “the One” or the Kabbalistic “En-Sof”:all are a kind of nonmanifest source of the manifest universe, but at the sametime are posited as a goal for those pursuing the spiritual path. While the leftbrain has difficulty comprehending ideas about a “nonmanifest source” and“ever-present reality,” the right brain, it seems, is quite at home with them.Each structure of consciousness goes through a period of development, at the endof which it enters what Gebser calls its “deficient mode.” This is when whatinitially was an asset becomes a handicap, when the potentials of a structurehave been exhausted, and when the characteristics associated with aconsciousness structure atrophy and harden into exaggerations of themselves.They become, as it were, a kind of caricature. This development is necessary inorder for the next consciousness structure to emerge. The previous one needs tobreak up so it can make space for the new structure and the process is notalways easy. The history of our consciousness, Gebser maintains, is litteredwith psychic catastrophes, a reflection McGilchrist agrees with. According toGebser, who died in 1973, we are living through the last stages of the deficientmode of the mental-rational structure, and he believed that within a fewdecades, a “global catastrophe” was, if not imminent, certainly very likely.THE MENTAL-RATIONAL STRUCTURE AND THE LEFT BRAINAs its name suggests, the mental-rational structure, which Gebser believed begancirca 1225 B.C., is characterized by rational, discursive thought, the kind oflogical, sequential thinking associated with the left brain. Whereas theprevious structure of consciousness, the mythic, is characterized by “a shapingor designing of images”—a right-brain activity—the mental-rational structure isfocused on words. Gebser’s dating for the beginning of the mental-rationalstructure falls within suggestive reach of the dating of the first alphabets,thus aligning his “mutations” of consciousness fairly closely with LeonardShlain’s ideas about the rise of literacy.What sets the mental-rational structure apart from the previous three structuresis that it is the most separated from “Origin.” In it, human consciousness,which had previously felt a fundamental connection to the world around it, wasnow unattached and “free.” The subject/object divide became firm. Consciousnessand the world were clearly experienced as different, radically opposedrealities. In the mental-rational structure, for the first time man learned howto think about the world as something separate from himself, and this also meantthe growing dominance of the ego, the verbal “I” which, we’ve seen, inhabits theleft brain. As Feuerstein writes, in the mental-rational structure we find forthe first time “the individual who could brave life, more or less, on his or herown, who did not feel particularly bound by, or even beholden to, the past, butwho looked ahead to the possibilities of the future.”20[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber19] It was with the rise of the mental-rationalstructure that, Gebser argues, our idea of a linear time arose, and with it “thefuture.” The previous mythic structure, he argues, saw time as cyclical, as akind of “eternal recurrence,” a coupling that the historian of religion MirceaEliade also recognized in his book The Myth of the Eternal Return (1954). We’veseen that the left brain is partial to both time and the future.The similarities between Gebser’s and McGilchrist’s ideas suggest that there isgood reason to link Gebser’s mental-rational structure with the kind ofconsciousness McGilchrist associates with the left brain. For all intents andpurposes, Gebser and McGilchrist are, I believe, speaking about the same thing.There are important differences between their ideas, but in a broad andsignificant sense they are fellow travelers.HERMETIC RENAISSANCEGebser believed that the mental-rational structure entered its deficient modearound the early fourteenth century; his evidence for this is the rise ofperspective painting during the first stirrings of the Renaissance.21[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber20] Medieval man felt himself to be a part ofnature; he was in it, in a way that we are not. With perspective, consciousnesswithdrew from the tapestry of nature and stood apart from it; perspective was aradical break with earlier painting because it aimed to be “lifelike,” topresent the world as we “really” see it. The Renaissance was one of the periodsin history when, according to McGilchrist, the two sides of the brain brieflyworked together, producing an enormously creative time. It was also a time of alarge-scale “Hermetic revival,” and some scholars have even suggested that theRenaissance owes more to Hermes Trismegistus than it does to Plato.22[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber21] Yet within two centuries of Hermes’ return, theentente cordiale between the left and right brain that McGilchrist associateswith the Renaissance had clearly broken down.In 1471, the Florentine philosopher Marsilio Ficino published his translation ofthe Corpus Hermeticum, the collection of magical and philosophical writingsattributed to the legendary Hermes Trismegistus, which had been lost for amillennium. For roughly the next century and a half, the prestige of Hermes andhis teaching were secure, and he was even considered of equal stature with Jesusand Moses.23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber22] Even figures associated with therise of modern science and the modern world—Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, IsaacNewton—were profoundly influenced by Hermetic ideas. Kepler, who discovered thelaws of planetary motion, made a living as an astrologer, and Newton wrote moreabout alchemy than he did about gravity—which, if nothing else, is a very“occult” force, given that no one has ever seen it.24[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber23] Yet by 1614, something had changed. Risingcritical scholarship revealed that the Corpus Hermeticum, believed to have beenwritten by Hermes Trismegistus before the Flood and to be the fount of the“ancient wisdom” at the heart of Hermeticism, could not have been written then.The texts were more likely the product of the Egyptian-Greek syncretism offirst- and second-century Alexandria, and could not have been, as they had beenbelieved to be, the source of Plato and other ancient philosophers’ wisdom. Frombeing revered as one of the most important spiritual, philosophical, and magicalteachers of all time, Hermes Trismegistus was now seen to be a fraud—he had, infact, most likely never existed. His teaching was a joke and his followers foolsand laughingstocks.It was of course precisely this dethroning of Hermes and his teachings thatpaved the way for the rise of modern science and for the kind of knowledgeassociated with it. To grasp the laws of planetary motion, we had to abandon theidea that the planets were moved, in Dante’s words, by “the love that moves thesun and the other stars.” In order to understand the world intellectually, theleft brain has to distance itself from it and turn it into an object. But whenreading accounts of the transition from a magical way of seeing the world to ourscientific one, I was struck by the aggressiveness of much of the anti-Hermesrhetoric.25 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber24] It was not simply a case ofrecognizing a mistake, which, certainly, would have caused some embarrassment,and then carrying on. On the contrary, what took place seems to have been morelike an all-out war on the Hermetic view of the world.ANTI-HERMESThis campaign was led chiefly by the Catholic monk, theologian, philosopher, andmathematician Marin Mersenne, who was a close friend of René Descartes, thethinker who, more than anyone else, is associated with the strict separation ofconsciousness and the world.26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber25] In 1623,Mersenne published a mammoth work, Quaestiones Celeberrimae in Genesim. This isostensibly an unwieldy commentary on the book of Genesis, but in actuality it isan extended attack on the Hermetic tradition. Mersenne denounced magic,divination, Kabbalah, pantheism, astrology, the Anima mundi or “soul of theworld,” and, most crucially, animism, the idea, central to esotericism, that theuniverse is in some way a living, sentient being with which man can communicate.Yet Mersenne did not merely argue that such beliefs were wrong or blasphemous—hewas, strange for our time, fighting in the service of both the church and thenew, mechanical view of the world. Mersenne went further and insisted that suchbeliefs were clearly insane, that is, pathological.27[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber26] If, as the esoteric scholar Joscelyn Godwinwrites, the Hermetic view “combines the practical examination of nature with aspiritual view of the universe as an intelligent hierarchy of beings,” and“draws its wisdom from all possible sources,” while seeing “the proper end ofman as the direct knowledge of God,” Mersenne would have none of it.28[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber27] As the historian Frances Yates wrote, Mersennewas “actively combating Renaissance animism and magical conceptions in order toclear the way for the new times.”29 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber28] In otherwords, he was doing his utmost to ensure the triumph of the new mechanical wayof seeing the world, and he had no reservations about fair play to achieve hisgoal. As we’ve seen, according to McGilchrist, the left brain is much more athome with machines than it is with living things, and René Descartes, friend ofMersenne, argued persuasively that animals were, in a sense, really only a kindof machine, or, as we would say today, robots. And the kind of mechanical way ofseeing the world, denuded of all interiority and value, that Mersenne andDescartes trumpeted, is, according to Gebser, a quintessential expression of thedeficient mode of the mental-rational structure of consciousness.INTEGRATIONMersenne’s attack on the Hermetic view of things, as well as the many othersthat followed in its wake and continue today, was, it seems to me, nothing lessthan an all-out attempt at character assassination. It was an effort not only topoint out that such a view was wrong, from the rising scientific perspective,but to defame it and its adherents. In our context here it was, I submit, aleft-brain assault on a right-brain body of thought, much like the kind of “wordversus image” campaign Leonard Shlain describes in The Alphabet Versus theGoddess. But we could just as equally say that it was an attack by the deficientmental-rational structure on the remnants of the mythical structure that residedin the esoteric, Hermetic view, as well as on the hints of the integralstructure this view embodied. As McGilchrist argues, the Renaissance was a timewhen the two rival hemispheres came together briefly, that is, they“integrated,” and formed a creative union that produced remarkable works of artand architecture. This was something different from the embeddedness in theworld of an overly right-brain consciousness—a characteristic of Gebser’s mythicstructure of consciousness—or the objectification of the world to which the leftbrain is prone—exemplified in Gebser’s mental-rational structure—but a creativecombination of the two, something along the lines of the “practical examinationof nature” combined with the “spiritual view of the universe as an intelligenthierarchy of beings” Joscelyn Godwin mentions above.CONSCIOUSNESS WARSThe esoteric, Hermetic tradition, forced underground by the rise of material,mechanical science, has suffered, I believe, a full-scale, no-holds-barredassault by the left brain and the deficient mode of the mental-rationalstructure. Its right-brain worldview, with its sense of a living, intelligentuniverse with which we can participate through our imagination, was targeted forattack by its left-brain antagonist. It is not the case, as it is generallyaccepted, that the Hermetic/esoteric view, anchored in what it erroneouslybelieved was a profound “ancient wisdom,” was, with the rise of reason,rationality, and the Enlightenment, simply superseded by a more correct view. Itwas not simply a case of “superstition” giving way to “science,” or of dogmadissolving in the face of free thought. That “more correct view,” informed bythe proselytizing zeal of a competing form of consciousness, seems to havepurposely and ruthlessly set out to consciously obliterate its rival. This was,indeed, a real war, one carried out on the fields of consciousness.In the early stages of its campaign, the antiesoteric view enjoyed manyvictories, and it eventually established itself as the sole arbiter of what istrue, what is “real” knowledge, and what is not. But now, some four hundredyears after Hermes Trismegistus, the thrice-great sage of magic and the ancientwisdom, was dethroned, his usurper’s position seems threatened—or at least thefoundations on which it established its supremacy seem somewhat less secure. Inour time, the deficient mode of Gebser’s mental-rational consciousness structurehas reached its peak, as it were. Developments like deconstructionism andpostmodernism suggest that the western intellectual tradition has begun to takeitself apart, with the left brain’s obsession with analysis turning on itself.30[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber29] Even earlier than these, the rise of the “newphysics” of quantum theory and related fields in the early part of the lastcentury has shown that the neat nineteenth-century vision of a perfectlyexplainable mechanical universe is no longer tenable. But there are morepressing concerns. We’ve seen that Gebser in his last days believed that we wereheading toward a “global catastrophe,” and the various crises—ecological,environmental, economic, social, political, religious, and cultural—that fillour daily news reports suggest he was not far wrong. Our era has had no shortageof Cassandras, and it would be easy to lump Gebser’s concerns together withother, less eloquent—not to mention less researched—jeremiads. But there is atension, an anxiety about our time that somehow seems to suggest that somethingwill happen, that some dike will burst, and that we will have a flood. As thephilosopher Richard Tarnas remarked, “late modern man”—that is, ourselves—is“the incongruously sensitive denizen of an implacable vastness devoid ofmeaning,” living in a world in which “gigantism and turmoil, excessive noise,speed and complexity dominate the human environment.”31[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber30] Things, many believe, cannot stay this way muchlonger. As Yeats said long ago, “the centre cannot hold.”Gebser was hopeful that with awareness and will, catastrophe can be avoided, andthe shift from our decaying mental-rational structure into the new integral onecould be achieved without the world collapsing. McGilchrist is hopeful too.Although he believes that left-brain dominance is increasing and that this isresulting in a world that is more and more like that familiar to peoplesuffering from schizophrenia, McGilchrist also believes that the very crisisinduced by left-brain dominance will—or at least may—trigger a reversal.32[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber31] He points out that in the past, similar periodsof left-brain dominance have, in a sense, set off an alarm that resulted in ashift toward right-brain values. In what Jung called an “enantiodromia”—that is,a reversal of values when one’s conscious attitude becomes lopsided and theunconscious steps in to restore the balance—our hyper left-brain view maytrigger a resurgence of the right.Yet the idea is not merely to jettison the left brain and return to an earlier,right-brain mode of consciousness. That would merely push the pendulum back tothe other side. Our left-brain consciousness was not a mistake, or “fall,” butan experiment on the part of the right, out of which it emerged. It is, asMcGilchrist says, the right brain’s emissary. It is needed, absolutelynecessary, and has a job to do; the problem is, it does it too well. The pointis to educate our left brain—that is, ourselves—so we can achieve the kind ofpsychic integration that both McGilchrist and Gebser suggest is our salvation.BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHERThey were not the only ones to see this. A reader of The Master and His Emissaryfamiliar with the esoteric tradition could not be criticized for experiencing adistinct feeling of déjà vu. One of the central themes informing the westernesoteric tradition, as well as that of the eastern, is the union of opposites.We see this in the ancient Chinese yin-yang symbol, in the mysteriumconiunctionis or coincidentia oppositorum of alchemy, in the pillars of Mercyand Severity that border the Middle Pillar of Harmony in Kabbalah, in the unionof microcosm (man) and macrocosm (universe) in Hermeticism and in its centraldictum “as above, so below.” The idea that by bringing opposites together, somenew, third element, not given, is produced, or that a third element is necessaryin order to bring about the union, also has a long history in esotericism, aswell as in more mainstream forms of thought.In alchemy, for example, the Great Work of transmutation requires the union ofsulfur and mercury—the Sun and the Moon—brought about through the medium of salt(Earth). Hindu philosophy speaks of the three gunas, which are characteristicsor tendencies of being. Left to themselves, tamas, the guna of inertia, andrajas, the guna of agitation, lead to ill health and disturbances, unless theyare balanced by sattva, the middle guna of bliss. We have already mentionedBlake (“Without contraries is no progression,” again from The Marriage of Heavenand Hell). The philosopher Hegel’s dialectic, the three-step dance of thesis,antithesis, and synthesis, is another expression of this threefold arrangement,as is Nietzsche’s pairing of Apollo and Dionysus, the Greek gods of order andmadness, whose union, Nietzsche believed, was behind the beauty of Greek drama.Rudolf Steiner’s “spiritual science” offers a similar tripartite arrangement.For Steiner, the spirits of Ahriman, associated with deadening materialism, andLucifer, the source of pride and hubris, are united and transcended by Christ,the mediator of these opposing spiritual forces. Gurdjieff spoke of a “law ofthree,” a “fundamental law” responsible for all phenomena in existence.33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber32] And Jung spoke of the “transcendent function,”brought about by the union of the conscious and unconscious mind, which producessome new, unexpected development that can help an individual break free of apsychic deadlock.34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber33]The psychologist and paranormal investigator Stan Gooch argued, much likeMcGilchrist, that humans inhabit two different and opposed realities, which hecalled Reality O (the objective world) and Reality S (our inner, subjectiveworld), and that these are reconciled in what he called Reality U, or “universalreality.”35 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber34] One of the best guides tounderstanding these opposed realities, Gooch believed, were the Letters on theAesthetic Education of Man by the German Romantic poet Friedrich Schiller. Inthese Schiller writes that “Freedom arises only when a man is a complete being,when both his fundamental drives [of imagination and intellect, or right andleft brain] are fully developed; it will, therefore, be lacking as long as he isincomplete, as long as one of the two drives is excluded.”36[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber35] Schiller was a contemporary and friend ofGoethe, whose own thinking focused on the tension between two forces, what hecalled “polarity” and “intensification,” the work of dividing unities andunifying divisions, the “systole” and “diastole” of the eternal heartbeat.Goethe shared this insight with his younger English contemporary, Samuel TaylorColeridge, who spoke of the “universal law of polarity” which was “firstpromulgated by Heraclitus,” the pre-Socratic philosopher who argued that the“way up and the way down are one and the same.”37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber36] More than a century after Coleridge, ArthurKoestler proposed what he called a “holoarchy,” a hierarchy comprising what hecalls “holons,” which are simultaneously both “parts” and “wholes.” Holons are“parts” of the level of the holoarchy that is above them, and “wholes” to thepart that is below. In this they display what Koestler sees as fundamentalcharacteristics of all “holons,” whether physical, organic, or social: what hecalls their “self-transcending” and their “self-assertive” tendency; that is,their tendency to merge into a larger whole, and their tendency to affirm theirindependence. It is suggestive that Koestler speaks of this as a “Janusprinciple,” taking the name from the two-faced Roman god.38[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber37]A DOUBLE-TRUTH UNIVERSEThis list could go on. When I began to see what Richard Tarnas calls our“double-truth universe” in light of our twin hemispheres, I experienced a kindof “double-truth” myself.39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber38] Was this a profoundinsight, or a numbing platitude? When you begin to look for these oppositions,they seem obvious. And yet, they are so obvious that we overlook them, or feelthey are not important. I do not know whether our “dualities”—those mentionedabove as well as the many I have not mentioned—originate in the fact that wehave two brains, or rather if our having two brains is a neurological expressionof some fundamental law of being, some irreducible cosmic yin-yang that runsthrough everything. In one sense this doesn’t matter. What is important is thatthe central idea running through all of these philosophies of “polarity,”“opposition,” and “duality” is the need for the creative tension between them tobe maintained. This means that any imbalance between them, with one sidedominating the other, must be rectified. This is not in order to achieve somebland equilibrium, but to keep the creative interchange between them going.From the perspective of Jung’s psychology, if the conscious, rational mindignores or obscures the input from the unconscious, the situation can becorrected in two different ways. The individual can consciously attempt to openup a dialogue with his or her other half and actively try to absorb andassimilate what it has to say—Jung developed a method of doing this, “activeimagination,” the aim of which was to stimulate the “transcendent function”mentioned above.40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber39] Failing this, theunconscious would do it itself, and this can be calamitous. The unconsciouscontents are not always polite; they can burst into our conscious life insometimes terrifying ways. They are willing to work with us if we are open tothem, but they will make themselves felt, whether we want them to or not. Thefirst route is preferable but harder, and demands discipline and determination.The second route is easier: you just let yourself go mad.I don’t want to put too Freudian a point on this, but I think we can say thatwith the rise of left-brain dominance and the deficient mode of themental-rational structure, our culture has swung into a dangerous imbalance, byrepressing the contribution of our other self, our other mode of consciousness.And one sign of this, I suggest, is the wholesale rejection of what we call “thewestern esoteric tradition.” For the last four centuries we have pushed thisaside, made it a laughingstock, diminished its importance, and ignored it—whenwe haven’t made determined attempts to eradicate it once and for all. Scientistsperiodically announce that they have finally and categorically debunked “theoccult,” the paranormal, mysticism, and everything related to it, but as anyonefamiliar with the history of our defamed inner tradition knows, it will not goaway. We can’t get rid of it for the simple reason that it is literally part ofus; if I am correct it has its roots there, a few millimeters across from “us,”next door in our right brain.41 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber40] Whether we likeit or not, we have to make an attempt to get to know our neighbor, our otherself, or suffer the consequences.OUR SECRET TEACHERSWhat follows is a kind of history of our “other” mode of consciousness, our“other” mind, and a look at what we can learn from its rejected knowledge. Thisknowledge has been subject to abuse by both the church and science, been drivenunderground and parodied in popular culture, but its influence has always beenfelt, if not acknowledged, and it has produced a remarkable canon of ideas,insights, and speculation about ourselves and our place in the cosmos. There isthe standard history of who we are, how we got here, and what the outlook forour future may be. But there is another history, a “secret history” of ourconsciousness, as I have argued in an earlier book. That history is not aseasily accessible as the official one, although, to be sure, it has become moreavailable to us in recent years through the Internet and other sources on our“information highway.” The standard history teaches us that the actors in thissecret history were a muddled, superstitious lot, gullible and credulous, whenthey were not simply madmen or fools. The western inner tradition has certainlyhad its fair share of eccentric types, but this wholesale low assessment of itsmembers is merely propaganda, and the western world owes much to its “secretteachers,” to the men and women who devoted themselves to understanding andexpressing the vision of our other mode of consciousness.Some of these teachers we know and in a sense are not secret at all. Yet in manycases what they have to teach remains so. Some are not so well known, indeed,are hardly known at all. One can be a secret teacher in the sense of beingunknown, but one can also be a secret teacher in the sense that what you teachis secret, hidden, obscured, or perhaps in some cases, even purposely disguised.Esoteric means “inner,” that which resides within, as opposed to the exoteric,which relates to the outer surface of things. It also means something aimed at asmall group, those who share an interest in and have a familiarity with concernsto which the majority is oblivious. The western inner tradition has always facedcriticism about elitism, about select groups who pride themselves on beingdifferent, if not superior to the masses. A smug spiritual self-satisfaction canarise with those who enjoy the distinction between “us” and “them.” But this istrue of any group; esotericism has no monopoly on egos and the false sense ofsuperiority to which they are prone. The message of our secret teachers is opento everyone. To understand it requires the same degree of intelligence,discipline, and determination needed to master a musical instrument or gainproficiency in quantum mechanics. But perhaps the most important thing is thatyou must want to learn.What makes an esoteric education different from learning to play a musicalinstrument or grasping quantum physics is that its subject and the personpursuing it are one and the same. In studying esotericism, we are in realitystudying and exploring ourselves, our being, our consciousness, and this is nota study from which we can remain “scientifically” detached. As the historian ofesotericism Arthur Versluis remarks, within its different branches, westernesotericism displays a “consistently recurring theme of transmutingconsciousness, which is to say, of awakening latent, profound connectionsbetween humanity, nature and the divine, and of restoring a paradisal unionbetween them.”42 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber41] We should, Versluis argues,view “esoteric traditions as written maps of and means toward the exploration ofconsciousness,” and see the initiations that make up much of the esoterictradition as ways of “awakening . . . higher degrees of consciousness.”43[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber42]I agree. What draws most people to the study of esoteric ideas and philosophiesis a profound felt need for this change, this transmutation of consciousness.Something is missing, there is some lack that the usual sources of satisfactioncannot meet. There is a vague, obscure sense that one must change oneself inorder to meet this need, and the different insights and philosophies making upthe varied strands of the western inner tradition suggest a way of doing this. Iwould add to this that we have good reason to believe that at least some of whatis missing is the contribution to our self-understanding offered by our muchmaligned yet infinitely patient, wise, and silent neighbor living in the brainnext door.So let us take a look at the sources of our rejected knowledge and what lessonswe can learn from the secret teachers of the western world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEAN ANCIENT WISDOM[../image/153618.jpg]The western inner or esoteric tradition often speaks of an “ancient wisdom.” Wefind this in the Hermetic tradition, with the idea that its founder, thelegendary Hermes Trismegistus, received a divine revelation at the dawn of time,which he subsequently passed on to his disciples. Today we know that the CorpusHermeticum was not written “before the Flood,” as some of its earliest readersbelieved, but is most likely a product of the religious and philosophicalsyncretism characteristic of Roman Alexandria. But in esoteric circles, the ideaof an initiatic descent, a Aurea Catena, or “Golden Chain” of adepts, reachingback into the dim vaults of antiquity and beyond, persists. The Renaissance,which saw a powerful Hermetic revival, was of course informed by the retrievalof ancient philosophy, namely Plato, which was lost during the so-called DarkAges. But it was precisely the belief that the Corpus Hermeticum was written byHermes Trismegistus in very ancient times—indeed, well before Plato—that madeits rediscovery in 1463 so spectacular.1 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber43]For the philosophers and scholars of the Renaissance, the older an idea or ateaching was, the better, and the very old was the best of all. This is in sharpcontrast with much of our own sensibilities, which see the new, the novel, the“breakthrough,” and the “cutting edge” as more worthy of our attention. Scholarsof the Renaissance believed that the ancient texts that had been lost forcenturies were closer to the source of knowledge, and hence were more pure, muchas a mountain stream is clearer nearer its source, unlike the muddy waters ofthe lowlands. Renaissance scholars were indeed excited by Plato. But the wisdomthat Plato had to offer, so the story went, was given to him by earlier sages,who themselves received it from even earlier adepts, who, as Frances Yateswrites, “walked more closely with the gods.”2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber44]As the historian Christopher McIntosh remarked, it was the fifteenth-centuryFlorentine philosopher Marsilio Ficino, translator of the Corpus Hermeticum, who“started the habit of talking in terms of a special wisdom handed down from sageto sage.”3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber45] This special wisdom was indeed veryold, and Ficino himself heard about it from his patron, Cosimo de’ Medici, thegreat power broker of Florence. Cosimo himself had heard about this ancientwisdom from the Byzantine Neoplatonic philosopher George Gemistos Plethon.Suffice it to say here that it was Plethon’s conversation with Cosimo about a“primal theology,” a prisca theologia, received by the Persian mage Zoroasterand other adepts at the dawn of time, and which informed all the world’sreligions, that eventually led to the rediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum and,through this, much of what we know as the Renaissance.Plethon’s idea of an ancient wisdom, intermittently lost and rediscovered, hasbecome a mainstay of esoteric thought. Practically every esoteric thinker hasrecourse to it. Some speak of it more than others, but in general all refer insome sense to a knowledge that was available to mankind in earlier times, butwhich has, over the centuries, become obscure, if not completely forgotten. Inhis sometimes unreliable but still very readable account of the philosophy ofthe occult, Dogme et rituel de la haute magie, translated into English by theoccultist A. E. Waite as Transcendental Magic, the nineteenth-century Frenchmagician Eliphas Levi presents a moving, if highly romantic, expression of theidea:Behind the veil of all the hieratic and mystical allegories of ancientdoctrines, behind the darkness and strange ordeals of all initiations, under theseal of all sacred writings, in the ruins of old Nineveh or Thebes, on thecrumbling stones of old temples and on the blackened visage of the Assyrian orEgyptian sphinx, in the monstrous or marvelous paintings which interpret to thefaithful of India the inspired pages of the Vedas, in the cryptic emblems of ourold books on alchemy, in the ceremonies practiced at reception by all secretsocieties, there are found indications of a doctrine which is everywhere thesame and everywhere carefully concealed.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber46]That what is said in this passage is not strictly true does not take away fromits romantic and imaginative power. It is clear to most critical students ofesotericism that there is not a single “doctrine” shared by the various groupsassociated with the esoteric, nor is there the kind of historical continuitybetween different esoteric movements that less historically minded readers mayimagine. (Although having said this, there is, I believe, what Arthur Versluiscalls an “ahistorical continuity,” a continuity of shared ideas, some which wewill encounter as we go along.5 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber47]) It is, infact, a mistake to speak of “esotericism” as if it were a single, monolithicteaching, like communism or socialism. As I discovered while researching forthis book, there are almost as many definitions of “esotericism” as there areesotericists or historians of esotericism writing about it.6[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber48] In fact, much of the “academic esotericism” ofrecent years is taken up with refining the definition of its subject—applying,we might say, left-brain explicitness to a right-brain implicit understanding—acommon enough practice in academia, but which may be a stumbling block for theaverage reader.“Esotericism” is a wide umbrella term covering a variety of ideas, beliefs, andpractices which, while not necessarily sharing a single common element, do seemto share what the philosopher Wittgenstein called a “family resemblance.”7[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber49] This is a collection of overlappingsimilarities, which link different members of a group together, but which caneasily dissolve if we attempt to make their connection too explicit.8[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber50] It is, in a sense, more concerned withrecognition, which is a right-brain affair, than definition, which is much morethe business of the left.9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber51] Even amongprofessing esotericists, there are different ideas of what esotericism is.Gurdjieff’s esotericism is not the same as, say, Rudolf Steiner’s, and both oftheir ideas about it may differ significantly from that of some other teacher’s.But unless we are sectarians, we would not say that Gurdjieff or Steiner’s ideaswere not “esoteric,” even if we could not define the term in a way acceptable toacademics. For our purposes here, I will follow Joscelyn Godwin, who writes that“the word esoteric refers to the inner aspect of a religion or philosophy, ofwhich the outer aspect is exoteric,” and repeat what I said previously, thatsuch inner teachings are fundamentally concerned with the “transmutation ofconsciousness.”10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber52]In the esoteric tradition, this “transmutation of consciousness” is commonlyknown as gnosis, a Greek word meaning “knowledge,” but not knowledge in oureveryday sense of the word, knowledge of “facts” or concepts. It is a kind ofexperiential knowledge, a knowledge that is also an “experience.” It is a kindof “knowledge in italics.” When you know something in the sense of gnosis, youreally know it. In The Quest for Hermes Trismegistus, I write at length aboutgnosis; here I will repeat my own definition of it: “immediate, direct,non-discursive cognition of reality,” a reality, that is, that includes thespiritual.11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber53] This is the knowledge of “thehidden or invisible realms or aspects of existence.”12[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber54] I will hazard the statement that the essence ofesotericism is the attainment of such knowledge, and that this is its centralcontrast with orthodox religions, which are based on faith and belief. Withoutsuch a focus, the study of esotericism, it seems to me, would be concernedsolely with what is exoteric, that is nonessential, about it.It was passages like Eliphas Levi’s above that led Madame Blavatsky, one of thefounders of the Theosophical Society and herself an important “secret teacher,”to title her first major work of esoteric philosophy, Isis Unveiled: AMaster-Key to the Mysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology (1877).Indeed, it was a lecture on “The Lost Canon of Proportion of the Egyptians,Greeks and Romans” given to her earlier “Miracle Club” that led to theformation, in 1875, of the Theosophical Society itself, one of whose aims is“the study of ancient religions, philosophies, and sciences.”13[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber55] Some years later, Annie Besant, successor toMadame Blavatsky as head of the Theosophical Society, wrote a book called TheAncient Wisdom (1897). Even esotericists who have no truck with Blavatsky or theTheosophical Society still look to the ancient past as the source of theirstudy. One of the major esoteric movements in the twentieth century,Traditionalism, takes as its central belief the existence of a primordialspiritual tradition, which was revealed by a divine source and flourished in theancient past, but which has been subsequently lost. The founder ofTraditionalism is generally considered to be the French metaphysician RenéGuénon, but other Traditionalists include the art historian Ananda Coomaraswamy,the philosopher Huston Smith, and the far-right Italian esotericist JuliusEvola. All, in different ways, share the idea of a philosophia perennis, a“perennial philosophy,” the belief that “all religions shared a common origin ina single perennial (or primeval or primordial) religion that had subsequentlytaken on a variety of forms,” an idea, we’ve seen, that it shares withHermeticism.14 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber56] Gurdjieff is another target forthe Traditionalists, who consider his “Fourth Way” teaching “counter-initiatic,”that is, a kind of esoteric “black magic.”15 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber57]Yet Gurdjieff, like the Traditionalists, also spoke of an ancient teaching, andhis discovery of this, in the monastery of the Sarmoung Brotherhood in CentralAsia, forms the climax to his spiritual adventure story Meetings with RemarkableMen.16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber58]Mention of the Sarmoung Brotherhood brings us to another mainstay of esotericthought: the belief that throughout history there have been “schools” informedwith this ancient wisdom, secretly at work “behind the scenes” of civilization,helping humanity in its struggle to evolve. These secret schools, so the storygoes, are the real agents of our development, and at crucial points in history,they inject esoteric ideas into the mainstream, in order to help mankind in itsslow growth toward spiritual maturity.THE OLD WORLDWe have seen that Iain McGilchrist believes that the right brain is older thanits upstart emissary, the left, a belief he shares with Leonard Shlain and other“split-brain” theorists. This would suggest that the kind of consciousnessassociated with the right brain would also be older than that associated withthe left.17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber59] We have also seen that Jean Gebserbelieves that before the rise of the mental-rational consciousnessstructure—which we have linked to the left brain—humankind lived in the mythicconsciousness structure, one more attuned to images, feelings, and intuitions,all elements of right-brain consciousness. Our own consciousness is slanted moreto the left than to the right. We see the world as something firmly outside us;there is a clear distinction between our inner world of thoughts, feelings,impressions, and the outer one of physical things. We see things in sharp detailand perceive them as separate, independent objects, and although we know thatnature is “alive” in the sense of being “organic,” we do not believe that it,like ourselves, has an “inside,” and we certainly don’t believe that inorganicthings, like stars and stones, are alive in any way at all. There is good reasonto suspect that our earlier form of consciousness saw things differently. In ASecret History of Consciousness, I look at a number of different philosophies ofconsciousness, some esoteric, some more mainstream. I try to show that all, indifferent ways, suggest that at an earlier time, human beings had a more“participatory” kind of consciousness, a kind of consciousness more in line withwhat we know about right-brain consciousness than the left; that is, aconsciousness that was more permeable, less rigid in its distinction between“inside” and “out.” This is a kind of consciousness that, except in certaincircumstances, we only experience now as children.For example, the philosopher of language, and great friend of C. S. Lewis, OwenBarfield—one of our secret teachers—believed that the history of languagerevealed what he called the “evolution of consciousness,” and he argued thispoint in his first book, History in English Words. Put briefly, Barfieldbelieved that as we look back into the history of language, we see that itbecomes more figurative, more metaphorical, more, in a sense, alive and poetic;our own age is, as the literary philosopher Erich Heller said, much more one ofprose. This is because, Barfield believed, at an earlier time the world was more“alive,” had more, as we would say, “soul,” and that when earlier people—andmodern-day poets—said that the world spoke to them, they were speaking thetruth.18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber60] To say that the world “back then” wasmore alive is another way of saying that our consciousness then perceived it assuch; it was a kind of consciousness that, as Barfield says, could see theinside of things, rather than, as we do, only their surface. It was a kind ofconsciousness that participated in the world around it, rather than one, likeour own, that only, as it were, bumps up against it.Barfield came to his insights independently, but when he became aware of thework of Rudolf Steiner, he saw that Steiner, on a larger scale, was saying thesame thing. Steiner, one of our most important secret teachers, also believed inan evolution of consciousness, but his outline of it included not only humanhistory, but that of the cosmos as well. In fact, for Steiner, the evolution ofconsciousness goes hand in hand with that of the cosmos because for him,fundamentally, our consciousness and the cosmos are two sides of the same thing.In other words, for Steiner, the kind of world we perceive depends on the kindof consciousness perceiving it, an insight he shares, in a different way, withMcGilchrist.19 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber61]Steiner’s system is vast, like a huge cathedral, and in some aspects it sharesmuch with that of Gebser.20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber62] In his reading ofthe evolution of consciousness, Steiner spoke of “epochs” rather than“structures of consciousness,” and he also spoke of earlier stages of ourevolution that preceded our own Earth stage in the somewhat awkward terms of“Old Saturn,” “Old Sun,” and “Old Moon.” In the “Old Moon” stage before ourcurrent Earth stage, consciousness perceived things in terms of images; it was,as Steiner called it, a “picture thinking,” something more akin to our ownexperience of dreams.21 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber63] We would not then, heclaimed, see a discreet, definite object and then have a “concept” or idea aboutit “in our heads,” but would respond to the “picture” as a symbol that wouldelicit the appropriate feeling. Steiner’s picture thinking seems very close tohow Gebser describes the mythical structure of consciousness, a key part ofwhich was the reflection of the inner world in the outer. Gebser sees the mythof Narcissus, the youth who fell in love with his reflection in a pool, asemblematic of the mythic structure.Both Steiner’s “picture thinking” and Gebser’s “reflection” strike me as in linewith what we know of how the right brain interacts with the world. Both would beopen to the kind of “both/and” approach associated with the right brain, asopposed to the left brain’s “either/or.” In his account of Steiner’s teaching,Stewart C. Easton remarks that “In the age before autonomous thinking”—the age,that is, before the rise of the left brain—“men perceived and interpreted . . .the world through their feeling. Thus to the ancient Egyptian there was nocontradiction when his literature provided him with different stories ofcreation and assigned the deed to various gods.” “No contradiction was presentto the Egyptians,” Easton says, “because contradiction belongs to thinking, notto the feelings.”22 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber64] Contradiction, we’ve seen,is something troubling to the left brain, but not the right, which is open tometaphor and multiple meanings, as is the case in its appreciation of symbols.HOW OLD IS THE SPHINX?Mention of the Egyptians brings me to another connection between the rightbrain, esotericism, and the kind of consciousness that may be the source of“ancient wisdom”—or that at least may point us in its direction. In TheCaretakers of the Cosmos, I make a connection between what we understand aboutright-brain consciousness and some of the ideas of another secret teacher, theFrench alchemist and maverick Egyptologist René Schwaller de Lubicz.The work of René Schwaller de Lubicz became widely known in the 1990s throughpopular books such as Graham Hancock’s Fingerprints of the Gods and RobertBauval and Adrian Gilbert’s The Orion Mystery, as well as Bauval and Hancock’sThe Message of the Sphinx. The title “de Lubicz” was given to Schwaller by theesoteric Lithuanian poet O. V. de Lubicz Milosz in 1919, when both were membersof a secret occult society.23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber65] Bauval andHancock argue that an unknown but highly advanced ancient civilization precededthe historically known civilizations, and both drew on Schwaller de Lubicz’scontention that the Great Sphinx of Giza was much older than the officialaccounts declared. The official account says that the Sphinx was built around2500 B.C. during the reign of the pharaoh Khafra, but in one of this last books,Sacred Science, Schwaller remarked that it had in fact been built much earlier,at around 10,500 B.C. The reason for this dating, Schwaller argued, is that thebody of the Sphinx showed clear signs of water erosion. Schwaller originallybelieved this was caused by flooding, but it was later determined that rainfallwas responsible. The last time enough rain fell in Egypt to cause such erosionwas some twelve thousand years ago—when, that is, it was not yet a desert.24[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber66]As a maverick Egyptologist, who also dabbled in alchemy and had a penchant forsecret societies and right-wing politics, Schwaller did not reach a wideaudience, and the mainstream Egyptologists who knew of his work considered him acrank. But in 1979, John Anthony West’s The Serpent in the Sky—an extensivestudy of Schwaller’s ideas—brought Schwaller’s work to a wider, moreappreciative readership, the budding New Age movement. It was through West’sbook that Hancock came across Schwaller’s remarks about the Sphinx. Schwaller’sdating of the construction of the Sphinx gained strong support in 1989 when Westconvinced the geologist and paleontologist Robert Schoch, a professor at BostonUniversity, to test Schwaller’s theory. Schoch was an expert on soft stone, likethe limestone of which the Sphinx is made, and to his surprise, Schochdiscovered that Schwaller was right, at least about the erosion marks. They werecaused by water, not wind and sand, as the official accounts stated.Understandably, Schoch’s results caused consternation among orthodoxEgyptologists, but their ire was raised even more by Bauval’s argument that theentire plan of the Giza complex, including the Sphinx, the great pyramids, andthe Nile, was laid out in Schwaller’s date of 10,500 B.C. It was originallydesigned, Bauval argued, to mirror the night sky over Giza at that time,specifically the constellation Leo, the belt of Orion, and the Milky Way. Inorder to provide a picture of the night sky over Egypt circa 10,500 B.C., Bauvaland Hancock used a computer to simulate the “precession of the equinoxes,” theapparent backward movement of the sun through the zodiac.25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber67] They discovered that the Giza complex didindeed reflect with surprising accuracy the heavens directly above it, and theyargued that this arrangement was designed to commemorate what in Egyptianmythology was known as Zep Tepi, the “First Time.”This “First Time,” i.e., the beginning of Egyptian civilization, occurred duringthe age of Leo, some twelve thousand years ago. The official account of humanhistory tells us that twelve thousand years ago, we were incapable of the kindof engineering skills needed to construct the Sphinx, or practically anythingelse, and that we certainly didn’t have the tools for the job. At best, the onlyimplements available to our Neolithic ancestors then were some flint and sticks.Even the construction of the pyramids, which Bauval and Hancock agree took placelater, poses problems. The engineering ability necessary to build the pyramidsalone baffles us, but what is even more baffling is the kind of knowledge thatseems to be embodied in the stone.26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber68]As dozens of books have pointed out, the Great Pyramid of Giza is a compendiumof mathematical and astronomical knowledge far in excess of what we believe thepeople responsible for them should have possessed. As early as 1864, an amateurEgyptologist, the London publisher John Taylor, argued that whoever built theGreat Pyramid had included π (pi) in their measurements, a number that wassupposed to have been first discovered by the Greek mathematician Archimedes in250 B.C.—that is, centuries later.27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber69] (For thosewho have forgotten, π is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter.)Much nonsense has been written about the pyramids, linking them to everythingfrom biblical prophecy to UFOs, and giving rise to what some skeptics call asubgenre of junk literature written by “pyramidiots.” But to the unbiased readerit is clear that whoever was responsible for the pyramids and other Egyptianmysteries, such as the temples at Karnak and Luxor, knew a great deal more thanwhat our official accounts suggest. Since 1894, when the British astronomerNorman Lockyer demonstrated in The Dawn of Astronomy that Egyptian temples, aswell as the pyramids, were most likely, if not exclusively, used forastronomical purposes, many researchers have come to see that the kind ofknowledge involved in their construction—as well as in other ancient structures,like Stonehenge (Lockyer was the first to suggest it was a kind ofobservatory)—was vastly different from what our official accounts allow.28[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber70]Schwaller too recognized that whoever built the Sphinx, the Great Pyramid, andthe temples at Luxor and Karnak was mathematically and cosmologically astute.From 1936 to 1951, Schwaller and his wife, Isha, herself the author of a seriesof novels about ancient Egypt (Her-Bak: Egyptian Initiate is the best known),studied the ancient Egyptian monuments. Schwaller found evidence in them for pi,but also for much more: a knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes, of thePythagorean theorem centuries in advance of Pythagoras, of the circumference ofthe globe, as well as evidence of ϕ (phi), known as the Golden Section, amathematical proportion that was again supposedly unknown until it wasdiscovered by the Greeks. As John Anthony West makes clear, the Golden Sectionis more than an important item in classical architecture. It is, according toSchwaller, the mathematical archetype of the universe, the reason why we have an“asymmetrical” “lumpy” world of galaxies and planets, and not a flattened-out,homogenous one, a question that today occupies contemporary cosmologists.29[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber71] In his writings, Schwaller linked phi toplanetary orbits, to the architecture of Gothic cathedrals, and to plant andanimal forms. It is, he argued, a “form constant,” that is, a kind of blueprintfor reality or “law” of creation. Through his research, Schwaller came tobelieve that all of Egyptian life—from mundane, everyday items to theirreligious sites—was centered around what he saw as a central metaphysical visionabout “cosmic harmony” and “the forces that bring about the becoming ofthings.”30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber72]THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE HEARTThe mathematical and cosmological knowledge that Schwaller discovered embeddedin the ancient Egyptian monuments was indeed astounding, but what was perhapseven more astounding was the fact that this knowledge was the product of a formof consciousness radically different from our own. Schwaller came to believethat Luxor, Karnak, and other Egyptian monuments were living organisms of akind; they were, he saw, compendia of esoteric knowledge, whose central purposewas a kind of transmutation of consciousness. This knowledge, he believed, wasrooted in a form of consciousness that he called “the intelligence of theheart.” This was essentially a way of looking into the insides of things, muchas Owen Barfield, discussed above, believed was true of human consciousness atan earlier stage. Our own modern consciousness—what Schwaller called “cerebralconsciousness” or “the Set mind,” named after the Egyptian god of chaos, storms,and the desert—was limited, Schwaller believed, to the outside of things.“Cerebral consciousness,” Schwaller argued, “granulates” reality into bits andpieces; it severs the ties in the “network of connections that links everythingwith everything else” which, we’ve seen, is associated with a right-brain formof consciousness. “All in the universe,” Schwaller wrote, “is in interdependentconnection with all,” a version of the “all is one” perception of the worldcommon to esotericism.31 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber73] Schwaller’s“intelligence of the heart” is essentially a participatory form ofconsciousness. This is made clear in Schwaller’s enigmatic posthumous workNature Word. With the “intelligence of the heart,” Schwaller tells us, we can“tumble with the rock that falls from the mountain/Seek light and rejoice withthe rosebud about to open” and “expand in space with the ripening fruit.”32[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber74] In other words, with the “intelligence of theheart,” we can experience all of these things—and more—from the inside.It was this ability to perceive the “inside” of reality that, Schwaller argued,allowed the ancient Egyptians a kind of immediate access to the type ofmathematical and cosmological knowledge that our “cerebral consciousness” hasacquired slowly only after much labor and many years. The ancient Egyptians,Schwaller believed, saw the world symbolically, much as Stewart Easton abovesays our “Old Moon” consciousness did. Nature was a kind of text—henceSchwaller’s title Nature Word—that conveyed truths about the forces behind it.The Egyptians called these forces “Neters,” which we translate as “gods,” andthey portrayed these forces in different symbolic forms. This “symbolicperception” allowed the ancient Egyptians a greater leeway in interpretingreality. For one thing, it allowed them to experience what Schwaller called “thesimultaneity of opposite states.”Schwaller first came upon this kind of “double-thinking” through his study ofquantum physics, especially the work of Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr.Heisenberg, we know, developed what he called “the uncertainty principle,” therecognition that at the level of elementary particles, we can know either aparticle’s position or its speed, but not both; securing one obscures the other.Bohr is famous for what he called “the principle of complementarity,” the ideathat light can act as a wave or a particle depending on the context, giving riseto the portmanteau term “wavicle.” Before this, physicists banged their heads onthe question of whether it acted as one or the other, as it gave conflictingevidence of both.33 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber75]The “intelligence of the heart,” Schwaller argued, was what allowed theEgyptians to develop what he called “symbolique,” that is, the ability to holdmutually exclusive ideas together simultaneously. For example, when an ancientEgyptian saw the hieroglyph of a bird, he knew it denoted the actual, livingcreature, but he was also aware of its connotations, that it was a symbol of the“cosmic function” embodied in the bird, that is, of flight. For Schwaller,hieroglyphics not only designated, they evoked. That is, they served dualpurposes simultaneously. As we’ve seen, this is something the right brain(“both/and”) is partial to, but which gives the left brain (“either/or”) muchgrief.HENRI BERGSON’S BRAINAnother link between Schwaller’s ideas about the consciousness of the ancientEgyptians and the right brain came from Schwaller’s background in the work ofthe French philosopher Henri Bergson, a secret teacher of the mainstream. For atime in the early part of the last century, Bergson was the most famousphilosopher on the planet, but he is little read today, although there has beenrenewed interest in his work in some areas.34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber76]In his early days, Schwaller was a student of the artist Henri Matisse, andMatisse himself had been a student of Bergson, so it is not unreasonable tothink that Schwaller absorbed some of Bergson’s ideas (indeed, given Bergson’spopularity, it would have been almost impossible for him not to). Bergsonbelieved that the human brain and nervous system serve an essentiallyeliminative function. That is to say, their purpose is to keep stimuli andinformation out of conscious awareness—not to bring it in—and to allow only asmuch of reality into consciousness as, in Aldous Huxley’s words, “will help usto stay alive on the surface of this particular planet.”35[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber77] Huxley made this remark in the context of hisfamous experiment with mescaline, which, he said, allowed him to see “what Adamhad seen on the morning of his creation—the miracle, moment by moment, of nakedexistence.”36 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber78] (Interestingly, Huxley speaks ofexperiencing the Istigkeit [“is-ness”] of Meister Eckhart, mentioned in theIntroduction.)Huxley believed mescaline—as well as other psychedelic drugs—achieved theireffects by turning off the brain’s “reducing valve” and, as it were, allowingthe “taps of reality” to run full blast. When this happened to Huxley, he wasflooded with what he calls “Mind at Large.” Huxley quotes the philosopher C. D.Broad, who had paraphrased Bergson’s ideas about the eliminative function of thebrain. Broad had written that “Each person is at each moment capable ofremembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything thatis happening everywhere in the universe.” Were the brain not to reduce or “edit”this universal awareness—or “cosmic consciousness,” as the psychologist R. M.Bucke, a little known secret teacher, called it—we would be swamped, Broad said,with a “mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge.” As it is, our innereditor does a very good job of providing us with only that very small selectionof reality “which is likely to be practically useful.”37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber79]Bergson, Broad, and Huxley did not have the material on split-brain theory thatis available to us, but if they did, I believe they would have recognized itsimportance. We have seen that the right brain is aware of the “network ofconnections linking everything with everything else,” which seems in line withour remarks about “universal awareness” and “cosmic consciousness” above. And wehave also seen that the left brain is geared toward focusing tightly on itsobjectives, and ignoring everything else. We can, I think, see Bergson’scerebral “reducing valve” and “eliminative function” as operations involving theleft brain, and that what it reduces is the broader, wider awareness of theright.A SUCCESSFUL ADAPTATIONThe brain’s eliminative function is, as Bergson and Huxley saw, a highlysuccessful evolutionary adaptation. Were we not able to edit out most of the“interdependent connections” everything has with everything else, we would nothave become such a successful species. Huxley recognized this when he remarkedthat if everyone took mescaline, there would be no wars, but there would be nocivilization either, because no one would bother to create it. We would be toohappy enjoying our sense of “cosmic consciousness” to do anything so boring. Inorder to function effectively—and to spur our creative efforts—consciousnessneeds to be limited. We need, in effect, to be dissatisfied enough with oursituation in order to improve it. (The advice to “be here now,” offered by manyspiritual teachers is valuable and salutary, but it can also lead to us“remaining there then.”) Yet, as we’ve seen, our highly efficient editor doeshis job too well. Much of the “irrelevant knowledge” it leaves out of ourawareness has to do with what makes life worth living, its beauty and meaning.Huxley understood this when, as mentioned, he felt that under mescaline, he sawexistence in its pristine form. In The Doors of Perception, his account of hisdrug experience, Huxley writes that he saw everything shining with an innerlight that reflected its infinite significance; looking at the bamboo legs of achair, Huxley felt that he had become them. This is a common experience withinthe western—and eastern—inner tradition. That is, Huxley saw into the inside ofthe chair, and everything else around him. The seventeenth-century Bohemianvisionary Jacob Boehme spoke of seeing into what he called “the signature ofthings,” and this seems to be what Huxley saw too.This ability to see into the interior of reality Bergson called “intuition.”This was, he said, a “kind of intellectual sympathy by which one places oneselfwithin an object in order to coincide with what is unique in it and consequentlyinexpressible.” Anyone who has read Boehme will know his accounts of hismystical vision are not easy to grasp, and we remember what was said in theIntroduction about the difficulty in conveying implicit meanings. On the otherhand, our everyday consciousness, Bergson said, “reduces the object to elementsalready known, that is, to elements common both to it and other objects.”38[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber80] As we have seen, the left brain likes to turneverything it encounters into something familiar.THE NINEVEH NUMBERThere is good reason then, I think, to equate Schwaller de Lubicz’s“intelligence of the heart” with a kind of right-brain awareness. Robert Lawlor,one of Schwaller’s translators and an authority on “sacred geometry,” said asmuch when he wrote that “localization in the right hemisphere of the highlyintuitive aspects of thought, together with the capacity for non-verbal patternrecognition, is consistent with the dominant quality of mind which, in Schwallerde Lubicz’s view, could have produced the temple architecture and hieroglyphicwritings of the ancient Egyptians.”39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber81] If thekind of knowing associated with a right-brain awareness was familiar to theancient Egyptians, can we also find it in other ancient people? The answer seemsto be yes.One of the most curious mysteries of the ancient world is what is known as the“Nineveh number.” In 1843, Paul Emile Botta, French consul at Mosul in what wasthen Mesopotamia (today Iraq), made a remarkable discovery. Digging at a moundknown as Kuyunjik, near the upper Tigris, he came upon the library of theancient Assyrian king Assurbanipal, who reigned in the sixth century B.C.Looking through the many clay tablets he unearthed, Botta came upon one thatcontained an unusually long number, running to fifteen places:195,955,200,000,000. The mound in which the tablet was discovered was at thesite of the ancient city of Nineveh, so it became known as the “Nineveh number.”What struck Botta and others at the time as strange was what ancient peoplewould do with such a number? What could they use it for? Although fairly commontoday, people in the nineteenth century rarely used the idea of a million. Whatpossible function could a number just short of two hundred trillion serve theancient Assyrians?In his book Our Cosmic Ancestors (1988), Maurice Chatelain, a French spacescientist and former NASA communications systems chief, writes of using acomputer to investigate the Nineveh number. He came up with some curiousresults. One was that the number was not arbitrary. It is 60 times 70, broughtto the power of 7. Chatelain then remembered that the Sumerians, credited withinventing writing, calculated using base sixty rather than base ten; we haveinherited our sixty-second minute and sixty-minute hour from them. The Assyriansinherited their culture from the Babylonians, who inherited theirs from theSumerians, so Chatelain wondered if the number 60 could offer any clue to themeaning of the Nineveh number. He discovered it did, and that the vast numbercould be seen as equaling 2,268 million days—just over six million years—workedout in seconds. Other surprises followed. Chatelain wondered if the Sumerians,who were obsessive astronomers, had known about the precession of the equinoxes.A complete precessional cycle takes roughly twenty-six thousand years. Chatelaindivided this into the Nineveh number and discovered that it worked out toprecisely 240 cycles, or “Big Years.” Chatelain then recalled the idea of “thegreat constant of the solar system,” a kind of astronomical “highest commonfactor,” into which all other cosmic numbers—planetary orbits, as well as thoseof satellites—will divide. Again using a computer, Chatelain calculated thelength of the planetary and satellite orbits in seconds and found that they toodivided into the Nineveh number equally. Whoever had calculated this figure,Chatelain concluded, seemed to know a lot about the stars.But the Nineveh number had even more surprises. Chatelain computed the period ofthe Earth’s rotation against the Nineveh number and was surprised to find itproduced a slight discrepancy: it was off by one twelve-millionths of a day peryear. This troubled him. The error was indeed slight, but so far he had not comeacross any inaccuracies and he wondered why he should do so now. Then Chatelainrealized something that the ancient Sumerians—or whoever the Nineveh numberoriginated from—would not have known: that the Earth’s rotation has been slowingdown at an infinitesimal rate, and that in twelve million years, a year will bea day shorter. Factoring this into his equation, Chatelain discovered that ifthe Nineveh number was a correct figure for the Earth’s rotation, it must havebeen computed some 64,800 years ago. But beings intelligent enough to computesuch a figure were simply not around then—or were they?THE BIRD’S-EYE VIEWChatelain’s own suggestion was that the knowledge contained in the Ninevehnumber came from extraterrestrials. His book is in the Erich von Däniken schoolof thought, that sees human evolution as a result of experiment and interventioncarried out by “ancient astronauts.” This may suggest a shaky provenance, butColin Wilson has suggested that the kind of knowledge responsible for theNineveh number—and other ancient astronomical mysteries—may be similar to thatdisplayed by “calculating prodigies.”40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber82] In1826, a six-year-old boy named Benjamin Blyth was out walking with his fatherwhen he asked what time it was. His father told him and a few moments laterBenjamin replied, “In that case I have been alive for . . .” and went on to givethe exact figure in seconds, around 160 million. His father jotted the answerdown and when they returned home he worked out the calculations. He toldBenjamin he was off by 172,800 seconds. But Benjamin corrected him, saying heleft out two leap years.Zerah Colburn, the nineteenth-century “lightning calculator,” was asked whether4,294,967,297 was a “prime number” or not. Prime numbers cannot be dividedexactly by any numbers other than one or themselves. We know the easy ones: 5,7, 11, 13, 17; but past a certain point they are no longer obvious and need tobe worked out. The trouble with primes is that there is no easy method of doingthis: you simply have to divide all the smaller numbers into it. Even a computerhas to do it “the hard way,” and with large numbers this takes time. Yet Zerahwas able to do it “in his head” and almost immediately say that this ten-digitnumber wasn’t prime, but could be divided by 641. Similarly, the psychiatristOliver Sacks has written about “idiot savants” who entertain each other byswapping twenty-four-digit primes.41 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber83] Theseindividuals are otherwise severely mentally handicapped, but in this oneinstance they display powers that strike us as miraculous.There is no logical way for these people to have arrived at their calculations.As Wilson suggests, it is as if they can somehow simply “see” the correctanswer. In a sense there is no “calculating” at all, at least not in the usualway. Rather, it is as if their minds could somehow “hover in the air, like ahawk, over the whole number field, and pounce on prime numbers [or any othercorrect answer] as if they were rabbits.”42 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber84]They had a “bird’s-eye view” of the problem and, rising above it, seemed to usesome form of “pattern recognition” to “see” which number would “fit.” Wilsonremarks that Keith Critchlow, the architect and authority on sacred geometry,suggests that a similar “method” was used by the Babylonians when working outright angles that ran into thousands of feet, and Wilson suggests that somethingsimilar may have been at work with the Nineveh number. Other ancient architectsmay have been privy to a similar insight. Studying the standing stones atCallanish, in Scotland, and at other megalithic sites, the aeronautical engineerAlexander Thom declared that the people responsible for them were “prehistoricEinsteins.”43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber85] Thom noticed that the mainnorth-south axis at Callanish was aligned directly with the Pole Star. But healso knew that when Callanish was erected—some estimates are as early as 3000B.C.—the Pole Star was not in its current position. For the builders ofCallanish to have aligned the site to geographic north without the Pole Star asa guide would have required highly sophisticated engineering ability—the kind,again, that should not have been capable then.This seems bizarre. But then, as we’ve seen, the philosopher C. D. Broadmaintained that “each person is at each moment capable of remembering all thathas ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happeningeverywhere in the universe.” The fact that we do not experience this kind ofawareness—or only rarely, in “mystical experiences”—is because of our leftbrain’s highly efficient editing abilities. Perhaps someone with a lessefficient cerebral editor would, in some way we can’t yet understand, be able totap into the knowledge necessary to erect Callanish and other sites of“archeoastronomy,” or “know” immediately whether a ten-digit number was prime ornot.HOW OLD IS MAN?Needless to say, Maurice Chatelain’s suggestion that the Nineveh number datesfrom nearly sixty-five thousand years ago will no doubt raise several eyebrows,but in A Secret History of Consciousness, I write about some speculation that“anatomically modern human beings” have existed in time periods when, accordingto the standard accounts, they should not have been there.44[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber86] Some of the material I looked at came from acontroversial book, Forbidden Archaeology by Michael A. Cremo and Richard L.Thompson, published in 1993. Its nine-hundred-plus pages are filled with what,from the standard account, are disturbing archaeological anomalies, but the factthat Cremo was a follower of Swami Prabhupada’s “Krishna Consciousness” movementwas enough to suggest to most orthodox archaeologists that they could ignore hisand Thompson’s findings with good conscience. But perhaps even more disturbingand certainly more difficult to ignore is an account by the respectedanthropologist Mary Leakey. In 1978, at Laetoli, twenty miles south of thefamous Olduvai Gorge, Mary Leakey, her son Philip, and another member of theirparty discovered what seemed to be typically human footprints preserved involcanic ash that dated from 3.5 to 3.8 million years ago. The prints were leftby hominids that walked upright, and Mary Leakey spoke of “unique evidence, ofan unimpeachable nature” which argued that “our hominid ancestors were fullybipedal a little before 3.5 million years ago.” This went against all thestandard accounts of human development. According to the accepted view, humanslike ourselves only came on the scene some forty thousand years ago. Yet, asMary Leakey wrote, “the essentially human nature and modern appearance of thefootprints were quite extraordinary.”45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber87] This,of course, does not prove that Chatelain’s dating of the Nineveh number iscorrect, or that the number itself is of any importance. But it does suggest thepossibility that humans like ourselves may have walked the earth much earlierthan we believe.NEANDERTHAL MANOne group of humans rather unlike ourselves who seem to have had a surprisingastronomical knowledge were the Neanderthals, who flourished from 100,000 to40,000 B.C. The clichéd picture of Neanderthal is of a stocky, beetle-browed,club-bearing subhuman, dragging his mate along behind him; but increasingly wesee that this is little more than an ignorant caricature. In a series ofbrilliant books written in the 1970s and ’80s, the psychologist and paranormalinvestigator Stan Gooch argued that, in fact, Neanderthal was not the brutishcaveman we believe him to be, but was in truth responsible for a “civilization”millennia before our own. A pioneer of “Neanderthal studies,” Gooch was laughedat when he first presented his ideas, but in recent years many of them—includingthe notion that Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon, our direct ancestor, mated andproduced us—have been vindicated, without, sadly, Gooch receiving any credit.46[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber88]One of Gooch’s suggestions is that Neanderthal’s large brain capacity—1,400cubic centimeters compared with our 1,300—was due to his larger cerebellum. Thecerebellum (“little brain”) is located at the back of the skull, next to thebrain stem and below the occipital and temporal lobes. It is a kind of earlycerebrum, the part of the brain that contains the cerebral cortex, and like theright brain, the cerebellum is older. Gradually, the cerebrum increased in sizeuntil it covered over the cerebellum, much as a tree may grow around a stone;the cerebellum is now almost completely obscured by the cerebrum. Gooch arguesthat Neanderthal’s larger cerebellum made him “psychic” and allowed for agreater sensitivity to natural forces, like magnetic fields, but also tophenomena we would call “paranormal.” He also suggested that modern “psychics”would have larger, or at least more active, cerebella than nonpsychics.47[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber89] The eighteenth-century philosopher EmanuelSwedenborg—one of our secret teachers—who studied the brain extensively, alsopaid especial attention to the cerebellum and, in his later religious writings,said that it was through it that the “influx from the Divine” reaches the soul.(That is why in heaven, Swedenborg says, no angel stands behind another, so asnot to block the flow.) Swedenborg also believed that in an earlier time, manhad greater contact with the Divine, unlike today, when we are separated from itby our rational intellect.48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber90] In Frances Yates’swords quoted earlier, for Swedenborg, early man “walked more closely with thegods.” In his book The Paranormal, Gooch points out that Swedenborg, who, likeGooch, was psychic, reported that he had felt “actual conscious experience ofthe cerebellum during . . . paranormal activity,” and Swedenborg often spoke ofbeing visited by angels and taking trips with them to heaven and hell. SoGooch’s ideas about the cerebellum may be significant.49[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber91]Among other surprises Gooch uncovered was that Neanderthals were very religious.They took care of their elderly and sick, and their dead were ritually buried,usually decorated with flowers and often with food and other offerings,suggesting a belief in an afterlife, an idea first proposed by the archaeologistRalph Solecki in 1972 in Shanidar, the Humanity of Neanderthal Man. The deadwere also painted in red ochre, a name for the iron ore hematite. In one minediscovered in southern Africa dating to a hundred thousand years ago, it isestimated that a million kilograms of the ore had been removed. This suggests alarge coordinated effort involving many individuals motivated by deep religiousconvictions over many years—although perhaps “convictions” is the wrong word forsomething that would have been much more “intuitive.” Red ochre was important toNeanderthal, Gooch argues, because its color linked it to menstrual blood; themenstrual cycle, Gooch believes, was central to the Neanderthal “religion.”TWO REALITIESIn the Introduction, I mentioned that Gooch argued that modern humans livedunder two different “realities,” what he called Reality O and Reality S. This“duo-consciousness” is the result of our Cro-Magnon/Neanderthal ancestry.Reality O is the “objective” approach to the world that we have inherited fromour Cro-Magnon ancestors, the tightly focused and highly edited awareness of thephysical world that Leonard Shlain argued started with early hunters. Reality Sis the “subjective” approach to life, the broader, more psychically sensitiveawareness that Gooch believes we have inherited from Neanderthal. Gooch believesthat Neanderthal were a devotee of a Goddess-based religion, which theyassociated with the moon. Cro-Magnon, on the other hand, were more attuned to asolar, masculine deity.Eventually, the highly efficient Cro-Magnon eradicated his laid-back but moreintuitive cousin, but not before he mated with her, and in our own psyches wecontinue the battle between them, much as McGilchrist argues goes on between ourtwo brains. It should be mentioned that Gooch did not see the struggle going onbetween the cerebral hemispheres, but between the cerebrum and the cerebellum.50[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber92] But although he disagrees on its location andparticipants, on all other accounts his version of the battle is practically thesame.51 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber93] Our inheritance from Neanderthal, Goochargues, is behind what, in Total Man and other books, he calls our “ancientadversary” and “other self” with whom our rational ego is in constant conflict.According to Gooch, this “adversary” has given rise to our myths and legends ofvampires, werewolves, goblins, centaurs, to fairy tales and other fables, aswell as to works of literature such as Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Caseof Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Cro-Magnon’s “solar” consciousness worked best in the bright light of day, andit revealed useful knowledge about the hard, physical world. Neanderthal’sintuitive approach was more suited to the night—he was nocturnal—and he wasattuned, as Schwaller believed the later Egyptians were, to cosmic forces. Alsolike Schwaller’s Egyptians, Neanderthal most likely experienced a kind of “groupconsciousness.”52 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber94] In Cities of Dreams, Goochargues that an entire Goddess-based Neanderthal “Moon civilization” oncestretched across Europe, but was eventually lost with the rise of Cro-Magnon andhis descendants, much as the cerebellum was eclipsed by the rise of thecerebrum. (We are reminded of Steiner’s “Old Moon” consciousness, and of LeonardShlain’s Goddess civilization, eclipsed by aggressive left-brainers. In TheWhite Goddess, the poet Robert Graves proposed a similar idea.) Thiscivilization, however, was not like ours, made of technology, massive cities,machines, and an indiscriminate exploitation of the natural world, but was onemore attuned to natural rhythms, to Schwaller de Lubicz’s “intelligence of theheart” and the “forces that bring about the becoming of things.” It would be amuch more “inner”-based civilization than an “outer” one; as Gooch says, itwould be a “civilization more of the mind than of buildings.”53[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber95] Hence Gooch’s title Cities of Dreams. Such a“civilization” would not necessarily leave many physical remains—think of the“civilization” of Native American Indians, all but wiped out by whitesettlers—but its cultural traces could be uncovered. In The Guardians of theAncient Wisdom, Gooch argues that much of the western esoteric tradition is,like our fairy tales and legends, a garbled account of the Neanderthal Moonreligion, and he argues that many of our superstitions and holy days are too. Inthis sense we can certainly see our Neanderthal ancestors as collectively makingup one of our secret teachers.THE SEVEN SISTERSOne need not agree with Gooch completely to appreciate his main idea: that priorto the rise of historical times, there existed an ancient people who had a“wisdom”—and consciousness—different from our own, and which may indeed, asGooch suggests, have in some way informed the western inner tradition. Oneapparently universal myth which, according to Gooch, was bequeathed to us byNeanderthal involves a faint group of stars called the Pleiades, also known asthe Seven Sisters.As a nocturnal being, Neanderthal would spend a great deal of time looking atthe night sky. Neanderthal charted the movement and phases of the moon, and heseemed to have created ritual objects as part of his worship. At a Neanderthalsite at La Quina in the Dordogne region of France, seventy-six perfect stonespheres were discovered, along with a flat flint disk some twenty centimeters indiameter. No obvious utilitarian use for these objects could be discovered andit seems they are a kind of religious artifact, related to Neanderthal’s moonworship.54 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber96] But while we can accept thatNeanderthal was obsessed by the moon—it is, after all, the largest and brightestobject in the night sky—the attention he paid to the Pleiades seems lessobvious. In Cities of Dreams, Gooch relates the strange fact that mythssurrounding the Pleiades, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be found aroundthe world, in places as far apart as ancient Greece, aboriginal Australia, NorthAmerica, and Siberia. In fact, the Pleiades are the only constellation noted andnamed by every culture on the planet, past or present. They are always known asthe Seven Sisters and they are always being hunted by the constellation Orion.The myths all tell the same story. But the Pleiades are not a brightconstellation—they are made up of fourth magnitude stars—and to the naked eyeseem rather faint. There are much brighter objects in the sky to attract theattention of early stargazers and mythmakers.Yet Gooch argues persuasively that some thirty thousand years ago, lateNeanderthal charted the movement of the Pleiades. He did this because, backthen, the rise of the Seven Sisters marked the arrival of spring. As moonworshipers, Neanderthal would be interested in all heavenly activity, and asGoddess worshipers, the arrival of spring and its procreative powers would beimportant to them. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, however, the riseof the Pleiades and the arrival of the vernal equinox no longer happen at thesame time, but Gooch argues that the significance the Seven Sisters had forNeanderthal was inherited by his Cro-Magnon competitor, who was just about tosqueeze his starry-eyed cousin out of existence. Neanderthal’s astronomicalknowledge was gradually transformed into myth, something, Gooch maintains, thathappened to all of Neanderthal’s “wisdom,” and was diffused across the globe.Gooch was not the only one to notice this strange status of the Seven Sisters.In Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age, the Oxford anthropologist RichardRudgley notes that the Russian prehistorian Boris Frolov also remarked on thecurious ubiquity of the Pleiades in world mythology. Frolov was convinced thatsuch acute parallels—even to exact names—across such distances could not becoincidental, and that they can only be explained by a “common heritage.” YetRudgley comments that such a common heritage would point to a “tradition ofcommunicable knowledge of the heavens that has existed for over 40,000 years.”That is, since the “beginning of the Upper Paleolithic,” and before both the NewWorld and Australia were inhabited. It would also mean that the people of thattime had a language. Rudgley recognizes that most authorities will not acceptthis—it would be “extremely awkward for most widely accepted views of thehistory and knowledge of science”—yet he does suggest that such a “knowledge”could help account for “certain objects of early Upper Paleolithic” that seemlike “advanced examples of calendars based on both solar and lunarobservations.”55 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber97] One such calendar was a pieceof bone the prehistorian Alexander Marshack discovered in an Upper Paleolithicsite. It dated from thirty-five thousand years ago yet had markings charting thephases of the moon, a finding he announced in his book The Roots ofCivilization.56 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber98]DIRECT PERCEPTIONRudgley is no occultist or esotericist, and his interest in ancient astronomersis strictly scientific, but as the title of his book suggests, he does believethat people of an earlier time knew more than we suspect. How did they know? Wehave seen that Schwaller de Lubicz believed it was through “the intelligence ofthe heart.” Gooch believed that Neanderthal and the humans that followed himexperienced what he called “direct perceiving,” a form of intuition in which“you get things right straightaway—‘just like that.’” This is opposed to ourmore common “indirect perceiving,” in which you have to work things out.57[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber99] The difference between the two, Gooch pointsout, is that with “direct perceiving,” you don’t know how you know, you just do.The knowledge just “pops into your head” and you have no idea how it got there.With the more laborious and time-consuming “indirect perceiving,” you do knowhow you know, and what’s more, you can show someone else how to know it too.This is our usual kind of knowledge, what the Greeks called episteme, and wearrive at it through the boring methods of trial, error, memory, and rote, whatin general terms we call “education.” Our other kind of knowledge is somethingdifferent, and because our usual ideas about reality—based on our left-brainaccounts—can’t explain it, we either dismiss it as impossible, or ignore it.Nevertheless, it is real.The dark magician Aleister Crowley said that “even the crudest Magick eludesconsciousness altogether, so that when one is able to do it, one does it withoutconscious comprehension, very much as one makes a good stroke at cricket orbilliards.”58 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber100] Crowley’s remark echoes that ofthe Austrian novelist and occultist Gustav Meyrink, who said that magic is“doing without knowing.” Jean Gebser believed that all magic required “asacrifice of consciousness.”59 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber101] Zerah Colburn,the “lightning calculator” whose talents certainly seemed magical, could notgive an account of how he arrived at his answers, although they were correct.Neither could Oliver Sacks’s “idiot savants.” As Gooch writes, “It seems to methat the ancients, in particular, of course, Neanderthal and then those who cameafter him who were close to him, did gain real understanding intuitively, a realknowledge of aspects of human life and human biology, of some of the functionsof the planet’s geology and perhaps some knowledge even of atomic and molecularstructure.” They acquired this knowledge, Gooch suggests, through dreams andclairvoyance or “simply by looking and saying ‘this is so.’” And the strangething is, as Gooch points out, “they were right.”Gooch’s “direct perceiving,” like Schwaller de Lubicz’s “intelligence of theheart,” seems to be a form of knowing very similar to gnosis, discussed earlierin this chapter. All three suggest the kind of “participatory” character thatOwen Barfield argued was typical of human consciousness at an earlier time.Again, we needn’t agree with all of Schwaller de Lubicz’s or Gooch’s argumentsto recognize their basic idea: that at some point in our history, we seemed topossess a way of knowing that was different from our more familiar one, and thatthis way of knowing allowed us a kind of “wisdom” that we have lost touch with,or at least have less access to than we once did. “Lightning calculators” stillseem to have some access to it, and in the annals of parapsychology andmysticism there are innumerable examples of an inexplicable knowledge coming tomany individuals. We have also seen that drugs like mescaline can open our“doors of perception,” allowing us an experience of this older form ofconsciousness. In one form or another, these examples—and there areothers—suggest that they are in some way related to the ancient wisdom we are insearch of.Where did it go?WHAT HAPPENED?No one knows exactly when or how we lost our ancient wisdom and arrived at thekind of consciousness we now possess. Rudolf Steiner speaks about the changefrom our “Old Moon” picture-based consciousness to our more logical, rational“Earth” consciousness, and Gebser of the transition from the mythic structure ofconsciousness to the mental-rational; but the actual mechanism involved remainsunclear, although each gives plenty of evidence that the change did take place.Stan Gooch sees the cerebrum as the culprit, and McGilchrist puts the blame ononly one half of it. Undoubtedly something happened that made things different,but no one knows exactly what triggered it. There have, however, been somesuggestions.In The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, JulianJaynes argues that at around 1250 B.C. a series of crises involving wars,massive migrations, pirate raids on the coastal towns of the Mediterraneancarried out by the mysterious Sea People, natural disasters like the terrificvolcanic eruption on the island of Santorini, and other disturbances led to therise of our own ego-based consciousness.60 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber102]Prior to this, Jaynes argues, consciousness was “bicameral,” two-chambered,which, in effect, means that before the “breakdown” of the “bicameral mind,”humans were more or less like the split-brain patients mentioned in theIntroduction. (Gebser believed that the mental-rational structure began around1225 B.C., so his and Jaynes’s dates seem to line up too.) Jaynes believed thatprior to the end of the Bronze Age, humans did not experience an interior“self-consciousness” in the way that we do, but heard voices in their head whichthey believed came from the gods but were really issuing from the right brain.Much of Jaynes’s evidence comes from Homer’s Iliad, which was written down inthe eighth or ninth century B.C., but which speaks of events—the TrojanWar—taking place during the Mycenaean civilization some six or seven centuriesearlier.The Iliad, Jaynes argues, contains no words that describe inner states of mind.“The picture then is one of strangeness and heartlessness and emptiness,” Jayneswrites. “We cannot approach these heroes by inventing mind-spaces behind theirfierce eyes as we do each other.”61 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber103] “Bicameralman” would not ask himself what he should do or what he thought about something,but would wait for a “message” from the gods—or, as Jaynes, argues, the rightbrain. (Jaynes’s own “inspiration” for his theory came when he experienced an“auditory hallucination” while pondering the problem of knowledge.62[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber104]) When he received his answer, he would go onwith whatever he was doing. Jaynes even says that “bicameral man” might have hadto ask the same question several times. On his way to build a dam across ariver, he might forget where he was going and what he was supposed to do when hegot there, and would have to petition the god again.This kind of dreamy, absentminded approach to life worked fine for a longtime—and it still does for many people. Life followed well-grooved routines andlittle happened to upset them. But when these routines were broken by wars,famine, or natural catastrophes, the older, more leisurely way of life collapsedand man had to learn how to react to things more quickly. Those who didn’t fellby the wayside. Jaynes points out that the “bicameral men” who went againstinstinct and had the presence of mind—the phrase is instructive—to allow theirwives and daughters to be raped by invaders would survive; those who followedthe old edicts of the gods and tried to defend them would more than likely becut down. Artifacts from after the time of Jaynes’s proposed breakdown seem tocorroborate his thesis. In 1230 B.C., a stone altar made by Tukulti-Ninurta I, atyrant of Assyria, shows Tukulti kneeling before the empty throne of his god. Atablet from the same time reads, “One who has no god, as he walks along thestreet, headache envelopes him like a garment.” Again, we don’t need to acceptall of Jaynes’s argument to grasp the basic idea: that at some point toward theend of the Bronze Age, something happened to human consciousness that put it onits road to us.Leonard Shlain places the “split” between the old consciousness and the new abit further back, to the rise of the alphabet circa 1700 to 1500 B.C. ThePhoenicians are generally credited with the invention of the alphabet, but thereis reason to believe that an earlier alphabet preceded the Phoenician, and morethan likely the credit for this revolutionary development should be shared amongseveral peoples who lived in the region between Egypt and Mesopotamia in thesecond millennium B.C. Whoever invented it, for Shlain the rise of literacy andits linear means of communication was, as we’ve seen, not an unalloyed benefit.For all its advantages, it has led, he argues, to a left-brain–dominated culturethat diminished and degraded the earlier holistic, right-brain, image-basedGoddess civilization.One of the disturbing insights that Shlain shares with Jaynes is that for both,the rise of a left-brain ego-based consciousness seems to have gone hand in handwith the rise of violence and cruelty. The Phoenicians, according to Shlain,were a cruel people, given to child sacrifice, and they left no literary orcultural remains.63 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber105] The AssyrianTiglath-Pileser I (1115–1077 B.C.), who came a century after Tukulti-Ninurta,inaugurated one of the bloodiest reigns in history. Laws made by Tiglath-Pilesercarried inordinately severe penalties, even for minor infringements. Bas-reliefsof Assyrian campaigns depict whole populations being impaled. “The Assyrians,”Jaynes writes, “fell like butchers upon harmless villagers.”64[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber106] We have seen that the left brain has afundamentally aggressive approach to experience, and Jaynes’s and Shlain’saccounts seem to corroborate this. As the left brain is geared toward dealingwith the world, this makes a strange, disturbing kind of sense. Faced with aworld thrown into chaos, and increasingly losing touch with the gods (orgoddesses), the “old ways” no longer worked and our ancestors had to make snapdecisions and achieve their aims as quickly as possible. As we all know, thequickest way to get something we want is to simply take it. “Smash and grab” isthe shortest route to fulfilling desires. Pain is a good persuader. Although inthe long run they are self-defeating, violence and cruelty, then, may be a kindof “shortcut” taken by a consciousness suddenly confronted by a dangerous world,and driven by a need to deal with things swiftly.65[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber107]A NECESSARY LOSSYet no matter how the shift from the old consciousness to the new wasengineered—and it more than likely took place at different tempos over a longtime—that it needed to be accomplished is clear. As I remarked earlier, in orderto operate effectively, consciousness needs to be limited. We need challenges,resistance, and obstacles in order to evolve. A perpetual Golden Age would be acurse, as would an indefinite stay in the Garden of Eden. As Aldous Huxley saw,if everyone took mescaline, no one would do the dishes, and they would soon pileup. We need to come up against some barrier in order to get the best out of us.As Nietzsche wrote, “What is happiness?—The feeling that power increases—that aresistance is overcome.”66 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber108] Bicameral man,Neanderthal, the ancient Egyptians most likely felt little resistance; closelyconnected to nature and the cosmos, how could they? In order to get thingsgoing, evolution, or the intelligence behind it, purposely put a damper on humanconsciousness, and over time drew it back from its awareness of “the network ofconnections linking everything to everything else” and fixed it firmly on whatwas right in front of it. The ancient Egyptians may have enjoyed, as Schwallerde Lubicz believed, “an unreflective grasp of the fundamental laws ofexistence,” but they didn’t necessarily know how they knew these laws, nor didthey feel that they should. At home in the cosmos, they did not feel the need toexplore it, in the way that our limited left-brain consciousness does. If youhave a strong intuitive knowledge of something, you rarely make the effort totry to explain it, and, as we’ve seen, most times you can’t. For all itsundeniable mystery and magic, Egyptian civilization remained static formillennia.Evolution or the force behind it does not want us to remain static. It pushed usout of the cosmic nest, into the cold and difficult regions of left-brainconsciousness, because it is in those unwieldy climes that we can best actualizeour capabilities."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOOUT OF THE MYSTERIES[../image/153618.jpg]In the Way to Wisdom, the German existential philosopher Karl Jaspers proposedthe idea of an “axial age.” This was a kind of “axis of history,” when new waysof thinking emerged that fundamentally shaped human development.1[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber109] This age lasted, Jaspers believed, from 800 to200 B.C., and it was during this time that “the man with whom we live today cameinto being.”2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber110] This was because it was duringthis time that “the basic categories in which we still think” and “the worldreligions out of which men still live” made their first appearance. In morerecent times, Karen Armstrong proposed a similar idea in her book The GreatTransformation; and in Order and History, the philosopher Eric Voegelin echoedJaspers in speaking of this period as encompassing a “Great Leap of Being.”The few centuries of his axial age produced, Jaspers tells us, anextraordinarily creative growth in human consciousness, and this surge of thehuman spirit was worldwide. “In the years centering around 500 B.C.,” Jasperswrote, “the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid, simultaneously andindependently in China, India, Persia, Palestine, and Greece.”3[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber111] In China during this time, we find Confuciusand Lao-Tzu, the founder of Taoism. In India, it was the age of the Upanishadsand of the Buddha. Zoroaster emerged in Persia and laid the foundations ofZoroastrianism, and in Palestine the Hebrew prophets Elijah, Isaiah, andJeremiah arose, announcing a new relationship between man and God. And in Greecewe have the beginning of philosophy itself.In Greece, Jasper’s axial age saw the arrival of a new kind of individual, the“thinker,” whose appearance we can see as the result of “bicameral man’s”nervous breakdown, and the development of Gebser’s mental-rational consciousnessstructure. Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles,down to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, represent a break in how humanconsciousness perceived the world, as well as a radically new way ofunderstanding it.QUESTION TIMEAlthough the transition from our earlier mode of consciousness into our morefamiliar one was not quite as sudden or complete as this notion of a “break”might suggest, it is clear that with the rise of these “thinkers,” something newhad appeared on the scene. Whether it was the breakdown of the bicameral mind,the rise of literacy, Gebser’s mental-rational consciousness structure, anuppity cerebrum, or some other unknown or unsuspected reason, it is clear thatby the middle of the first millennium B.C. something different was coming intoplay, at least in that part of the planet that would later be seen as thebirthplace of the “western world.” At this point “the mythical age with itspeace of mind and self-evident truths was ended,” Jaspers wrote. “The opinions,customs, conditions, which had hitherto enjoyed unconscious acceptance came tobe questioned.” “The world,” Jaspers said, “was thrown into turmoil,” and menand women had to find a new way to live in it.4[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber112]One sign of this new development was that, rather than accept the time-wornmythical answers about the fundamental mysteries, people starting askingquestions. People had, of course, asked questions before, but the kinds ofquestions being asked now were different. “Bicameral man” may have asked thegods—or his right brain—“Where can I find good hunting?” or “Where is a freshstream?” or “What sacrifice should I offer to ensure a good harvest?” Thequestions now being asked by a few eccentric characters had nothing to do withuseful things like these, but were ends in themselves. The people asking themwanted to know, not because it would help them in some way, but because theywere curious. They were infected with what the literary philosopher GeorgeSteiner calls a taste for “the sovereignly useless,” and had acquired thebizarre habit of being “interested in something for its own enigmatic sake,”which Steiner suggests “may be the best excuse there is for man.”5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber113] “All philosophy begins in wonder,” Socrates,through his scribe Plato, said in the Theaetetus, a dialogue about knowledge andwisdom. Aristotle and many others would soon echo him. And from the accountsthat have come down to us, it seems that the Greeks of the axial age began towonder about quite a few things.The myths about the creation of the world that can be found in Homer and Hesiod,and later in Ovid, give a narrative, poetic account of how it came into being,that is, a story. The first thinkers of the axial age asked a different sort ofquestion and looked for a different kind of answer. They did not ask how theworld came into being, how, that is, the gods created it, but of what it wasmade. What one of Jaspers’s axial-age Greeks, pointing to the ground, or a star,or a cloud, wanted to know was, “What is this made of?” What is its essence?That was the question.LOST IN THE STARSWhat the early, pre-Socratic philosophers were interested in is what Aristotlelater called an arche, a Greek word meaning “beginning,” “origin,” or “source,”and which is familiar to us through Jung’s use of the term “archetype.” As onehistorian of philosophy put it, these axial-age Greeks were looking for “theoriginal and controlling stuff and first principle of the universe, the natureof which provides an explanation of the existing universe, and its origin, as awhole.”6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber114] To use an anachronistic phrase thatwould not apply until the modern age, the pre-Socratics wanted to know what madethe universe tick. In this sense we can see these early questioners and thinkersas the first scientists.We can also see them as the first “absentminded professors.” A tale about Thalesof Miletus (c. 624–546 B.C.), in Asia Minor, now Turkey, that Plato tellsillustrates this. In the Theaetetus, Plato tells how Thales was once soengrossed in looking at the stars that he didn’t notice a well and fell rightinto it. This prompted a Thracian maidservant to remark that Thales was soconcerned with what was happening in the sky that he was oblivious to what wasright in front of him. (Thales was an early astronomer and accurately predicteda solar eclipse in 585 B.C., so his stargazing was at least fruitful.) The storylater became one of Aesop’s fables. Such observations as the maidservant’s soonbecame commonplace—“Anyone who gives his life to philosophy is open to suchmockery,” Plato remarks—and the kind of obsessiveness that prompted them couldbe dangerous. Archimedes of Syracuse, famous for his cry of “Eureka,” is said tohave been killed in 212 B.C. by a soldier who ordered him to meet the Romangeneral Marcus, then busy conquering the city. Archimedes’ fame was so greatthat the general wanted to meet him, but Archimedes was so engrossed incontemplating a mathematical diagram that he ignored the soldier who, in a fitof anger, killed him. Nietzsche said that philosophers “lived dangerously,” andat least in this instance he was right. But the moral of the story is clear:philosophers live dangerously because their obsession with concepts and ideas—aleft-brain concern—can alienate them from “life.”Thales, who was one of the Seven Sages of ancient Greece, believed thateverything is made of water, or, more accurately, that water is the essence orarche of everything. “All is water,” he said, “and the world is full of gods.”Here we see an overlap between the mythic view of the world and the rising“scientific” one, a blending of the old and new consciousness that would lastfor some time. Water, Thales noted, sustained life while in its absence thingsdied; he also maintained the view that the Earth floated on a kind of cosmicsea, a carryover from the mythic notions of Oceanus, the great World Ocean thatwas believed to encircle the universe. The philosophers who followed Thalesproposed arches of their own. Thales’ student, Anaximander, proposed that thearche was not a substance or stuff like water, but a kind of principle that,somewhat confusingly, also had stufflike qualities. Anaximander’s apeiron, thename of his arche, means the “infinite” or “indefinite.” Apeiron is limitlessand indefinable; since it explains everything, it must be beyond everything, andbecause it is the source of all characteristics, it must be characterlessitself. As it is through the apeiron that heat gets its hotness, water itswetness, air its dryness, and earth its solidness, the apeiron itself cannot behot, wet, dry, or solid. Anaximenes, a student of Anaximander, proposed a lessabstract arche and believed that the fundamental stuff of things was air.Heraclitus, the “dark philosopher,” said it was fire. They seemed to befollowing a pattern, and it took the philosophers Leucippus and Democritussometime later to complete the set of the ancient elements. They proposed thatearth, or at least solid matter, in the form of atoms, was the basic stuff outof which everything else was made, an idea that gained remarkable currency inthe modern age.ORDER IN THE FLUXWe may not be impressed with Thales’ ontological analysis, nor with that of thephilosophers who followed him, although later philosophers like Martin Heideggerbelieved that we had taken a wrong turn at Plato and needed to get back to thepre-Socratics.7 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber115] But our sophistication canblind us to the significance of their attempts to answer the childish question“What is the world made of?” This is a query that, with an enormous amount oftechnology and expense, we still ask today: witness the recent excitement overthe Higgs boson. What is important about Thales, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, and theothers is that, as Richard Tarnas puts it, they “made the remarkable assumptionthat an underlying rational unity and order existed within the flux and varietyof the world” and they made determined attempts to grasp it. The emphasis hereis on “rational unity.” As Tarnas says, these early philosophers made it theirtask to discover a fundamental principle at work in the world, and to provide“impersonal and conceptual explanations” of it “based on their observations ofnatural phenomena.”8 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber116] Whatever the world ismade of, these early philosophers inaugurated a new departure for humanity. Theybegan to think about things, rather than just accept them. Neanderthal andSchwaller de Lubicz’s ancient Egyptians may have enjoyed an intuitive unity withthe cosmos that we experience only rarely, if ever. But I am not sure if theywondered about things in the way that we, if we are lucky, still do.A HARMONIOUS MANTalking about Thales, Anaximenes, and the other early Greek thinkers, I haverepeatedly used the word “philosopher.” This is something of an anachronism, asit was not until the advent of another pre-Socratic thinker that the word evenexisted. This was Pythagoras of Samos (c. 571–c. 497 B.C.), and if we excludemythical and semimythical characters like Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, andZoroaster, we can think of him as our first secret teacher.9[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber117] Along with several other things, Pythagoras istraditionally held to be the first person to use the term “philosopher,” meaning“lover of wisdom.” He also introduced the word “cosmos” into our vocabulary. Itcomes from a Greek word, kosmos, meaning “an orderly or harmonious system,” andit is opposed to another Greek word, khaos, or “chaos,” which for the Greeksmeant a formless void, the inchoate state of things before creation.In The Caretakers of the Cosmos, I point out that although scientists often usethe words interchangeably, “universe” and “cosmos” do not mean the same thing.Essential to the idea of a cosmos is the necessity of beauty, hence our word“cosmetic,” which for the Greeks meant “that which beautifies,” but for us means“makeup,” something essentially false or “just for show.” So for Pythagoras andthe philosophers who followed him, we can have stars, planets, galaxies, and soon, but unless these are related to each other in a beautiful, harmonious order,we do not have a cosmos. Another term still in use that has its source inPythagoras is “theory,” from the Greek theoria, which means to “contemplate” orto “see” with the mind’s eye, or “nous.” “Theory” for us means an idea orconcept, but we can see its roots in the notion of “speculation,” which linksboth to “spectacle” and to “theater,” both of which involve a kind of seeing.One of the difficulties in writing about the pre-Socratics is that little ofwhat they wrote has survived. All we have are enigmatic fragments, and in thecase of Pythagoras, who, like Socrates and Christ, taught orally, we don’t evenhave that. (Pythagoras may have left some poetry written under the name Orpheus,but that is uncertain; why he may have chosen Orpheus as a pen name will becomeclear shortly.) What have come down to us are accounts of Pythagoras’s life andteaching by later philosophers. The Neoplatonists Porphyry and Iamblichus wroteaccounts of his life, but in these how much is truth, how much myth, and howmuch hearsay attributed to Pythagoras by the devotees of his school is, at thispoint, impossible to sort out. Most of the stories about Pythagoras should betaken with several grains of salt as the sort of thing that accumulates aroundan exceptional individual. I leave it up to the reader to decide whether or notPythagoras had a golden thigh, or could be seen in two places at once, or if hewas indeed the Hyperborean Apollo (or at least his son)—Hyperborea being amythical land to the north—or that he could converse with a certain river andalso with demons, that he descended to the underworld, or, as is perhaps mostknown, could truly hear the “music of the spheres.”10[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber118]This celestial music, said to be the euphonious hum of the planets as theygently turned around the Earth in their crystalline spheres, is a development ofone of the two discoveries that, if they know anything about Pythagoras, mostpeople credit him with. One is the famous Pythagorean theorem which, as we’veseen, Schwaller de Lubicz believed the Egyptians knew well before him. If thestories of Pythagoras’s travels are true, he may indeed have learned it fromthem. Pythagoras is also said to have discovered the musical octave. One day,passing a blacksmith, he noticed that the iron rods the smithy was hammering letout different tones depending on their size. It was through this that Pythagorasdiscovered that different musical notes are related to each other harmoniouslybecause there is a simple ratio between the notes and the length of the stringproducing them. This story itself may be a folk tale, but Pythagoras didexperiment with the monochord, an ancient single-stringed musical instrumentwith a movable bridge, and it was most likely through his observation of thisthat he recognized the relation between the length of string and its tone.11[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber119] Having said this, Pythagoras may have learnedabout the octave during a stint in Babylon, where some scholars have argued itssecrets had been known for some time.12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber120]However Pythagoras hit upon the octave, it is the source of his central insight:that there is a harmonious order at work in the universe, and that this order ismost fundamentally expressed through numbers, something Schwaller de Lubiczbelieved the ancient Egyptians knew as well. Pythagoras was supposed to be soattuned—an instructive metaphor—to this cosmic order that, just as he could hearthe octave emerge from the smithy’s hammer blows, he could also hear thegentler, more heavenly tones of the planets above.A SHORT LIFE OF PYTHAGORASPythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus, a gem engraver and merchant from Tyre, andhis wife, Pythias, and was born on the Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea.He is believed to have studied with Anaximander, from whom he adopted the ideaof the apeiron, as well as with Thales. He is also thought to have studied withPherekydes of Syros, an enigmatic figure who is said to be the first Greekphilosopher to teach the notion of the transmigration of souls, an idea thatPythagoras and his followers would also adopt.13[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber121] It was said that Pythagoras could remember hispast lives and that he could also see the past lives of his students. Sometimesconsidered one of the Seven Sages of Greece, Pherekydes is seen as atransitional figure, bridging the mental gap between the older mythologicalthought and the rising pre-Socratic philosophy.Iamblichus, writing nearly a millennium after Pythagoras’s death, claimed thatPythagoras had spent twenty-two years in Egypt, and that he also studied amongthe Chaldeans and possibly with the Zoroastrians in Persia.14[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber122] He was said to have been initiated into thereligious mysteries of certain “barbarians”—which simply meant non-Greeks—andthat, according to Porphyry, it was “from his stay among these foreigners thatPythagoras acquired the greater part of his wisdom.”15[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber123] He studied, it is said, in all the schoolsthat were available at the time, even reaching the country that for many was thereal Hyperborea, the “land beyond the North Wind,” ancient Briton, where he mayhave made contact with the Druids, who, along with Pherekydes, also believed inthe transmigration of souls.16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber124]Although Pythagoras traveled in search of knowledge, his journeys may also havebeen in the service of Polycrates, the enlightened tyrant of Samos, a lover oflearning and art. It is believed that Pythagoras was engaged in severaldiplomatic missions for Polycrates.17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber125] Suchpolitical assignments are not uncommon among some secret teachers, and figuressuch as Swedenborg, Madame Blavatsky, Gurdjieff, and Aleister Crowley have beensuspected of espionage and other political intrigues.After his travels, Pythagoras returned to Samos and it is said that for a timehe lived in a cave, which he fitted out as a place to study philosophy. He isthought to have started his first school then, which was called the Semicircle,but this was short-lived. There appears to have been some disagreement withPolycrates. Pythagoras seemed to think, as Plato would after him, that eitherphilosophers should be kings or that kings should be philosophers, and he may beresponsible for inaugurating the tradition of trying to inject philosophicalidealism into the practicalities of political life. Evidently this didn’t goover well with Polycrates, and at around 530 B.C., Pythagoras left Samos andmoved to Crotona, one of the largest Greek cities in southern Italy. It was herethat his real teaching began. His reputation preceded him; almost immediately onhis arrival, he was asked to address the people on the right conduct of life. Hemust have been a persuasive orator. His audience asked him to get involved inthe local government, and for a time his philosophical-political ideas seemed tohave found a home. It is said that after his speech, hundreds of locals joinedhis newly formed Pythagorean Brotherhood, the first philosophical school inEurope, and the first esoteric one too; at least it is the first for which wehave any historical records.Pythagoras’s influence in the public life of Crotona and what was known as MagnaGrecia or “Greater Greece” was widespread. But again it was short-lived. It isunclear what prompted it, but at some point the populace of Crotona rose upagainst Pythagoras and his disciples. The rebellion may have been sparked by thedisciplined, often ascetic life that Pythagoras maintained was essential to thepursuit of wisdom, or it may have been a result of the suspicion that theaverage person often has toward the activity of a secret “elite.” It may havebeen that the Pythagorean attitude toward women—which gave them the same statusas men—and the overall communal character of the school attracted the animus ofpowerful members of the community. It is also suggested that Cylon, a corruptnobleman of Crotona, sought admission to Pythagoras’s brotherhood but wasdenied, and so led the rebellion against him. Whatever the cause, Pythagoras andhis brotherhood were attacked. Their meetinghouses were burnt down and many ofthe disciples were driven into exile or slain. Pythagoras himself fled themassacre and headed to Metapontion, another Greek Italian colony, where he spenthis remaining days and started another school. It is said that he died afterfasting for forty days.18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber126] Empedocles said thatin his life, Pythagoras experienced “all things that are contained in ten, eventwenty generations of men,” and even this brief outline suggests that it isdifficult to disagree with him.IT’S ALL IN THE NUMBERSPythagoras’s central insight was that number was at the heart of the cosmos.This may not sound too remarkable. For us, living in the scientific age, numberis indeed everything. From our bank balance and body mass index to our PIN codesand Facebook friends, number is central to our lives. But between Pythagoras’sidea of number and our own there is a world of difference. We see number asessentially a unit of measurement, of quantity, and we apply it to practicallyeverything, so much so that the Traditionalist philosopher René Guénon arguedthat we live under “the reign of quantity.”19 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber127]That physical reality can be measured accurately and that predictions based onthese measurements will also prove accurate is at the core of modern science andtechnology. We obviously have much to thank for this, but Pythagoras saw numbersvery differently. For him they were essentially qualitative. That is, where wesee 1, 2, 3, and so on as merely integers expressing the amount of something,for Pythagoras numbers had characters, much in the way that, say, people do. Forhim, 1, 2, 3, and so on expressed certain fundamental, archetypalcharacteristics that gave pattern and shape to reality. So where we use numbersto denote the quantity of something—the distance between London and Paris or theprice we have to pay for some item—Pythagoras and his followers were interestedin understanding the meaning of a number, to discover its essence in itself. Forthem, number was a universal principle, as fundamental, if not more so, as lightor sound. Indeed, for Pythagoras, light and sound, as well as everything else,were in essence expressions of the metaphysical character of number. As DavidFideler writes, for Pythagoras, number is “the principle, the source, and theroot of all things.”20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber128]For Pythagoras, One is technically not a number. The Monad or Unity is theprinciple behind numbers, which are the “manifestation of diversity in a unifiedcontinuum.”21 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber129] The One is the fundamentalsource out of which everything else emerges. It is with Two that all existencebegins. Two, or the Dyad, introduces multiplicity and strife, the tensionbetween opposites, but also the possibility of understanding, of relating theopposites to each other. (Again, Schwaller de Lubicz speaks like a Pythagoreanwhen, in his early work A Study of Numbers, he speaks of the primal,inexplicable “scission” of the absolute nonmanifest One into multiplicity, amystery that in the form of the Big Bang still tantalizes science.)The opposition of subject and object is overcome by Three, or the Triad, whichis precisely the relation between these two, between knower and known, which isknowledge. Here, at the very beginning of western thought, we have therecognition that oppositions are unified through the introduction of a thirdelement, the notion of a “transcendent function,” mentioned in the Introduction.This third element harmonizes the other two; it “fits” them together to createorder, which is what “harmony” means. Things are in harmony when they fittogether well, when they are ordered, when the balance and proportion betweenthem is correct, and this can apply to everything, from a musical composition oran architectural design, to our diet, which we are told should be “balanced.”This basic pattern of existence, what Gurdjieff centuries later would call “thelaw of three,” was expressed by Pythagoras in a figure he called the tetraktys,which is a pyramid of ten points, with one point at the top and four at thebottom, with a row of two and then three in between. For Pythagoras and hisfollowers, all of creation is symbolized in the tetraktys. Here we have theundifferentiated unity of the One, which becomes the polarity of opposites inTwo, then their harmony and reunification in the higher synthesis of Three,resulting in the manifestation of the world in Four. For Pythagoras, thetetraktys was so important that he called it the kosmos, or Pan, which means“the All.”The tetraktys is an example of what the Pythagoreans called “number-shapes,” theway that numbers form certain kinds of figures, which tell us about the world.The Pythagoreans wrote numbers as a series of dots. Odd numbers were seen toform squares while even ones formed oblongs, and this is something one candiscover for oneself.22 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber130] We may have abandonedthis kind of thinking, yet we still think of numbers as “figures,” and when wewant to find the answer to something, we say we will “figure it out,” aPythagorean inheritance we all share. The kind of mathematical relationshipPythagoras saw between the lengths of iron rods and the tones they emittedseemed to exist throughout the rest of creation too. It was the work of thephilosopher, the lover of wisdom, to seek out this hidden order and to harmonizehimself with it. He or she must balance his own inner world, his soul, and outof its initial chaos form a cosmos, that is, give it beauty through achieving aspiritual order.Again, the fundamental process at work in arriving at order, whether in theinner or outer cosmos, was the harmonizing of the tension between two opposites,between the limited and the unlimited, the peras and the apeiron. Our word“perimeter,” or the “period” that ends a sentence or indicates a certain lengthof time, is an echo of the Greek peras. It was in this that Pythagoras differedsharply from his other philosophers. Where Thales, Anaximenes, and the otherssought the fundamental “stuff” out of which the cosmos was made, Pythagoras wasfocused on form. Number was not a thing or a kind of material, but that whichgave form and limit to matter. All things have form, and all form can beunderstood in terms of number, and number itself is the result of harmonizingthe limited and the unlimited. Without the limited, the unlimited, asAnaximander knew, would be formless, a kind of chaos. It is the limiting powerof form that allows for a cosmos to exist.A PHILOSOPHICAL LIFEIt was also the power of limit, in the sense of a disciplined way of life, thatcreated the inner cosmos, the ordered beauty of the soul. Pythagoras differedfrom his Ionian contemporaries in maintaining that philosophy was not only asearch for rational answers or concepts to account for natural phenomena, but away of being in the world, a way of bringing oneself into harmony with the orderthat permeated existence. It was a way of bringing oneself into balance with thecosmos, of fashioning a well-tempered soul. The musical metaphor is peculiarlyapt, because music for Pythagoras was well suited to harmonizing the mind andthe soul. Its mathematical order excited the mind while the soul enjoyed thatorder’s beauty; indeed, Pythagoras is said to have calmed an excited youth byhaving a certain mode of music played, a recognition that the harmony and orderfound in music can have a direct and predictable effect on the psyche, aninsight that Gurdjieff shared and said was true of all “objective art.”23[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber131] Music was central to Pythagoras’s teaching, asit was to the cosmos, and the goal of the philosopher was, like Pythagoras, tobe able to hear the harmony of the spheres.Members of the Pythagorean Brotherhood were vegetarians. This was in partbecause of dietary reasons; the idea behind the philosophical life was to becomepure, and coarse flesh would work against this. But Pythagoras also believedthat by eating animal flesh, we may inadvertently eat a human soul that hadtransmigrated there. Beans were also famously forbidden, as the flatulence theyproduced would have interfered with the contemplative calm the brothers desired.Some kind of physical exercise aimed, as it is today, at promoting well-beingand a balanced lifestyle was also a part of the Pythagorean discipline.Pythagoras’s students were divided into two levels, although he also had secretteachings that he reserved for a select group, a not uncommon procedure inesoteric schools. The akousmatikoi or “auditors” went through a three-yearprobation period and were limited to listening to Pythagoras’s lectures, whichwere said to have been given behind a screen. The mathematikoi or “students”proper endured a five-year period of silence, during which they were not allowedto ask any questions, merely to reflect on the teachings they absorbed. Allproperty was held in common, and the brothers’ daily routine consisted ofstudying mathematical diagrams that modeled the harmony in nature and thecosmos. They would also study the heavens and learn the fundamental principlesof music. Music seemed to unify the total range of the Pythagorean life,relating the mind, the emotions, and the body. As David Fideler writes, “Thedivine harmony can be grasped through the mind, yet can also be perceivedthrough the senses.”24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber132] Apollo was the god oforder and beauty, and his lyre produced beautiful harmonies; it is no surprisethat Pythagoras was his devoted servant, and there is a tradition that sees inthe god’s name the essence of the Pythagorean teaching. Apollo is said to meanto “become one, not many” (hoi polloi in Greek means “the many”).25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber133] Whatever we may think of the myths and talltales associated with Pythagoras, it is clear that with his school began thestudy of mathematics, music, and astronomy that would form much of the westernintellectual tradition that followed.ORPHEUS AND THE MYSTERIESThat music played a large role in Pythagoras’s philosophy links his teachingswith the Orphic mystery tradition. Orpheus was a musician—his lyre was said tohave come from Apollo—whose playing was so beautiful it was said to move notonly men’s souls, but also stones, trees, and even demons and the gods. He was ahuman who achieved a semidivine status, and most of us know about his ill-fatedattempt to rescue his wife, Eurydice, from the underworld. In the earliestversion of the myth, he does succeed, but later versions have him breakingHades’ condition that on his journey back to Earth, he not look back atEurydice; he does, and she is forced to return to the depths. The Orphicteachings aimed at freeing the soul from this fate, and for centuries Orphismwas one of the most important of the Greek Mystery religions. They are called“mysteries” because what exactly was made known during their rites was neverrevealed and remains a mystery—participants took a vow of secrecy under pain ofdeath—but also because from what we do know of them, it is clear they wereconcerned with the central mysteries of life and death.The little we know about the Mysteries comes from brief remarks made by some oftheir initiates. The Greek poet Pindar said that whoever took part in theMysteries “knows the end of life, and its divinely-bestowed beginning.” TheRoman statesman Cicero said that not only did he find “reason to abide in joy”at the Mysteries, but also “to die with greater hope.”26[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber134] The Golden Ass, by the Roman writer Apuleius,depicts in fictional form an initiation into the Mysteries of Isis, and amongthe Greek greats said to have been initiated were the dramatist Sophocles andthe fount of western philosophy, Plato.The most famous of these initiations, the Eleusinian Mysteries, were performedin Eleusis in Greece from around 1500 B.C. to their end in 392 A.D., when theRoman Emperor Theodosius I closed the sanctuaries and ordered the destruction ofmany other pagan religious sites.27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber135] A fewyears later, in 396 A.D., the coup de grâce was delivered when Alaric, king ofthe Visigoths, invaded, accompanied by many Christians, and wiped out whateverwas left. The Eleusinian Mysteries were founded, so the story goes, by thegoddess Demeter in honor of the god Dionysus, in thanks for the release of herdaughter Persephone from her captor, Hades, who had brought her to theunderworld. Persephone was allowed to return to Demeter for half a year, and themyth is supposed to represent the return of spring after the barren winter. Ifnothing else, it does represent a rebirth and in this sense is related tosimilar themes and rites of other death and rebirth religions, like that of Isisand Osiris in Egypt, and that of Demeter’s fellow Greek, Dionysus, as well asChristianity.The rites involved a celebration and procession from Athens to Eleusis and wereopen to every Greek speaker, man, woman, or slave, the only exception beingmurderers. These rites were a more participatory kind of worship, as opposed tothe stale respect shown to the distant gods of Olympus. There were two levels ofMysteries, the Lesser and the Greater. In the Lesser Mysteries, participantswere given knowledge of the higher worlds, of what lay beyond the earthly planeand the release from it through death. But in the Greater Mysteries, theparticipants were given an experience of this. As Joscelyn Godwin points out,the Lesser Mysteries were a collective experience, while the Greater Mysterieswere experienced individually, and apparently not everyone was worthy of them.28[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber136] The experience of the Lesser Mysteriesculminated in the participants being shown an ear of corn; this and the othervegetal symbolism associated with the rites—wheat, pomegranates, poppies—suggestthe ever-recurring forces of life, stirring within nature and ourselves, andrevealed to the initiate that he too will return after a brief departure.In the Greater Mysteries, a potion known as the kykeon, a mixture of barley,mint, and water, was consumed, and the secrets of the afterlife were revealed tothe participants. Those who received the kykeon were known as epoptai, the namefor those who had beheld (epopteia) the sacred secrets—a link, perhaps, to thetheoria or contemplation of the Pythagoreans. What exactly they beheld and whatexactly was in the kykeon remains unclear, although some scholars have suggestedthat the kykeon contained some hallucinogenic (or “entheogenic,”“god-engendering”) substance; LSD from ergot, a fungus found on corn and othergrasses, and “magic mushrooms,” have been suggested.29[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber137] That drugs may have been in wide use inancient and classical times is the thesis of a fascinating book, The ChemicalMuse: Drug Use and the Roots of Western Civilization by D. C. A. Hillman. Heargues that Pythagoras, as well as other early philosophers, were very familiarwith them.30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber138] As Albert Hofmann, the discovererof LSD, remarked, “Greece was the cradle of that experience of reality in whichthe ego felt separated from the exterior world,” and the Mysteries must have“addressed some profound spiritual necessity, some yearning of the soul.”31[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber139]PURIFYING THE SOULInitiates into the Mysteries were also given knowledge to help them on theirjourney after death from the underworld to the heavenly spheres, much as theEgyptian Book of the Dead and the Tibetan Book of the Dead give advice on how toavoid the traps and snares facing the souls of the newly departed. Initiateswere given the password to the paradise of Demeter and were told that on theirjourney through the underworld they should avoid drinking from the spring ofLethe “near the white cypress,” which contains the “waters of forgetfulness,”but to make sure they drink from the spring flowing from the “Lake ofMnemosyne,” or memory. To remember your spiritual self was essential to avoideither remaining in Hades, a dim realm of shades and shadows, or to being bornagain.The aim of the Orphic Mysteries was to avoid having the soul fall again into thebody after death. Through the observance of certain rites and an ascetic way oflife—the Orphics, too, were vegetarian and if not celibate, were sexuallyabstemious—those who follow the path of Orpheus would become pure, wouldexperience a katharsis, the Greek root of our “catharsis.” They would be“cleansed,” and through this would avoid being reborn, which, as in the case ofeastern ideas of reincarnation, was seen as a punishment for our sins. Orpheusbegan as a reformer of the Dionysian Mysteries, the wild, orgiastic rites of thegod of drunkenness and madness. Nietzsche pitted the gods of madness and oforder—Dionysus and Apollo—against each other, and recognized that in the tensionbetween them lay the roots of Greek art.The mythologist Carl Kerényi saw Dionysus as an “archetypal image ofindestructible life,” the élan vital or “life force” beyond reason, which cannotbe understood but only experienced. Dionysus is a “death and resurrection”deity. In one version of the Dionysian myth, he is the son of Zeus andPersephone. The Titans—earlier, godlike powers that Zeus has tamed—jealous ofZeus, eat the child, except for his heart, which Athena rescues and gives toSemele, a Theban princess with whom Zeus had relations. In revenge for themurder of Dionysus, Zeus destroys the Titans, and out of their ashes makesmankind. Semele later gives birth to Dionysus again, but is herself destroyed byHera, Zeus’s jealous wife. As in many myths about the creation of mankind, aresidue of the god—our spiritual spark—remains within us, and the rites of theDionysian Mysteries were aimed at releasing this, through orgies, drunkenness,and other, more “transgressive” acts, inspired by “divine madness.” In lateryears, the Dionysian Mysteries, as well as the others, were enormously popularin Rome; their transgressive character proved too much, even for decadentRomans, and they were outlawed. But Dionysus did not disappear. Of all the godsof ancient Greece, Dionysus is the one who still remains with us, as the divinemadness of sex, drugs, rock and roll, and raves is still a popular means of“getting out of it,” out, that is, of the limits of the rational mind.Dionysus, like Orpheus, was linked to music, but Orpheus sought a less mad wayof releasing the soul from the bondage of the body. In one version of Orpheus’sdeath, after rejecting the sexual advances of the Maenads, the female followersof Dionysus who engaged in orgiastic and cannibalistic rites, he is torn topieces by them, but his head lives on and floats down the River Hebrus to theisle of Lesbos, where it continues to sing. Orpheus started his own, tamerversion of the Dionysian Mysteries, a kind of ascetic, more speculative rite,which had the same goal of release from our earthly bonds, but which pursuedthis more consciously, in a more controlled and meditative way. As ChristopherBamford puts it, “the Orphic way of life” provided the “possibility of anyindividual attaining by his own efforts . . . a transcendent purity synonymouswith divinity.”32 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber140] In this sense, we can seeOrphism as a kind of precursor to Pythagoras and his school.Yet there is a difference between what the initiates of the Mysteriesexperienced and the kind of life led by the Pythagorean Brotherhood. While theepoptai of the Eleusinian Mysteries spent an evening enraptured with visions ofthe beyond, induced by the possibly hallucinogenic kykeon, they afterwardreturned to their everyday lives, which were not necessarily devoted to thepursuit of wisdom. In a sense, the Mysteries were the ancient Greek equivalentof modern festivals like Burning Man. They were spectacular and revelatory, butafterward you went home. For all its significance, the experience was passive.It was something that happened to you.The philosophical life is different. The Pythagoreans wanted to understand therevelations of the Mysteries, and not wait for death to release them from theburdens of the body. Although informed by the religious spirit of Orphism, theywanted to cultivate their intellects as well as their souls. The ritualobservances of Orphism were not enough. This is why the Pythagorean Brotherhoodwas a school and not only a religious community. Its members spent yearscontemplating the universal harmony, through mathematics, astronomy, and music,and they pursued this wisdom because they loved it. Not everyone whoparticipated in the Mysteries would have the same perseverance. The catharsisthat the Dionysiacs achieved through their mad revels, and which the Orphicsreached through their rites and practices, was made available to thePythagoreans through their desire to grasp the rational order of reality.Purifying the soul of its earthly dross was essential, but equally necessary wasdisciplining the mind.THE PERMANENT NEEDS OF HUMAN NATUREThe balance achieved by the Pythagoreans between the intellectual spirit and thereligious soul seems like a temporary truce between the older, mythological wayof being and the newer, critical form of consciousness. The type ofconsciousness that appeared during the axial age was indeed new and differedfrom its mythological predecessor, yet as the classicist Francis Cornfordremarked, “the philosophic Muse is not a motherless Athena.”33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber141] What Cornford means is that philosophy’sappearance was not unprecedented, as Athena, the goddess of wisdom, was said tohave emerged fully formed from Zeus’s brow after it had been split open byPrometheus’s ax—an image that both Julian Jaynes and Jean Gebser use to describethe painful wrenching of a new form of consciousness out of an older one andwhich again suggests the aggressive character of linear, left-brain thinking.Cornford’s book From Religion to Philosophy, first published in 1912, arguedthat, unlike the accepted view that the pre-Socratics represented a completebreak with the mythological past, and the first step in what we would call amodern, “scientific” type of thought, the “fresh spirit of rational enquiry”they represented had its roots in earlier Greek religion and mythology. Therationalistic assumptions of Cornford’s contemporaries saw mythology andreligion as little more than superstition, and the pre-Socratics for them werethe first signs of an awareness unburdened with these constraints. In recenttimes, Peter Kingsley has followed Cornford and proposed that not only was thenew philosophy a child of its mythological predecessor, some of its mostinfluential practitioners, such as Parmenides and Empedocles, had roots inancient shamanistic practices and that these dark origins have been obscured bylater philosophical tradition.34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber142]Cornford argued that while what would in time become the scientific mode ofthought did have its beginnings with the Ionian pre-Socratics, such asAnaximander, who did not believe in the gods, there was another school, and thatthese “two traditions” were “moved by distinguishable impulses along linesdiverging, more and more widely, towards opposite conclusions.” These impulses,Cornford writes, “are still operative in our own speculation, for the simplereason that they correspond to two permanent needs of human nature, andcharacterize two familiar types of human temperament” (my italics). This seemsto be another expression of the fundamental duality of human consciousness.35[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber143] The other school of early philosophy wasrepresented by Pythagoras, and there is reason to believe that, aware that theolder form of consciousness was on its way out—although he did not think interms of “forms of consciousness”—Pythagoras tried to salvage what he could ofit, and embodied this in his teaching.36 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber144]PLATOProbably the most important figure in western philosophy who was initiated intothe Mysteries is Plato, who speaks of them in the Phaedo, his dialogue on theimmortality of the soul. Plato’s importance to the western intellectualtradition was summed up by the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, who said thatall subsequent philosophy was only a footnote to him.37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber145] Plato inherited much from Pythagoras, and inhim the “two traditions” and “permanent needs” of human nature and thoughtachieved a remarkable if temporary synthesis. If there is a single mostimportant secret teacher, we would not be far wrong in bestowing that title onPlato. As the historian of esotericism Wouter J. Hanegraaff argues, practicallyall of western esotericism has its roots in Platonism.38[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber146]We do not know much about Plato’s life. He was born to an aristocratic Athenianfamily in 427 B.C. and he died, at the age of eighty or eighty-one, in 347 B.C.It is said that he was called Plato because of his broad physique, although,like much else said about him, this might be just a legend. Plato’s family hadpolitical connections in high places and it is thought he saw military servicein his youth. Like most young men of his class, he was widely read and tutoredin music and mathematics, and he was also educated in the philosophy ofPythagoras and Parmenides, and most likely the Sophists, lecturers in rhetoricand argument, who sold their knowledge for a price. The most importantexperience of Plato’s life was his meeting with the philosopher Socrates, whoappears as a central figure in the early Platonic dialogues; Socrates took upphilosophical arms against the Sophists, whom he perceived as intellectualopportunists, lacking integrity.We know little of Socrates’ life aside from his depiction in Plato’s dialogues;other sources, such as Plato’s student Xenophon and the playwright Aristophanes,are secondhand and fragmentary. Like Christ, Socrates taught orally, and alsolike Christ, we are dependent on the reports of his followers for what we knowof him. As some have pointed out, there is scant factual evidence for Christ’shistorical existence and only a little more for Socrates’.39[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber147] Socrates’ intelligence, intellectual honesty,disdain for honors or riches, and resolute pursuit of the good, true, andbeautiful, impressed Plato, as did his concern with ethical and moral questions,as opposed to the more naturalistic ones of the pre-Socratics. For Plato,Socrates embodied the philosophical life, and it was his execution at the handsof the Athenian state on the charge of corrupting Athenian youth that turnedPlato away from politics.After Socrates’ death in 399 B.C., Plato left Athens and for many years traveledaround the Mediterranean studying mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, andreligion with Pythagoreans in Italy and with the priests of Egypt. It was aroundthis time that he began writing. Although known as a philosopher, Plato alsowrote poetry, and his dialogues themselves, written in a vivid dramatic style,have a literary genius uncommon among philosophers. In 385 B.C. Plato opened hisAcademy, where budding lovers of wisdom studied mathematics, astronomy, naturalscience, and philosophy. The Academy was set in a grove sacred to the goddessAthena, and tradition says that over the entrance were the words “Let no oneignorant of geometry enter,” an admonition that may have given quite a few laterphilosophers pause; Nietzsche, for example, was famously bad at math. Plato’saim in founding the Academy was to stop the disintegration of Greek culture andto prepare Greek citizens to take positions in politics and government, a steptoward actualizing his belief, voiced in the Republic, that philosophers shouldbe kings, or kings, philosophers.As in the Pythagorean school, Plato’s students participated in communalactivities and dedicated themselves to living the philosophical life. As OwenBarfield told C. S. Lewis, philosophy was not an academic subject for Plato, itwas a “way.”40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber148] Plato’s Academy remained openin different forms until the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I shut it down in 529A.D. Justinian feared that the pagan philosophy it taught was a threat toChristianity, and his closure of the Academy is generally seen as the end ofAntiquity.Plato’s ideas about philosopher kings hit a wall when he tried to put them inpractice. In 367 B.C. Plato was invited to become the personal tutor ofDionysius II, the ruler of Syracuse in Sicily. Dionysius II, however, did notmake the grade and, being paranoid—as most rulers are—he suspected Plato ofplotting against him and placed him under arrest. Eventually Plato was releasedand he returned to Athens and the Academy, where he found a new student,Aristotle, who would have his own turn at creating a philosopher king when hebecame tutor to Alexander the Great. Plato spent his last years writing,crystallizing the insights of a lifetime devoted to philosophical inquiry. It issaid that he died peacefully in his sleep, although other accounts say he passedaway while attending a wedding.THE IMMORTAL SOULIn the Phaedo, a record of Socrates’ last words, Plato examines different ideasabout the afterlife and the immortality of the soul. In the end Socratessuggests that the soul is immortal because it can have knowledge of and a sharein the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, which are eternal. Because we canparticipate in these timeless values, there must be some part of us that istimeless too. Only like can know like, Socrates tells Phaedo, his student.Socrates has spent his life pursuing an understanding of the essence of thesethings, the indispensable quality that makes them what they are, much to thedismay of the people who have been on the receiving end of his inquiries.Socrates called himself a “gadfly,” who “stung” his listeners out of theircomplacency with his unending questions, rather as Gurdjieff was known as the“arch-disturber of sleep” who remorselessly “stepped on people’s corns,” thatis, their self-love and vanity. In Socrates’ case, the corns were ignorance andself-importance.The Euthyphro gives an example of Socrates’ often numbing pursuit of hisessences—in this case, of piety.41 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber149] He neverarrives at an explicit definition of these fundamentals and, given what we knowof them, as I point out in the Introduction, we can understand why. But he doesarrive at an understanding of them: that they are timeless and exist in some waybeyond the physical world and that his soul participates in them because he hassought them through his pursuit of knowledge. Convinced of the truth of this andfortified by his experience of the Mysteries, Socrates asks his friends not tomourn his death nor to weep at it, but to recognize that it is only his physicalbody that will die, not his soul. It is being released from a long bondage; asW. B. Yeats said centuries later, we are “fastened to a dying animal.”42[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber150] Socrates’ bonds are loosening. His last wordsare “we ought to offer a cock to Asclepius.” Asclepius was the Greek god ofmedicine, and sacrificing a cock to him was done in thanks for recovering froman illness. Socrates sees life as an illness, and his death is the restorationof health: his return to the timeless realm of the soul.THE FORMSPlato too believed that philosophy was a preparation for death in the sense thatthe true philosopher does as much as possible to separate his mind or soul fromhis body during life, something we know that Pythagoras and the Orphics werealso interested in doing. This does not mean practicing asceticism or embracinga kind of romantic death-worship; but it does mean being moderate in sensualpleasure and indifferent toward riches and honors. It also means making cleardistinctions between what we can know in an absolute or “pure” sense and what ofour knowledge varies.43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber151] True knowledge, truewisdom, cannot come from the senses, Plato argues, because the perception ofthings they provide is unstable and shifting and often deceptive.This seems to fly in the face of science, but a moment’s thought shows this istrue. We see the sun come up and go down, but we know it does neither, and thatthe perception that it does is really a result of the Earth’s rotation. Wecertainly do not see that the Earth is round—at least we did not until theadvent of space exploration—but we know it is, and that knowledge was arrived atthrough reason. If you take a pencil and put it halfway into a glass of water,it appears to bend, something ancient sailors noticed when they put their oarsinto the water. We know the pencil and the oars do not bend, but they appear to.This does not mean that the kind of knowledge provided by the senses is wrong orillusory in some fundamental way, but that it is relative. Under certainconditions, certain observations can be made, and certain deductions derivedfrom them.Aristotle, Plato’s student, will take argument with his teacher and begin theappreciation of empirical knowledge, knowledge accrued by observation, that isthe basis of science. His ideas will dominate the western mind for centuries. Wehave got into the habit of thinking that science provides us with the mostaccurate or “true” knowledge because of its phenomenal success in its practicalapplication. But Plato was not interested in observing nature or in thepractical application of knowledge but in grasping the kinds of “essences”Socrates was after, and that is a good distinction between science andphilosophy. We are back again with the pursuit of George Steiner’s “sovereignlyuseless.” Philosophy is not “good” for anything—a reflection mostnonphilosophers will agree with—but its pursuit enriches our lives. It has noutilitarian value but is a good in itself.44 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber152]In the Phaedo, Socrates speaks of “absolute beauty” and “absolute goodness.” Hewas not speaking of the “most beautiful thing” but of that which gives beautifulthings their beauty, and of that which gives good things their goodness.Socrates’ friends agree that such absolutes exist, and he asks them how theyknow this. Have they ever seen absolute goodness or beauty, and not only good orbeautiful things? They agree that they have not, and Socrates suggests that thebest approach to grasping these absolutes is not through the senses but throughthe “unaided intellect,” that takes no account of sight, sound, touch, or anyother sensory means. It is not the body or senses that know in this way, but thesoul, the mind.Plato took Socrates’ essences and absolutes and with them developed his theoryof the Forms, or Ideas. It is his most important contribution to westernconsciousness and it had a profound influence on western esotericism and thoughtin general. Its truth or value has been debated practically since Plato firstpresented it; in the Parmenides, he himself subjects it to some of the harshestcriticism it has received. Like all good philosophers, Plato does not shy fromquestioning his own ideas. Put simply, Plato believed that the Forms were thefundamental blueprints of reality. Just as a carpenter must have an idea of achair before he can make an actual chair, or an artist an idea of what he wantsto paint before he makes his painting, so too for all of reality. Beautifulthings are related to each other because they all participate in the Form orIdea of Beauty, which exists in a nonphysical realm outside the physical world,just as the carpenter’s or artist’s idea exists in their minds.To speak of a nonphysical realm being “outside” is, of course, confusing, but weare saddled with a language geared toward dealing with the physical world andmust make the best of it. We never see Beauty, but only things that participateit in.45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber153] A sunset, a flower, a painting, andyour girlfriend are all beautiful because they in some way reflect the “essenceof the beautiful.” We can’t observe this essence as we can observe the thingsthat participate in it, but through the mind we can grasp the necessity for it,and insofar as we do, we share in it. So through philosophy, the love andpursuit of wisdom, we can awaken that part of us that exists outside the senses,outside the body, and enter the timeless realm of the Forms.Plato believed that the physical world, the world of the senses, was a copy orreflection of the “real” world of the Forms, and he believed that as long as weremain limited to what the senses tell us, we are not in true contact withreality. Socrates’ dialectic is a rigorously logical method of criticalinvestigation, and hence embodies the new “mental” left-brain structure ofconsciousness; but when Plato wanted to propose a positive insight, he turned tomyth. As Whitehead said, “The father of philosophy, in one of his many moods ofthought, laid down the axiom that the deeper truths must be adumbrated bymyths.”46 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber154] In this way, Plato catered to our“permanent need” for something more than logic.In a famous myth in The Republic, Plato tells us that we are like prisoners in acave who are forced to sit and look at a wall. We are not allowed to turnaround, so we do not see that behind us our captors have devised an interestingway to keep us occupied. They have a bright, roaring fire going, and before itthey use puppets of different shapes and sizes to create shadows that appear onthe wall. As they parade these objects in front of the fire, we see thesilhouettes they cast. As they are all we can see, we sit entranced and watchthe show, which we take for reality, and some of us even devise theories toaccount for the sequence in which the shadows appear. It would be the same as ifwe were somehow locked in place in a movie theater and made to look at what wason the screen, with no knowledge of how the images got there.47[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber155]Every now and then, however, a prisoner manages to turn around. He sees the fireand the people carrying the puppets and he realizes that what he had beenlooking at all his life was not reality, but only a shadow of it. Our prisonermanages to escape his bonds and he makes a dash for the exit from the cave.Outside he sees the trees, clouds, sky, and sun and is dazzled by his firstglimpse of Reality: he no longer sees shadows, but the real things responsiblefor them. Delighted with his discovery, and wanting to share it with his fellowprisoners and help them escape, he returns to the cave to tell them. But theyare so used to seeing shadows that they don’t believe his story. They say he ismad, wrong, or simply telling lies, and angrily turn their heads back to thewall. Saddened by their disbelief and mockery, he leaves them to their chains.Such, Plato says, is the fate of the philosopher.A PORTABLE TOMBPlato’s cave is the body and the limitations of the senses, but anothersubterranean metaphor he uses to depict the human condition is perhaps morestriking. In the Cratylus, a dialogue about the origin of language, Socratesmakes a play on words that has a deep philosophical import. The joke isn’tapparent in English, but in ancient Greek it works. Socrates says that accordingto the Orphics, the body, or soma, is the tomb, or sema, of the soul, which is“buried” in our present life.48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber156] As theHermetic writings will later say, the body is our “portable tomb.”49[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber157] As in the myth of the cave, the body here is aprison. For most of us, our release from this incarceration will only come withdeath. But for some there is a way for the soul to escape its prison, or atleast to be let out of it every now and then, before that final release. Andaccording to tradition, there is a good chance that Plato may have learned ofthis way in Egypt.In The Quest for Hermes Trismegistus, I write about the work of Jeremy Naydler.In his short book Plato, Shamanism and Ancient Egypt, Naydler argues that thereis good reason to believe that Plato did spend time in Egypt, and that whilethere he was initiated into some of the Egyptian Mysteries. Naydler is not alonein thinking this. Thomas Taylor, the nineteenth-century Platonic scholar who wasthe first to translate all of Plato into English, and whose work influenced suchimportant figures as William Blake and Ralph Waldo Emerson—and who deserves tobe seen as one of our secret teachers—claimed that Plato was initiated into theGreater Mysteries in an underground chamber beneath the Great Pyramid of Giza.Taylor tells us that the Mysteries “enkindled and brought from its dormantstate” what was already latent in the “Divine Plato,” namely his spiritualknowledge. Plato himself argued that all knowledge is really memory, so Taylor’sremarks make good Platonic sense. Taylor relates that “After three days in theGreat Hall,” Plato was “received by the Hierophant of the Pyramid” and given“the Highest Esoteric Teachings.” According to Taylor, Plato remained with thepyramid for three months, during which time he was prepared to go out into theworld, “to do the work of the Great Order, as Pythagoras and Orpheus had beenbefore him.”50 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber158] One of the esoteric teachingsthat Plato is thought to have learned during his time in Egypt was a method ofseparating the soul—or, as we would say, consciousness—from the body, and thatthis entailed a way of “dying” while in life.As we’ve seen, Socrates believed that philosophy was a preparation for death. Aliteral interpretation of this suggests a kind of world-rejection and pessimism,the kind of anti-life philosophy that Nietzsche suspected in Socrates and Plato.But if that was the case, why shouldn’t the philosopher just commit suicide andget it over with? To “practice dying,” in the way that Naydler suggests Platohad in mind, means something else.PLATONIC SHAMANSNaydler argues that some form of shamanism was involved in ancient Egyptianspiritual practices, and that works like the Egyptian Book of the Dead were notonly funerary texts but were guides on how to separate what the Egyptians calledthe “ba” from the physical body. The myth of Osiris’s dismemberment at the handsof his evil brother, Set, is paralleled, Naydler argues, by dismemberment motifsin shamanic initiation rituals; we have already seen that Peter Kingsley arguesthat much of early Greek philosophy has shamanic roots.51[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber159] Egyptian ideas about the soul are complex andoften confusing, but the ba corresponds roughly to what we mean byconsciousness.52 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber160] The Egyptians depicted the baas a bird with a human head, hovering over the body of the deceased; to moderneyes, these images seem to suggest accounts of “out-of-the-body-experiences,”which suggests that the body in question may not have been dead after all. MostEgyptologists see these images as depictions of the soul leaving the body afterdeath and they believe that this teaching was part of the common Egyptianreligion. Naydler argues that in fact these images are depictions of the baleaving the body while it was still in life, and that the knowledge of how to dothis was reserved for the priests; it was, he maintains, an esoteric knowledge,not divulged to the masses.The Egyptians believed that the ba leaves the body at death, and also in sleepduring our dreams, but Naydler argues that the Egyptian hierophants also knewthat it can be released from the body in states of deep relaxation or trance.For this to happen, Naydler argues, “the central requirement was that thepsycho-physical organism be stilled.” “The ba only comes into its own,” Naydlerwrites, “when the body is inactive and inert.”53[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber161] The kind of physical inactivity Naydler speaksof seems to me to be rather close to the kind of contemplative calm sought afterby the Pythagorean or Platonic philosopher.While the body is active, its noisy demands obscure the ba, but when it isquiet, the ba can be known and felt. In order to experience the ba consciously,while awake and alive, consciousness must be withdrawn from the body andgathered into a unity. The Egyptians believed that consciousness was spread outamong the different parts of the body, or rather that the different parts of thebody had their own kind of consciousness, an idea that, centuries later, P. D.Ouspensky would explore.54 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber162] To experience theba while awake, the consciousness of the rest of the body had to be stilled,while that of the head, where the ba resided, had to be concentrated, as if onewere tightening a fist. This unified consciousness could then separate from thebody and experience the spiritual states associated with dreams and with thejourney of the soul in the afterlife while still awake and alive. In essence,what this means is that our “I” could feel itself to be an independent reality,not dependent on the body or limited by its restrictions. For the ancientEgyptians as well as for the Pythagorean/Platonic philosopher, we “have” a body,but we ourselves are something different from it.Whatever the source of Plato’s ideas, with the rise of his student Aristotle,his philosophy lost its dominant position and the long dialectic between mythand logic—the two “permanent needs of human nature”—in the western mind began.We are still involved in this. Plato may have lost top billing for a time—formany years he certainly shared it with his brightest pupil—but his eclipse wasby no means permanent. And when he reemerged into the spotlight, it was in avery appropriate place: Egypt."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREETHE SECRET GNOSIS[../image/153618.jpg]The School of Athens” by the Renaissance painter Raphael, part of the frescoesdecorating the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, depicts a gathering of some ofthe major figures in classical philosophy. At the center, drawing the viewer’sattention and dominating the scene, are Plato and Aristotle. A barefoot Plato,with gray beard and straggly hair, holds a copy of his Timaeus in his left handwhile with his right he points upward to the heavens. Aristotle, younger andbetter dressed, holds a copy of one of his important works, the NicomacheanEthics, and with his other hand points downward toward the earth. The gesturesare traditionally thought to show the difference in their approach to knowledgeand philosophy: Plato concerned with comprehending the transcendent ideas,Aristotle focused on gathering empirical knowledge about nature. Here, inpictorial form, is the contrast between the universal and the particular overwhich many subsequent philosophers lost much sleep. But what is interesting fromour perspective of looking at the history of western consciousness through thelens of our two brains is that Plato stands on the right, while Aristotle is onthe left.1 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber163] With Aristotle, the kind of closeattention to empirical data that would slowly mature into our own modern sciencebegan. With this, the move away from myth and more intuitive modes of knowinggained momentum.Aristotle’s impact and influence on western consciousness is as great asPlato’s. Some would say it is even greater. It is no exaggeration to say thatAristotle’s approach to knowledge came to define and dominate the western mind,and did so until only fairly recently. But as far as I can tell, he does notfigure into the esoteric aspect of our story. Indeed, much of esotericphilosophy finds itself in opposition to Aristotelianism. His emphasis on theevidence of the senses, on logic, on the strictures of rational discourse isoften at odds with the inner analogical and metaphorical character of much ofesoteric thought, and Aristotle’s dictums provided many walls for esotericthinkers to bang their heads against. Through the long years of the Middle Ages,Aristotle was the Christian philosopher of choice, eventually wedded to thefaith through the efforts of St. Thomas Aquinas. During this time his formerteacher Plato was held in much lower esteem as a dangerous pagan to be avoided.Aristotle was born in 384 B.C. in Stagira, in northern Greece, and came from aprestigious Macedonian family; his father was physician to the Macedonian kingAmyntus III, the grandfather of Alexander the Great. After his father died,Aristotle went to Athens and, at seventeen, joined Plato’s Academy, where heremained for twenty years. With the death of Plato, he left Athens and went toAssus in Anatolia, where a graduate of Plato’s Academy was ruler. Here and alsoon the island of Lesbos—home to the seventh-century B.C. poetess Sappho—hecarried out extensive research in zoology and marine biology, practicallyinventing the disciplines. Where mathematics was central to Plato’s philosophy,Aristotle focused on biology, the shifting forms of life in contrast to theeternal verities of geometry. Aristotle was not interested in the“supersensible” Ideas, but in how something becomes what it is, what he calledits inherent “entelechy,” or “goal”—how each substance actualized its innerpotential. Aristotle’s approach was systematic and aimed at a workableclassification of phenomena; his writings cover an extraordinary range ofsubjects, everything from botany, chemistry, and ethics, to poetics, politics,and psychology. He is in fact the first systematic thinker and his methods arestill at the root of the western educational system. This shows his differencefrom Plato, who never devised a system and whose dramatic dialogues move fromtopic to topic. Plato is also a much better writer and we can say that, withAristotle, the tradition of unreadable philosophers begins.While he was Plato’s student, Aristotle paid lip service to the Forms, but hewas really out of sympathy with Plato’s ideas and soon abandoned them, arguingthat they had failed to account for how the particulars that shared in thetranscendent universals appeared in the first place. Rather than focus on whatseemed to him vague notions of unearthly forms, Aristotle set his sights firmlyon the phenomenal world. Thus began the “bifurcation” in western thought—to useAlfred North Whitehead’s term—that has run like a fissure through it ever since.THE LYCEUMIn 343 B.C. Aristotle was summoned back to Macedonia by Philip II, who wantedhim to tutor his thirteen-year-old son, Alexander. Later, while on hiscampaigns, Alexander sent biological and botanical specimens back to Aristotle,who had returned to Athens to start his own school. At his Lyceum, which hefounded in 335 B.C., Aristotle built up a huge “research library” and taught hisstudents his methods of classification, the necessity of systematizingknowledge, and the rigors of formal logic. The students who gathered aroundAristotle became known as the “Peripatetics,” because he often taught whilewalking.There were some differences between Aristotle’s Lyceum and Plato’s Academy. Inthe Lyceum, the emphasis was on “scientific research and data collection,” whichmade it very different from a “semireligious philosophical school like Plato’sAcademy.”2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber164] Another difference is that whilePlato’s school was rather like a private club, Aristotle’s Lyceum was open toeveryone—except women. Plato’s Academy was open to women, and for his time Platowas very outspoken about the ability of women to learn philosophy. Anotherdifference was that the dialogical method was downplayed. Aristotle lectured,much as university teaching is done today, and did not engage his students indialogue. His reasoning was that, as they were students, they did not yet knowenough to provide intelligent answers. This is very different from Plato’s ideathat truth emerges through the give-and-take of philosophical exchange, in whichopposing or contrasting views can arrive at a conclusion partaking of both, aform of the “transcendent function.”IS IT LOGICAL?In Plato’s early dialogues, Socrates is central, and the emphasis is on criticalreasoning; but Plato did not set out a systematic formal logic. Aristotledecided to fill this gap. We have all been exposed to Aristotle’s logic in oneform or another. It has become so fundamental to our way of thinking that weaccept it as given, as “natural,” and we find it hard to believe that at onetime it was new and unusual. Essentially, it is a means of avoidingcontradiction in thinking and of making sure our conclusions follow from ourpremise—terms that originate with Aristotle. It is an indispensable tool forthought—an “organon,” as Aristotle’s pupils called it—and it is difficult, ifnot impossible, to conceive of thinking or engaging in philosophical argumentwithout it. We can think of it as a set of traffic signs and signals directingour reasoning. Readers who have taken Philosophy 101 will be familiar with theform of the “syllogism,” which stems from a Greek word meaning “to reason with.”The most famous one runs: “Socrates is a man. All men are mortal. ThereforeSocrates is mortal.” Other similar constructions follow this pattern and readerscan refresh their memory by consulting any handbook of logic, if the thought ofdoing so doesn’t fill them with dread.Fundamental to Aristotle’s logic are the notions of identity andnoncontradiction. Put in its simplest form, this tells us that A is A, that A isnot not-A, and that A is either A or not-A. However we look at it, inAristotelian terms, something either is or it isn’t. There’s no middle ground.This is generally called the “law of noncontradiction” and it is related to the“law of the excluded middle.” This states that something cannot be both true andfalse and must be either one or the other.This is a trait of left-brain thinking, its insistence on an “either/or”approach to knowledge and understanding. This “black-or-white” approach has itsvirtues and we use it every day; life would soon become chaotic without it. Butit is not the only way we can think of things or perceive the world. Earlier wesaw that Schwaller de Lubicz believed that the ancient Egyptians had a more“both/and” approach that was more in line with how Iain McGilchrist argues theright brain interacts with the world. The kind of perception that couldappreciate the “simultaneity of opposite states” informs practically all ofesoteric thought. The esoteric scholar Antoine Faivre includes it in his “fourfundamental elements” of esotericism. Under the heading “Correspondences”—thebelief, central to esoteric thought, that there exist relations “among all partsof the universe, both seen and unseen,” the “network of connections that linkseverything with everything else”—Faivre writes “the principles ofnoncontradiction and excluded middle of linear causality are replaced here bythose of the included middle and synchronicity.”3[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber165] Synchronicity, Jung’s name for the phenomenaof “meaningful coincidence,” tells us that something which in logical termsshould not be meaningful or have any connection to my inner world neverthelessdoes. And the notion of correspondence tells us that something is more thanitself, that it is also a symbol of some higher significance. For Aristotle, asfor Gertrude Stein, a rose is a rose and nothing else. For an esotericist, arose is a rose, but it is also much else.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber166] Andthe “excluded middle” or “tertium non datur”—the “third not given”—is preciselythe result of the “transcendent function,” which produces a “third” alternative,a synthesis of two opposing propositions that “transcends” both of them.PHILOSOPHY IN DIFFICULT TIMESWe can see Aristotle as the end of the first phase of philosophy, its earlycreative stage. After him the seeds of doubt begin to grow, and the world thatphilosophy found itself in changed. After Alexander the Great’s death in 323B.C., squabbles among his generals led to his empire being divided into separatestates. Life became more complicated as wars, migrations, the mixing ofdifferent peoples and cultural beliefs, and other disruptions introduced a senseof uncertainty and instability into things, much as in our own time. The cosmicorder which in earlier times seemed reflected in human affairs was now a distantmemory, as everyday life became increasingly complex, confusing, and oftendangerous. From an attempt to grasp the fundamental realities of existence,philosophy shifted to more ethical and practical concerns, and became more andmore a kind of “self-help” teaching, aimed at survival in difficult times. Itsfocus was on a disengagement with the world and a detachment from one’s ownpassions and intellectual doubts. More than anything else, peace of mind becameits goal.Cynicism, whose name comes from the idea that its practitioners “lived likedogs” (kynikos, the root of “cynic,” is Greek for “doglike”), rejected society’sconventions and advocated a return to “nature.” In practice this meant anancient Greek version of “letting it all hang out” and “getting off the grid,”exemplified by Diogenes of Sinope (404–323 B.C.), who wore rags, barked atpassers-by, ate scraps, and urinated in the marketplace. Diogenes believed thatonly by rejecting society’s norms and listening to the needs and demands of“nature” could one lead a true and good life. He has been depicted as living ina barrel, surrounded by dogs, which he preferred to people, and as holding alofthis lantern by daylight as he searches for an honest man. While Diogenes and hisfollowers believed in virtue, for us being cynical means suspecting the worst ofeverything.Skepticism arose out of the recognition that there was widespread disagreementamong philosophers about practically everything, and that logic and reason couldbe used to support antithetical arguments, something the Sophists had taught.Skeptics doubted the possibility of knowledge—either through reason or thesenses—and advocated “suspending judgment” (acatalepsia) about the truth orfalsity of all propositions. Either side of an argument could be maintained withequal reason; there was no way to choose between them, so one should, in effect,abandon the attempt. This suspension, they claimed, would result in a state ofataraxia, a kind of imperturbable tranquillity or “release from worry,” whichthey maintained was the most desirable state, something that much “mind, body,spirit” literature aims at in our own time.The Epicureans also sought ataraxia. Epicurus (341–270 B.C.) held that the worldconsisted fundamentally of atoms and “the void,” the space in which the atomsmoved. His materialist philosophy sought to free men from their worries aboutthe gods and other superstitions, as well as the fear of death. There was nosoul and at death nothing happened except that the atoms of one’s body returnedto the flux. Like the Cynics, he advised a retreat from the public world, but amuch more decorous one, and taught that one should “cultivate one’s garden.” Oneshould, as he said, “live unknown.” “Epicurean” for us means refined anddelicate tastes, but this is in some ways a misnomer. Although advocating a kindof materialist hedonism, Epicurus really argued for the simple life. Pleasurewas the only good, and one should arrange one’s life to have as much of it aspossible. This did not mean that we should jam as much pleasure into our livesas we can, as if it was an “all you can eat” buffet and we’d be losing out if wedidn’t stuff ourselves. Such gluttony is simply quantitative. Epicurus preacheddiscrimination aimed at providing the highest quality of pleasure.Self-discipline and self-control were central tenets of Epicureanism.The Stoics were much more catholic in their tastes. Where the Epicureans taughtthat one must pick and choose what to attend to in life in order to experiencethe highest degree of pleasure, the Stoics argued that we must put up witheverything life throws at us, whether good or bad. This is because it is allpart of the divine reason or logos, a cosmic unity that is ultimately good andof which we are inescapably a part. Our own sense of “being stoic” and having a“philosophical attitude” toward life stems from this belief. The founder ofStoicism was Zeno of Citium (335–263 B.C.) not to be confused with Zeno of Elea(495–430 B.C.), famous for his paradoxes. The term “stoic” comes from the StoaPoikile or “painted colonnade” where Zeno taught in Athens, competing withPlato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum.The Stoics were materialists and believed, with Heraclitus, that the fundamentalsubstance of reality was fire; they also believed that the cosmos would bedestroyed in some final conflagration but was reborn cyclically. They rejectedPlato’s Forms but believed there was a world-logos, or reason, with which ouractions must be in accord. They also believed that as the world was a unity ofwhich we are a part, all men are inherently brothers and therefore equal. If inour own life this equality was not apparent—many slaves adopted Stoicism—thiswas of no matter. In the end any inequities will be evened out; we should notcomplain about our lot, as it is a necessary part of the world order and thingsare irrevocably fated to be as they are. This order is not apparent to thesenses but can be recognized through logic. The Stoics believed that as one is acitizen of the world, one has a duty to be engaged in political affairs.Stoicism saw no difference between Greek and non-Greek, a “one world” philosophyradical for its time. Like the Epicureans and the Skeptics, Stoics sought a kindof ataraxia, but they saw this more in terms of being free from the passions.They sought to quiet the soul and arrive at apatheia, a freedom from emotions;our “apathy,” which derives from this, is a negative version of what for theStoics was a positive state of emotional calm. Stoicism proved remarkablysuccessful; probably its most famous exponent was the Roman emperor MarcusAurelius (121–180 A.D.), whose Meditations offer guidance on how to maintainapatheia in the midst of conflict.RETURN OF THE MYSTERIESThe “self-help” philosophies that sprang up in the Hellenistic Age provided somerational guidance in an increasingly complex and intimidating world. But formany, these reasonable teachings were not enough, and some sought a more intenseemotional experience—more right brain, we might say—to give meaning to theirlives. By the time of Rome, the ancient Mysteries, accompanied by some newer,exotic ones, became increasingly popular. The established religion—the Romanpantheon, a warmed-over version of the gods of Olympus—no longer commandeddevotion and respect, and increasingly Romans found themselves worshiping atstrange altars. Rome was remarkably tolerant about religion, and as long as aconquered people paid respect to the Roman gods, they could worship their owngods too. But the tables were often turned, and the gods and goddesses of adefeated people quickly made their way to Rome, where they enjoyed conquests oftheir own. Rome became a kind of spiritual marketplace—similar to our owntime—and deities of many lands and peoples found new and fervent followers inthe Eternal City.One of the most popular of the Mysteries was that of Isis, the Egyptian goddessof love, marriage, and the home, but also of the moon and magic, whose namemeans “throne.” She was the sister-consort of the Egyptian resurrection god,Osiris, and the mother of Horus, a warrior god depicted as a hawk or falcon andseen as the protector of Egypt. In many ways, Isis was similar to the Greekgoddess Demeter, and there was a fruitful union of Greek and Egyptian deitiesduring the period of Hellenized Egypt. Isis had been worshiped in Egypt forcenturies; the earliest references to her are from the fifth dynasty, c.2465–2325 B.C., and she is mentioned frequently in the Pyramid Texts, c.2350–2100 B.C., associated with the Egyptian Book of the Dead. With the conquestof Egypt by Alexander and then Rome, her worship spread; as early as the fourthcentury B.C. she was being worshiped in Piraeus, the port of Athens, whichSocrates often frequented. There had always been a strong link between Greeceand Egypt. In the Timaeus, an Egyptian priest tells Solon, one of the SevenSages of Greece, that the Greeks were “only children,” and goes on to inform himabout the lost continent of Atlantis and that Egyptian civilization was eightthousand years old—a dating which puts it in line with Schwaller de Lubicz’sestimate.5 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber167] As Arthur Versluis writes, allthroughout the classic, Hellenistic and Roman age, “Egyptian tradition wasregarded by the Greco-Romans as synonymous with magic and ancient wisdom as wellas divinatory power.”6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber168]Isis was the daughter of the earth god, Geb, and the sky goddess, Nut. Marriedto her brother, Osiris, she taught the Egyptians the arts of the home, weaving,baking, and brewing (the Egyptians were fond of beer). Osiris’s brother, Set,however, grew jealous and murdered Osiris, hiding his body in a leaden coffinwhich he threw into the Nile. Isis eventually found Osiris but Set was sofurious at the discovery that he hacked Osiris’s body to pieces, flinging themto the winds—the shamanic dismemberment motif of which Jeremy Naydler speaks.With some effort, Isis gathered Osiris’s body parts, all except his penis. Withsome help from Thoth, the god of magic, and some improvisation, Isis was able toconceive a child, Horus, by Osiris.Osiris was then obliged to enter the underworld, which, like the Greek Hades, heruled. Horus eventually grew up and avenged his father. As the broken-heartedwidow of Osiris, Isis is often depicted in mourning. Via Delos (Apollo’sisland), Magna Graecia, Herculaneum, and Pompeii—all of which had temples in herhonor—Isis eventually arrived in Rome, where a temple to her and theGreco-Egyptian syncretic god Serapis was erected on the Capitoline Hill duringthe time of Julius Caesar, and where she was worshiped for centuries.Isis was the perfect wife and mother: unobtrusive but ready to take charge whenneeded. She used her magic for healing and is often depicted nursing the babyHorus, an image that later reappeared in Christian iconography as Mary nursingthe baby Jesus. As many women pray to Mary for help and guidance, rather thandirect their prayers to Jesus or God, so too did many call on Isis “the mightymother” for strength and comfort. “Of all the gods of the Mystery religions,”writes Joscelyn Godwin, “perhaps best loved was Isis—loved for her warmhumanity, and for incarnating all the best aspects of women as lover, wife,mother, and widow.”7 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber169]Another mother goddess was somewhat less reassuring. Originating in Phrygia—westcentral Anatolia—Cybele was like Isis in personifying all that was warm andloving in a mother. But she also had a dark, grasping, devouring side thatlikened her to Hecate and the Indian Kali, whose worship included violence,pain, and murder.8 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber170] Known as the Magna Mater orGreat Mother, Cybele was often identified with the Greek Rhea, mother of Zeus,but was more widely worshiped in her Dionysian role as the goddess of dark ritesand orgiastic descent into divine madness. Cybele was first symbolized in ablack stone—most likely a meteorite—that was set as the face of a silver statue.During the Second Punic War, when the Carthaginian Hannibal was advancing onRome, her statesmen consulted the Sibylline Books—a collection of oracles from asibyl, or prophetess, that guided Roman governors throughout the Republic andEmpire—and was told that only if the Great Mother was brought to Rome would ittriumph. Taking no chances, a messenger was sent to the Delphic Oracle for asecond opinion and received the same instruction. In 194 B.C. the blackmeteorite was fetched from Pessinus in Asia Minor, where King Midas was said tohave ruled, and brought to Rome. She was installed in a temple atop the PalatineHill and was worshiped there until her cult was banned by the emperorValentinian II in the fourth century A.D.Cybele’s cult was banned because of the “transgressive” character of herworship. Many of her male followers castrated themselves in memory of her tragicyoung beloved, Attis. There are different versions of the story, but in essenceAttis was a beautiful young man with whom Cybele fell in love—in some versionsshe is his grandmother, indirectly by way of Zeus. But Attis became bethrothedto Midas’s daughter. Cybele was enraged at this and, appearing in her full formbefore Attis, she drove him mad. Attis ran to the mountains and, at the foot ofa pine tree, castrated himself, dying in the process. But through theministrations of Zeus and a satisfied Cybele, he was resurrected; along withOsiris, Dionysus, and Christ, Attis is an archetypal death and resurrectionfigure.Many of Cybele’s followers took Attis’s lead and, as mentioned, castratedthemselves as the Great Mother’s worshipers danced and writhed through thestreets of Rome. Others were less radical, though their self-harming—slashingand cutting themselves into a frenzy—was no less wild. Many dressed in women’sclothes, wore makeup, and greased their long hair. As with Dionysus, with whomCybele is often identified, raucous music, chanting, dancing, drinking, and morelascivious acts made up her worship. As with the Dionysian rites, many foundthis aspect of Cybele’s worship too much. Laws were made to segregate herworshipers, and no Roman citizen was allowed to join in their processions, norto become priests or priestesses in her cult. No Roman could wear thebright-colored clothes or engage in the revelries that made up the Phrygianforms of worship. Eventually her worship was banned, and those who wished tocontinue it were forced to form secret societies and to conduct their servicesin private. In the sixth century, the emperor Justinian had any remainingdevotees tortured and executed, often burying them alive.The ecstatic character of the Great Mother’s worship was shared by other cults,most of which participated in what will strike most of us as rather extravagantrites: the taurobolium, or bull-sacrifice, and criobolium, or ram-sacrifice. Apriest or priestess stood in a deep trench, covered by wooden planks in whichfine holes were cut. The bull was then slaughtered and its blood ran through theholes onto the worshiper who, in some versions, drank it. Initially aimed atensuring the well-being of the emperor, the empire, or one’s community, it laterbecame a ritual of personal renewal—death and resurrection. Its similarity toJewish and Christian practices involving the Paschal Lamb is striking. In thelast days of paganism, the taurobolium was performed in defiance of risingChristianity; the place of the ritual was on a site where St. Peter’s nowstands.One Mystery religion in which a bull played a central role was that of thePersian cult of Mithras, which grew out of Zoroastrianism and which was limitedto men. It spread mostly through the military, forming a kind of RomanFreemasonry. According to Manly P. Hall, Mithraic initiation rites were oftenperformed in underground temples fashioned to look like caves, which theinitiate entered by descending seven steps—representing the ancient planets—andupon whose walls were painted mystic symbols.9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber171]Here the candidate underwent grievous trials, where he was pursued by the wildbeasts and demons of his lower nature. Part of the Mithraic rites involved thetauroctony, or sacrifice of a bull, in which Mithras, the intercessor betweenman and the gods, stabs the animal with a sword while turning his face towardthe sun. Mithras was extremely popular in the Roman world and his cult spreadfrom Syria to Scotland, mostly among soldiers but, like Stoicism, also amongslaves. As in modern Freemasonry, there were no social distinctions: rich orpoor could be initiated; and also like Freemasonry, initiates were bound bysecrecy. As more than one historian of the Mysteries has noted, there areseveral similarities between the Mithras cult and another that was to becomemuch more successful: that of Jesus Christ. Mithras was a savior god whointerceded on man’s behalf with the Persian god Ahura Mazda. He was born on thetwenty-fifth of December and his birth was witnessed by shepherds. He wasconsidered a manifestation of the Logos—the mind or divine intelligence behindthe cosmos. He will return at the end of the world to judge mankind, and after alast battle with, and victory over, evil—Ahura Mazda’s archenemy, Ahriman—hewill lead the faithful to life eternal.SOOTHSAYERS AND WONDERWORKERSThis time was also one in which prophecies, predictions, visions, and othermeans of gaining supernatural knowledge became increasingly popular. If, as theSkeptics believed, reason was no sure road to secure knowledge, other ways wereavailable and the Romans, like other ancient peoples, made use of them. Prophecyby a variety of methods was commonplace. Probably the most popular was by meansof reading an animal’s entrails. The unfortunate creature—most often a bird—wassliced open and its intestines scrutinized for some indication of the gods’intentions, much as in less brutal times a gypsy fortune-teller or grandmotherlyspiritualist would consult your tea leaves. Although this gory method was verypopular, as indeed was animal sacrifice in general, less gruesome means werealso available. Yet the fact that people resorted to such crude expedientssuggests how far consciousness had shifted from its earlier intuitive,participatory mode. What may have come naturally at an earlier time now neededto be extracted through extreme methods. Some part of our earlier consciousness,however, still remained. Sibyls, women prophets who, while in some altered stateof consciousness would communicate obscure and often incomprehensible oracles,were respected as divine messengers of the gods and many would make the journeyto seek their pronouncements; we have seen how important the Sibylline Bookswere and how they were responsible for the Great Mother coming to Rome.In second century A.D. a Roman family known as the Juliani conducted what todaywould be considered a form of spiritualism or “channeling.” It was a kind offather-and-son act. The elder Juliani would practice theurgy, magical ritualsaimed at contacting the gods, and through these rites put his son into a trance.While in this state, the boy would answer questions and utter strange sayingswhose source was believed to be divine. The Juliani called themselves, or wereconsidered to be, “Chaldeans,” an ancient name for the Babylonians, much astoday some modern forms of spiritual teaching attach the term “Egyptian” tothemselves, in order to profit from the pedigree. Most of what the Julianicommunicated is lost, but some of their sayings were recorded; these fragmentscame to be known as, or at least associated with, the Chaldean Oracles. Modernscholarship suggests that the Oracles are a commentary on an original “mysterypoem”—something, perhaps, like the philosophical poems of Parmenides andEmpedocles—that is lost but which was considered to be of Chaldean or Babylonianorigin. The Chaldean Oracles were later attributed to the Persian sageZoroaster, and as such, they were influential on the development of westernesotericism. When Gemistos Plethon lectured Cosimo de’ Medici on the priscatheologia, he saw Zoroaster as the initiator of the Golden Chain of Adepts, andthe Oracles as the fount of the ancient wisdom.Whatever the source of the Oracles—and the nineteenth-century Platonist ThomasTaylor believed that at least some of them did originate with Zoroaster—thevisionary teachings they pronounce are in keeping with the philosophy we have sofar recognized in the ancient Egyptians, Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato: thatthe human soul and spirit are not irrevocably linked to the body, and throughcertain practices they can regain their heavenly inheritance.Magic and sorcery were also very popular, and tales of miracles, magical feats,and dark spells captured the ancient imagination just as they do today. Lovepotions, poisons, spells to gain power, riches, influence, or to discover hiddentreasures, become invisible, heal, cause harm, or become immortal: these andother similar perennial human desires sent many to seek audience with those whoknew the ways of fulfilling them. As today, many of the individuals offeringtheir sorcerous services at a price were mostly adept at parting a fool from hismoney. There were some, however, who seemed to have exhibited genuinelyremarkable abilities. One such was the magician, philosopher, and wonderworker,Apollonius of Tyana.APOLLONIUS OF TYANAThere is little definite factual knowledge of Apollonius. Most recentscholarship places him c. 15–100 A.D. He was born in Cappadocia in Asia Minor(again, modern Turkey) to a prestigious Greek family, and most of what has comedown to us about him can be found in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written bythe philosopher Philostratus, most likely between 220 and 230 A.D.Philostratus’s biography, commissioned by Julia Domna of Syria, second wife ofthe Roman emperor Septimus Severus, is supposed to be based on a diary kept by acompanion of Apollonius, Damis, but there is debate over whether Damis existedor not. As with Pythagoras, it is difficult to sift fact from fiction, and ingeneral we need several grains of salt when looking into Apollonius’s biography.Apollonius appears to have been a Pythagorean and to have shared in thePythagorean revival that began around the first century B.C. He was a wanderingphilosopher-magician and is said to have traveled to India, Egypt, Syria,Greece, and Rome, and to have had run-ins with at least two emperors, Nero andDomitian. He was vegetarian, avoided wine, wore his hair long, did not shave,dressed only in linen, condemned animal sacrifice, and at the age of twenty tooka five-year vow of silence. He is said to have written many books, none of whichhas survived, but fragments of his writing appear in later philosophers,although whether these are actually by Apollonius is still anyone’s guess. ToArab alchemists, Apollonius was known as Balinus; in the Middle Ages, aninth-century Arabic version of the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, themost famous alchemical text, found in a work called The Secret of Creation, waserroneously attributed to him.As in the story of Pythagoras, Apollonius traveled in search of knowledge. Hestudied with the Persian magi, Egyptian hierophants, India fakirs, and Greekphilosophers. Like Orpheus, he sought to reform the cults he encountered and hewas initiated into the Mysteries of Eleusis. In this Apollonius seems much likeother philosophers and sages of the time, but he stands out among them becauseof the many reports of his miraculous or paranormal powers. He was reported toheal, to have “second sight,” to be able to transport himself to faraway places,and to predict the future. On one occasion Apollonius passed some men on theirway to execution. He insisted that the confession of one of them had beenobtained under torture and he compelled the guards to put him last in the lineas he said that a reprieve would come for him. The guards did and a reprieve didcome. On another occasion, while in Ephesus, where he taught for some time,Apollonius stopped in his tracks and cried, “Strike the tyrant, strike!” thenstood staring at the ground before him. Those around him were astounded andbelieved he had gone mad, but then Apollonius informed them that at that verymoment the emperor Domitian, who held Rome in a reign of terror, had beenmurdered. Soon after, messengers from Rome arrived and corroborated Apollonius’saccount.Some other stories of Apollonius’s powers are perhaps less believable, such asaccounts of him raising people from the dead, and the tale of “the vampire ofCorinth” sounds too good to be true. At a wedding banquet for his friend andstudent Menippus, Apollonius noticed something strange about the bride-to-be.Watching her closely, Apollonius realized she was really a lamia, a kind ofvampire, and he urged his friend to abandon the wedding and leave the banquet.Menippus, however, was too entranced with his betrothed’s beauty, and soApollonius used his magic to defeat her spell. Suddenly all the guests, finedecorations, and marvelous food disappeared, and what remained was the monstrousfigure of the would-be bride. (The poet Keats used this tale as the model forhis poem “The Lamia.”) This and other tales, such as Apollonius’s descent intothe underworld and that he was the son of Proteus, an ancient Greek sea-god whocould change his shape, sound just a bit too pat; the lamia encounter is mostlikely a cautionary tale about excess of material comfort. But Apollonius wasmost likely a real Pythagorean philosopher blessed with natural paranormalpowers—or cursed, as he suffered throughout his life the calumny to which mostmagicians are subject. As Colin Wilson writes, Apollonius was most likely “aphilosopher, a natural medium, and something of a seer.”10[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber172]JESUS CHRIST, THE SECRET TEACHERWas Apollonius a secret teacher? The fact that he is no longer well-knownwhereas he was once one of the most famous sages of antiquity—memorials in hishonor dotted Asia Minor—suggests he was. But what about his better-knowncontemporary? There are many similarities between the life of Apollonius andthat of Jesus. Both their births were foretold by a supernatural being and bothwere miraculous. Both were precocious youths who left home and became itinerantpreachers. Both urged people to devote their lives to the spirit, not materialthings. Both gathered disciples who believed in their divinity. Both performedmiracles: healing, raising the dead, casting out spirits. Both aroused strongopposition, were arrested and condemned. (An enemy of Apollonius, Euphrates,accused him of plotting against Domitian and of sacrificing a young boy toscrutinize his entrails for portents of Domitian’s downfall; Apolloniuspresented himself voluntarily at Domitian’s court and refuted the chargesmagisterially.) Both returned to life after death, appeared before theirdisciples, and were eventually raised up to heaven. And both had later followerswho wrote books about them. During the rise of Christian antipaganism in thethird century A.D., Apollonius was held up as a kind of pagan Christ, and thereis some speculation that Philostratus’s biography was written as a kind ofpropaganda to show that the pagans had their own miracle worker and spiritualteacher and that the Christians had not cornered the market. To counter theseclaims, in the fourth century the Christian historian and polemicist Eusebiusargued that Apollonius was a fraud, or worse, the Anti-Christ, and that anymagical powers he had came from the devil.There are also indications that the life of Jesus was in many ways similar tothose of other “death and rebirth” gods. I’ve already mentioned the similaritiesbetween Jesus and Mithras. In The Jesus Mysteries, Timothy Freke and Peter Gandyargue that Jesus was not a real individual but a composite figure made up ofelements of the “godman” myths prevalent at the time, those of Osiris, Dionysus,Attis, and other “resurrection” gods.11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber173] Frekeand Gandy argue that elements of the Jesus story such as the virgin birth, beinga “god made flesh,” being born in humble surroundings, offering the opportunityof being “born again,” descending into hell, and the idea of a return andjudgment on the “last day” can all be found in the myths of Osiris, Dionysus,and other “godmen.”12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber174] Freke and Gandy arguethat the Jesus myth was a symbolic Mystery teaching devised by Hellenized Jewsand that, like the Greek Mysteries, it originally included an outer and innerinitiation. At some point, some Jews stopped at only the outer initiation andtook the story of Christ’s crucifixion literally, not symbolically, and theirteachings became orthodox or historical Christianity. Those who understood thatthe true Christian message could be received only after the inner initiationbecame known as Gnostics and were eventually wiped out.Possibly more books have been written about Jesus Christ than any otherindividual. As mentioned earlier, most biblical scholars agree that there islittle corroborative evidence about his historical reality. What evidence we dohave is documentary, based on written accounts, not archaeological, i.e., nophysical traces of Jesus’s existence have come to light, at least so far.Although most scholars accept that he was a real person, there is littleconsensus about the facts of his life or his teaching, and attempts to draw anaccurate portrait of the “historical Jesus” have proved frustrating. Practicallyeverything we know about him comes from the Gospels, which were written wellafter his death and most likely not by his apostles, although there arereferences to a Jew named Jesus in the Jewish historian Josephus and in theRoman historian Tacitus. The significance of these references, however, is alsoconsidered debatable. It is a delicate and controversial matter. It has beenargued over the years that, among other things, Jesus didn’t die on the cross,but escaped to raise a family, and that he was not a human being but amushroom.13 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber175] In one sense, whether or not Jesusexisted is irrelevant. It is clear to most devotees of the western esoterictradition today that Hermes Trismegistus was not a real individual, but this hasnot prevented them from taking Hermeticism seriously. That Jesus may not haveexisted does not mean that we should not love our enemies.A SECRET CHRISTIANITY?Seeing Jesus as a secret teacher means that the Christianity that has come downto us and remains a powerful presence in the western world is not the sameteaching that esotericists believe Christ himself taught, or that the Jesus mythembodied. This should not really shock us; the philosophy that Plato taught isnot the same philosophy that one finds in universities today. This includesCatholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and Protestantism, as well as the othermajor tributaries of the central Christian stream. There does seem to be textualevidence for this, of the kind that scholars recognize. In 1958, while examiningmanuscripts at Mar Saba, an Eastern Orthodox monastery near Jerusalem, thehistorian Morton Smith came upon what appeared to be a remarkable discovery.Paging through an ancient tome, Smith chanced upon a hand-copied letterpurporting to be from the early church father Clement of Alexandria (c. 150–215)to one Theodore. Clement was one of the earliest and most respected of thechurch fathers and no letters of his were thought to have survived, so to comeacross one was exciting. But what his letter said was even more spectacular. Itspoke of a “secret gospel” attributed to Mark, which he wrote in Alexandria, inaddition to the canonical Gospel of Mark. This secret gospel, the letterrevealed, was “for the use of those being perfected,” in order to “lead thehearers into the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by the seven[veils].”14 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber176] The letter quotes a story fromthis secret gospel, telling of a young man who, like Lazarus, was raised fromthe dead. Wearing “a linen cloth over his naked body,” he meets Jesus, who staysup the night with him, teaching him “the mystery of the kingdom of God.”Tantalizingly, Smith did not discover exactly what this “mystery” was, as theletter broke off in midparagraph.Smith spent many years researching the letter and came to the conclusion that itwas authentic, although the copy he came upon was made in the eighteenthcentury. He was especially impressed by the fact that the tale of the young manfit perfectly into the canonical Gospel of Mark, and this led Smith to concludethat the passage was originally a part of Mark’s Gospel but was later taken outand reserved for those who had been initiated into Christ’s inner teaching. Thatthe young man wore only a linen cloth suggested the passage depicted aninitiation, as that was traditionally what was worn while undergoing one. Smithbelieved that there were also other teachings not included in the “secretgospel,” which Jesus imparted to his disciples orally.As Richard Smoley writes in Inner Christianity, “That the Christian faith mayoriginally have been closer to an occult lodge or a secret society than to areligion should not come as a complete surprise.”15[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber177] As Smoley points out, secrecy is a commontheme in the Gospels. Jesus speaks in parables, which conceal his meaning asmuch as they convey it, a characteristic of much esoteric communication. When heheals people, he asks that they do not speak of it. Nicodemus’s nocturnal visitto Jesus, depicted in the Gospel of John, may, Smoley suggests, be seen asanother account of an initiation.The rise of critical biblical scholarship in the nineteenth century, with itsrationalist assumptions, chipped away at the great edifice of Christianity. Butthe scholarly and scientific blows it inflicted could be absorbed and the faithmaintained. Smith’s discovery was different. It did not undermine Christianityscientifically, by showing, say, that the Bible could not be read as history, asit had been for centuries. Smith’s discovery, if it was one—controversy aboutits authenticity remains, as about practically all scholarship that challengesthe received wisdom about church history—showed that our ideas aboutChristianity, what it is really about, may need revising.Smith’s was not the only discovery that suggested this. Fragments of anapocryphal text written in Greek, known as the Gospel of Thomas, had been knownsince the late nineteenth century, but in 1945 the full text in a Coptictranslation appeared. It was part of a collection of fifty-two ancient writingsfrom the early days of Christianity discovered in Nag Hammadi in Egypt, andwhich have come to be known as the “Gnostic Gospels.” The texts were used bythose early Christians that Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy believed underwent theinner initiation mentioned above and achieved gnosis, which, they argue, was thetrue aim of Christ’s teaching. The Gospel of Thomas reads much more like acollection of sayings than a narrative, and its simplicity suggests that it maybe older and hence closer to Jesus’s own time than the canonical Gospels.16[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber178] But even more than its age, what the Gospel ofThomas actually says is remarkable. From the start it identifies itself as a“secret gospel.” The Dutch historian and theologian Gilles Quispel studied thetext and, as Elaine Pagels writes in The Gnostic Gospels, “Quispel was startled,then incredulous to read: ‘These are the secret words which the living Jesusspoke, and which the twin, Judas Thomas, wrote down.’”17[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber179]The mention of Jesus having a twin brother was startling to be sure, but equallyso were the “secret words” Jesus spoke. As Pagels writes, while some of the“secret words” appeared in the New Testament, in this setting they seemedstrange and full of new meaning, while others were “as cryptic and compelling asZen koans.”18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber180] For example: “Split the wood andyou shall find me,” “Lift up a stone and I am there,” “Be passers-by,” “I havecast fire upon the world, and see, I am watching until it blazes,” and“Whosoever finds the meaning of these sayings will not taste death,” whichsounds remarkably like the aim of the Mysteries as well as that of Pythagorasand Plato. One such enigmatic saying ran, “If you bring forth what is withinyou, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what iswithin you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.” This sounds very muchlike good psychotherapeutic advice, and it’s no surprise that C. G. Jung, whohad been studying Gnosticism since the 1920s, was excited by the discovery; in1952, one of the scrolls making up the Nag Hammadi Library—as the collectioncame to be called—was purchased by the Jung Foundation and was named the JungCodex in honor of the man many saw as a kind of modern Gnostic.What was also striking about the Gospel of Thomas is that the picture of Jesusit presents is very different from the traditional one. This Jesus does notforgive sins nor does he perform miracles. He does not claim to be the Messiahor preach the end of the world, all things the traditional Jesus does do. Theteaching he brings is not about salvation, traditional Christianity’s aim, butenlightenment, or gnosis, a knowledge that can transform those who receive it.In the Gospel of Philip, this is made clear: “Ignorance is a slave. Knowledge isfreedom. If we know the truth, we shall find the fruits of truth within us. Ifwe are joined to it, it will bring fulfilment.”19[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber181] Other passages in other Gnostic Gospels alsoportray a Jesus rather different from the one we are familiar with. The Gospelof Philip has Jesus kissing Mary Magdalene on the mouth and thereby offendingthe other disciples; both Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln’s Holy Blood, Holy Grailand and Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code are based on the idea that Jesus and Marywere husband and wife, or at least lovers, and that Jesus didn’t die on thecross but survived and fathered children. Other texts also offer a verydifferent idea of what Christ and the orthodox Bible taught. The Testimony ofTruth portrays the serpent in the Garden of Eden as a gnostic hero, encouragingAdam and Eve to eat of the Tree of Knowledge, and God as a jealous hoarder,guarding his treasure and kicking the couple out of paradise when they disobeyhim. The feminine spirit, for the most part minimized in accepted Christiantradition, is here celebrated; in one strange text, Thunder, Perfect Mind, itspeaks gnomic sayings: “I am the first and the last, the honored one and thescorned one, the whore and the holy one . . . the silence that isincomprehensible, the utterance of my name.”20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber182]THE GNOSTICSWho were the Gnostics? Until the discovery of the Nag Hammadi Library, most ofour knowledge about them came from prejudiced sources, the church fathers whorailed against and condemned them as the first “heretics,” a word that derivesfrom the Greek hairetikos, which means “able to choose.” Heretics are those whochoose something other than the received church dogma. What the Gnostics chosewas gnosis over belief and experience over faith, a choice that is the essenceof esotericism. What Pagels’s The Gnostic Gospels and other recent books aboutprimitive Christianity argue is that there was a struggle in the early yearsover exactly what Christ taught and how that teaching should be spread. Althoughthere is not one “Gnostic teaching” and much difference between the variousGnostic sects that emerged in the first few centuries after Christ, generallyspeaking the Gnostics were those early Christians who believed that Christtaught the way to gnosis, to an immediate, inner experience of spiritual realityand that, through this, everyone potentially could share equally in the divine,could become a “Christ.” The Christians who rejected this idea and whointerpreted Christ’s teachings and the story of his life literally, who believedthat he was the unique “son of God,” that only he could experience spiritualreality firsthand, who accepted the story of the crucifixion as historicallyreal and unique and that Jesus died for our sins, laid the foundations for whatwe know as Christianity. There was a battle between these ideologies in thefirst centuries of the Christian era, Pagels and others tell us, and needless tosay, the Gnostics didn’t win.21 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber183] Oneinteresting possibility, mentioned earlier, is that the Gnostics themselves mayhave predated the “official” Christians. That the Gospel of Thomas may be olderthan the canonical Gospels suggests this, and so it may be the case that theofficial Christians themselves were the real “heretics.”22[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber184]One of the earliest critics of the Gnostics was Justin Martyr (c. 100–162 A.D.),a philosopher who went through Stoicism, Aristotle, Pythagoreanism, and Platobefore converting to Christianity. He became one of its most vocal apologistsuntil he was beheaded in Rome for refusing to sacrifice to the gods. In hisSecond Apology, he condemns Gnostic teachers such as Simon Magus, Valentinus,and Marcion as “wicked and deceitful.”23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber185] Theaccount of Justin’s trial suggests that he took his Christianity very literally;when his accusers told him that if he did not make sacrifice to the gods hewould be tortured without mercy, Justin replied that this was what he and alltrue Christians want, to “be tortured for our lord Jesus Christ and so to besaved.”24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber186] As Jesus was tortured and died ahorrible death before ascending to heaven, the literal Christians believed thatif they suffered the same fate, so too would they go to heaven. Althoughdifferent Gnostic sects had different interpretations of the crucifixion, theygenerally rejected Justin’s somewhat gruesome conviction that the sure way tobecome one with Christ was to meet a gory end.Justin Martyr wasn’t the only early Christian to speak ill of the Gnostics. Forthe church father Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons (c. 130–202 A.D.), Gnostic beliefswere an “abyss of madness” and their gospels “full of blasphemy.” He wasespecially troubled by the Gnostic teacher Basilides of Alexandria (c. 117–138A.D.), because of his casual attitude toward sin and carnal pleasures.25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber187] Hippolytus of Rome (170–235 A.D.) wrote anepic Refutation of All Heresies in which, along with attacking pagan philosophy,he criticized thirty-three Gnostic sects—evidence, as mentioned, that there wasmuch disagreement among the Gnostics themselves. Tertullian of Carthage (160–225A.D.), known as the “founder of Western theology,” castigated the Gnostics forrefusing to believe in the physical reality of Christ’s resurrection. Today,acceptance of the literal truth that Christ rose from the dead and that, at theLast Judgment, true Christians will also emerge from their graves seems limitedto the more fundamental among believers, readers perhaps of the Left Behindseries of apocalyptic fiction. Tertullian made it the linchpin of faith, arguingthat precisely because it was absurd, it must be believed, rather like the “leapof faith” of the father of existentialism, Søren Kierkegaard.This is just a selection of the kind of attacks the “true” Christians launchedagainst the “heretics.” Reams have been written by the defenders of the faith,arguing that the Gnostics were everything from lascivious sensualists to agentsof the devil. What was it that the Gnostics believed that so enraged theirfellow Christians? And why was it so important for them to eradicate theGnostics who, collectively, we can see as secret teachers?As mentioned, there were many different Gnostic sects and no one specific“Gnostic teaching” or authority to which all of them adhered. Gnostic groups didnot organize themselves hierarchically and were on the whole antiauthoritarianand more loose and liberal in their structure than the orthodox Christians. Forone thing, they allowed women much more freedom and power and had no qualmsabout learning gnosis from them. And indeed, so diverse and occasionallycontradictory were Gnostic beliefs that some of their enemies claimed that theywrote a “new gospel every day.”26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber188] This led tothe church fathers seeing in their sometimes daunting collection of beliefs aconfused mess of contradictions, fantasies, and downright lies, a criticism theyhad no hesitation to profit by.The church fathers exaggerated this aspect of Gnostic mythology, to be sure,just as they studiously ignored the contradictions in their “official” dogma—or,as Tertullian did, championed them as tests of faith. Yet anyone who has spentsome time studying the different myths associated with Gnosticism can beforgiven for turning away with a sense of metaphysical dizziness. The Gnosticcosmos is populated with quite a few spiritual entities and it is oftendifficult to keep track of them and their significance. Yet having said this,some basic orientations and attitudes were shared by practically all of theearly Christians who considered themselves Gnostics, or were considered such bythe “official” church.A FALSE WORLDOne central Gnostic theme is that the world we live in, the physical world ofmatter and the senses, is evil, or at least seriously flawed. It is a kind offalse world, a prison of sorts, created not by the “true God,” who is beyond thecosmos—and everything else—but by a “demiurge” or craftsman who subsequentlybecame convinced that he was indeed the true God and fell to lording it over hiscreation. This demiurge—the term is Greek and is what Plato calls the creator ofthe world in the Timaeus—was for the Gnostics associated with Yahweh, the God ofthe Old Testament. As I say in the Introduction, the situation here is rathersimilar to how Iain McGilchrist portrays the relationship between the right andleft brain, with the left brain, the “emissary,” usurping power from its“master,” the right. McGilchrist speaks in terms of psychology and neuroscience;the Gnostics spoke in myth and metaphysics. Yet what each says is very much thesame: our true consciousness and relation to the world has been obscured, and afalse or at least incomplete and inadequate one has been substituted for it.The true God exists in what the Gnostics called “the Pleroma,” a nonmanifestdimension of reality beyond—or before—space and time; as mentioned, it can beseen as something like Jean Gebser’s “Origin,” and it shares its position withother similar nonmanifest spheres of reality such as the En-Sof of Kabbalah, theSunyata of Buddhism, and the Hermetic and Neoplatonic One. The true God is notalone, though; he shares this nonmanifest existence with a feminine divineprinciple called “Ennoia,” which means “thought” in Greek. Unlike the God of theOld Testament who creates the world out of nothing—creatio ex nihilo—the GnosticGod emanates creation out of his (or her) own being, rather as the sun emanateslight and heat.27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber189]The “emanationist” cosmology of Gnosticism is central to esoteric thought andcan be found in other traditions, such as the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, whichportrays a hierarchy of being, beginning with the unmanifest En-Sof anddescending through different levels of decreasing spirituality, the sephiroth or“vessels,” until it reaches the lowest, the physical world of time, space, andmatter. A similar “ladder of being” is central to Neoplatonic and Hermeticcosmology, and it plays a central role in the cosmologies of modern esotericistslike Rudolf Steiner and Gurdjieff.The emanations from the true God are called “aeons,” and one of them is Sophia,which we know means wisdom. Sophia is the youngest of the aeons and hence thefurthest from the true God. In her desire to know the true God, Sophia emanatesa kind of creation of her own, but something goes wrong, and the result is adark mass, a kind of chaos, the “formless and void” state before creation inGenesis. Sophia decides to create a being that can bring order to this void, andhence gives birth to Ialdaboath, who is the demiurge; he is also known as an“archon,” a term that comes from a Greek word meaning “petty official,” a kindof cosmic bureaucrat, punctilious and overzealous in his duties. Essentially,Ialdaboath gets the bit between his teeth and in a flush of hubris, out of thechaos he creates other archons who help him in creating the world of space andtime and everything in it, including humanity, which they will rule.Ialdaboath is quite pleased with himself and, ignoring Sophia’s warnings,declares (much as does the God of the Old Testament) that “There is no other Godbut me,” rather as the left brain refuses to acknowledge the existence or atleast the importance of the right. He is utterly convinced of his supremeimportance and just as utterly ignorant of the true God beyond his materialcosmos; he dismisses anything Sophia has to say about him. And like any clichédoriental despot, Ialdaboath—or Yahweh—rules like a petty tyrant. And so we findourselves here, in a world unimaginably distant from true reality, subject tothe rule of the archons, trapped in some cosmic prison. (Sophia, too, becomestrapped in it, and part of the Gnostic narrative is the search for her in orderto release her from her bondage.)We are, as Heidegger put it, “thrown into the world,” having no idea where wecome from or why we are here, with no sort of Rough Guide to help us find ourway around. It is a gloomy situation, and some interpreters of Gnosticism, likethe philosopher Hans Jonas, have likened its vision to the kind of worldportrayed by the existentialists, devoid of meaning and purpose.28[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber190] Echoes of the Gnostic vision also sound inGurdjieff’s “Fourth Way,” which sees humanity as similarly trapped, locked in akind of cosmic prison.29 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber191] But there is a savinggrace in our predicament. Within us, sunken beneath the constricting layers ofmatter, is a spark of our divine inheritance, some small part of the true God’semanation. Through realizing this, through achieving gnosis, the knowledge ofour true spiritual nature, we can escape from the rule of the archons and ascendthrough the spheres of the false world and return to our source.The Gnostics are those who pursue and achieve this knowledge, and Jesus is thesecret teacher who leads them to it. He is one of the “messengers of light” sentby the true God to lead mankind—or at least some of it—out of the snares of thearchons. Not all of us are up for the task; unlike orthodox Christianity, whichmaintains that salvation is available to all who accept Christ as their savior,the Gnostics were more selective. They characterized people as three kinds:“hylics,” who are sunk deep in gross matter and the flesh and have no concernfor the spirit; “psychics,” who are less carnal but given to accepting thedogmas of traditional religion; and “pneumatics,” who are spiritually awake andwho can achieve and understand gnosis.30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber192]Hylics have no interest in the spirit and psychics are happy to bank on faithand belief, but only pneumatics have a chance of escaping the archons.In recent times this notion of a false world has become very popular, in a widecultural sense, as the success of films such as the Matrix series show. Otherfilms, such as Peter Weir’s The Truman Show, Vincenzo Natali’s Cube, and AlexProyas’s Dark City treat of a similar theme. Gnostic ideas started to revive inthe twentieth century, mostly through the work of Jung, who was himselfinfluenced by the work of the Gnostic scholar G. R. S. Mead, but can also befound in the novels of Hermann Hesse and Thomas Pynchon, as well as in thescience fiction of Philip K. Dick and other writers.By now the term “gnostic” has become rather broad and seems to have blended withthe philosopher Paul Ricoeur’s notion of what he calls “the hermeneutics ofsuspicion,” the belief, prominent in our time, that ideas and philosophiescannot be taken at face value, but must be examined for their “true” or “hidden”motivations. So for Marxists, religion is “really” “the opium of the people,”and for Freudians spirituality is “really” camouflage for “sex.” We may believethat what this amounts to is a “hermeneutics of cynicism.” One sign that we livewithin a “gnostic” milieu is the popularity of a variety of conspiracy theoriesand the sensibility that goes with them: the disturbing feeling that nothing welearn about on the news or from any other “official” source can be believed andthat the true state of things is being kept from us. Those who can unravel thetight skein of falsehoods and red herrings and arrive at the “true” source,whatever that may be, can be seen as modern Gnostics.GNOSTICS AT WORKGnosticism has been accused of promoting a radically pessimisticworld-rejection, a Manichean dualism that has nothing but contempt for thephysical world, including the human body. The Persian prophet Mani (215–277),the founder of Manicheanism, “the religion of light,” drew on Gnostic sources,as well as those of Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Buddhism in his bid tocreate a dualistic world religion based on the eternal battle between darknessand light, or good and evil. Later dualist Christian sects, such as the medievalBogomils and Cathars, seem to share in this Gnostic attitude. But as mentioned,not all Gnostics shared the same beliefs and attitudes, and while some diddespise the physical world and their own bodies, others held less radical views.As Stephan Hoeller, a modern Gnostic teacher, writes, from the Gnosticperspective: “Humans are caught in a predicament consisting of physicalexistence combined with ignorance of their true origins, their essential natureand their ultimate destiny,” and their only hope of escape lies in an attitudeof “nonattachment and nonconformity to the world.”31[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber193] While this is true, how each Gnostic practicedthis was different. Some were able to do this from within the rising orthodoxchurch.Valentinus (c. 100–c. 160 A.D.), whom Hoeller calls “the greatest of Gnosticteachers,” was, according to Tertullian, in the running to be pope.32[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber194] Valentinus was born in Alexandria, but in histhirties he moved to Rome, where it is said he studied with a disciple of St.Paul. He lost his bid to be pope to Pius I in 140, but Valentinus continued toteach, although he is said to have been soon denounced as a heretic. Valentinusis said to have developed the most systematic and complex Gnostic doctrine,blending Greek, Christian, and oriental ideas into a kind of “Gnosticorthodoxy”; sadly, most of his writings have not survived, except for the“Gospel of Truth,” which is part of the Nag Hammadi texts. Yet for many years,his followers considered themselves true Christians and carried on their worshipwithin the church that ultimately condemned them.Basilides of Alexandria, whom we’ve already mentioned and who taught between 117and 138 A.D., also saw himself as a Christian and a theologian. He was said tohave been tutored by a disciple of St. Peter, Glaucias, who he claimed passed onto him a “secret doctrine.” Exactly what Basilides taught is unclear, asaccounts of his teachings by the church fathers Irenaeus and Hippolytus differ.What is clear is that it was a fantastically complicated system involving 365“heavens” ruled over by Abraxas, who was associated with the God of the OldTestament. It was the lower angels of these heavens that created our physicalworld. Basilides taught that Christ did not die on the cross, but was saved fromcrucifixion by Simon of Cyrene, who took his place. While Simon suffered inJesus’s place, the Gnostic Christ laughed at those who took the body seriously.Basilides didn’t take it seriously, but instead of treating it with asceticrigor, he had an attitude of “do what you like,” hence Irenaeus’s anger,mentioned earlier, toward what he saw as Basilides’s profligacy.Carpocrates, who flourished in the second century A.D., took things a bitfurther. He was said to have taught a radically antinomian doctrine, one thatmade a point of flouting the rules. If this world is false, created by asecond-rate god, then there’s no need to follow moral strictures and anythinggoes. Carpocrates’ disciples were said to ingest semen and menstrual blood asholy sacraments—a practice revived in the twentieth century by the antinomianmagician Aleister Crowley, who taught his followers to “do what thou wilt”—andto have included intercourse during their worship.33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber195] Much of the accusations of licentiousness andpromiscuity aimed at Carpocrates and the Gnostics in general were rooted inorthodox propaganda, so we need to take them with much salt. Yet the antinomianstrain in Gnosticism would emerge in different ways throughout the spiritualhistory of the West.The first Gnostic “villain”—from the church’s point of view—was Simon Magus, whoappears in the book of Acts and who was accused of using magic to impress theSamarians with his greatness. He was a contemporary of Jesus and Apollonius, andlike them had a reputation as a wonderworker. He has the distinct honor ofhaving a sin named after him. When he saw Peter and John healing through theHoly Spirit, he offered them money if they would tell him how they did it. Thepractice of trying to buy spiritual things with money was henceforth called“simony.” He was accompanied by a woman who he claimed was an embodiment of thetrue God’s “Thought,” but who was also a reincarnation of Helen of Troy. Heclaimed he had found her working as a prostitute in Tyre, an example of the“reversals” common to Gnostic narratives: the serpent, Cain, Judas, and otherbiblical bad guys are often portrayed as Gnostic heroes. Here the sacred, holyThought of God supported herself as a whore. It is unclear what Simon taught,and in the official accounts he converts to the true faith, although as RichardSmoley suggests, this is probably more propaganda.34[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber196]The greatest threat to the early church was the Gnostic teacher Marcion, who isstill regarded as one of the most dangerous of heresiarchs. Marcion (c. 85–160A.D.) was born in Pontus on the Black Sea and was raised in a Christian family;his father was a priest, possibly a bishop, as well as a ship owner. Marcionfollowed in his father’s footsteps and grew up to become a successfulbusinessman as well as a priest. In 140, he went to Rome, where he madesubstantial donations to the fledgling church. He also tried to make moredoctrinal contributions, attempting to win Christians around to his point ofview. He was unsuccessful, so, like any good entrepreneur, he started his ownchurch. At this he was successful, dangerously so. Many Christians took to hisdoctrine, especially in Syria, where until the fifth century there were largeMarcionist communities. Marcion taught that there were two gods, the God of theLaw, which was the demiurge, and the Good God beyond. He denied that Jesus had areal physical body, a heretical belief that became known as Docetism. The onlyscriptures he accepted were the Sermon on the Mount, some parts of the Gospel ofLuke, as well as the Epistles of St. Paul.Marcion wanted to purge Christianity of its Jewish elements—hence his rejectionof the Old Testament—and we can see his efforts to pare down the faith as thefirst attempt to establish an “official” church canon, something the churchdidn’t do until the Council of Nicaea in 325. By then, Marcionite churches werethriving. Some writers on Gnosticism wonder if Marcion should be considered a“true” Gnostic, as central Gnostic elements such as gnosis, an elaboratemythology, and the divine spark are absent from his teaching. Although tarredwith the Gnostic brush, the absence of gnosis and the Gnostic cosmology in histeachings may be attributed to his determination to purge Christianity of itsJewish roots.THE ROOTS OF GNOSTICISMWhile clearly growing in Christian soil, the roots of Gnosticism spread intodifferent religions and beliefs. The exact debt it owed to these is unclear andmost likely will remain so. Scholars continue to debate over how much Gnosticismreceived from its predecessors and what the medium of transmission was. For ourpurposes, it is enough to give a general idea of the different spiritual sourcesavailable to it at the time. One such was the Jewish wisdom tradition, containedin the book of Proverbs, in the Wisdom of Solomon, and in the apocryphalEcclesiasticus, also known as the Wisdom of Sirach, as well as the better knownEcclesiastes. In these, Wisdom is personified as a woman, much as in the Gnostictradition, and the general atmosphere of these works is pessimistic: that thereis nothing new under the sun would not be out of place among other Gnosticaphorisms. Other Jewish traditions, such as the Merkabah, or “throne mysticism,”would also have been known to the early Gnostics. This tradition, which arosearound the time of the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem (70 A.D.),predated Kabbalah and was based on the vision of Ezekiel, who saw a cloud offire within which was a blazing chariot, surrounded by strange creatures.Through meditating on this vision, aspirants aimed to “ascend” to heaven in thechariot and reach the heavenly throne. This and other forms of “JewishGnosticism,” as the Kabbalah scholar Gershom Scholem called it, were prevalentat the time of early Christianity and most likely contributed significantly tothe makeup of Gnosticism proper.35 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber197]The Gnostics were part of a strange phenomenon of their time, what we can call“the retreat to the desert.” Colin Wilson has called this “the third greatevolutionary step taken by the human race,” after the creation of cities and thereligious and philosophical awakening of the “axial age.”36[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber198] Practically overnight, large numbers of peopleabandoned the cities and made an exodus to the desert, where they establishedcommunities dedicated to “contemplation and knowledge of the infinite” in anattempt to satisfy a craving for some meaning beyond the decadent world.37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber199] One such group was the Essenes, a kind offundamentalist Jewish religious group, who established themselves near the DeadSea and who are thought to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, discoveredin Qumran on the West Bank in 1946. As with so much else from this time, thereis a great deal of debate about exactly who the Essenes were and what theybelieved; one highly controversial matter is whether Jesus and John the Baptistmay have been members of their sect. What does seem clear is that the Essenesfelt that the traditional Jewish faith had broken the covenant with God and thata new one had to be established.Like other sects we have looked at, the Essenes had two levels, what we mightcall full-time and part-time members. Full-time Essenes lived at Qumran andadopted a celibate, ascetic life devoted to ritual and prayer; part-timers couldlive in the city, be married, and carry on a normal routine while dedicatingpart of their life to worship. Like the Gnostics, the Essenes had a dualisticworldview, in which good and evil, truth and falsehood, were engaged in aneternal combat, with the human soul as the battlefield. Like later Christianity,the Essenes were not ethnocentric; anyone of pure heart and soul could be saved,although like the Gnostics they recognized that not everyone was up to the task.Also, like the later Christians, the Essenes shared in the expectation of someapocalypse that would bring an end to the sinful world and the establishment ofrighteousness, a Messianic belief central to the Jewish faith. They spoke of anindividual known only as the Great Teacher; who he may have been has never beendiscovered, which certainly qualifies him as a secret teacher.Another dualist teaching that informed Gnosticism was Zoroastrianism. It remainsunclear exactly when Zoroaster, after whom the religion is named, was born, orif indeed he was one person or several. Current scholarly opinion hasZoroaster’s birthplace as Bactria, in what is now Afghanistan, and his doctrinestook hold most firmly in Persia. Today, Zoroastrians are known as Parsis andworldwide they number fewer than 150,000, the major Parsi communities being inIndia. As mentioned earlier, Zoroaster holds an important place in the HermeticChain of Adepts, equal to if not more important than that of HermesTrismegistus, and he is one of the key figures of the “axial age.” According toone historian, Zoroaster was the first to teach doctrines such as “individualjudgment, heaven and hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general LastJudgment, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body.”38[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber200]All of these doctrines would play an enormous role in the development ofChristianity, Judaism, and Islam. They would also inform Gnosticism, but themost significant Zoroastrian teaching to make its way into Gnostic doctrine wasits dualism. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion within which oppositesplay a central role. There is the one Good God, Ahura Mazda, which means “wiselord,” from whom two forces, a beneficent spirit called Spenta Mainyu and adestructive spirit named Angra Mainyu, emerge. Although in Zoroastrianismcreation is good, evil is a reality, even though it will eventually be defeatedat the end of time. Over the centuries, Ahura Mazda and Spenta Mainyu coalescedinto Ohrmazd, and Angra Mainyu became Ahriman, the original Zoroastrian trinitydownsizing to a duality. Rather than an emanation of the Good God, Ahriman tookon a reality of his own, and came to be seen as equal in stature. Good and evil,or light and darkness, became coeval powers, present from the beginning, andengaged in a titanic war. It was this development of Zoroastrianism that Maniadopted into his “religion of Light.” While recognizing the power of evil,Zoroaster saw the world as essentially good, an assessment that differs from thegenerally pessimistic notions of the Gnostics.We have already mentioned that Platonism was an ingredient in the Gnostic mix.It would difficult for it not to be: Greek thought and Greek ways ofunderstanding the world informed practically all forms of belief at this time.The Gnostics did not escape this, although how they used Greek ideas waspeculiar to themselves; as one scholar remarked, Gnosticism was “a kind ofPlatonism run wild.”39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber201] Nevertheless, theGnostics absorbed much from Plato and Greek philosophy, however they used it:the idea of the demiurge; the soul’s descent from the spiritual world intomatter; the dualism of mind and matter, or spirit and world; the nature of Godand the return to our source. They were not, however, the only denizens of thedesert to borrow much from the Greeks, nor were they the only ones in pursuit ofgnosis. Other spiritual communities at this time sought the kind of direct,incontrovertible spiritual experience that informed Gnosticism. But what theymade of this was something different."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURFROM THE ONE TO THE ONE[../image/153618.jpg]In 331 B.C. Alexander the Great had an idea: he would found a city in his ownname and it would be in Egypt.1 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber202] The locationof this future metropolis—or, to be more exact, cosmopolis, as the denizens ofAlexander’s city would come from all corners of the known world—was soon decidedand Alexander’s surveyors and architects had been sent to the site to beginwork. But then something happened. Alexander, the student of Aristotle, was agreat reader of Homer, and he carried his precious copy of the great poet’s workin a golden casket, which, legend has it, was forever at his side. In theOdyssey, Homer had spoken of Pharos, an “island in the stormy sea off theEgyptian coast,” and this mention of the “only harbor” and “good landing beach”on the whole of the otherwise featureless Egyptian coastline struck Alexander.The Greek historian Plutarch records that one night Alexander had a dream inwhich a man of ancient and wise appearance stood beside him and recited Homer’sverse about the Egyptian island. Alexander saw his dream as a vision and tookthe hint. The next day he ordered his architects and surveyors to abandon thefirst location for his city and take their tools to where the poet had advisedthe master of the known world to put down stakes. Thus, the story goes,Alexandria, fabled city of antiquity, home to the legendary lighthouse andlibrary, was born.At first, Alexander took a hands-on approach to the job. He rode on his horseBucephalus across the desert, pointing out to his architects where temples wouldbe and where the palace would rise and what form the harbor would take. Therewas a decided lack of chalk in Egypt at the time, and so the lines ofmeasurement that Alexander’s surveyors indicated were laid with barley flour. AsJustin Pollard and Howard Reid note in their book The Rise and Fall ofAlexandria: Birthplace of the Modern World, flocks of birds attacked themeasurements as soon as they were traced, creating what must have been a strangescene.2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber203] But although the net of lines andangles measuring what we might call the Platonic Form of Alexandria was quicklyerased by crowds of hungry birds, the city they gave birth to would remain forcenturies and, at its height, would rival Rome itself. Yet Alexander never sawit. Impatient with the foundation work of his eponymous city, and tempted byfresh conquests, he left the site after a few days and headed to the desertshrine of Ammon, one of the great creator gods of Egypt, where the priests therewould declare him “master of the universe” and a true son of Ammon, effectivelymaking him a god.Alexander then pushed on to the “ends of the earth and the Great Outer Sea,”getting as far as India and, as mentioned, sending shipments of specimens backto Athens for his old tutor Aristotle to examine. Returning westward after hisfailed India expedition—his troops had mutinied and demanded he turnback—Alexander stopped off at Babylon, where he died in 323. Some believe he waspoisoned and that Aristotle himself was party to the plot, but this has neverbeen corroborated. What we do know is that shortly after a drinkingbinge—Alexander was fond of wine—he took ill and never recovered. Legend has itthat at thirty-three, seeing that he had become master of practically all therewas to rule, he cried at having no worlds left to conquer.The story is apocryphal and most likely a distortion of Plutarch’s remark that,at being told that there were infinite worlds, Alexander wept because he had notyet conquered this one. Its meaning, however, is clear. The moral seems to bethat had Alexander paid more attention to Aristotle, the lure of battle andcommand might not have gained such mastery over him, and he might have dedicatedhis later life to something more durable than the temporal success of conquest.After Alexander’s death, his empire began to crumble. Egypt came under the ruleof Alexander’s general Ptolemy Soter I. There was much debate as to the locationof the last resting place of the great king—it would become a sacred site anddraw pilgrimages—but after much discussion, Ptolemy Soter I solved thisparticular problem by kidnapping Alexander’s body. He brought it to Memphis,where it was entombed among the pharaohs. Some years later, Ptolemy IIPhiladelphius, Ptolemy Soter I’s successor, brought the golden sarcophaguscontaining Alexander’s body back to his city. Where it is buried remains amystery, although in recent years a site outside of Alexandria has attractedmuch attention.3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber204] In any case, however greatAlexander was, for the purposes of our story he merely helps to set the scene.For it is his city, and not its founder, that would have an enormous influenceon the esoteric history of the West, harboring within its walls quite a fewsecret teachers.A CITY OF SECTS AND GOSPELSBy the time Caesar Augustus had conquered Egypt in 30 A.D.—which led to thesuicide of Mark Antony and his lover, Cleopatra VII, the last of thePtolemies—the Ptolemaic dynasty had ruled Alexandria for three centuries. Duringthis time a remarkable fusion of Greek and Egyptian religious ideas had takenplace. Although the Greeks and later the Romans were the dominant social andpolitical force, Egyptian spirituality still maintained its preeminence. AsHerodotus, the “father of history,” remarked, the Egyptians “were scrupulousbeyond all measure in the matter of religion,” and their knowledge of themysteries of life, death, and the beyond had been renowned through thecenturies.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber205] The Greek and Roman rulers ofAlexandria were in awe of the Egyptian priesthood and were more than happy toacknowledge their wisdom. Although at different times the city would be plaguedby persecutions and pogroms—first by the Romans against the Jews and Christiansand then by the Christians against the pagans—for the most part an enviablereligious tolerance was maintained. And where the Greeks and later Romans sawresemblances between their gods and those of Egypt, a convenient syncretismoccurred.Rather than argue over top billing, a fusion between Greek and Egyptian godsoften took place. One such god was Serapis, who was an amalgamation of theEgyptian gods Osiris and Apis (a bull deity), but who was depicted with a Greekappearance and who also enjoyed characteristics attributed to Hades, Demeter,and Dionysus. Serapis was an extremely popular deity, especially during theRoman period. His cult came to a disastrous end in 391 A.D. when a Christianmob, roused by Patriarch Theophilus of Alexandria, destroyed his temple, theSerapeum, during a pagan pogrom, along with many other pagan sites. Any remnantsof the cult were put down a few years later when the emperor Theodosius Isuppressed all pagan religions.But before this, Alexandria was home to a dizzying assortment of faiths,beliefs, philosophies, and religions. It was, as the novelist Lawrence Durrell,author of The Alexandria Quartet, called it, “a city of sects and gospels.”Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Jews, Babylonians, Persians, Phoenicians, Indians,and other peoples filled its maze of streets and squares and temples.Platonists, Pythagoreans, Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Christians, Stoics, and manyother followers of many other beliefs met, argued, and learned from each other.As in our own time, the Alexandrian Age provided a spiritual marketplace, a bevyof competing teachings, some fraudulent, others profound, meeting a variety ofintellectual, emotional, and religious needs.One attraction of this hive of philosophies and faiths was the fabled library ofAlexandria, the largest of ancient times. Founded by Ptolemy Soter I, itremained in existence—if in reduced form—until the sack of Alexandria by theArab leader Amr ibn al’Aas in 639 A.D. Legend has it that when asked what to dowith the library, Amr ibn al’Aas replied that “either the books contradict theKoran, in which case they are heresy, or they agree with it, in which case theyare unnecessary,” and ordered that they be burned to heat his soldiers’ baths.The truth of this remains debatable, but by the time of Amr ibn al’Aas’sconquest, the library had already suffered extensive buffetings. It was onceburned accidentally by Julius Caesar in 48 B.C., when he tried to preventPtolemy III, whom he was battling, from reaching his ships; pillaged by theemperor Aurelian in 273 A.D.; and ransacked by Patriarch Theophilus at the sametime that he laid waste to the Serapeum. As Pollard and Reid remark, with theloss of the library, “most of the knowledge of the first thousand years ofWestern civilization was lost.”5 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber206] We know ofsome of its contents from remarks in various works, but of most of what waslost, we do not know. Had the library survived, our ideas about the ancientworld and what it knew may well have been very different.Exactly how many works were housed within the library is unclear; estimatesrange from five hundred thousand to more than a million, but as no catalogue ofthe library’s contents has ever been discovered, we will never be sure.According to Alberto Manguel in The Library at Night, “the Library of Alexandriarevealed a new imagination that outdid all existing libraries in ambition andscope.”6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber207] Earlier libraries were aimed atsafekeeping and were mostly the work of collectors. The library of Alexandriawas the first true research library, available to scholars from all over theworld. Initially begun in order to better follow the teachings of Aristotle,Alexander’s tutor, the library grew to encompass all that was written at thetime. Ptolemy ordered that any ship docking in Alexandria had to deposit anybooks it might be carrying at the library, where they would be copied andeventually returned; as Manguel remarks, “like so many solemn kingly promises,this one was not always kept, and often it was the copy that was handed back.”7[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber208] Such a collection was bound to attract thebest minds of the time. A quick name check of some of the figures associatedwith Alexandria provides a prestigious list: Euclid, whose geometry is stilltaught today; Archimedes of “Eureka” fame; Galen, the greatest physician ofantiquity; Claudius Ptolemy, whose geocentric universe was in place until thetime of Copernicus; and Eratosthenes, who knew the circumference of the Earthand was a chief librarian at Alexandria.But while the preeminence of Alexandria as an ancient haven of episteme isunchallenged, it was also home to the pursuit of gnosis. Yet not everyoneinterested in this particular form of knowledge was a Gnostic.THE OTHER GNOSTICSWe’ve seen that in the early days of Christianity, a struggle took place betweenvarious Gnostic sects and what would become the official church over whatexactly was the true Christian teaching. Most of the early church fathersrejected the various Gnostic beliefs, but while rejecting the Gnostics, someearly church fathers had more sympathy with the idea of gnosis, or directspiritual experience, and strove to incorporate it into Christian doctrine.These orthodox Gnostics, as they might be called, laid the foundations for anesoteric Christianity based on a Christian gnosis, which would inform a powerfulstream within the western esoteric tradition. One such orthodox Gnostic was thechurch father Clement of Alexandria, whose letter to Theodore speaking of a“secret gospel” we looked at in Chapter Three.Clement was born in Athens, where he received a classical education, but heseems to have spent most of his life in Alexandria. Our hard knowledge about himis scant, but from allusions in his written works, some scholars have suspectedthat he may have been an initiate of one of the mystery religions; he does atleast seem to be well-informed about them, as about Greek philosophy, which herespected, while rejecting pagan religion. Clement sought out spiritualknowledge from a variety of sources, and he makes a reference to six mysterious“blessed and memorable men” whom he does not name but from whom he says helearned much.8 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber209] One of these men is thought tohave been Pantaenus of Alexandria, a Christian scholar who was dean of the firstChristian school, known as the Didascalia; among other works, it would producethe first translation of the New Testament from Aramaic and Greek into Coptic,the language of the Egyptian Christians. The idea behind the school was todevelop a philosophical argument for Christianity that could hold its ownagainst the Platonists and which would not offend the critical sensibilities ofthe Greek Egyptians it wanted to attract. Pantaenus is thought to haveoriginally been a Stoic before converting to Christianity; if so, he would havebeen well versed in the sinewy twists and turns of Greek dialectic. Clementbecame his star pupil and would eventually succeed Pantaenus as head of theDidascalia. Pantaenus is said to have embarked on an evangelical mission toIndia and left Clement in charge; he was eventually martyred during one of theChristian pogroms that became a familiar feature of the time.Clement saw the need to develop a philosophy of Christianity if he was tosucceed in attracting educated Greeks to the new religion, and he taught a veryeclectic curriculum, drawing on Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, and theEpicureans, integrating different aspects of Greek philosophy into his Christiancatechism. He wrote many works, of which his Stromata (“miscellany”) is perhapsthe most important. This is a collection of aphorisms and reflections aimed atportraying the good Christian life and at leading the reader to an understandingof its mysteries. It was not a systematic work, and Clement drew on whatever wasappropriate to make his points. It was in this eclectic and practical spiritthat Clement saw the value of some Gnostic notions, if he nonetheless rejectedthe central Gnostic teachings. “The life of the Gnostic,” he says in hisStromata, “is, in my view, no other than works and words which correspond to thetradition of the Lord.” With this in mind, Clement was able to wed some Gnosticnotions to his orthodox beliefs.THE NEED FOR SYMBOLSOne such notion was the need to conceal the true meaning of Christianity insymbols and allegories, that is, to read scripture analogically, not literally,which, as we’ve seen, was a hermeneutical approach of the Gnostics. This isnecessary, Clement believed, because not everyone can read the Gospels in thesame way, and this is because there are spiritual differences between people.(Clement seems to be speaking of this in his remarks about Mark’s “secretgospel” in his letter to Theodore.) Clement saw these differences in much thesame way as the Gnostics did. He speaks of three levels or tiers of humanunderstanding, what he calls the “heathen,” the “believer,” and the “gnostic,”which correspond quite clearly to the Gnostic grades of hylic, psychic, andpneumatic. But although Clement believed in a “true Gnosis,” he could not acceptthe central Gnostic doctrine of a false god, and his Gnosticism remainedstrictly within the bounds of the church.A similar idea to Clement’s notion of reading the Gospels symbolically wasdeveloped by the Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria (20 B.C.–40/50 A.D.).Alexandria had a large Jewish population and it was there that the Septuagint,the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, emerged. Philo came from a wealthyAlexandrian family and he strove to develop a philosophical justification forJudaism that would satisfy the dialectical appetite of the Greeks. He believedthat Greek philosophy was actually rooted in the wisdom of Moses; as in the caseof Hermes Trismegistus and Zoroaster, Moses too was believed to have received adivine revelation, a knowledge of the perennial philosophy or prisca theologia,which was handed down through the ages. Philo saw Moses’s teaching as the“summit of philosophy,” and believed that it was his wisdom that informedPlato’s ideas. Philo introduced the notion of the “Great Chain of Being,” thehierarchical structure of reality, into the biblical account of creation, seeingGod as the absolute One, from whom the logos or Forms (Sophia in the Jewishtradition) emanated, through whom the created world was brought into being. Buthe also saw that the Bible needed to be read allegorically, not literally, andhad to be understood on different levels. Genesis, he said, should be read as a“metaphor for the history of the soul,” and not as a literal account ofcreation. With his Hellenic approach to the Bible, Philo had, according to oneaccount, “created the philosophical space in which the early church fatherswould grow Christianity,” his influence reaching to St. Paul, the Gospel ofJohn, and the Epistle to the Hebrews.9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber210]ORIGENAnother church father who saw much good in gnosis was Origen (185–252 A.D.), whoenjoys the dubious honor of being declared heretical centuries after his death;he was officially condemned in 553 A.D. by the Second Ecumenical Council ofConstantinople. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I felt Origen’s works were sodangerous that he ordered them destroyed. Although some Christian thinkers havetried to return him to the fold, he remains the black sheep among the earlychurch fathers.Origen was born to a Christian family and was raised in Alexandria. His father,Leonides, taught Greek, and his mother was Jewish. He had an excellent educationin Christian scriptures and Greek philosophy, and attended the Didascalia underClement’s tutelage. Origen also attended the “secret lectures” of the mysterioussecret teacher Ammonius Saccas, who had for another student Origen’s youngercontemporary, the Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus, whom we will meet furtheron. Origen’s brilliance was obvious from the start, and was reflected on hisfamily: his father was often referred to as “Leonides, father of Origen.”Leonides, however, came to a bad end, being beheaded in 202 during a pogrominstigated by the emperor Septimus Severus.With his father’s death, Origen’s family was left destitute and Origen supportedthem by teaching and by copying manuscripts, but he was also helped by a wealthyChristian woman who paid for his education. It was during the Severian pogromthat Clement left Alexandria (he would die c. 215, but exactly where isunknown), and the next year the Bishop Demetrius made the eighteen-year-oldOrigen head of the Didascalia. As a young man, Origen was of a passionate,somewhat impulsive nature, and a reading of Matthew on the question of eunuchsled him to castrate himself, much like the devotees of the Great Mother Cybele,“for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” The fact that many of his students werewomen may have had something to do with his rash act, and Origen later admittedthat his extreme devotion was unnecessary and beyond the call of Christianduty.10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber211]Like Clement, Origen taught an eclectic curriculum, bringing Christian doctrineand Greek philosophy together, and his students enjoyed a remarkable degree offreedom, following whatever scholarly paths attracted them, while living asimple life punctuated by prayer and fasting. Origen himself was said to spendall day teaching and all night studying scripture, setting an ascetic examplefor his students. He spent ten years as a teacher, leaving Alexandria for briefsojourns in Rome and Arabia. He later became friends with Ambrose of Alexandria,a wealthy man Origen had converted to Christianity. Ambrose became his patronand for the rest of his life he promoted Origen’s work. Origen was a prolificwriter and estimates of his output range in the thousands. And it was in hiswritings that the Gnostic strain in his ideas appeared.As Philo did with Judaism, Origen sought to introduce Platonic notions intoChristian doctrine. His savvy with Greek dialectics served the Christian causein good stead when Origen was called upon to refute the criticisms ofChristianity produced by the Platonic philosopher Celsus, who saw Christianityas a kind of “revolt of the masses” against the true philosophy of the Greeks,with its appeal to the rabble and uneducated, to blind faith rather than reason.Christians appreciated Origen’s riposte, Against Celsus, but when it came tofinding a place in their religion for the very Platonic notions Celsus tried towoo them back to, they balked. Origen’s Platonizing of Christianity can be seenin his treatment of the Trinity, which he saw hierarchically, in the sense ofthe “Great Chain of Being,” or ladder of reality, reaching from God to themineral kingdom, with the angels, man, animals, and the vegetable world inbetween. Where Christian doctrine presents the Trinity as a “mystery” to beaccepted on faith, however aberrant to reason, as Tertullian said theresurrection of the body must be, Origen tried to have it make good Platonicsense. As Philo did, Origen saw God the Father as the absolute One, a God thatwas “wholly other,” beyond our human conceptions, and as such he could not beresponsible for something like creation. And as Philo did with Sophia, Origensaw Jesus the Son as an emanation of God, as the logos, the Word, equivalent tothe Platonic Forms, which were at work fashioning the world. The Holy Spirit,the third member of the incomprehensible Trinity, Origen saw as embodied in thechurch and its saints.While this arrangement does not strike us as threatening or shocking, iteventually led to Origen’s posthumous condemnation because it seemed to agreewith the Arian heresy, promulgated by the fourth-century Alexandrian theologianArius. In a nutshell, this argued that Jesus was not of equal stature as God,that, in effect, he occupied a slightly lower link in the Great Chain of Being.It was Arianism that occupied the minds of the attendants at the Council ofNicaea—along with Docetism—in 325 and which led to the dogma that Jesus was“begotten, not made,” i.e., was of the same being as God, and not an emanationfrom him, nor “created” by God in any way. Origen had lived before Arius, buthis attempt at a “subordination of the divine Persons”—as his hierarchicalscheme was called—was a pre-echo of Arius’s heresy. As Origen wrote in On FirstPrinciples, “The God and Father, who holds the universe together, is superior toevery being that exists . . . the Son, being less than the Father, is superiorto rational creatures alone (for he is second to the Father). The Holy Spirit isstill less and dwells within the saints alone. So that in this way the power ofthe Father is greater than that of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and in turnthat of the Holy Spirit exceeds that of every other holy being.” Origen alsobelieved that between human beings and the upper levels of his hierarchy, therewere intermediary spirits, some good, some bad, his version of the Gnosticarchons, which was later codified into the Christian angels and demons. It wasideas such as these that also led to Origen’s condemnation.Origen had other Gnostic ideas. Like Philo and Clement, he believed that we needto read scripture symbolically, and like them he detected three levels ofmeaning, that of “body, soul, and spirit,” which lines up well with the Gnostichylic, psychic, and pneumatic and Clement’s heathen, believer, and gnostic. ForOrigen, “just as man consists of a body, soul, and spirit, so in the same waydoes the scripture.”11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber212] He spoke out sharplyagainst the absurdity of reading the Bible as literal truth, asking “who is sosilly as to believe that God, after the manner of a farmer, ‘planted a paradiseeastward in Eden,’” and that one could have a first, second, and third day“without the sun and moon and stars?”12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber213]Origen’s tripartite hermeneutics was considered standard Christian doctrineuntil a ruling at the Eighth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople in 869 made itChristian dogma that man consists of only body and soul, relegating spirit to adoctrinal limbo. Origen also believed in the preexistence of souls before theirearthly life and he taught reincarnation, an idea that some Gnostic sectsembraced and which was not uncommon in early Christianity.One idea that most likely made him anathema to more hardline literalistChristians was his acceptance of universal salvation, the belief, known asapocatastasis, that at the end of time, even the devil will be redeemed and theoriginal paradise will be restored. In essence, Origen believed that God wasfundamentally not interested in punishment and had better things to do thantorture errant souls for eternity. Those with a taste for fire and brimstonemore than likely felt this was too liberal a stance and saw Origen as adangerous revisionist, although everything he taught was in no way antitheticalto Christ’s glad tidings.Origen would eventually be branded a heretic by the church, but in his own lifehe suffered for it deeply. When the emperor Caracalla unleashed fury onAlexandria, slaughtering thousands of its citizens indiscriminately because ofwhat he perceived as their lack of respect, Origen and Ambrose fled to Caesareain Palestine. A later falling out with Demetrius, the bishop of Alexandria, ledOrigen to move there permanently. He was increasingly under attack by otherchurchmen for his provocative views, but he never left the church and would cometo its aid when it called. During his last years, he founded a school. When theemperor Decius started new persecutions, believing that Christian magic wassomehow behind a return of the plague, Origen was arrested, imprisoned, andtortured. He was eventually released, but died not long after from his injuries.THRICE GREATEST HERMESAlong with the early church fathers, another group in Alexandria who shared withthe Gnostics a hunger for gnosis were the Hermetists. Who they were, we do notknow; no names have come down to us and they signed their works with pseudonyms.So there is no equivalent among the Hermetists to Valentinus, Basilides,Marcion, or other Gnostics who were their contemporaries. Given this, they wereperhaps the most secret teachers of all. We do know whom they worshiped and whatthey believed, as far as we can tell from their writings. They were disciples ofHermes Trismegistus, the “thrice greatest one,” master of magic, philosophy, andall learning, and they believed that mankind had a divine mission: to journeyback through the planets to their invisible divine source and awaken theirconsciousness to an awareness and grasp of the cosmos. The means of doing thiswas through gnosis, which we can see as a form of “cosmic consciousness.”13[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber214]Earlier, I mentioned that a remarkable syncretism characterized the religiousatmosphere of Alexandria and pointed to the god Serapis as evidence of this.Another example is the creative fusion that took place between the Egyptian godThoth and the Greek god Hermes. Both gods had much in common, and when theGreeks of Alexandria recognized this, a union of the two deities seemed natural.Thoth is the god of speech, writing, language, and magic; he is a moon god andis responsible for creating hieroglyphics, and along with Ma’at, the goddess ofJustice, he stands with Ra on his solar barque. Thoth is depicted as anibis-headed man holding a pen and tablet. The ibis was sacred to Thoth, andthousands of the birds were sacrificed in his honor yearly, so many that thespecies was practically wiped out in Egypt. It is he who records the outcome ofthe weighing of the soul when the dead are judged in the Duat, the Egyptianunderworld. Thoth is a guide to the underworld; he is associated with Osiris andis believed to have composed parts of the Book of the Dead. We remember that itwas through Thoth’s help that Isis was able to revive the dismembered Osiris andto conceive the child savior, Horus, through him.Hermes too was a “psychopomp,” a guide leading souls to Hades. He is a messengergod, a god of writing, of speech and eloquence. He is also an interpreter, hencethe discipline of hermeneutics, the science and art of understanding how weunderstand things, grows out of his activity. While Thoth’s worship can betraced back to 3000 B.C.—Hermopolis, one of the oldest cities on earth, was thecenter of his cult—Hermes’ origins are both somewhat later and more humble. Hebegins as a cairn or pile of stones, known as a herm, that Greek travelers leftat crossroads; hence Hermes is a god of travelers and crossroads, both earthlyand spiritual. These herms, which date from around 600 B.C., later becamestylized pillars, with a bearded Hermes displaying an erect phallus. Hermes is atrickster god—Thoth could be one too at times—and he is also a god of thieves,merchants, and bankers; one still finds his visage overlooking banks today.When these two gods began to be conflated, what emerged was not a syncretic godlike Serapis, but a new character altogether. Exactly when the figure of HermesTrismegistus first appeared is unknown; several instances have been suggested,but there is still no scholarly consensus on them.14[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber215] In the fifth century B.C. the Greek historianHerodotus identified Thoth and Hermes with each other in his Histories, and thephrase “three times great” may date back earlier than this, to the Egyptian LatePeriod.15 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber216] But it is clear that by the secondcentury A.D. the incomparable sage Hermes Trismegistus, incorporatingcharacteristics of Thoth and Hermes, had become a well-known figure inAlexandria, embodying the pursuit of sacred wisdom and secret spiritualteachings, and the attainment of esoteric knowledge.As mentioned in the Introduction, until the early seventeenth century, HermesTrismegistus was considered a real person, although an unusually accomplishedone. Church fathers like Clement, Lactantius (240–320), and St. Augustine(354–430) acknowledged his eminence. For Lactantius, he presaged the incarnationof Christ, and St. Augustine believed he was a contemporary of Moses. For both,he lived well before Plato. In addition to inventing writing and magic, HermesTrismegistus was the creator of civilization, of medicine, chemistry, laws, art,astrology, alchemy, music, mathematics, and much more. According to the Egyptianhistorian Manetho, Hermes Trismegistus was the author of some thirty-sixthousand books. The Neoplatonist Iamblichus credited him with a somewhat smallernumber, a mere twenty thousand. Clement speaks of forty-two books written byhim, while the Alexandrian alchemist Zosimus called Hermes “a thousand timesgreat.”Since the early eighteenth century, occultists have called the Tarot the Book ofThoth, giving it an Egyptian provenance most modern scholars reject.16[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber217] Yet Eliphas Levi claimed that the true Book ofThoth was Egypt itself, or what was left of it, its pyramids, obelisks, temples,and Sphinx, which can be read and interpreted like a secret text, an idea heshared with Schwaller de Lubicz.17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber218] Throughoutthe Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Hermes Trismegistus was known as “theEgyptian,” as it was he who embodied the sacred knowledge of those holy people.And it was in his writings and those by his disciples, known to us as theHermetica or Corpus Hermeticum, that Hermes Trismegistus communicated the divinerevelation he had received at the dawn of time. This was the prisca theologiaand “perennial philosophy” that was later handed down from adept to adeptthroughout the ages, and which we’ve already encountered in one form or another.As we now know, Hermes Trismegistus was not a real person and his writings, theCorpus Hermeticum, were not written “before the Flood,” or even before Plato,who was supposed to have been profoundly influenced by them. But if this is so,who was Hermes Trismegistus, and who did write the Corpus Hermeticum?We do not know where or when or by whom the name “Hermes Trismegistus” was firstuttered, but by the time of the composition of the works attributed to him, inthe second and third centuries of the Christian era, we can assume legends andtales of his remarkable accomplishments and wisdom were widespread.18[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber219] Early scholars believed that the ideasexpressed in the Corpus Hermeticum were Greek through and through, and that theEgyptian elements that run throughout them—most clearly in the Asclepius, themost well-known Hermetic writing until the rediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticumin the fifteenth century—were really an exotic window dressing, lending theworks a mysterious, mystical lure. Although the influence of Platonic ideas inthe Corpus Hermeticum is clear, many scholars today believe that the tone andatmosphere of the writings is nonetheless Egyptian, and that the teachings theypresent are a late codification and Hellenization of ancient Egyptian wisdom.19[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber220]Although the Corpus Hermeticum and Hermes Trismegistus themselves could not haveinfluenced Plato—as the Renaissance Hermeticists believed—that Plato very likely“went to school in Egypt” suggests that the Platonic ideas informing the authorsof the Hermetic writings were themselves rooted in Egyptian thought.20[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber221] What seems to be the case is that inAlexandria in the second and third centuries of the Christian era, severaldifferent authors over many years wrote a variety of philosophical,cosmological, mystical, spiritual, and magical texts communicating the ancientEgyptian wisdom in a Hellenized form, and that these unknown authors—or secretteachers—attributed these texts to the remarkable sage Hermes Trismegistus andhis disciples. They did this not out of good marketing strategy, but as a signof the worship and respect they had for the wisdom they were communicating.One possible reason they acted in this way is that they foresaw an imminentdisaster approaching Egypt. In the Asclepius, Hermes tells his discipleAsclepius that “A time will come when it appears that the Egyptians haveworshiped God with pure mind and sincere devotion in vain. All their holyworship will turn out to be without effect and will bear no fruit. For the godswill withdraw from earth to heaven and Egypt will be deserted.” Dark days willreach the land of the Nile, Hermes warns, and the river will run with blood.Religion will be forsaken, crime will be the norm, and evil will rule the land.But Hermes also tells Asclepius that there will be a resurrection of the spirit;the ancient ways will be restored and Egypt, once “the temple of the wholecosmos,” will again become “an image of heaven.”21[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber222] At the time of writing, with Egypt overrun byforeign invaders—first Greeks then Romans—and infiltrated by foreignreligions—Greek, Roman, Christian, Gnostic, Jewish—it may be that Egyptianesotericists thought it best to collect the ancient wisdom in a series ofwritings so that it may survive the deluge ahead.THE CREATION ACCORDING TO HERMESWhat was the ancient wisdom the unknown Hermetists wanted to save? In thePoimandres or The Divine Pymander, the most famous text from the CorpusHermeticum, Hermes Trismegistus recounts a mystical experience in which the truerelations between God, man, and the cosmos were revealed to him. It was anexperience of gnosis, an immediate, direct revelation of spiritual insight. Likethe Gnostics who were their contemporaries—some Hermetic texts were among theGnostic scrolls found in Nag Hammadi—the Hermetists sought a knowledge thatwould cut through the knotted bundle of doubts and perplexities that Greekdialectic had become. Earlier we saw that soon after Plato, philosophy hadbecome an arena of competing “discourses,” to use a popular academic term, withthe result that many felt that philosophy itself, the “love of wisdom,” hadbecome something to avoid, and that reason could not lead one to any certainty.Frances Yates points out that by the time of the Hermetic writings, dialectichad reached a standstill and nothing new could be expected to come from it.Gnosis was something different. As the Gnostic and Hermetic scholar G. R. S.Mead remarked, with gnosis comes “certitude, full and inexhaustible, no matterhow the doubting mind . . . may weave its magic.”22[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber223] The doubting mind for Mead was Greek; what itknew was “discursive knowledge,” “the noise of words,” and “the appearance ofthings.”For “Greek” here we can read “the left brain,” with its meticulous attention toparticulars and its tendency—some might say obsession—with prying discreet,individual objects—parts—out of the whole. The whole, the province of the rightbrain, was what the Hermetists were after, and in his mystical experience ofgnosis, this is what Hermes Trismegistus got.While in a relaxed state, in which his body was calm—a state much like thatdescribed by Plato as “practicing dying,” and in which Jeremy Naydler suggeststhe ancient Egyptian priests could release their ba from the body—HermesTrismegistus is visited by Nous, or the Divine or Universal Mind. Nous tellsHermes about the creation of the world. Much of the story will be familiar tous. Wanting to create the world, Nous first creates a craftsman, a demiurge, whodoes the job, much as in the Platonic and Gnostic creation myths, although inthe Hermetic account, the craftsman does not go rogue and usurp power from hismaster. The craftsman creates seven helpers to aid him in his task; these willturn out to be the seven ancient planets, whose crystalline spheres willencircle the Earth. With the job done, Nous decides that he would like to sharehis creation with another, so he creates Man. (Needless to say, Man here is usedin the classical sense of human, meaning men and women.)Man is quite taken with creation, and wanting a closer look at Earth, he peersthrough the seven spheres and is immediately smitten with Nature. Nature, too,is smitten with him, and their attraction to each other causes man to fall toEarth, where the two embrace (Nature here, as in all classical accounts, is awoman). Plummeting through the seven spheres, man’s originally wholly spiritualbeing becomes weighted down with elements of the planets, and he finds himselfsunken into brute matter, his inherent spiritual state now obscured by the denseresistance of the physical world. Like the Gnostics, Hermetic Man finds himselftrapped, “fallen” into a world that constrains his freedom and denies hisspiritual roots. At the very least he has become, as the Hermetic writings haveit, a creature of “two worlds,” an earthly being subject to “fate” yet with amemory of and yearning for his spiritual source, however distant and diminishedits influence has now become.THE JOURNEY THROUGH THE PLANETSThe Hermetists shared with the Gnostics the idea that they had fallen from anoriginal spiritual state into a world of brute and oblivious matter, but theirresponse to this situation was different. For one thing, the Hermetists did notsee the world as evil, nor did they believe it was a product of a usurper god.Another difference is that while the Gnostics worked within the Judeo-Christiantradition, the Hermetists’ milieu was Egyptian, although some interpreters haveseen their teachings as a kind of “pre-Christian Christianity.” Both, however,saw gnosis as the answer. But while the Gnostics sought gnosis as a way ofescaping from a false world, the Hermetists saw gnosis as a way of recoveringtheir spiritual state within the world. And for them, this ultimately meant away of transforming the world, of redeeming it and themselves from their fallenstate. At the risk of overgeneralizing, we can say that if for the Gnostics theworld was a prison they wished to escape, for the Hermetists it was one theywished to transform into a cathedral.Just as the Gnostics believed that the way back to their source, the true Godbeyond the cosmos, led through the gauntlet of the archons, the Hermetistsbelieved that the way to regain their true spiritual state led via a “journeythrough the planets,” a return trip back to Nous. During this voyage they wouldeither divest themselves of the dense, planetary characteristics they hadacquired on their descent, or transform them into positive values. This “ascentthrough the spheres” was not accomplished via a rocket ship but through an innervoyage, the kind of “journey into the interior” that would become a mainstay ofthe esoteric tradition. Fundamentally, this was a meditative and contemplativepractice aimed at transforming consciousness, much as the “practice of dyingwhile still alive” and the initiation into the Mysteries were. The Hermetistsknew that their origin and goal lay “beyond the cosmos,” but they knew this“beyond” was not some far-off destination in the depths of space, but a “beyond”outside of space, that metaphorically “interior” realm we call “the mind.” The“progress through the Hebdomad,” as Stephan Hoeller calls the journey throughthe seven planets, took place inwardly, and its stages were marked by anincrease in consciousness. As Hoeller writes, “as the initiate’s interior powersincrease, the stranglehold of the cosmos and the planets decreases.”23[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber224]As one side of our nature is subject to planetary, stellar, and cosmic forces,the aim of the “progress through the Hebdomad” was to master these and toactualize oneself as a “microcosm,” as a small cosmos in oneself. From being apart of the whole, and subject to its constraints (“fate”), one became areflection of the whole itself. The aim was to come to a vision of what theycalled “the One, the All,” or, as the modern Christian Hermeticist ValentinTomberg calls it, “the totality of things.”24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber225]The Hermetist undertook a guided ecstatic inner ascent during which he wouldconfront the planetary forces working on him and master or transform them fromlimitations into useful powers, at each stage approaching closer to Nous. Asimilar “ladder of ascent” can be found in other traditions: in Kabbalah, as thepath upward through the Sephiroth; in Tantra, as the awakening of the Kundalinipower through its ascent of the chakras; and in more modern esoteric teachings,such as Gurdjieff’s “Ray of Creation,” Rudolf Steiner’s “evolution ofconsciousness” through the planetary spheres, and in C. G. Jung’s“individuation,” in which the role played by the planets is now couched inpsychological terms, as the “archetypes.”COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESSThe ultimate aim of the journey through the planets was gnosis, or, as mentionedearlier, “cosmic consciousness.” Although this term did not come into widespreaduse until the publication of R. M. Bucke’s Cosmic Consciousness (1901)—aremarkable book arguing that mankind is evolving into a new, wider mode ofconsciousness, and which influenced important figures in the “secret history ofconsciousness” such as William James and P. D. Ouspensky—as I suggest in TheQuest for Hermes Trismegistus, descriptions of gnosis given in the CorpusHermeticum and other Hermetic writings are strikingly similar to those given byBucke and the inner explorers who followed him.25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber226] As the term suggests, this was a consciousnessof the cosmos, of the “network of connections linking everything to everythingelse” mentioned earlier, and which I have linked to a right-brain mode ofperception. In Book XI of the Corpus Hermeticum, Nous explains to Hermes that“within God everything lies in the imagination,” and goes on to give adescription of what he can expect from gnosis.Command your soul to go anywhere and it will be there quicker than your command.Bid it to go to the ocean and again it is there at once . . . Order it to fly upto heaven and it will need no wings . . . If you do not make yourself equal toGod you cannot understand him. Like is understood by like. Grow to immeasurablesize. Be free from every body, transcend all time. Become eternity and thus willyou understand God . . . Consider yourself immortal and able to understandeverything: all arts, sciences, and the nature of every living creature . . .Sense as one within yourself the entire creation . . . Conceive yourself to bein all places at the same time . . . Conceive all things at once: times, places,actions, qualities and quantities: then you can understand God.26[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber227]Much of this passage reminds us of the remark by the philosopher C. D. Broad,quoted in Chapter One, that “Each person is at each moment capable ofremembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything thatis happening everywhere in the universe.” And as I suggest in that chapter, thereason we usually aren’t aware of “everything happening everywhere in theuniverse” is that, as Henri Bergson suggested, our brain serves an eliminativefunction, allowing only enough of “reality” into our awareness to help ussurvive. The reader may remember that I associated this eliminative functionwith the left brain’s tendency to fix on the part while ignoring the whole. Thepassage from the Corpus Hermeticum above suggests that what the Hermetists wereaiming at was a shift from a left- to a right-brain mode of consciousness, fromour everyday form of consciousness that attends to our daily necessities, to onethat is aware of “the network of connections linking everything to everythingelse.”In The Eighth Reveals the Ninth, one of the Hermetic texts found among the NagHammadi scrolls, we find a long string of what seem nonsense words: “Zoxathazo aoo’ee Zozazoth,” and so on. What exactly the Hermetists did with these isunclear, but one suggestion is that they chanted them in order to induce analtered state of consciousness, or that they were a sign that such a state hadbeen achieved. As Stephan Hoeller writes, “this heavenly mystery [gnosis] is notprofitably approached in rational terms,” and “the utterance ensuing from suchextraordinary states of consciousness also must be of an other than ordinarykind.”27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber228] The idea would be that on reachinggnosis, the rational mind—or left brain—responsible for ordered speech would be“short-circuited,” as it were, which, as we saw earlier, would make a logicalaccount of the experience difficult, if not impossible. Many of the Hermetictexts speak of such states, which were expressed in hymns of praise (anotherimportant difference from the Gnostics) or in a profound “sacred silence.” Atthe end of the Poimandres, Hermes says, “You whom we address in silence, theunspeakable, the unsayable, accept pure speech offerings from a heart and soulthat reach up to you.” We have already pointed out that the implicit meaningsand insights provided by the right brain more times than not elude clear,explicit statement.Another aspect of the Hermetic gnosis that we have already touched on is itspeculiar ability to enter into things, to see and to experience their “insides.”Earlier I spoke of this in regard to Schwaller de Lubicz’s “intelligence of theheart” which allows us to “tumble with the rock which falls from the mountain”and “rejoice with the rosebud about to open,” and Owen Barfield’s ideas about“original” and “final participation.” In Book XIII of the Corpus Hermeticum,Tat, a disciple of Hermes Trismegistus, tells his master thatI have been made steadfast through God; I now see not with the eyes but by theoperation of spiritual energy in the powers. I am in heaven, in earth, in water,in air; I am in living creatures and plants; I am in the womb, before the womb,after the womb. I am present everywhere.28 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber229]This passage reminds us of Jesus’s remark in the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas:“Split a piece of wood and I am there.” As mentioned, Iain McGilchrist arguesthat the right-brain mode of perception is more “participatory” than the left,it allows us to “get inside” things more, in the way that Bergson’s “intuition”also does. Given that the wisdom associated with the Corpus Hermeticum isconsidered ancient, and that Barfield and Schwaller de Lubicz and others suggestthat our early ancestors had a more participatory form of consciousness, andthat McGilchrist argues that our right-brain consciousness is older than ourleft, this again suggests to me that what the Hermetists were about was linkedin some important sense to a shift from left- to right-brain consciousness.Again, this is not to reduce Hermeticism to an expression of brain function, butto show that the whole Hermetic tradition, its pursuit of gnosis and cosmicconsciousness, is not some weak-minded wild goose chase, but a recognition ofthe value and irreducibleness of our other mode of consciousness.DRAWING DOWN THE GODSThe parts of the Hermetic writings touched on above have a mystical,philosophical, and ecstatic character, yet as we know, Hermes Trismegistus wasthe master of magic. The most magical of the Hermetic texts is the Asclepius,which was famous throughout the Middle Ages and which was censured by St.Augustine because of its instructions in the art of theurgy. This is the callingdown to earth or making present the gods and their powers—or, conversely, theraising up of the theurgist to them. In the Asclepius, Hermes tells hisdisciples how one can draw the divine energies from the stars and infuse theminto representations of the gods—how, that is, one could “animate” statues andsymbols of the gods by permeating them with a spiritual “life force” borrowedfrom the Anima mundi, or “soul” of the world, which the theurgist funnelsthrough his imagination. This kind of “star magic” would later inform theRenaissance Hermeticism of Marsilio Ficino, who developed a kind of prophylacticand therapeutic astrology with it. This would attract good stellar forces andrepel baleful ones, using music, art, poetry, and scents, as well as magicalsigils and symbols, as spiritual “magnets,” capturing these energies. It was thepotentially “demonic” character of this magic that would turn Augustine andlater churchmen against Hermeticism, which for a time, like Platonism, was seenas a Christian fellow traveler.Theurgy would form an important part of the last phase of pagan philosophy, in akind of Platonism that had as much to do with magic as it did with the love ofwisdom, and which perhaps could have appeared nowhere else but in Alexandria.The last exponents of what came to be called Neoplatonism claimed to possessmagical and clairvoyant powers, and they saw philosophy as being as muchconcerned with making vital contact with living spiritual beings as with thesubtleties of dialectic—even more so, perhaps. It was a visionary philosophy,and although the Neoplatonists make no mention of the Hermetists (they were,however, critical of the Gnostics), they shared with them a desire to return tothe source, and they too sought to climb up the “ladder of being” through theintermediary spheres to the One. The theurgic element in Hermeticism thatrepelled Renaissance churchmen was for these late pagans the essence of theirteaching: the belief that through meditation, ritual, and solemn rites, onecould manifest divine powers and participate in them. Here the Platonic Forms,once abstract and impersonal, have become living entities that the theurgist cancommunicate with, not merely contemplate. Although the church would ban suchpractices, its own belief in the “real presence” of Jesus in the Eucharist,brought about through transubstantiation, the alchemical transformation of thecommunion host and wine into the body and blood of Christ, is an echo of the“god-making” powers conferred upon the theurgist.PLOTINUS AND THE MAN HE WAS LOOKING FORThe thinker most associated with Neoplatonism, however, was a visionary and amystic, not a magician, although his approach to Plato would pave the way forthe more magical Platonism to come. Plotinus (204–270) is thought to have beenborn around 204 in Lycopolis, Egypt, but there is really no consensus on hisancestry or his early life, and he never made public the date of his birth. Hardbiographical information about most of our ancient secret teachers is scant, butin Plotinus’s case this is doubly so: he took a dim view of his personal life,believing that all that mattered was the spiritual and philosophical life, whichfor him meant the pursuit of the One, the transcendent source of being. Plotinuswas exceedingly chary about revealing any details about his background, the onlytitbit of personal gossip forthcoming from him was the fact that he continued tonurse at his governess’s breast until his eighth year—exactly why he spoke ofthis is unclear.29 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber230] So contemptuous of the bodywas Plotinus that the biography of him written by his disciple Porphyry(234–305) begins, “Plotinus, the philosopher of our time, seemed ashamed ofbeing in a body.” We know that in the Platonic tradition, the body is seen as animpediment to pure thought—“to rise up to very truth is altogether to departfrom bodies,” Plotinus wrote in his Enneads—but he seems to have taken thenotion of philosophy as an escape from embodiment to an extreme. His shame abouthis “detestable vessel” led to Plotinus’s proscription against any portraitbeing painted of him.30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber231] Yet the motive behindall this secrecy was not a desire to create a veil of mystery—to, in effect,draw attention to himself through his ostentatious attempts to avoid it—but thathis ideas, his philosophy, should attract and bond his students to him, not hispersonality. If any man lived completely for philosophy, it was Plotinus.Plotinus began his philosophical life in his late twenties. At the age oftwenty-seven, he came to Alexandria seeking a teacher. His search for one in thepublic lecture halls was disappointing and he almost despaired of his questuntil someone told him of a remarkable teacher who spoke not in the lecturehalls, but at the city’s docks. No doubt piqued by so odd a choice of venue,Plotinus took his friend’s suggestion and went to hear this unusual savant. Whenhe did, he knew his quest was over. “This,” he said, “was the man I was lookingfor.”The man Plotinus discovered was Ammonius Saccas (175–242), mentioned earlier,about whom little is known, and who qualifies as a secret teacher. There is somedebate over whether or not he was a Christian. Porphyry says that he was broughtup Christian but abandoned the faith for philosophy, while Christian writersclaim that he remained Christian throughout his life. Some scholars havesuggested that a way out of this confusion is to assume there were twoAmmoniuses in Alexandria at the time, one a philosopher, the other a Christian.My own feeling is that if Ammonius was as central an influence on Plotinus as isbelieved, it is difficult to accept that he was a Christian while tutoringPlotinus in philosophy. Although Neoplatonism would influence Christianity,there is little to suggest that Christianity influenced Plotinus’s thought, andin the last centuries of paganism, Neoplatonism and Christianity were bitterrivals.What we know of Ammonius Saccas is that he came from a humble background andthat he worked as a porter on the Alexandrian docks, hence his nickname“Saccas,” which means “sack bearer.” In 193, he founded a school, but he left nowritings and taught orally; the little we know of his philosophical ideas comesfrom accounts in Porphyry and later Neoplatonists (Plotinus himself also taughtorally and only wrote down his ideas after his student Porphyry compelled him tolate in life). Ammonius attended lectures in philosophy for many years but healso learned much from contact with the people he met at the harbor: sailors,traders, and fishermen, some of whom may have stimulated his interest in foreignteachings, those of Persia and India, a curiosity he passed on to Plotinus.There was a revival of interest in Pythagorean thought at the time, and likePythagoras, Ammonius demanded a vow of secrecy from his students, whom heseparated into three classes—novices, initiates, and masters—rather like thethree levels of understanding we have seen in the Gnostics, Clement ofAlexandria, and Origen. As he was Origen’s teacher, we may wonder if Origen’sthree-tiered notions of scripture and the human being may have its roots inAmmonius’s lectures.Like Philo, Clement, and Origen, Ammonius taught that we should interpret mythsand legends symbolically, not accept them as literal truth, seeking theircorrespondences with our interior world, that is, the life of the soul. Thepractice of reading the Greek myths analogically that became part ofNeoplatonist practice most likely had its roots in Ammonius’s hermeneuticalapproach. He took few students, and he seems to have had an exoteric teachingthat he voiced in public lectures and an esoteric one he reserved for his closedisciples. He was an eclectic teacher and drew on many sources for his ideas,even on dreams; it is said that he thought so much about philosophy during theday, that his thinking continued during sleep, and that many of his insightscame to him in dreams. He was known as a theodidactos, or “God-taught,” and itis believed that he was the first to use the term theosophia, or “divinewisdom.” Centuries later Madame Blavatsky, one of the founders of theTheosophical Society, would celebrate Ammonius Saccas as an enlightenedforebearer, and she spoke of the Alexandrian Philalethians, or “lovers oftruth,” a name that Ammonius embraced as well. Along with his eclecticism, whichblended Plato with Egyptian and even Indian ideas, what Blavatsky shared withAmmonius was the belief, which we encountered in Chapter One, that there is auniversal teaching, a perennial revelation, at the basis of all myths,religions, and philosophies, and that, at bottom, there is no conflict betweenthem. It is said of Ammonius that he aimed to show that there is a fundamentalagreement between Plato, Aristotle, and even Christianity, as they were allexpressions of this timeless wisdom, a philosophical project that would occupyRenaissance Hermeticists like Pico della Mirandola and which forms the essenceof the Traditionalist school of esoteric thought.Ammonius believed in an absolute transcendent deity, utterly beyond humancomprehension, an idea that we have seen in Philo and also in Origen, and healso believed that the human soul was a kind of immortal “radiation” from theimmortal universal soul that emanated from this One. As the human soul was aradiation of the universal divine soul, through meditation, contemplation,virtue, and the love of wisdom, the human soul can raise itself to union withits source. It is this belief in henosis, a Greek word meaning the union of theindividual soul with its divine source, that is at the foundation ofNeoplatonism.THE LAST DAYS OF PLOTINUSPlotinus stayed with Ammonius for eleven years. After the death of his master,and intrigued by his remarks about the mystic teachings of the Persians,Chaldeans, and Indians, Plotinus decided that he would go on a journey to theEast. His mode of transportation may seem odd, but without independent means,travel in the ancient world was not easy. To get to the Orient, Plotinus decidedto join the army of the emperor Gordian III, which was embarking on an invasionof Persia. Gordian III was assassinated en route; his campaign collapsed andPlotinus found himself lost in the wasteland. It took him two years to reach theancient city of Antioch. From there he boarded a ship to Rome, where he remainedfor most of the rest of his life, retiring in his last days to an estate insouthern Italy, bequeathed to him by a friend.In Rome, Plotinus became something of a celebrity. The emperor Gallienus and hiswife became followers, and with them came a host of other prominent citizens,including many members of the senate, as well as many influential women.Plotinus became tutor to many of their children and was well rewarded inexchange; he was often called on to arbitrate in disputes. One of his students,Malchus of Tyros, was nicknamed “Porphyry” (“clad in purple”) because ofPhoenician descent—purple dye came from Tyre—but perhaps also because Malchusmeans “king” and purple was the color of royalty. Porphyry stayed with Plotinusfor six years, but left Rome for Sicily on Plotinus’s advice, to recuperateafter a severe mental strain led to thoughts of suicide. During Porphyry’sabsence, Plotinus died, finally jettisoning the detestable vessel he had spenthis life trying to ignore. After leading an abstemious life dedicated to work,contemplation, and the pursuit of the good, Plotinus contracted what may havebeen leprosy. An ungenerous reflection would be that his body took a lastrevenge against his abuse. There is some debate over the actual nature of hisdisease, but becoming a leper would be one compelling reason to leave Rome andretire to a secluded estate. His last words are said to have been “Strive togive back the Divine in yourself to the Divine in all.” Readers familiar withthe work of Rudolf Steiner may hear in this a pre-echo of Steiner’s own latedefinition of his esoteric teaching, Anthroposophy, which he characterized as “apath of knowledge to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual inthe universe.”31 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber232]FROM THE ONE TO THE ONEGiving back “the divine in oneself to the divine in all” can be seen as theessence of Plotinus’s work, as well as the core concern of Neoplatonism.Plotinus himself, we should reflect, did not see his work as a new approach toPlato, merely the refining of certain aspects of his philosophy left in a roughform at the master’s death. Or, as some commentators remark, Plotinus thoughtout of his own concerns, and looked to Plato for confirmation of his insights.We can see his work as “Plato +”. If in Plato the philosopher finds wisdomthrough contemplating the Forms, and the best wisdom in contemplating the Formof Forms, i.e., the Good, with Plotinus the philosopher goes a step further andfrom contemplation reaches union, or henosis, when he becomes one with theobject of contemplation or, with the later “magical” Neoplatonists, is made“godlike” himself.It is surprising that Plotinus makes no mention of the Hermetists, who were hiscontemporaries. He did write critically of the Gnostics: in Against theGnostics, he chides them for their world rejection, their antinomianism, theirabandonment of moral responsibility and the pursuit of virtue, in favor of theirelite “secret knowledge.”32 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber233] One suspects hehad the Carpocratian variety of Gnosticism in mind. The Hermetists did devotethemselves to virtue and purification—a central Plotinian ideal—and they did notsee the material world as evil, but even more so, as we’ve seen, they devotedthemselves to union with the One, with the henosis that transforms the natural,carnal self into something more godlike, to which Plotinus also aspired. It maybe that Plotinus associated the Hermetists with the Gnostics, as both pursuedgnosis. Plotinus did not believe there was a “magic formula” for union with thedivine, a special dispensation that only members of an elite sect couldenjoy—the “one thing needful,” to borrow from the Gnostics’ Christian rivals.33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber234] Although Plotinus himself experiencedgnosis—that is, direct spiritual knowledge—he was a true philosopher and he gotthere by effort. He knew that work, thought, discipline, and virtue were thesine qua non of achieving union with the divine.But Plotinus did see things differently from the Hermetists, at least as far ashis account of creation goes. Unlike the Platonic, Judeo-Christian, and Hermeticcreation stories, Plotinus does not posit a creator or demiurge or anydeliberate plan for creation. For Plotinus, the One did not decide to create thecosmos; it is an irrepressible outcome of the overflow of its divine being, justas the sun’s light and warmth is essential to its being a sun. The sun does notchoose to shine; it must, or it would not be a sun. In a sense, for Plotinusthere is no act or moment of creation per se, and he treats Plato’s account inthe Timaeus as an allegory. All is part of the One, which is eternal. Creationis ongoing, not a temporal or historical event. We can say Plotinus had a“steady-state” view of creation rather than a “Big Bang” one, which means thathe did not see an end to creation; it is everlasting.In his creation story, Plotinus posits another version of the Great Chain ofBeing, which we’ve seen in Philo, Ammonius, and Origen. There is the One:absolute, transcendent, beyond all attributes, beyond anything we can say aboutit. It is not Mind, nor God, nor the Good—although we will use these terms torefer to it—but somehow beyond these. It is beyond everything because it is thesource of everything, and hence cannot be a “thing” itself. It is the One andthe All. All things come from it and to it all things wish to return. It is theGood toward which all other goods are drawn.From this indescribable, incomprehensible source, two spheres of being emanate,the Intellect, or Nous, and the World Soul, or Anima mundi. The three togetherare called the “three hypostases,” or ultimate principles. They are thefundamental, transcendental—nonsensible—realities out of which all things comeinto being. From the One comes Nous, from Nous comes the World Soul, and fromthe World Soul comes Nature and the material world. As with Jean Gebser’sstructures of consciousness, with each new structure being further removed from“Origin,” in Plotinus’s system, the further an emanation is from the One—interms of ontology, not spatial distance—the less spiritual and more dense itbecomes, yet each emanation retains elements of the other emanations. And so theOne is present in the All, as Gebser’s structures remain active althoughsuperseded by later structures.Like Gebser’s Origin, the One is not lessened by its emanations; it is aneternal spring, an inexhaustible source that loses nothing by creating. Plotinusspeaks of the process of creation as “the unfolding of a seed,” which moves“from simple origin to . . . the world of sense . . . from a store ofindescribable power . . . that must not halt within the higher range . . . butcontinue to expand until the universe of things reaches the limit of itspossibility, lavishing its vast resources on all its creatures, intolerant thanany one should have no share in it.” In this portrayal of a kind of ontologicalgeyser, continuously gushing creative energy out of itself and into itscreations, Plotinus’s vision is like that of Henri Bergson’s élan vital, thesurging life force at work in the world. It is no surprise that for many yearsBergson lectured on Plotinus in university, and it is also no surprise thatPlotinus’s ideas informed Goethe and other Romantic philosophers and poets.The One is self-sufficient and self-content, but the Intellect and World Soullook back to their source; they contemplate it, and through their contemplation,an overflow of creative energy arises that permeates all of creation. Thiscontemplation is shared, to differing degrees, by the All. All is in touch withAll, or, as Plotinus would say, All is linked to All through “the sympathy ofall things,” the “network of connections linking everything to everything else.”“A sympathy pervades this single universe, like a single living creature,”Plotinus writes, “and the distant is near.” This “sympathy of all things” willinform later esoteric readings of the world, whether through Hermetic,alchemical, and Kabbalistic “correspondences”—“as above, so below”—or in Jung’snotion of synchronicity, the “meaningful coincidences” that tell us that ourrelationship to the world is a much more participatory one than our scientificminds would have us believe, or through the analogical hermeneutics ofsymbolism, which sees poetic and metaphoric reflections of the whole in each ofits parts, through the kind of perception that we have associated with a moreright-brain mode of consciousness.At the very bottom of the Plotinian ladder is matter, which is a formless chaosuntil it receives the imprint of the Forms of the Intellect through themediation of the Soul. While necessary for the sensible cosmos to exist—whichexistence itself is a necessity—matter is a kind of afterthought, an unavoidablecanvas on which the Intellect and Soul create the beauty of the world, asensuous mirror reflecting the supersensible. (We must remember that forPlotinus, as for all our secret teachers, consciousness, not matter, is primary;true being resides in states of consciousness, in a ladder of spiritualactivity.) The Intellect, or Nous, is the realm of the Intelligible Forms, thePlatonic blueprints for everything in existence. A perfect harmony exists inNous, with every part related to every other part seamlessly; the Forms areordered, not a mosaic or jumble. Because it is spiritual, not material, Nous isever present, outside of space and time; as William Blake, a reader of Plotinusthrough his friend Thomas Taylor, said, “one thought fills immensity.” Unlikemany neuroscientists and modern philosophers of mind, who tell us that the mindis something in us individually, in our brains as an epiphenomenon of neuralfiring—a kind of steam given off by our neurons—for Plotinus (and the entireesoteric tradition) we are in Mind, in “Mind at Large,” as Aldous Huxley calledit, and because of this are connected to each other.We see evidence of Nous everywhere, in the patterns of nature from sunflowers tospiral galaxies. Like Pythagoras, Plato, and the Hermetists, although regretfulof his embodiment, Plotinus saw the created world as a work of beauty andwonder. But the world is not only harmonious; it is alive, a single, sentientorganism, carrying within itself the imprint of its source. While Nous providesthe forms that the created world will exhibit, it is the Anima mundi that giveslife to everything. It is the life force running through the cosmos. The WorldSoul brings the cosmos of space and time into being, and it is through it thatit is animated, or “ensouled.” Again, unlike modern science, which sees life asan accidental product of a meaningless universe, the result of a chancecombination of physical forces, for Plotinus the entire cosmos is alive,intelligent, and responsive to human entreaty—this is the basis of the latertheurgic philosophy of Iamblichus (245–325) and Proclus (412–485), the last ofthe Neoplatonists. It is through the Anima mundi that the Forms of the Intellectbecome something more than abstract ideas, just as it is through his soul thatthe philosopher is a “lover of wisdom,” and not a dry logician. And it isthrough his soul, which is linked to and is a part of the World Soul, that thephilosopher is immortal. The Plotinian ladder of being is recapitulated in man,who contains within himself his source in the Anima mundi, Nous, and the One. InPlotinus’s philosophy, the aim of the philosopher is to climb this interiorladder, and to regain a place with his source in the One. The similarity to theHermetic “journey through the planets” should be clear.In the Enneads, the collection of his writings edited and organized by Porphyry,Plotinus uncharacteristically speaks of himself when trying to give adescription of the kind of mystical union he sought:Often I have woken to myself out of the body, become detached from all else andentered into myself; and I have seen beauty of surpassing greatness, and havefelt assured that then especially I belonged to the higher reality, engaged inthe noblest life and identified with the Divine; and there established, I haveattained to that supreme actuality, setting myself above all else in the realmof Intellect. And after this repose in the Divine, descending from Intellect toreasoning, I am perplexed as to how my descent comes about, and how my soul hasbecome embodied—a soul, though in the body, of such manifest excellence.As in the Hermetic account, for Plotinus man is of two natures: he is anamphibian, living in two worlds simultaneously. One part of him is in directcontact with the higher worlds, another part is immersed in the lower ones. Mancan choose which part of his being he values, and to which part he directs hisenergies and attention. To focus on the body and its desires—linked to whatPlotinus called the “lower soul”—or to the temptations of the world is to cutoneself off from the divine. To turn one’s attention first to reason, then tothe higher intellect, is to renew the link to our origin in the One. Tocontemplate this One is the true happiness toward which man can aim; all else isa distraction.This did not mean that Plotinus counsels us to retire to a cave and live thelife of an ascetic. Contemplation of the source begins with contemplation of itsfruits, with the beauty and order of the world, and this is aided by the pursuitof virtue. This leads to a good that is independent of the travails of life.Journeying within, one frees oneself of the body’s tyranny and comes torecognize one’s unity with the World Soul. In the intelligible Forms, we see theradiance of the Good. Finally, rather than perceive the Forms from without, weattain union with them. The philosopher no longer reflects on the good and true,using his intellect to understand them; he has become one with them. The realityhe had contemplated is no longer outside him. He and it are one.This henosis, however, cannot be commanded or willed, although the philosopherworks daily preparing the ground for it. He must be patient and allow it tohappen. It is not exactly a kind of grace, as Plotinus does not believe that theOne does anything; it does not bestow this union. But it is always present,always available, just as the stars are always present; it is only the proximityof the sun that obscures them. The philosopher must make himself a worthy vesselfor the presence of the One by emptying himself of coarse matters. Or, to changethe metaphor, he must quiet the racket within himself so that the sacred silencecan be heard. It is solitary work, with no aim other than itself. Unlike Plato,Plotinus did not dream of philosopher kings, but of teachers who, like the Oneitself, radiate their knowledge and wisdom so that those who are drawn to thephilosophical life and are capable of it may be guided in their quest.Ultimately, through purifying himself, pursuing the virtues, and throughcontemplating the good, the true, and the beautiful, the philosopher comes tosee and to participate in the ever-present, self-evident, and eternal One, “thesolitary returned to the Solitary.”AFTER PLOTINUSAfter the austere and sublime heights of Plotinus’s teaching, there would seemto be little left for Neoplatonism to do. In effect, what takes place afterPlotinus is a kind of retreat from these timeless philosophical peaks and areturn to the roots of Greek spirituality in pagan mythology and the Mysteries.With Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus, we can see what we might call the “laststand of paganism” before its passing. With Christianity on the rise, thesethinkers may have felt that they had to make the old religion more acceptable tothose who had developed their critical thinking through philosophy. The resultis an early attempt at a philosophy of religion, a way of understanding theancient ways through the lens of Platonic thought.We have Porphyry to thank for forcing Plotinus to write; otherwise the Enneadsmight never have been produced. (We also have him to thank for editingPlotinus’s writings which, from all reports, were often chaotic.) Porphyryhimself was a highly cultured and learned thinker who wrote a great deal, butonly little of this has survived. He wrote a spirited criticism of Christianity,Against the Christians, arguing like Celsus against what he saw as their lack ofreason and dependence on emotional persuasion, not philosophical argument. Healso wrote on the virtues of vegetarianism and other forms of abstinence andmade an attempt to harmonize Plotinus’s thought with Aristotle, an early essayin the kind of synthesizing and integration of previous Greek philosophy thatwould occupy later Neoplatonists. We can say that with Plotinus, the greatcurrent of philosophy that started with Thales reaches an end; those who cameafter him are less creative and original; they are more scholarly and aim tofind ways of reaching agreement between ostensibly opposed viewpoints in orderto develop an all-inclusive philosophical system. Such system building isgenerally associated with the completion of a movement of thought. As thephilosopher Hegel, one of the great system builders, remarked, “the owl ofMinerva flies at dusk.”Porphyry was more interested in religion than Plotinus. Although he showedreligion due respect, it is clear that Plotinus believed that his philosophical,contemplative approach was sufficient and that the rituals of religiousobservance were unnecessary. When invited to make a pious visit to his localtemples, Plotinus declined, remarking that “they should come to me, not I tothem.”34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber235] This did not mean that Plotinus didnot believe in the gods, only that his own approach to venerating the divine waspreferable. He had a similar feeling toward magic or theurgy. He believed magicworked, but only within boundaries of the natural world. It was a way of usingthe “sympathy of all things” arising from the World Soul. But the higher realmswere unaffected by it, and it was these with which he was ultimately concerned.We can see the later development of Neoplatonism as a contradiction ofPlotinus’s ideas about theurgy and the gods.Porphyry begins this change with his belief that traditional religiousobservance was still important. Plotinus’s approach was, he knew, limited toonly a handful of determined individuals and could never appeal to the masses.But the myths informing pagan religion, he also saw, needed to be readsymbolically, with a philosophical eye, an idea we’ve already encountered withAmmonius Saccas. Porphyry argued for an esoteric reading of Greek mythology,seeing in it coded knowledge about the soul and its need for, as well as its wayof, salvation. His esoteric reading of Homer is most clearly presented in hiswork The Cave of the Nymphs. Porphyry was also a great reader of the ChaldeanOracles, whose devotees, we’ve seen, were practitioners of magic and divination.Yet while he was most likely the teacher of Iamblichus, Porphyry was also acritic of theurgy, and in his Letter to Anebo—supposedly an Egyptianpriest—Porphyry spells out a series of questions about theurgy’s efficacy andhis preference for a more philosophical approach.Iamblichus had no doubts about the efficacy and importance of theurgy, and wecan see his “magical Platonism” as a retreat from Plotinus’s solitary mysticalheights to a kind Neoplatonic religious service. Iamblichus was born in Chalcisin Syria, into a wealthy family that descended from Syrian priest-kings. We knowlittle about his life. He most likely studied with Porphyry, but ultimatelyrejected his philosophy in favor of a kind of baroque system that introduced amultiplicity of superhuman beings into Plotinus’s relatively simple ontology.Iamblichus elaborated on Plotinus’s three hypostases, adding furtherdifferentiations between them, increasing the number of intermediary spheresbetween man and the One, as well as the beings who inhabit them. He was also adevotee of Pythagoras and saw him as the supreme arbiter, introducingPythagorean “number mysticism” into Plotinus’s ideas. For one thing, he added asecond One, thus introducing Pythagoras’s “dyad.”Iamblichus disagreed with his teacher Porphyry about theurgy. His rebuttal toPorphyry’s criticisms, On the Mysteries of Egypt, argues that we cannot achieveunion with the One through our mind alone—Plotinus’s way—but require the aid andassistance of the gods. Hence the need for theurgy. What was essential was notthinking our way to the One, Iamblichus argued, but the “performance ofmysterious acts which surpass all understanding, duly executed in honor of thegods, and the power of unutterable symbols, intelligible to the gods alone.”35[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber236] In other words, it is the power of ritual,symbols, and magic words that “effects the theurgic union.”36[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber237] Here we are back to the Gnostics and theHermetists, who employed rituals and prayer to achieve gnosis, althoughIamblichus’s remarks about the importance of divination and “divine possession”sound very much like modern accounts of mediums and “channeling.”37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber238] But here we also have an early appearance of asplit in the western esoteric tradition, to which we will return further on,between what will come to be known as the via negativa and the via positiva, theway of pure contemplation, which divests itself of imagery and works, and theway of ritual, symbolism, and practice, which embraces them.We can also say that Iamblichus’s insistence on “mysterious acts which surpassall understanding” and “the power of unutterable symbols” puts him in closerproximity to a more right-brain approach than Plotinus’s more cerebral method.For Iamblichus, symbols and rituals are objectively effective; they contain realpower. They do not compel the gods, but the gods recognize them and respond totheir affinity with them, because the symbols and rituals are themselvesgodlike. As mentioned earlier, this understanding of the significance of ritualwould inform the theology behind the Christian sacraments. Although moderncritics see his ideas as a “charter for irrationalism,” Iamblichus’s standing inantiquity was impressive.38 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber239] He was regularlycalled “the divine Iamblichus,” and the emperor Julian the Apostate (331–363),who tried to revive the pagan religions, said that he preferred Iamblichus overPlato.Proclus was born in Constantinople but went to Athens, where he studied at thePlatonic Academy. He was so good a student that he was eventually made its head.Although the Academy would continue on until its closure by Justinian in 529, wecan see Proclus’s time there as its last blaze of glory. Proclus is most knownfor his long and detailed commentaries on previous philosophers, and in generalwe can see his work as an attempt to systemize the ideas of Iamblichus. LikeIamblichus, he was a great believer in theurgy, and he made daily orisons to thesun and other deities while living an abstemious life. Like Porphyry, he was adevotee of the Chaldean Oracles, so much so that he rated them higher thanPlato. Like Iamblichus, he argued that we have need of the help of the gods inorder to attain salvation, and he was especially devoted to the importance ofritual objects, which for him were portals to the divine realms; throughtheurgy, even the most mundane items could be raised to divine status.Where Plotinus focused on the intellect as the royal road to henosis, Proclussaw the need to integrate our emotional and religious aspects into this pursuit;hence the need for ritual, prayer, and religious observance. Plotinus’s thoughtseems to hover over history, but Proclus was much more a man of his time,attuned to the proliferation of sects and cults that characterized lateantiquity. His loyalty to the fading gods of Greek mythology caused him sometrouble in an increasingly intolerant Christian milieu; at one point he wasexiled because of his worship of the pagan deities. His Platonic Theology is amonumental attempt to integrate Greek mythology, Pythagoreanism, Orphism, andthe Chaldean Oracles into a systematic philosophy of pagan religion, to presenta coherent pagan theory of the gods rooted in Platonic thought, and to see inthe Olympian pantheon allegories of abstract ideas. It is a massive work,containing within itself a universe of divine beings and multiple levels ofreality which in its baroque complexity reminds us of the Ptolemaic geocentricuniverse, with its epicycles on epicycles, needed to “save the appearances.” Thepagan world in which both emerged was on its way out, but both, in differentways, would inform the new world that would take its place."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEGREAT PAN IS DEAD[../image/153618.jpg]In 415, during the reign of Honorius—generally considered one of the worst Romanemperors—Cyril, the Christian patriarch of Alexandria, incensed with antipaganzeal, encouraged a mob of Christian fanatics in an act that in sheer brutalityserves as symbol for the end of paganism. At the very least it was a grimexample of what was in store for any who refused to reject pagan ways andconvert to the new faith.Cyril’s predecessor, Theophilus, had already ordered the destruction of allpagan temples in Alexandria. But to make the message crystal clear, an even moreviolent reminder seemed necessary. Cyril was suspicious of the influence ofAlexandria’s last Neoplatonic philosopher, the brilliant Hypatia (370–415), oneof the most remarkable women in western history. A mathematician, dialectician,philosopher, and astronomer—she is credited with developing theastrolabe—Hypatia’s well-reasoned arguments easily outpaced the emotionalrhetoric of the Christians, and her persuasive oratory was a threat to theincreasingly militant faith. More specifically, her influence over Orestes,prefect of Alexandria, and other city officials troubled Cyril, who had alreadybanished the Jews from Alexandria—after confiscating their goods—and he believedthat Hypatia advised the prefect in ways contrary to Christianity. Cyril was onclose terms with a group of desert monks, as well as with the parabalani, “thereckless ones,” Christian fanatics who were feared for their exuberant faith andpenchant for violence. Historians debate the extent of his responsibility, butit is generally agreed that Cyril’s detestation of Hypatia communicated itselfto these extremists, who decided to rid Christianity of this despicable evil.Enraged with pious indignation, and led by a particularly zealous cleric namedPeter, the mob attacked Hypatia as she returned home from the academy. Pullingher from her chariot, they dragged her into the Caesarean Church where theystripped her, beat her to death, and then scraped the flesh from her bones withoyster shells (some accounts say roof tiles). They then took her remains to aplace called Cindron and burned them. Thus Hypatia became “the greatest of thepagan martyrs,” as well as one of our secret teachers.1[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber240] Cyril went on to have a long and illustriouscareer in the church, and according to one Christian Web site, is considered“the most brilliant theologian of the Alexandrian tradition.”2[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber241]Although Proclus was three years old when Hypatia was murdered, and the PlatonicAcademy in Athens would remain active until 529, this gruesome assassinationseems to mark a turning point. For the Neoplatonists who remained in Alexandria,it was a sign that they should leave the city, which was no longer a safe havenfor philosophy. And so began what we might call an “esoteric exodus.”Increasingly, the stream of ideas and teachings emanating from Greek thought—androoted, perhaps, in the Egyptian Mysteries—would have to act secretly, would,that is, have to go “underground,” a survival tactic not uncommon in the historyof the western esoteric tradition. For roughly the next millennium, the ideas wehave looked at in previous chapters, stemming from Pythagoras, Plato, andPlotinus—and also from the Gnostics and Hermetists—would lead a covert life,subtly informing more mainstream developments, adding a secret leaven to the nowtriumphant Christianity and the soon to rise Islam. Like a subterranean current,esoteric ideas moved below the surface, occasionally bubbling up to groundlevel, but more times than not remaining like a hidden spring at which a fewdaring souls took refreshment.DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITEOne last emanation from the Neoplatonist school would inform perhaps the mostmystical and esoteric expression of western Christianity, and there is somepoetic justice in the fact that the source of this final efflorescence was aChristian student of Damascius (458–538), last teacher of the Platonic Academy.This unknown philosopher—truly a secret teacher—was well versed in the complexNeoplatonic theology of Proclus, and with this he performed an act of spiritualfusion. Taking the Neoplatonic hierarchy of intermediary realms (and theirinhabitants, all the gods and daimons) as a model, he developed what wouldbecome the Christian “celestial hierarchy.” This is the ladder of spiritualbeings comprising the Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Virtues, Powers,Principalities, Archangels, and Angels, that reaches up from our fallen stateback to God.3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber242] We do not know who this mysticand visionary was. He is known as Dionysius the Areopagite, but that is not hisreal name. He is called this because he was confused with the Athenian convertedby the apostle Paul and mentioned in Acts 17:34; he was also confused with St.Dionysius, the patron saint of France. Because of this he is often called“Pseudo-Dionysius.” He was most likely active around 500 and probably had beenborn in Syria, but there is little we actually know about him. His works, TheDivine Names, Mystical Theology, Celestial Hierarchy, Ecclesiastical Hierarchy,and a collection of ten epistles had a huge influence on Christian theology andmysticism throughout the Middle Ages, and if we can credit one figure with therise of the Gothic cathedrals, it’s Dionysius.To be sure, the elements of the Gothic style came from many sources; the pointedarch, for example, came from Islam, most likely through Muslim craftsmen takenprisoner during the Crusades.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber243] But theinspiration for it came from Dionysius’s Neoplatonic–Christian theology. AsWilliam Anderson writes in The Rise of the Gothic, what compelled Abbot Suger inthe twelfth century to rebuild the cathedral of St. Denis according toDionysius’s mystical vision, thus inaugurating the age of the Gothic, was “thedesire to create in stone and glass an interior expressing the Neoplatonic ideathat our visible and corporeal light derives from a higher incorporeal light.”5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber244] So when we look today with delight atstained-glass windows in our churches, we have Dionysius the Areopagite to thankfor them.According to Arthur Versluis, “Dionysius the Areopagite stands as a centralfigure in the history of western esotericism,” an assessment shared by JoscelynGodwin, who calls him “the father of Christian esotericism.”6[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber245] Dionysius deserves this high standing forseveral reasons. One is that he laid the foundation for a Christian gnosis byproviding a Christian equivalent to the intermediary spheres of being in theNeoplatonist ladder of reality, in other words, the whole realm of the angels.Through this synthesis, an invaluable part of the Neoplatonic cosmology wassaved from oblivion as the pagan worldview shrank in the face of risingChristianity. If one no longer “journeyed through the planets” back to Nous, onecould still contemplate the angelic hierarchies.Another reason Dionysius is important is that he introduced a dichotomy thatcontinues to run, not only through western esotericism, but through the West’sspiritual heart. As with Plotinus (and Philo, Origen, and Ammonius Saccas), forDionysius, the one God, the source of all being, is transcendent, utterly beyondhuman conception. Yet he is also in some inexplicable way available to us. Theway of reaching God through the recognition of his transcendence is known as thevia negativa, mentioned in the previous chapter. This is the way of “negativetheology,” the “emptying out” of all ideas, images, or preconceptions about God(or the One) in order to allow his “dark brilliance” to shine within oneself. Onthis path—which informed the great movement of Christian mysticism in the MiddleAges, specifically Meister Eckhart and the anonymous author of The Cloud ofUnknowing—one aims to remove anything coming between oneself and the divine. Onemeans of doing this is by way of negation, through expressing what God is not.(Hinduism has a similar approach to grasping the incomprehensible Brahma in itsdoctrine of “neti-neti,” “not this, nor that.”7[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber246])In a sense, this leads to a kind of spiritual “black hole,” an emptiness whichis really a fullness (Dionysius often uses paradox to try to convey hismeaning). God in this sense is everything but also nothing, as he is beyondeverything: he is literally “no thing.” Like Zen koans, such paradoxicalstatements inhibit the logical mind, allowing for a sudden illumination. AsDionysius writes, “Through the inactivity of all his reasoning powers the mysticis united by his highest faculty to That which is wholly unknowable; thus byknowing nothing he knows That which is beyond knowledge.”8[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber247] This would not be out of place coming from oneof Plotinus’s Enneads.Yet, paradoxically, Dionysius also articulated the opposite path, the viapositiva, which proceeds through imagery, symbols, through positive statementsabout God’s goodness, love, omniscience, and so on.9[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber248] In this way, the formless, transcendent God isrevealed to us. Poetic symbolism, which, to be sure, is not the same as“idolatry,” does not define the divine; it alludes to it, points in itsdirection. It is not explicit, but seeks to embody the divine’s implicittranscendent reality. A symbol is not the thing; that is idolatry. But itprovides a way to the thing. It does not say, it shows. Images and symbolsprovide a means through which we can ascend the spiritual hierarchies, just asthe Hermetists used images and symbols to make their “journey through theplanets.” This is because symbols and images can activate our latent powers ofintuition, of the right-brain mode of consciousness, and it is precisely achange in consciousness that esotericism is after.In a very real sense, the distinction between the via negativa and the viapositiva is that between mysticism and esotericism. Where the mystic seeksdirect union with the divine, eschewing any intermediary realms, the esotericistwants to know and explore these realms, and his means of doing so is throughimagery and symbols—through, that is, imagination. Where the mystic desiresunion, the esotericist seeks knowledge—in other words, gnosis—and he reaches itthrough the imagination. Achieving gnosis through the use of disciplinedspiritual imagination will become one of the fruits of the esoteric exodus outof Alexandria.DARK AGESAlthough composed in the last days of paganism, it was not until the ninthcentury, some three hundred years after he flourished, that Dionysius’s writingswould become available in the West. Before then, a tremendous upheaval tookplace. The great power of Rome, the greatest empire the world had yet seen,tottered and fell. It was the breakdown of a civilization, and it did not takeplace overnight. If Rome was not built in a day, it also took longer than thatfor it to fall. It was in decline for at least a century. Some historians, likeEdward Gibbon, saw Christianity as greatly responsible for Rome’s collapse. “Ihave described the triumph of barbarism and religion,” Gibbon says at the end ofThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Other historians point out that therewere many factors, and that no single one can be held solely accountable.The empire had grown too large: by 285, it had already split into a western andeastern part, with Byzantium its eastern capital. It had become too corrupt: itdepended too much on hired foreign armies, and had a history of mad, sadisticemperors. But one reason why Rome disintegrated must be because it was one ofthe most materialistic civilizations in history, fostering a culture of power,wealth, indulgence, and little else. It is clear that once the Christians cameto power, they persecuted their rivals just as much as the Romans had persecutedthem. But it is also clear that Christianity offered a view of life that inessence, if not always in practice, was more spiritual, more meaningful to theaverage person than what was available in the empire. It was a vision of a worldtransformed, and there was good reason why many embraced it. The world rejectionthat Christianity taught was arguably a valid response to the world in which itappeared, in which life was cheap and the individual dispensable, and charityand love in short supply. There was a felt sense that something had to change,that life was about something more serious than what most people saw aroundthem—a not uncommon feeling in our own time—and for many, Christianity met thatneed. It is one of the tragedies of history that what began as an alternative tofire and the sword too soon descended into the very thing it came to overcome.Whoever or whatever was responsible, by 476, when Romulus Augustulus, the lastemperor of the western Roman empire, was deposed by Odoacer, the first king ofItaly, ancient Rome was no more. In recent times historians have questioned theaccuracy of the term “dark ages,” yet the fall of Rome nevertheless ushered inan age of what we can call “endarkenment.” Different barbarian hordes—Goths,Huns, Vandals—filled the power vacuum and hacked away at the corpse of theempire. It was a time when “violence, ignorance, and anarchy swept over Europelike a tide.”10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber249] The learning that hadcharacterized Athens and Alexandria was scattered on the winds. It was not atime when esoteric knowledge, or any other kind, could flourish, yet here andthere, in small, inconspicuous ways, some of what remained was gathered andpreserved. In 529, the same year that saw the end of the Platonic Academy,Benedict of Nursia, the “father of Christian monasticism in the West,” foundedthe first Benedictine monastery in Monte Cassino, Italy.11[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber250] So began “the most important religious orderin western Christianity.”12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber251]There had been monastic Christian communities in the deserts of Egypt, and bythis time, the Celtic church, independent of Rome, had also set up monasticcommunities in the British Isles.13 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber252] Benedictimported the idea to a West ravaged by war, famine, and social collapse, andstrove to create small, self-sufficient enclaves where the work of civilizationcould carry on. The dictum ora et labora, “pray and work,” became the guidingspirit behind the Benedictine order, in which the disciplines of spirit andfruitful action were combined. Benedictine monks were devoted to God, but theyalso tilled the land. In a way, we can see the early monasteries as attempts tolive “off the grid,” to detach themselves from the turbulent macrocosm aroundthem and achieve a harmony in a microcosmic way. As Rodney Collin writes in TheTheory of Celestial Influence, in the monastery “all that was of value of thepast was kept—Greek and Roman manuscripts copied, Byzantine symbologytransferred to painted miniatures, secrets of music and medicine preserved, the‘opus dei’ or work of regeneration attempted.”14[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber253]Whether or not “esoteric schools,” as Collin suggests, were behind the movement,which quickly spread, the effect was the same. The monasteries acted as a kindof time capsule, in which the elements of a new flowering could be preservedamid the chaos and dangers of the outer world. Here the seeds of a new beginningcould be kept safe and nurtured until the time was right for them to sprout. Itis difficult for us to grasp exactly what it meant to live in this time.15[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber254] In our age of almost instantaneous retrievalof the past, the idea that the past is not always available seems strange. Yetit was certainly true in the Dark Ages, and they were dark for precisely thisreason. The “Great Memory,” in William Anderson’s term, on which new generationsdraw for inspiration, is not always available, and at this time it would be somecenturies before what was left of the western mind could call on it again.16[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber255]Yet what was preserved was shared. Another important service the monasteriesperformed was the communication of ideas. Pilgrimages from monastery tomonastery—a kind of spiritual tourism—helped spread knowledge from one center toanother, and kept lines of communication open at a time when travel remainedunsafe. The age this fractured fledgling Europe found itself in may not havebeen as dark as earlier accounts suggest, but it was certainly dim, and thelight would not return to it for some time. And when it did, it came, as alldawns do, from the East.FACING EASTAs different peoples in the West picked over what remained of the Roman Empire,another world civilization was coming to power: Islam. Readers familiar withHermetic history may wonder why in writing of Alexandria, I made only a briefmention of alchemy. Although its roots lie in Egypt—indeed the word “alchemy” isthought by some to stem from the Arabic al-kemi, “out of Egypt”—alchemy as apractice and subject of study does not really appear in the West until thethirteen century, with figures like Albertus Magnus (Albert the Great,1200–1280) and Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274).17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber256]Its heyday as a more spiritual, as opposed to a predominately practical,discipline concerned with the transmutation of metals is even later, followingthe Renaissance. (Other forms of alchemy also arose in China and India, roughlyaround the same time as it did in Egypt.18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber257])Although in the popular mind, alchemy is still seen as at best a precursor tochemistry and at worst the fanciful pursuit of turning lead into gold, studentsof esoteric history know that at its heart it was—is—a spiritual discipline,aimed at the transformation of the self, a goal it shares with other esotericpractices. Alchemy was active in Alexandria and although the Corpus Hermeticumdoes not speak of it, in figures like Zosimus of Panopolis (fl. ca. 300 A.D.),called “the father of alchemy,” we can see a blend of alchemical and Hermeticideas and teachings, especially in his famous Visions.Space does not allow me to go into detail about Zosimos and his Hermetic andGnostic connections; readers can find more about this in The Quest for HermesTrismegistus.19 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber258] One thing I will mention isthat the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, the most famous alchemical textof all, is not part of the Corpus Hermeticum. The alchemists themselves did notmake much use of these Hermetic writings, although they did see HermesTrismegistus as the patron saint of their work.20[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber259] The earliest known version of the EmeraldTablet is found in the work of the great Arabic alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan(721–815), known to the West as Geber, and dates from the ninth century. It isbelieved to be a translation from Syriac. As yet, no Greek original of theEmerald Tablet—the language in which the Corpus Hermeticum was written—has beenfound.Alchemy spread from a fading Alexandria to a rising Arabic East when Amr ibnal’Aas, mentioned earlier, conquered the city in 639. Amr ibn al’Aas may nothave appreciated the wealth of literature he had acquired by plundering thecity—as his alleged burning of the library’s collection suggests—but thosearound him did, and Arab scholars and philosophers soon demanded translations ofthe Greek and Latin texts that had fallen into their hands. Works onmathematics, medicine, philosophy, and other disciplines were speedily turnedinto Arabic, as were many alchemical texts. The first known Arab alchemist wasKhalid ibn Yazid (660–704) of Damascus. He is said to have studied under aByzantine monk named Morienus, who had himself studied under Stephanos (fl.610–640), one of the last alchemists of Alexandria, who left the city in the endand headed to Byzantium. Khalid was an Umayyad prince, and Morienus agreed totutor him in hopes of converting him to Christianity. Morienus apparentlysucceeded in transmuting some lead into gold, but his hopes of transmutingKhalid into a Christian soon faded when the prince, angry that his courtalchemists could not match Morienus’s skill, had them executed. Understandably,Morienus fled. Khalid’s less reprehensible contribution to alchemy was to havemany Greek alchemical texts translated into Arabic.The most important Arab alchemist was, as mentioned, Jabir ibn Hayyan, who wasborn in Tus, Khorasan, in Iran. It is said that our word “gibberish” is rootedin Jabir’s incomprehensible writings, but there is debate about this. He beganhis alchemical studies in Kufa (in present-day Iraq), where he is said to havestudied with Ja’far al-Sadiq (700–765), a learned man who was known as the sixthImam, a spiritual leader in succession from the Prophet Mohammed. Ja’faral-Sadiq was also a Sufi, a follower of the esoteric path in Islam. Jabir cameto be known also as “Al-Sufi,” and like the Sufis, as well as like the ancientEgyptians, he believed that the true seat of human intelligence was not thebrain, but the heart, an idea we have spoken of in connection with Schwaller deLubicz. Like the Arab world in general, Sufism profited by the esoteric exodusfrom Alexandria, and it embraced the Neoplatonism and Hermetism that had madetheir way east. Like Neoplatonism and Hermetism, Sufism sought union with thedivine, what it calls tawhid, or “unity of being,” and it employed meditation,prayer, ritual, and most famously dance, to achieve this end. The order of theMevlevi dervishes, founded in the thirteenth century by the Sufi mystical poetRumi (1207–1273), with their hypnotic whirling, is the most recognizable imageof the Sufis in the West.The beginning of Sufism dates from the first two centuries following thefounding of Islam in 622, rather as Gnosticism dates from the first twocenturies following the founding of Christianity. It is said to get its namefrom the rough wool or suf garments its practitioners wore, to distinguishthemselves from the fine apparel worn by the Islamic court. The Sufis wereascetic ecstatics devoted to the love of Allah, and they traced their lineageback to Ali, the Prophet’s son-in-law, hence they are part of Shia Islam.In Baghdad, Jabir came under the protection of the court of Harun al-Rashid(763–809), the famous caliph of The Thousand and One Nights. Here he practicedalchemy, but also pursued Aristotelian science; more than Plato, Aristotlebecame the Arabic philosopher of choice; outside of the esoteric community,Jabir is known today much more for his work in chemistry than for his alchemicalcontributions. Harun al-Rashid was a lover of learning and culture, and amongmany other cultural and scholarly projects, in 750 he established the “House ofWisdom” in Baghdad, a seat of learning that rivaled Alexandria and made Baghdada center of knowledge, culture, and trade. This was the “Golden Age of Islam,” atime when the Arabic world was the unchallenged hub of science and civilization.While Europe slumbered in its Dark Ages, the Arabic world was alight withenlightenment. Yet much of the light it enjoyed had its source in the esotericteachings it had inherited from the West.PAGANS AND THE PROPHETAs the source of his alchemical knowledge, Jabir cited the Greek and Egyptiangods, as well as Pythagoras, Hermes Trismegistus, and Agathodaimon, a figure whoappears in the Corpus Hermeticum as one of Hermes’ disciples.21[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber260] While a triumphant Christianity sought toeliminate all trace of its pagan rivals, the Arabic world in which Neoplatonism,Gnosticism, and Hermetism found themselves seemed to welcome them with openarms, at least for a time. As the Greeks found important similarities betweentheir god Hermes and the Egyptian Thoth, so the Arabs found that HermesTrismegistus had much in common with their prophet Idris (whom they alsoassociated with the biblical Enoch). When Alexandria became unsafe for paganphilosophy, many of its Neoplatonists and Hermetists left and made their way tothe ancient city of Harran in northern Mesopotamia (now Anatolia in Turkey).Harran is no more. It was founded in 2000 B.C. but in 1271 A.D. it was destroyedby Mongol invaders, and all that remains of it are ruins. But in its day it wasan important trading hub—its name means “crossroads”—and it appears in the Bibleas the place Abraham visited after leaving the city of Ur.22[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber261] Harran is also the site of an ancient copperindustry, but it was its ancient university that attracted many Alexandrianpagans fleeing Christian intolerance. With them they brought the eclectic wisdomthat characterized Alexandria, teachings from the Magi, the Chaldeans, the Jews,the Greeks, even the Christians. Yet it was Hermes Trismegistus that made thestrongest impact on the Harranians, who came to worship him as a great teacherand sage. Parts of the Corpus Hermeticum became a sacred text in Harran, and theancient city became one of the last outposts of pagan thought. When Christianstried to convert the populace, most refused, which led to Harran being known asthe “city of pagans.” For Christians this became a mark against the Harranians,but their loyalty to Hermes Trismegistus served them well when dealing withtheir later Arab conquerors.By the mid-seventh century, Syria and Mesopotamia came under Arab rule, and in744 the Umayyad Caliph Marwan II moved his capital to Harran. The capital wassoon moved back to Baghdad, and in 830, while on campaign against theByzantines, the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma’mūn passed through Harran. When he askedthe people what their religion was, they answered, “We are Harranians.” Notsatisfied with this, he pressed them to be more specific. Were they Muslims,Christians, Jews, or Magians—all people protected by the Koran? The Harraniansreplied no. When al-Ma’mūn asked about their holy books and prophets, they wereeven less forthcoming. Al-Ma’mūn accused them of idolatry and informed them thatif they had not converted to Islam or to some other belief sanctioned by theKoran by the time he returned, he would be forced to execute them.Understandably some Harranians converted to Islam and some to Christianity. Butthe majority refused and remained pagans, yet they sought some way out of theirdilemma. They consulted a Muslim jurist, who suggested that they call themselvesSabians, one of the religions sanctioned by the Koran, and who were known toworship the angels in the form of the seven ancient planets—a strong link to theHermetists. For a sacred text they chose the Corpus Hermeticum and for theirprophets they chose Hermes Trismegistus, whom, as mentioned, the Arabsassociated with their prophet Idris, and Agathodaimon, whom the Arabs equatedwith Seth, a son of Adam. This protective coloring proved successful and thepagans of Harran were allowed to live. Thus Harran’s Hermetists—now known asSabians—were allowed to work and study undisturbed and Harran remained a havenfor philosophy for some time.23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber262]Perhaps the most famous of Harran’s pagans was the Arabic scholar Thabit ibnQurra (835–901). Thabit attended Harran’s university, where he quicklyestablished his brilliance. But following a schism among Harran’s Hermetists,Thabit left Harran for Baghdad. Here Thabit became close to the caliph. Heearned favor in the court and was invited to study at the House of Wisdom. Someof Thabit’s fellow Harranians followed him, and together they formed anindependent Hermetic school in Baghdad. They too took the name of Sabians, andhearing of this, many of Harran’s Hermetists left Harran to join Thabit’s pagancommunity. Here they formed a Neoplatonic academy, with the Hermetic books astheir central texts.Thabit wrote on a wide range of subjects: mathematics, logic, astronomy,medicine, astrology, magic, the “occult sciences”; it is unclear if he had aninterest in alchemy, as no alchemical texts by him have come down to us. Thabitalso made many translations from Greek to Arabic, and as a whole the HarranianHermetists were known as excellent translators, a talent that was also observedin the mysterious Brethren of Purity, a community of Hermetic scholars intenth-century Basra, that produced an encyclopedia of esoteric science, theRasā’ il, which proved important for Sufism. The Brethren of Purity weremysterious, in the sense that we know little about them; their dates areuncertain, as is their membership and their links to Sufism, Shiism, Ismailism,or to the Sabians of Harran. Their aim, however, was to integrate the teachingsof the ancient philosophers with the Koran, and like many we have looked at,they recognized a primordial revelation of sacred knowledge from which HermesTrismegistus, Pythagoras, Plato, as well as Abraham, Jesus, and Mohammed,drew.24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber263]Thabit’s core love was philosophy. Thabit and his followers saw themselves as“the heirs and propagators of Paganism,” the philosophy of Plato and theNeoplatonists. For Thabit, it was pagans who “civilized the world and builtcities,” who “taught the hidden wisdom,” and to whom “the Deity revealeditself.” It was pagans who “discovered the art of healing the soul . . . and thebody” and who “filled the earth with wisdom, which is the highest good.”According to Thabit, “without paganism the world would be empty andmiserable.”25 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber264]Thabit wrote this celebration of pagan philosophy while living in Baghdad; thissuggests that for a time at least, the Muslim world was tolerant of, and evenopen to, the influx of Hermetic and Neoplatonist ideas. To say that thedeity—Allah—revealed itself to “philosophers”—a term of abuse for fundamentalistMuslims—was tantamount to heresy. But Thabit was able to say it without censure.This liberality of thought would continue for some time, and after Thabit’sdeath, the work of his followers would carry on, contributing to Islam’s GoldenAge of learning. Yet by the middle of the eleventh century, the tide had turnedand a new orthodoxy was establishing itself. Thabit had said that “happy is hewho, for the sake of paganism, bears the burden of persecution with firmhope.”26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber265] It would not be long before one ofthe Prophet’s pagans would have an all too concrete opportunity to test thetruth of this noble sentiment.SUHRAWARDI, MARTYR AND ILLUMINISTBy the mid-eleventh century, the liberalism that allowed pagans like Thabit ibnQurra to express their love of pagan philosophy without censure had faded and anew intolerant fundamentalism had settled into the Arab world. An orthodoxy onceopen to the influx of esoteric ideas and insights coming from a declining Westhad now closed ranks. Much as would happen with the Renaissance Hermeticists’attempts to leaven the logos of Christianity with Hermetic ideas, Arab religiousthinkers decided that since with the Prophet and the Koran they had all that wasnecessary for salvation, there was no need to adulterate their pure teachingswith Greek philosophy. The eclectic, syncretic, and synthesizing character ofesotericism was anathema to those who believed they had the Truth at hand. Andso paganism and the philosophies associated with it became heretical. No onefelt the force of this conservatism more than the Persian theosopher,Neoplatonist, and Gnostic Suhrawardi (1155–1191), who was executed in Aleppo(present day Syria) on charges of heresy.Our knowledge of Suhrawardi’s life is minimal. He was born in Suhraward, avillage located near the present-day towns of Zanjan and Bijar Garrus innorthwest Iran. He studied Aristotle and the great Persian polymath Avicenna(980–1030) in nearby Maragheh with Majd al-Din Jaili, who was the teacher of thetheologian and philosopher Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi. He then went to Isfahan, wherehe studied logic with Zahir al-Farisi. After this, Suhrawardi seems to havespent some years on an “initiatory quest” or “journey for knowledge,” anitinerary common to many of our secret teachers. He traveled through Anatolia,during which time he came into contact with many Sufi masters, among them Fakhral-Din al-Mardini. Fakhr al-Din al-Mardini was an unusual Sufi, professingAristotelian leanings along with more mystical ones, and this uncommoncombination would have a lasting effect on Suhrawardi. Suhrawardi’s earlybiographer, Shams al-Din Shahrazuri, relates that Suhrawardi became a Sufi, yetsome accounts suggest that while he studied with and learned much from them, henever fully joined the Sufis. That he is rarely mentioned in histories of Sufismsuggests he was more of a fellow traveler than true convert.27[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber266] Yet the point seems merely academic. Sufi ornot, Suhrawardi lived the Sufi life: he was an ascetic; had no interest inwealth, power, or rank; prayed incessantly; and loved sama, the Sufi music anddance. He was prone to solitary meditation, often kept a vow of silence, andfrequently wore the suf garments that gave the Sufis their name. Yet he alsoseemed to move among the finely dressed courtiers of Anatolia, and one of hisearly works is dedicated to one of the minor rulers in this area.One reason why Suhrawardi may have declined to take the final step to becoming afull Sufi is that he saw as his task the fruitful and necessary dialogue betweenphilosophy and ecstatic surrender, between thought and mystical vision, a rareblend he first encountered in Fakhr al-Din al-Mardini. He recognized theimportance of Aristotle—Avicenna had taught him that—yet he saw that the Greeksage’s philosophy needed to be surpassed. Yet he also saw that the ecstatic loveof the divine that Sufism pursued was itself not enough. His work was “addressedprecisely to those who aspire at once to both mystical experience andphilosophical knowledge,” and he made clear that it should be transmitted only“to him who is worthy, chosen from among those who have given evidence of asolid knowledge of the peripaticians’ philosophy, while their hearts arenevertheless captured by love for the divine Light.”28[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber267] Suhrawardi saw that what was needed was boththe heart and the mind, the essence of esoteric work, or, as we might say, bothsides of our cerebral hemispheres, whose creative union brings a true vision ofreality. Thought or feeling alone did not suffice. What was needed was to rootthought in the self-evident soil of inner spiritual experience.Suhrawardi arrived in Aleppo in 1183; according to Shahrazuri, at his entry intothe city he was dressed as a dervish. Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (1138–1193),known to the West as Saladin, had conquered Aleppo that year, and he had madehis son, al-Malik al-Zahir, temporary governor. Suhrawardi soon became closewith the young governor and eventually became his tutor, but he also veryquickly gained the enmity of the local jurists and ulama, or scholars of theKoran, for his skill in debate and dialectics. Although like them a SunniMuslim—here, perhaps, is another reason for his reluctance to fully convert toShia Sufism—Suhrawardi did not hesitate to point out where dogma had got thebetter of their thought. Had Suhrawardi lived a century or so earlier, thismight not have caused him much grief. But in the climate of orthodoxy thatreigned at the time, such forthrightness was costly. As mentioned earlier, theterm “philosopher” is one of abuse for orthodox Muslims, suggesting a penchantfor the “noise of words” the Gnostics had deplored, and it was becoming veryclear that Suhrawardi belonged to their ilk.It was during this time that Suhrawardi completed his major work, Hikmatal-Ishraq (The Philosophy of Illumination, 1186), also known as OrientalTheosophy, in which he attempted to revive the philosophy of ancient,pre-Islamic Persia, an esoteric metaphysics of Light that had much in commonwith the wisdom traditions of Alexandria, especially Neoplatonism.29[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber268] As Suhrawardi wrote, “There was among theancient Persians a community of people guided by God who thus walked the trueway, worthy Sage-Philosophers . . . It is their precious philosophy of Light,the same as that to which the mystical experience of Plato and his predecessorsbears witness, that we have revived in our book.”30[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber269] It was this same philosophy of light,transmitted by Dionysius the Areopagite, that would inspire the soaring,illuminated interiors of the Gothic cathedrals.As Gemistos Plethon would some centuries later, Suhrawardi spoke of an initiaticchain, a school of ancient adepts, comprising Hermes Trismegistus, Zoroaster,Pythagoras, Plato, and Plotinus, as well as a series of Iranian-Islamicteachers. This mystical lineage, he argued, articulated the one true revelation,the prisca theologia and perennially illuminating philosophy, that it was hisgoal to resurrect. His aim was to revive “the ancient wisdom which has neverceased to be taken as a pivot by the Imams [Guides] of India, Persia, Chaldea,Egypt, as well as those of ancient Greece up to Plato, and from which they drewtheir own theosophy; this wisdom is the Eternal Leaven.”31[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber270]Such objectives and beliefs, while essential to the esoteric history of westernconsciousness, did not go down well with Aleppo’s orthodoxy. The jurists andulama complained that Suhrawardi defended the “philosophers” too well, that hisideas were heretical, and that they would influence the young governor andmislead the people. They also accused Suhrawardi of claiming to be a prophet andof performing magic—both highly heretical acts. Suhrawardi denied these charges,but the accusations stuck and his protestations were ignored. As Socrates hadcenturies earlier, Suhrawardi found himself accused of corrupting the young. Andjust as Socrates’ accusers did, those who saw Suhrawardi as a threat demanded hebe put to death.Letters from Aleppo’s magistrate reached Saladin in Damascus, his capital, andthey did not speak well of the “philosopher.” Suhrawardi, the magistratedeclared, was a threat to the public good and a heretic. These charges werebrought against Suhrawardi by those he had bested in debate, and were fueled byenvy of his influence, but by this time this barely mattered. Saladin saw themagistrate’s point—he had no love for “philosophers” and most likely felt thatone dead one was better that many angry mullahs—and ordered his son to executehis tutor. (Saladin, a conservative Sunni, may have felt that Suhrawardi’steachings were much too Shia; and Suhrawardi’s belief in the fundamental unityof all religions—the essence of the perennial philosophy—might not have been toopopular during the Crusades.)Al-Malik al-Zahir at first declined to order the execution, but when pressured,he capitulated. Exactly how Suhrawardi was murdered is unclear. Some accountssay he was starved to death, denied food or drink. Some say he was strangled,others beheaded, and still others suggest a crucifixion.32[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber271] However it was done, Suhrawardi was henceforthknown as the Shaikh al-Maqtul, “the murdered Master,” as well as the Shaikhal-Ishraq, “the Master of Illumination.” Like Hypatia, Suhrawardi died for hisphilosophy.THE IMAGINAL WORLDIn recent times, Suhrawardi’s philosophy has gained a new following through thework of the French philosopher and historian of religion Henry Corbin(1903–1978), one of the great esoteric scholars of the twentieth century and acentral figure in what we can call a modern “esoteric academy,” the EranosConferences held in Switzerland from the 1930s on. Through Corbin’s works—TheMan of Light in Iranian Sufism, Cyclical Time and Ismaili Gnosis, and The Voyageand the Messenger among others—the modern reader is introduced to an idea thatruns throughout esoteric thought but is articulated in Corbin’s “spiritualhermeneutics” in perhaps its clearest and most eloquent expression. This is thenotion of the ‘âlam al-mithâl, or, as Corbin calls it, the Mundus Imaginalis, orImaginal World. This, Corbin writes, is a “very precise order of reality, whichcorresponds to a precise mode of perception,” which, for Suhrawardi, is based ona “visionary spiritual experience” that the Shaikh al-Ishraq considered “asfully relevant as the observations of Hipparchus or Ptolemy are considered to berelevant for astronomy.”33 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber272]What this means is that the world of visions that informs Suhrawardi’sphilosophy is perceived through the organs, not of the senses, but of theimagination—we can call them “organs of inner vision”—and what they perceive inthis realm is as real as what astronomers see when they observe the stars. Thatis, the Imaginal World, though located (metaphorically) within our own ourpsyches (and where are they located, precisely?) and hence to that extent“subjective,” is in reality as “objective” as the outer world known to oursenses. Earlier I spoke of Dionysius the Areopagite’s notion of the viapositiva, the approach to the spiritual by way of images and symbols, that is,through the imagination. It is through Suhrawardi’s ‘âlam al-mithâl, Corbin’sImaginal World, that one passes when taking that route.Corbin coined the term “Imaginal” for this realm of being which occupies thesame place in Suhrawardi’s ontology as the intermediary realm of theNeoplatonist’s Anima mundi, the Hermetic “journey through the planets,” andDionysius’s angelic hierarchy. This was necessary in order to differentiate itfrom our term “imaginary.” Brought up on “realist,” utilitarian notions ofreality (that is, left-brain notions), we think of the imagination as either apoor substitute for actuality—as when we “imagine” what we did last summer—orflights of fancy (“that’s just your imagination”). We may accept a more valuedappreciation of it when we realize that it is imagination that fuels great worksof art and informs all breakthroughs in science. Yet the idea that theimagination constitutes an entire world of its own, just as objective as oursensory world, with its own laws, geography, history, and, most difficult toaccept, inhabitants, is, for most of us, too much to swallow. Yet this isprecisely what Suhrawardi and all the other secret teachers tell us.The “Imaginal” is the world that lies between the purely intelligible—that is,conceptual—world of Plato’s Forms (the Intellect in Plotinus’s philosophy) andthe purely material world of the senses.34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber273] Itis, as Corbin writes, “ontologically as real as the world of the senses and thatof the intellect.”35 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber274] It partakes of andinforms both in the sense that in it, the pure abstract Ideas are clothed insymbols, and the brute objects of the physical world can become imbued withsymbolic significance. We enter it every night when we dream, and some intrepidexplorers have entered it while fully conscious. To jump ahead somewhat: C. G.Jung’s “descent into the unconscious,” Swedenborg’s journeys to heaven and hell,Rudolf Steiner’s “readings” of the “Akashic record,” to name perhaps the mostwell-known modern journeys into the interior, all took place within the MundusImaginalis. While there, each of these “mental travelers”—in the secret teacherWilliam Blake’s phrase—discovered, as Aldous Huxley did following his ownvoyages into these inner realms, that the mind “still has its darkest Africas,its unmapped Borneos and Amazonian basins” and that “the creatures inhabitingthese remoter regions of the mind are exceedingly improbable.” As all our secretteachers did, Huxley recognized that at “the antipodes of everydayconsciousness” (we could say, left-brain consciousness), we find “the world ofVisionary Experience.”36 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber275] It was that worldthat Suhrawardi sought to explore.THE INNER VOYAGESuhrawardi wanted to anchor his philosophy in his immediate experience, hisgnosis. And so like the Hermetists and Gnostics, he undertook the innervoyage.37 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber276] His destination was Nâ-Kojâ-Abâd,“the country of no-where.”38 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber277] This did not meana place that did not exist. It meant an interior place, an inner location thatcould not be found in any external “where” or on any map—that is, any physicalterrain. In Suhrawardi’s “hierarchy of light,” our physical world occupies thesame position as it does in the Hermetic ladder of planets and the Neoplatonistchain of descending emanations. We experience it as an “outside,” “external”world because we are far removed from its source, which, paradoxically, iswithin ourselves. For Suhrawardi, creation is an overflow, a radiance, from anoriginal Supreme Light of Lights. This is a pure, immaterial light, as is thespiritual light of Neoplatonism. Radiations emerge from this Supreme Light in adescending scale, giving rise to what Suhrawardi calls “horizontal light,” whichserves the same function as the Platonic Forms. In a sense we can say that,according to Suhrawardi, our physical world is made of “hardened” or “dense”light, something that used to be science fiction but which seems to becomingscience fact.39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber278]Borrowing from Zoroastrianism, Suhrawardi sees this “ladder of light” as anangelic hierarchy, in which each angel is the different level of reality orstate of consciousness (the two are the same). And as with the Gnostics and theHermetists, it is the theosopher’s desire to ascend this angelic ladder andreturn to his source. As we have seen with other inner voyagers, the first stepin this journey is to detach oneself from the body, from worldly matters andconcerns. By doing this, one is ready for the voyage within, remembering, in aslight paraphrase of Corbin, that the metamorphosis of the knowing subject isthe real voyage for the gnostic philosopher.40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber279]Rather than present his accounts of inner voyaging in abstract, conceptual termsas Plotinus did, Suhrawardi gives us a series of visionary tales, spiritualstories in which the narrative, characters, and setting symbolize the spiritualrealities the inner voyager encounters, much as we know dreams do. As Suhrawardiwants to present an Imaginal World, one of images, he can’t do otherwise. Yet inour dreams we are still subject to the influences of the sleeping body; whatSuhrawardi has in mind can be seen as a kind of “conscious dreaming,” dreamingwhile wide awake, perhaps more awake than in our normal waking state. Althoughthe stories differ in detail, in essence they share the same structure. Freeinghis consciousness from the concerns of the body and entering a meditation, thevoyager finds himself in the presence of a supernatural being, much as HermesTrismegistus does at the beginning of the Poimandres. The being asks thevoyager, who is generally known as “the stranger,” who he is and where he comesfrom. The stranger replies that he is a traveler who aspires to return home, tohis true homeland beyond the world of the senses. This journey will take himbeyond Mount Qâf, the “cosmic mountain,” which is made up of the celestialspheres he must surmount, much as the Hermetists did. There, beyond Mount Qâf,the stranger will find his true, higher self, and he will approach the“spiritual city,” Hūrqalyā, which starts at the “convex surface” of the “NinthSphere, or Sphere of Spheres” which encompasses the whole cosmos.When he steps beyond this sphere, something remarkable and, for most modernminds, incomprehensible happens. The entire outer world is seen to be containedwithin the inner one. Paradoxically, by going inward, we find ourselves outsidethe “outer world.” As Corbin puts it, “once the journey is completed, thereality which has hitherto been an inner and hidden one turns out to envelop,surround or contain that which at first was outer and visible.”41[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber280]In The Caretakers of the Cosmos, I speak of our “inside out” condition,expressed in the aphorism of the “unknown philosopher” Louis Claude deSaint-Martin that “It is necessary to explain things by man and not man bythings,” meaning that we are wrong to try to explain man by the world, when theworld should be explained in terms of man.42 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber281]The same can be said for our consciousness. We generally think of ourselves as“contained” within the world—the cosmos—and of our consciousness as containedwithin our head, or brain. But beyond Mount Qâf, beyond, that is, the top of theladder of light, the opposite appears to be true: the cosmos is contained withinour consciousness, which is itself not limited to some metaphorical space withinmy skull, but is the space in which all “spaces” can exist. We see that thehitherto outer world has become a symbol of the inner one, and that acorrespondence exists between all the different levels or worlds and the statesof consciousness associated with them.TRUE IMAGINATIONOur first reaction to this may be “That’s fine, but how do you know this isn’tjust your imagination, in our usual sense of the word? How do you know it isn’ta fantasy?” The inner voyager has to ask himself this too, and learn thedifference between the imaginatio vera, the “true imagination,” and sheersubjective fancy. True imagination has a cognitive, noetic value; it is an organof knowledge. We learn from it and can come away from our inner voyaging withsome practical, effective understanding, and not merely the pleasure of havingbeen on a “trip.” As the poet and Blake scholar Kathleen Raine says, there is a“learning of the imagination,” and like anything worth knowing, its lessonsdemand hard work and concentration. True imagination is not sheer whimsy orarbitrary novelty; it works within a canon of symbols, images, and metaphors, atradition that is manifest in its expressions. While our modern positive notionof imagination looks to it for the “new” and “original”—which often amounts tothe subjective and “shocking”—the Imaginal tradition finds the original in whatis close to the origin, to the primal, the archetypal, and which appears indifferent but resonant symbols in the different esoteric teachings.These symbols have a definite relation to each other, much as the grammar andsyntax of any language do, and the traveler in the Imaginal must learn to readthem as he must read any language. This requires not “free association” or “bluesky thinking,” but a “new discipline of the imagination,” an “activeimagination,” a controlled inner seeing, not a parade of random thoughts.43[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber282] In this sense, the imagination is aninstrument one must learn to use properly, just as a scientist must learn to usehis microscope. In effect the inner voyager must learn how to discriminatebetween the objective landscapes and figures he encounters and his or her ownsubjective imagery, just as we learn how to discriminate between good art andbad. If we recognize the difference between a focused imagination, intent on itsobject, and the diffuse wanderings of daydreams and gratification fantasies, weare halfway there.TREES OF LIFEThe need for a disciplined imagination is a central part of another visionarytradition, whose codified form began to emerge first in France and then in Spainin the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In Chapter Three, I spoke of the Jewishmystical tradition of Merkabah, the “throne mysticism” based on Ezekiel’s visionof a flaming chariot. The practice of visualizing Ezekiel’s chariot in order toascend with it to the divine—much as the Hermetists ascended through the planetsto Nous—was part of the Jewish Heichalot, or “divine palace” mystical traditionof the first centuries A.D. This continued as an active tradition, embracingfasting, prayer, meditation, and incantation, until the emergence of Kabbalah inits modern form.Kabbalah, which means “receiving,” had in some form or another always been partof the mystical side of Judaism. It signifies a vast, complex, and sometimesconfusing amalgam of esoteric, meditative, and magical lore. It is not onespecific teaching—there is no central “book of Kabbalah”—but a general “umbrellaterm” covering a wide-ranging tradition, including theosophy—the wisdom ofGod—ecstatic meditative states, and magical and esoteric practices focused onthe hidden power of words. Letters and words have a significance and status inKabbalah quite unlike that in other esoteric traditions—understandably, givenJudaism’s proscriptions on imagery. It is said that to speak the name of Godcorrectly—known by the Greek term “Tetragrammaton,” which, oddly enough, means“four-letter word”—is to destroy the universe. Hence the true pronunciation ofYHVH remains secret, while it is the word “EMETH,” or “Truth,” written on theGolem’s forehead, which brings it to life in the old legends; rubbing out the“E,” which leaves “METH,” or “death,” destroys it. While the ecstatic andmagical aspects of Kabbalah are important and remain popular today, it is itstheosophical or esoteric character, in the sense of gnosis or knowledge, that isits real heart. Much as Stephen Hawking does in our time, Kabbalists want toknow the mind of God.Depending on your source, Kabbalah has its origins in Adam, Abraham, or Moses,each of whom, legend has it, received a divine revelation. But one likely andmore historical beginning for Kabbalah as we know it may be in theinterpretation of the Talmud developed in the Jewish academies that flourishedfrom the sixth to tenth centuries A.D. Like the other primal revelations we’vediscussed, Kabbalah shares in the perennial philosophy and prisca theologia, andin essence it is the esoteric reading of the Torah, a way of understanding God’splan in creation and our place in it. For most of its history, it was an oraltradition, passed down through the generations, and protected and kept hiddenfrom unworthy hands. But by late antiquity it had begun to take on the writtenform in which it is popularly known today. Although mainstream Judaism considersit nonsense, Kabbalah’s ecstatic side has a vital life in the Hassidictradition, which began in the eighteenth century, and since the 1970s, Kabbalahhas been one of the staples of New Age and “mind, body, spirit” literature. Oneof the earliest texts in Kabbalah is the Sefer Yetzirah, or Book of Creation,which was most likely composed sometime before the sixth century A.D. Legendascribes it to the first-century Rabbi Akiva, who was martyred by the Romans,but it was most likely written later than this.In the Sefer Yetzirah, creation is understood as the result of ten emanations orsephiroth (translated as “numbers” or “vessels”), containers of the creativeenergies emerging from the unmanifest and incomprehensible Godhead, which isknown as the En-Sof, or “limitless light.”44 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber283]As with many of our secret teachings, this invisible source is beyond anythingwe can comprehend. Yet we are not completely cut off from it, and Kabbalah hasits own rationale for bridging the gap between the via negativa and viapositiva. Although as in Islam, Judaism forbids any representations of thedivine in order to avoid idolatry, in the Kabbalistic tradition, the viapositiva is condoned as long as the practitioner knows that the imagery andsymbols he employs are a means to the divine, and not ends in themselves. Sowhile it is understood that God is ultimately beyond any of our conceptions, theKabbalist nevertheless meditates on God’s countenance, visualizing the “hairs ofhis head,” his “cranium,” the “nostrils of the ancient,” his “ears, hands,feet,” and other parts of the metaphorical anatomy of the divine. The Shi’urQomah, for example, a Midrashic text of the Heichalot tradition, provides theprecise measurements of God’s macrocosmic body. As one commentator remarks, “forthe Kabbalist, it was acceptable to portray God’s attributes in physical terms,on the understanding that it was an appropriate understanding of something thatwas beyond all corporeal expression.”45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber284] As inother esoteric traditions, one aim of Kabbalah is to discipline the nephesch, or“animal soul,” so that it can make way for the neschamah, or “higher soul.”Between the unmanifest source of creation and our own world there stands what isknown as the Otz Chiim, or Tree of Life, a diagram of the heavenly sephirothwhose elegant simplicity belies the complex reality it symbolizes. The Tree ofLife is another version of the ontological ladder we have seen with theNeoplatonists, the Hermetists, and the Gnostics, and while it shares with themthe archetypal theme of a kind of “stairway to heaven,” which the Kabbalistclimbs in order to know God, the breadth of its application can be stunning. Asone esoteric scholar remarks, “the Tree of Emanation is an almost infinitelycomplex constellation of symbols . . . a glyph for the whole of existence thatbears within it countless interrelated glyphs.”46[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber285] If for the Hermetist “that which is above islike that which is below,” the Kabbalist takes this same formula of“correspondence” and applies it tenfold.The ten sephiroth run from Kether, which is called “the Crown,” the firstemanation from the Godhead, to Malkuth, “the Kingdom,” which is the physicalworld. In between are Chokmah, “Wisdom”; Binah, “Understanding”; Chesed,“Mercy”; Geburah, “Severity”; Tiphereth, “Beauty”; Netsach, “Victory”; Hod,“Glory”; and Yesod, “Foundation.”47 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber286] Connectingthe ten sephiroth are twenty-two “paths” that correspond to the twenty-twoletters of the Hebrew alphabet, which, for Kabbalists, has esotericsignificance. Much as Pythagoras believed that numbers lay at the foundation ofthings, the Kabbalists believed that the Hebrew alphabet did.From its beginning in the Godhead to its end in our physical universe, creationpasses through four levels, or “worlds,” which correspond to the four levels ofscriptural interpretation, from the literal to the anagogic. Kabbalists intenton understanding the secret meaning of creation meditate on the different“paths” between the sephiroth, while visualizing different combinations andpermutations of letters, numbers, and geometric forms. Entering the ImaginalWorld, they find the landscapes and beings appropriate to their understanding,their encounters corroborated by the symbolic necessities of the journey. Eachof the creative energies contained in the sephiroth permeates the universe andenters into combinations with each other. And just as the Neoplatonic theurgistsemployed symbols and performed “mysterious acts” to attract the divine powers,the Kabbalist knows what symbols, names, or numbers “correspond” to the heavenlyenergies he wishes to understand. If an esoteric understanding of the world isbased on analogy—on the right-brain perception of the “network of connectionslinking everything with everything else”—then the Tree of Life is the mostcomplex and systematic representation we have of this.The Sefer ha-Zohar, or Book of Splendor, another central Kabbalist text, is avoluminous, complex, and often meandering mystical interpretation of the Torah.It appeared in Guadalajara, Spain, in 1286 and was said by its “discoverer,”Moses de León (1250–1305), to be an ancient work passed down through the ages,written by the second-century wonderworking Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai, a student ofRabbi Akiva. Most modern scholars believe it was written by León himself. Itsfive volumes comprise many different aspects of the tradition, including magicalspells, and like Suhrawardi, it includes stories and tales, most featuring RabbiYohai and his ten companions.Another important work, the Bahir or Book of Illumination, appeared in France inthe eleventh century. It is a fragmentary work, attributed to the first-centuryJewish sage Nehunya Ben HaKanah, but its true authorship is unknown; its jumbledcharacter suggests that more than one hand was involved in its conception. Itsgnomic paragraphs speak of the mystical significance of the shape of Hebrewletters, as well as the sacred names in magic, and describe, in a Neoplatonicfashion, the emergence of the subsequent sephiroth out of the first emanation ofthe divine, Kether, “the Crown.” Some scholars of Kabbalah, such as GershomScholem, suggest a pronounced Gnostic influence on the Bahir.Although for most of its existence Kabbalah remained strictly within a Jewishmilieu, in the Renaissance it was linked with the Hermetic and Platonictraditions. With these, it formed what became known as “Christian Kabbalah,” themost fiery proponent of which was Pico della Mirandola, whom we will meetfurther on. One of the heretical nine hundred theses that Pico was called on todefend before a panel of learned theologians in Rome was “There is no sciencewhich gives us more assurance of Christ’s divinity than magic and the Kabbalah.”It is understandable that the panel disagreed and that this, along with most ofPico’s other theses, were condemned. Pico’s Christian-Platonic-Hermetic varianton the ancient Jewish tradition informed the Kabbalistic magic associated withnineteenth-century occult figures like Eliphas Levi and groups like the HermeticOrder of the Golden Dawn, and continues to inform popular occultism today,although scholars of the Jewish mystical tradition like Gershom Scholem haveworked to purge Kabbalah of its popular occult character and return it to itsroots.48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber287]THE MIDDLE PILLARIn looking at the western esoteric tradition through the lens of the integrationof our two modes of consciousness, one is unavoidably drawn to the tripartitearrangement of the Tree of Life, its three “pillars.” In between the pillar ofMercy—made of Chokmah, Chesed, and Netzach—and the pillar of Severity—Binah,Geburah, Hod—stands the “middle pillar” of “harmony” or “balance,” Kether,Tiphereth, Yesod, and Malkuth. We can say that in Kabbalah, the middle pillarsymbolizes the transcendent function, the dynamic integration of the opposites,a kind of mystical “Goldilocks” state, in which the balance between the twoextremes is achieved and an esoteric condition of being “just right” is reached.Tiphereth, “Beauty,” is located at the center of the Tree of Life, and is thesephira with the most links to the other sephiroth. It is also the midpointbetween Kether and Malkuth, between, that is, the first emanation from theunmanifest En-Sof and ourselves.In Kabbalah, the first three sephiroth are known as “the Supernals.” Althoughnot quite so unmanifest as the En-Sof, the Supernals are still far beyond humancomprehension, and they exist in a realm that lies on the other side of what isknown as “the Abyss.”49 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber288] Although the Godheadis always in their sights—metaphorically, at least—we can say that for mostKabbalists, Tiphereth is the bull’s-eye. This suggests that this centralsephiroth and its middle pillar symbolize the union of our two modes ofconsciousness with which this book is concerned, the pillar of Severityencompassing “hard,” left-brain thinking, and the pillar of Mercy housing the“softer” mode of the right.THE RETURN OF NATURE AND THE RISE OF THE GOTHICIn 824, Emperor Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, asked the Byzantine emperorMichael the Stammerer for the loan of a book. It was the Greek text of Dionysiusthe Areopagite’s The Celestial Hierarchy. As Louis could not read Greek, he sentthe manuscript to the monastery of St. Denis, located north of Paris. Here, in636, the relics of St. Denis, the patron saint of France, were interred in thebasilica, and from the tenth to the eighteenth century, it was in St. Denis thatmost of the kings of France found their final resting place. The monks at St.Denis, one of whom was Louis’s cousin, tried to translate the manuscript intoLatin, but as their Greek was not much better than Louis’s, the result was lessthan satisfactory.Some years later, in 845, John Scotus Eriugena (815–877), an Irish monk andtheologian, accepted an invitation to come to France, to teach in the PalaceSchool founded by Charlemagne. While there, he agreed to translate themanuscript; as he was one of the few at that time who could read Greekproperly—his training as an Irish monk saw to that—this was fortunate. Hefinished the translation by 862, and thus, as we’ve seen, introduced to theendarkened West the light of Neoplatonism, seen through the acceptable gauze ofDionysius’s Christian ontology. Not since St. Augustine had Platonic ideas madesuch inroads into Christianity.Eriugena—the name means “born in Ireland”—translated more of Dionysius’s workand he also wrote books of his own, the most famous being Periphyseon (latertitled De divisione Naturae, On the Divisions of Nature). His philosophycombined his own interpretation of Dionysius with the beliefs of Gregory ofNyssa (335–395) and Maximus the Confessor (580–662), theologians of the easternOrthodox church who were influenced by Neoplatonism. Eriugena’s central visionis the Neoplatonic one of a transcendent God from whom all things flowhierarchically and to whom all things return. For Eriugena, the divine emerges“from itself” and returns “into itself,” and like Origen, another PlatonicChristian, Eriugena was a believer in apocatastasis, the doctrine thatultimately all beings will be saved and will share in the return of the originalparadise. As with Origen, this belief led to trouble with the church.Like Dionysius, Eriugena emphasizes the “wholly other” character of God, and hiswork is in the school of “negative theology.” Yet Eriugena’s vision included thenatural world, which had been ignored—demonized even—by the church as theprovince of paganism and the devil. Eriugena thought otherwise. He spoke ofnature’s “manifest theophanies”—how God appeared through it—and saw its beautyas evidence that the Godhead manifested both in negation, the via negativa, andin the celebration of the whole cosmos, the via positiva. For Eriugena, thedivine flows from formlessness into infinite forms, a Neoplatonic version of theHermetic formula of “the One, the All.” If for most of the Middle Ages “themedieval mind perceived the physical world as symbolic to its core,” withEriugena it began to appreciate the natural world for its own sake.50[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber289]This renewed concern with nature also manifested in the twelfth-century Schoolof Chartres, a center for Platonism in northern France, and at the time the mostimportant institution of learning in western Europe. Its members read Eriugena,Dionysius, the Neoplatonists, and whatever Plato they could find. In hisCosmographia, Bernardus Silvestris (1085?–1178?), one of the philosophers ofChartres, outlined a Neoplatonic cosmology delineating the hierarchicalstructure of the cosmos. In his scheme, the highest spirits dwell near theGodhead in the “Eighth Sphere”; the angels are associated with the planets; andthe divine hierarchy reaches down to the “sublunary discarnate beings,” beforebeginning its ascent.51 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber290] Although the churchhad tried to expunge Plato from its worldview, the Greek sage seemed to bemaking a comeback; in 1147, Pope Eugene III even commended Silvestris’sCosmographia, a sign that the injunction against pagan philosophy wasweakening.52 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber291]Eriugena’s reading of Dionysius emphasized the Neoplatonic centrality of light;in the School of Chartres, the focus was on what we can call “sacred geometry.”Of the few works of Plato available to the Chartres philosophers, one was apartial Latin translation of the Timaeus, in which Plato provides a myth of thecreation. Timaeus himself, who does most of the talking, was a Pythagorean, andnot surprisingly he voices the belief that number and geometry are at the rootof existence. The philosophers at Chartres were impressed with this; it seemedto lead to a rational understanding of Genesis, and they began to think of Godas a mathematician. In the natural forms around them they could see sacredgeometry at work—we saw some examples of this in Chapter One where I speak ofthe Golden Section—and in their manuscripts they began to picture the Creatorwith a compass. The idea that number, harmony, and proportion—all fundamentalPythagorean concerns—were at the heart of all creation took hold. When these metDionysius’s celebration of light, the ingredients for the Gothic were in place.THE AESTHETIC ABBOTThe man responsible for putting them together was Abbot Suger (1081–1151).Little is known of his early life. He was born into a humble family and at theage of ten began his education at the Abbey of St. Denis. During this time hemet the future king Louis VI of France, with whom he became friends; he wouldalso later befriend Louis VII. By 1109, Suger had become secretary to the abbotof St. Denis. Suger was a responsible, capable man who earned the respect ofthose around him. Louis VI used Suger as an envoy on many missions, some toRome, and on his return from a mission to Pope Gelasius II, who reigned for ayear in Montpellier, in 1122 Suger was made abbot of St. Denis.Suger had long wanted to remodel the abbey church. He was an aesthete and apatron of the arts, a man who, like Eriugena, saw the “manifest theophanies” ofnature, and also those in the works of man. He loved precious stones, gold, andstained glass, and collected many pieces of fine craftsmanship. He was also areader of Dionysius. In 1137, Suger decided to get to work.One of his aims in reconstructing the church was to have it be filled withlight, which, following Eriugena and Dionysius, Suger believed was the closestthing on earth to the divine. God may dwell in an impenetrable holy darkness,but when he manifests, he first appears as radiant light. One result of Suger’slight philosophy was the huge rose window above the west portal at St. Denis,the first of its kind. The rose window would soon become a signature of theGothic and serve as a kind of Christian mandala, harmonizing the twelve apostlesaround the figure of Jesus or his mother, while allowing the divine effulgenceto illuminate the cathedral’s interior. Another result was the highstained-glass windows that we associate with the Gothic. In order to accommodatethese, which demanded thinner walls than those of Romanesque churches, many newarchitectural features were required: the pointed arch, the ribbed vault, andthe flying buttress, as well as techniques in producing stained glass whichmodern methods have been unable to duplicate. Suger wanted to create a semblanceof heaven on earth, and the effect these cavernous illuminated interiors had onpeople used to the sturdy and stolid Romanesque churches must have beenastonishing. With the later additions of the soaring spires, Gothic masterpieceslike Chartres seemed to embody in stone and colored glass the hierarchicalcosmos of the Neoplatonists. They acted as a kind of spiritual rocket ship,sending its congregation shooting to the heavens, as well as a mysticallightning conductor, drawing down to Earth the divine energies, much as theNeoplatonic theurgists drew down the power of the gods.The interiors, designed according to sacred geometry, formed a space unlike thatof the everyday, and must have produced a sense that by stepping inside, one wasentering a much larger world.53 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber292] And when someof the earliest harmonized music, in the transition from plainsong to polyphony,was performed in places like Notre Dame de Paris, the otherworldly effect musthave been transformative.54 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber293] The harmonies ofsound and space must have given the congregation a sense of Pythagoras’s musicof the spheres.THE MYSTERY OF THE CATHEDRALSThe rise of the Gothic took place between 1150 and 1220, a brief period whichsaw a transformation of western consciousness, only some aspects of which I cantouch on here. It occurred during what has been dubbed the “twelfth-centuryRenaissance.” It was a remarkable burst of creativity and imagination the aim ofwhich was, according to some commentators, to embody a new image of mankind, toharmonize disparate elements in the medieval consciousness, and to present a“symbolic realization of universal humanity.”55[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber294] One reflection of this was the more human,personal character of the figures represented within the cathedrals’ walls,compared to those of Romanesque churches, which, for all their power, wererough-hewn and abstract. Just as the aim of Christianity was to perfect man, sotoo the Gothic images of Christ would present his humanity more perfectly. Thisrequired greater artistry, and more than one Gothic craftsman could echo thegoldsmith and lay brother Hughes de Dorgnies’s remark, “Let others sing Christwith their mouths; Hughes sings with his goldsmith’s work,” a pre-echo ofBlake’s belief that we worship God best through works of the imagination. Thisis an example of what William Anderson calls “Gothic joy,” a renewedappreciation of beauty.56 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber295]We do not know the names of the masons who built these marvels, which deserveour awe and wonder as much as the Sphinx and pyramids do. Even on a sheertechnical scale this is true: according to Jean Gimpel in The Medieval Machine,in France from the eleventh to the late thirteenth centuries, more stone wasquarried than in the whole history of ancient Egypt.57[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber296] Those responsible for building the Gothiccathedrals were truly secret teachers, and what they had to teach us stillremains a mystery. Much has been written about the symbols, images, and designsthat decorate the Gothic cathedrals. Some, like the mysterious alchemistFulcanelli—his real identity has never been disclosed—declare that they speak ofalchemical and esoteric knowledge in a secret language, what Fulcanelli calledargotique, a kind of esoteric slang.58 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber297] In LeMystère des Cathédrales, Fulcanelli claims that the term “gothic” originates notwith the Goths, but with the French word argot, which Fulcanelli defines as “alanguage peculiar to all individuals who wish to communicate their thoughtswithout being understood by outsiders.”59 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber298]Fulcanelli calls this a “spoken cabala,” the “green language” in which he claims“all the Initiates expressed themselves.”If nothing else, this does seem to fit the esoteric character of revealing byconcealing, of keeping sacred secrets safe from profane hands. Others, like P.D. Ouspensky, believed the Gothic cathedrals were the work of hidden esotericschools that used the church as “an instrument for the preservation andpropagation of the ideas of true Christianity,” of “true religion or trueknowledge” during the “superstitious, bigoted and scholastic Middle Ages.”60[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber299] Ouspensky and Fulcanelli may be right, andanyone who has visited Chartres, Notre Dame, or any other of the great Gothiccathedrals can be excused for believing that some deep, interior, and not whollyconscious work is taking place as one gazes at their strangely moving symbolsand images. More than one student of the Gothic has noted that along with theChristian and Platonic iconography—a figure of Pythagoras, for example, sitsover the west portal at Chartres—symbols and decorations linked to an earlierpagan past also appear.As William Anderson has pointed out, chevrons, spirals, and lozenges—allpatterns associated with the Great Goddess of the Neolithic period—formdecorations on many Romanesque churches, which also incorporate the image of theSheila-na-gig, a female figure revealing exaggerated genitals. Debate continuesover the meaning of these figures, but there is a strong argument that theyrepresent some continuation of a pre-Christian fertility religion. ManyChristian churches dedicated to the Virgin were built over ancient pagan sitesdedicated to goddesses such as Venus, Diana, Cybele, and Isis. A common featureof many of these churches is that they possess statues of the Black Virgin,which are believed to have miraculous powers. Chartres had one, until it wasdestroyed by anti-Christian sans-culottes during the French Revolution. And inthe center of the rose window of Chartres’s north transept, Mary, Jesus’smother, surrounded by radiating lozenges, has a black face.Why these Virgins should be black remains a mystery.61[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber300] As we saw in Chapter Three, the original cultstatue of the goddess Cybele had a black meteorite in place of its face. Theearliest known images of a mother holding a child on her lap, as representationsof Mary and the baby Jesus are often presented, are of Isis suckling her infantson, Horus, and an ancient name for Egypt was, as we’ve seen, “khem,” which issupposed to refer to the black alluvial soil of the Nile. Does the Black Virginlook back to early forms of the sacred feminine?One characteristic of early Christianity—if not throughout its whole history—isthe emphasis on the masculine side of the divinity at the expense of thefeminine. (If Leonard Shlain is right, the feminine has had a hard time of itduring the entire reign of the left brain.) It is no secret that practically allof the Gothic cathedrals were dedicated to Our Lady, Notre Dame. We know thatthe Gnostics had more appreciation of the feminine than did the Christians whobecame the official church, and that part of their mythology concerned thesearch for the goddess Sophia (Wisdom) and her release from bondage. We alsoknow that Sophia was a central character of the Solomonic books of the OldTestament. The Royal Portal of Chartres, the three doors that open into thecathedral in the west front, are surrounded by carvings depicting the works ofknowledge, science, and art (it is there that we find Pythagoras). Surmountingthese is a statue of the Virgin, seated on the throne of wisdom, from which shegives her blessing and guidance.Given that the School of Chartres was for a time “the most important civilizingforce in Europe,” as well as “the greatest shrine of the Virgin in westernEurope,” one can’t help but ask why the two are associated.62[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber301] Was this an attempt to bring thefeminine—which, all concerns about the simplistic character of the idea noted,we can associate with a right-brain mode of being—back into a masculine,left-brain dominated worldview? The official attitude of the church toward thefeminine can be gleaned from these remarks by Bernard of Cluny, atwelfth-century Benedictine monk. “Woman,” according to Bernard, was “sordid,perfidious, fallen.” She “besmirches purity, meditates impiety, corruptslife . . . woman is a wild beast, her crimes are like the sand . . . woman is aguilty thing, a hopelessly fleshy thing, nothing but flesh . . . all guile sheis, fickle and impious, a vessel of filth, an unprofitable vessel.”63[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber302] With such an assessment of the feminine comingfrom the author of De Contemptu Mundi (On Contempt of the World), woman’s longassociation with nature could not have helped her case. It is also clear thatsuch a negatively biased view would call out to be compensated by a morepositive assessment.There were other signs of a heightened appreciation of the feminine at thistime. Toward the end of the eleventh century, Europe saw the mysteriousappearance of the troubadours, Provençal poets who sang of their idealized lovefor an unobtainable woman. Much of their poetry was influenced by the Arthurianlegends, which captured the medieval imagination, and spoke of the knight whodedicates his valorous deeds to his lady love, Lancelot and Guinevere being thearchetypal pair. Both the Arthurian legends and the troubadours elevated womento something like a spiritual savior; William of Poitiers (1071–1126), the firstof the troubadours, declared “By her alone shall I be saved,” althoughapparently this did not prevent William from also being “one of the greatestdeceivers of ladies.”64 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber303] From the Mediterraneanthis popular movement of Platonic love—in the sense of its being unconsummated,although not always—spread to northern France, where the singers were calledtrouvères and then to Germany where the Minnesingers were known as the “terrorof the husbands.”65 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber304]The church did not think well of this development, and there is some suggestionthat the cult of the Virgin was created as a response to this growing eroticspirituality, in which “a vision of woman entirely at variance with traditionalmanners” was celebrated.66 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber305] For the troubadour,“woman was set above man,” a kind of Gnostic reversal of the church’s officialview, and was seen to embody an ideal love, far beyond “any attainable in thislife.”67 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber306]Although a satisfactory account of the origin of the troubadours remainsunwritten, links have been made between them and Sufi and Arabic poetry, whichspeak of the mystic’s love for the divine in highly erotic terms, and with thekind of Neoplatonic spirituality we have seen in Suhrawardi.68[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber307] That the Arab movement reached far into Spainand southern France suggests at least that this is a strong possibility. Anargument has also been made that the troubadours were influenced by the Catharheresy, a resurgence of Gnostic spirituality in the twelfth and thirteencenturies that for a time presented a viable threat to the dominance of Rome. InCrusade Against the Grail, the German esotericist and SS officer Otto Rahnargued that “all troubadours were Cathars,” and that the rhetoric of courtlylove was a code—or “green language”—for heretical beliefs, an argument putforward in the early twentieth century by the French Rosicrucian JoséphinPéladan in Le secret des troubadours (The Secret of the Troubadours).What was it about the Cathars that so troubled the church and what role, if any,did they play in the esoteric history of the West?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXSPIRITUAL LOVE IN THE WESTERN WORLD[../image/153618.jpg]In 1244, in the Languedoc region of southern France near the foothills of thePyrenees, a massacre took place that we would not be far wrong in calling “thelast stand of medieval Gnosticism.” At the end of a long and devastatingspiritual war, conducted with the kind of “meticulous brutality that mightarouse envy even among modern practitioners of genocide”—or so believes RichardSmoley in Forbidden Faith: The Gnostic Legacy from the Gospels to the Da VinciCode—225 high priests of what the church called “the Great Heresy” preferred toburn to death rather than recant their beliefs.1[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber308] The siege of their stronghold, the nearimpregnable castle of Montségur, lasted for months, and the heretics had strongsupport from local nobles. But as the days wore on and the heretics’ protectorsreached terms with the papal forces, it became clear that the end was in sight.It’s doubtful the true believers would have been spared had they chosen toreject their religion and return to the “true faith,” and they seem to haveaccepted their destiny with equanimity, even joy. Accounts say they went to theflames singing. Legends also say that just before the end, a small group of theElect managed to escape their stronghold and carry away with them a treasure.What exactly that treasure was and what happened to it remains a mystery.The “war against the Cathars,” or the Albigensian Crusade, began in 1209, whenPope Innocent III decided to wipe out a religious movement within westernChristianity that in essence revived the doctrines of the Gnostics of old. Itwas called the Albigensian Crusade because the first bishopric of this hereticalsect was established in the French town of Albi. But the sect’s other name, theCathars, tells us more about their spiritual character. It comes from the Greekword katharos, meaning “purified.” We have encountered this before, in speakingof the cathartic, purifying effect of the Dionysian and Orphic mysteries. TheCathars sought a similar purity. As some radical Gnostics sects did, theyembraced an austere metaphysical dualism, seeing the physical world of matter asthe work of an evil God, and as good only that which emanates from spirit. Thehard historical evidence linking the Cathars to the Gnostics and the Manicheansis, according to scholars, meager and highly controversial; yet a familiaritywith the beliefs of these groups suggests the kind of “ahistorical continuity”between them that Arthur Versluis speaks of. There are enough similaritiesbetween the Cathars, the Manicheans, and the Gnostics to suggest that all three,as well as other, less-known sects associated with them, shared the sort ofspiritual dualism that the church wanted to expunge, once and for all.WHO WERE THE CATHARS?The Cathar movement came to public awareness in 1143 in Cologne. During atheological dispute, it became clear that some of the participants, among themthe local archbishop, held doctrines antithetical to the church. He spoke of a“baptism by fire,” rather than water, that was performed by a laying on of handsand not with the baptismal fount. Followers of the strange faith werevegetarians and teetotalers, and they allowed marriage only between virgins,considering sex, even if for procreation as the church affirmed it, somethingsinful. The archbishop declared that their religion had many followersthroughout the world, and he claimed that the origins of his belief came fromthe East, Byzantium, where the doctrines of the true Christianity had beenpreserved since the days of the martyrs. Threatened with execution, many of thearchbishop’s flock recanted their heresy and returned to the fold. Thearchbishop didn’t, and he and a few fellow staunch believers were accordinglyburnt.One heresy that preceded the Cathars and came from the East was that of theBogomils, a dualistic religious sect that appeared in Bulgaria in the tenthcentury. Very little is known about them.2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber309]Their name, said to derive from the sect’s founder, means “beloved of God,” or“chosen of God,” or “worthy of God’s mercy.” Where and how the Bogomilsoriginated is a matter of debate. Some accounts trace them back to theMassalians, the fourth-century anticlerical “praying people” who embraced aradical dualism and who believed that after a “baptism by fire,” they were freefrom evil and could do as they pleased, an antinomian attitude embraced by someGnostics. The Bogomils are also said to be linked to the Paulicians, anotherdualistic sect who had a peculiar regard for the apostle Paul. Some accountstrace them back to ancient Dionysian and Orphic cults still thriving in EasternEurope in the seventh century.Wherever the Bogomils descended from, they embraced certain practices thatclearly resonate with those of the Cathars. They rejected the Old Testament,likening its God to the Gnostic demiurge, and dismissed the sacraments of thechurch. They saw the cross as the instrument of Christ’s torture and not to berevered, yet paradoxically they embraced Docetism, the belief, shared by manyGnostics, that Christ’s body was only a “phantom,” and that he did not suffercrucifixion. Like the Cathars, the Bogomil priests were ascetic, abstaining frommeat and wine. They saw the established church as an instrument of the devil,whom they considered the creator of the physical world which, needless to say,they believed was evil. They lived simply, as the first apostles did, and lookedwith scorn, as the Cathars would, on the church’s increasing temporal power andwealth. As the Gnostics did, they had their own way of interpreting scripture,and tended to make heroes of biblical villains. And as in some of the Gnosticsects, their followers were divided into two camps, the Perfects and theBelievers. Perfects were completely committed to the faith and its austererequirements; Believers were allowed a less strenuous worship. The way fromBeliever to Perfect was demanding and arduous, requiring much study, asceticpractice, and the performance of a rite that would find a central place in thesacraments of the Cathars. This was known as the consolamentum, “the consoling,”which completed their rejection of this evil earth and hastened their return tothe higher spheres from which they had fallen.3[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber310]There is a sense that the Bogomils, like the Cathars, were already wellestablished at the time of their discovery, as if they had planted “sleepers” indifferent parishes and conducted their worship alongside conventionalchurchgoers. As with the Gnostics, it could be said that the Cathars were thetrue Christians, and that the established church had become dogmatic andcorrupted, its initial spiritual force spent. In a strange paradox, at the sametime as the Gothic movement looked toward the eternal heavens, the establishedchurch sought greater and greater temporal power; popes were not satisfied withcelestial authority and sought more and more secular control. The Catharsabhorred this and, with some justification, saw the church as an obstacle to thetrue faith. The Cathars themselves seemed an embodiment of this. Their life ofthe spirit was so devout, their acts of mercy and charity so genuine that theirpreachers earned the name les bonshommes, “the good men.”These good men, however, soon also earned the enmity of the church. In 1145,Bernard of Clairvaux, founder of the Cistercian Order, was sent to the Languedocto battle the heresy. He had little luck, and in 1163, another outbreak occurredin Cologne. The Languedoc seemed fertile soil for the sect. It was a regionassociated with a flowering of culture unheard of in the Middle Ages, soindividual that some sources speak of a “Languedoc civilization,” with its ownarts, literature, and language, Occitan. (“Languedoc” means the “language of theoc,” oc meaning “yes” in Occitan, which was spoken in an area of Europe thatincluded parts of Italy, France, and Spain.) This coincided with a religioustolerance and openness to different faiths; many Jews lived in the Languedoc,and it was in Provence that the Kabbalistic Sefer ha-Bahir emerged in thetwelfth century.According to Denis de Rougemont in Love in the Western World, the Languedoc wasthe scene of “one of the most extraordinary spiritual confluences in history,”bringing together “a strong Manichean religious current,” and “a highly refinedrhetoric,” stemming from the Sufis and Platonism.4[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber311] The Crusades had opened up traffic with theeastern Mediterranean, which allowed for an influx of new ideas, the conduit forwhich may have been the military-religious order of the Knights Templar. It isnot surprising that with an increasingly corrupt church, a return to a moregenuine spirituality would take place here and that it would spread quickly. Bythe end of the twelfth century, the Cathar faith was well established, evenmaking inroads into the courts of the nobility.The church tried to stem the spread of the Great Heresy, and between 1204 and1206 it held a series of public debates in the Languedoc. These had littleeffect. With more of the region’s nobility siding with the Cathars, the churchrecognized that words were not enough and stricter measures were called for. In1209, the crusade against the Cathars began with what is known as the “sack ofBéziers.” A crusader army reinforced by mercenaries fell upon the French town,which was a Cathar stronghold. When asked how the army were to differentiatebetween Cathars and those who remained faithful to the church, Abbot Amalric,the papal legate, spiritual leader of the crusade, is reported to have said,“Kill them all; God will know his own.” God had his work cut out for him;accounts give the number of dead at twenty thousand. This suggests the level ofviolence condoned by the church and mandated by the crusade’s zealous leader,Simon de Montfort, who devastated whole towns and put entire populations to thesword in the name of Christ.The Cathars and the nobility that protected them had little chance of survivingsuch slaughter and a truce was reached in 1229 with an agreement known as thePeace of Paris that officially put an end to the heresy. Yet many Catharscontinued to worship in secret, secluded in their castles in the Pyrenees. Inorder to root them out, Pope Gregory IX established the Inquisition, a highlyeffective spiritual secret police staffed by Franciscan and Dominican monks,which would be overseen by the papacy itself. After the fall of Montségur, smallenclaves of Cathars continued to exist for some time in northern Italy, but withthe efficiency of the Inquisition, these were eventually rooted out, and by thethirteenth century, Catharism was effectively eliminated.A CATHAR GNOSIS?Some writers on the Cathars wonder if they should be considered Gnostics atall.5 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber312] This is not only because of a lack ofhard historical evidence linking them to the early Christian sects. Whileembracing the radical dualism popularly associated with the Gnostics, theCathars did not, it seems, pursue gnosis. It could be said that with theesoteric exodus from Alexandria, the two main elements of “classic Gnosticism”parted company and went separate ways.6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber313] Thegnosis element in Gnosticism and Hermetism went to Persia, where it wasdeveloped in the work of Suhrawardi. The dualistic element was carried on byMani and his followers and thrived in Babylonia. We’ve seen that there is enoughcircumstantial evidence to suggest a connection between Manicheanism and theBogomils, and between the Bogomils and the Cathars. But is it true that theCathars embraced a world-rejecting religion without any element of gnosis?Earlier I mentioned the Cathar practice of the consolamentum, which was anothername for the “baptism of fire.” What was the consolamentum? It seems it may havebeen a version of the “secret teaching” and “inner initiation” of primitiveChristianity mentioned earlier. There I remarked on Timothy Freke and PeterGandy’s idea that there was a “inner initiation” involved in early Christianitythat was rejected by the Christians who would go on to build the establishedchurch. In John 3:5, Christ tells Nicodemus that “Except a man be born of waterand spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” Baptism by water is theconventional sacrament initiating someone into the church, but the secondbaptism, that of “spirit,” is something else, and seems to have been more alongthe lines of the ancient Mysteries or a kind of gnosis experience. Water for theCathars was a symbol of matter, of the physical world into which we are born,and hence for them was a reminder of our fallen state. Baptism by spirit—orfire, a symbol of spirit—initiated one into the higher life beyond the physicalworld, into the kingdom of God.As Richard Smoley suggests, the consolamentum may have been something alongthese lines, a second baptism that marked one’s second birth into the life ofthe spirit. It was not administered lightly. A candidate first had to go througha two-year probationary period in which he or she was taught much along the samelines as the church did. After this, if the candidate was serious enough aboutthe faith to receive the consolamentum, he first had to fast for forty days,emulating Christ’s sojourn in the desert. Then a period of silence was enforcedand other ascetic practices carried out. After this, the candidate was broughtto a room lined with torches, where there was an altar upon which was a copy ofthe New Testament. The candidate stood in the middle of a circle formed by theworshipers, where the Lord’s Prayer was recited and appropriate passages fromthe New Testament were read. All this was in preparation for the consolamentumproper. Placing the New Testament on the candidate’s head, the other membersplaced their right hands on him while the elder recited, “Holy Father, acceptthis thy servant into thy justice and bestow the grace and Holy Spirit uponhim.” With this the ritual concluded with a “kiss,” not on the lips but byplacing the New Testament on the participant’s shoulder.7[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber314]What took place inside the candidate during this initiation? Clearly there isscant “hard” historical evidence to tell us, and inner experience is alwaysdifficult to interpret, even our own. One scholar of Catharism suggests that theresult of the ritual was that the soul of the candidate “rediscovered the spiritfrom which it had been separated.”8 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber315] Thiscertainly sounds as if the consolamentum was a true initiation, in the sensethat it was the kind of transformative experience associated with the Mysteriesor with the awakening of gnosis. Smoley suggests that what occurred during theconsolamentum may have been like similar experiences in other religions in whichsome kind of “spiritual energy” is transmitted from the guru to the disciple.According to J. G. Bennett, a student of Gurdjieff who experienced such atransmission at first hand, in the Sufi tradition there is the idea of Baraka,or “effectual grace,” which can be transmitted by someone of “a high degree ofattainment.”9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber316] Similar practices can be foundin other traditions, and we are all familiar with eager chelas mobbing acharismatic guru hoping to absorb some of his radiant grace—followers of theBhagwan Shree Rajneesh, for example, come to mind. Something similar is also thecase with fans of movie stars, rock stars, and other celebrities.Whatever happened during the consolamentum, the church did not look kindly onit, because it controverted its own teaching that the sacraments of the churchwere both necessary and sufficient for salvation. This meant that extraEcclesiam nulla salus, “there is no salvation outside the church.” Nothing elsewas needed, no “inner initiation” or “secret gospel.” Such ideas, the churchbelieved, were dangerous and could only lead the faithful away from the truepath.The Cathars saw things quite differently. The church itself had taken a detourand was no longer heading toward paradise, but deeper into the world of matter,into power, wealth, and secular influence. Innocent III himself claimedsupremacy over all the kings of Europe and did his best to show he meant it.Whatever true spirit the church had at its start seemed to have congealed intoits opposite, and for those of a living faith, this was a travesty of Christ’sglad tidings. It seems we are really talking about two very different kinds ofreligion: one based on an inner experience, which, because of its nature isavailable to only a few, because they accept the difficulties that come withhaving it, and the other centered on dogma and the official rules of theexoteric church.10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber317] Christ had little time forthe scribes and Pharisees who knew the letter of the law but not its spirit, andwho tried to prevent those who did know the spirit from experiencing it.Tragically this made little impression on the devout who condoned the slaughterof thousands in his name. What the Cathars may have aimed at was the return of atrue gnosis, a true experience of the spirit, to a church that had lost touchwith it, or, as is likely, began its career by denying it fiercely in favor of aliteral reading of the law.11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber318]SOUL LOVEEarlier, I mentioned a possible link between the Cathars and the troubadours. Atfirst sight this seems unlikely. The troubadours sang of love, mostly but notexclusively unconsummated, while the Cathars—at least their parfait or Perfect,those who had taken the consolamentum—scorned sexuality as a trap luring soulsdeeper into the folds of matter. While it is true that some troubadours andtheir idealized women might succumb to the temptations of the flesh, they hadself-discipline enough for us to characterize their pursuit of Eros asspiritual. We can even see them as embracing a kind of medieval tantra, theeastern form of spiritual practice that includes sex in its worship. Whiletantra has become widely popular among New Age devotees, it is often for thewrong reasons. It is not, as many believe, aimed at better and more powerfulorgasms, but at transmuting sexual energies into something finer, into states ofconsciousness receptive to spiritual insights. Although the troubadours may nothave spoken of it in these terms, there is reason to believe that they may havehad something similar in mind.The idea that sexual love can be a means of achieving spiritual insight has along history in the West. In Plato’s Symposium we learn that the love ofphysical beauty is the first step toward the love of beauty in itself, whichleads to the love of the good, the Form of Forms, and so to the divine. Socratesvoices this idea during the drinking party and it is no coincidence that theperson he has learned this from is a woman, Diotima, a philosopher and seer.More than two millennia later, Goethe ends the second part of Faust with thewords “Das Ewig-Weibliche / Zieht uns hinan,” “the Eternal-Feminine / Draws usupward.”12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber319]A more modern and little-known rendition of the same theme is AmorousInitiation, a novel by the Lithuanian poet, philosopher, and esotericist O. V.de Lubicz Milosz, in which “the realization of the unity of the sensual and thespiritual . . . leads the narrator to a higher state of consciousness and tocontemplation of the Divine discernible in Creation.”13[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber320] So while the delights of sexual love may onlymire us deeper in the depths of the fallen world, they can also help us rise upout of it into the clear light of the spirit. The church did not think well ofthe troubadours, but it could hardly have been their slips into carnality thattroubled it. Men and women had fornicated well before the troubadours arrived,so it must have been something else. That something else may have been theknowledge that through a spiritualized sexuality, men and women were able totranscend their earthly limits and enter the sphere of the soul without the needor guidance of the church, which looked upon such pursuits as highly dubious.Sex for the church was a regrettable but necessary means of procreating therace; it saw it in strictly utilitarian terms. The idea that it could be an endin itself and could initiate one into the deeper dimensions of life must havebeen threatening.14 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber321]In The Mystery of the Grail, the controversial Italian esotericist Julius Evolasuggests that “the troubadour literature”—which Evola associates with the Graillegends and which themselves center around the notion of a pure love—“had, to acertain extent, an esoteric dimension and secret tendencies” linked to a“superior knowledge and a spirituality purer than the Catholic one.”15[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber322] “The literature of love,” Evola argues, “had asecret content,” which was associated with the kind of doctrine of purificationthe Cathars sought and which led to them becoming “Perfect Ones.” This “secretcontent” and “doctrine” was incompatible “with the more exoteric Catholicteachings,” as were the Cathars’ beliefs.16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber323]For Evola, the church had usurped the role of Wisdom-Sophia—or denied itoutright—and had exiled the “true doctrine,” while its increasingly secularobjectives distanced it from a “vivifying knowledge,” the kind sought, perhaps,by the Cathars and troubadours.17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber324] Thisknowledge was of the soul, and for the troubadours it was personified in the“unobtainable woman,” who symbolized a love that transcended the earthly.Individual troubadours ostensibly sang of different women, but they were all,according to Evola, really singing of the “same woman”: the symbols ofSapientia, Lady Intelligence, Sophia, the feminine embodiment of a higherknowledge and experience.18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber325] As mentioned, thecult of Mary may have been created in order to keep the spiritualizing power ofthe feminine within the bounds of the true faith. If so, the plan worked to someextent, but as the popularity of the troubadours suggests, it was not a totalsuccess.DANTE AND BEATRICEPerhaps the most famous and influential expression of the “spiritualizedfeminine” in western literature is the figure of Beatrice, the Florentine womanwho inspired Dante Alighieri’s La Vita Nuova (The New Life), and who appears ashis psychopomp, or “soul guide,” leading him out of purgatory and into paradisein The Divine Comedy. Needless to say, The Divine Comedy is one of the greatworks of world literature and Dante ranks with Homer, Shakespeare, and Goethe asone of the titans of European letters. What is perhaps less well-known is thathis account of an inner journey from hell to heaven may be informed by thepursuit of the kind of knowledge associated with the western esoteric tradition.It may be the case that Dante is one of our secret teachers.Dante was born in Florence in 1265 and died in exile in Ravenna in 1321. Hisfamily was of the impoverished nobility, and Dante was proud of an ancestry thathe could trace back to Roman soldiers who settled along the banks of the Arno.He speaks little of his father, and sonnets he wrote satirizing him suggest alack of filial respect. His mother died when Dante was fourteen—some accountssay ten—and he had a half sister and half brother from his father’s secondmarriage. But there is little mention of Dante’s family or of his wife, who borehim three children, in his writings. What is clear is that Dante was devoted tohis native city and it was his involvement with its politics and ongoingstruggle between the Guelph and Ghibelline parties—supporting the papacy and theHoly Roman Emperor, respectively—that, in 1301, threw him into exile. It wasduring this banishment that Dante wrote The Divine Comedy, a work inspired byhis encounter with the beautiful Beatrice and in which he hoped to write “thatwhich has never been written of any woman.”In La Vita Nuova, Dante tells of his first seeing Beatrice when she and he werenine. “The moment I saw her I say in all truth that the vital spirit, whichdwells in the inmost depths of the heart, began to tremble so violently that Ifelt the vibration alarmingly in all my pulses, even the weakest of them. As ittrembled, it uttered these words: ‘Behold, a god more powerful than I, who comesto rule over me.’” Unlike in a Hollywood romance, Dante remained the distantadmirer, satisfied with the merest glimpse of his beloved. He receives no morethan these, but when he does, they are transformative. “Whenever and wherevershe appeared,” Dante writes, “I felt I had not an enemy in the world . . . Iglowed with a flame of charity which moved me to forgive all who had everinjured me; and if at that moment someone had asked me a question, aboutanything, my only reply would have been ‘Love.’”19[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber326]Such remarks may strike our cynical ears as so much sentimental gushing. ForDante, they were the meaning of his life. He meets Beatrice only once againnearly a decade after his first encounter, but his path and hers were not tocoincide, and she eventually marries a banker. At one point she ignores him andhe is crushed at the idea that she is making fun of him. He rises above hisheartache and is determined to sing only her praises, filled with trepidationover what he believes are portents of her impending death. Her father dies andso does her friend, and Dante himself dreams of her dying. He breaks off writingLa Vita Nuova when he learns she is dead, and for a time finds solace in a youngwoman who briefly takes Beatrice’s place. Beatrice is finally transfigured intoan angelic being, a spiritual inspiratrice, who will lead Dante to the “beatificvision,” his direct experience of God.Scholarship has still not decided if Dante’s Beatrice was a real person or anallegorical or symbolic figure. Many critics agree that the most likelycandidate was Beatrice Portinari, who was born in the same year as Dante anddied in 1290 at the age of twenty-four. Beautiful women who die young and whoserve as muses are not infrequent among romantic poets. Edgar Allan Poe made theearly death of a beautiful woman the theme of many of his stories, and his ownchild-bride, Virginia Clemm—she married Poe at thirteen—died at the age oftwenty-five. Novalis, the German Romantic poet and esoteric philosopher, becameinfatuated with the twelve-year-old Sophie von Kühn; they married and Sophiedied of tuberculosis at sixteen.20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber327] The namesof these poets’ tragic muses are instructive. Other sightings of Sophia are morefleeting. In 1872, the Russian spiritual philosopher Vladimir Soloviev watchedas the young girl sitting across from him in a second-class carriage of theMoscow-Kharkov express become the living embodiment of the Divine Woman.Soloviev was to have two more such visions, one while studying Gnostic texts atthe British Museum in London, the other while visiting Bedouins in Egypt. Manywomen today reject the role of the muse, wanting to be appreciated for who theyare personally, not for how well they can accommodate the idealized visionprojected onto them. Yet for Dante and a group of poets associated with him, theability of some women to reflect the higher light of the spiritual formed theessence of a powerful devotion.THE FEDELI D’AMOREDante began to write poetry at eighteen and he soon did what all aspiringwriters do: send his work to established poets in order to get some feedback onit. In this case it was a group of poets who were working to regenerate thecultural and spiritual standards of Florence. They were known as the “Fedelid’Amore,” “the Faithful of Love.” Their leader was Guido Cavalcanti (1250–1300),a poet who developed the dolce stil nuovo, the “sweet new style,” which becameDante’s own and which transformed the poetic expression of the time.Cavalcanti was one of the wittiest and wealthiest of Florence’s poets, and hewas also a reader of the alchemist and theologian Albertus Magnus and thePeripatetic Arab philosopher Averroes. Along with innovations in style andlanguage, the dolce stil nuovo developed the themes of the troubadours and of“courtly love” into an exploration of the philosophical, psychological, andspiritual experience of Eros. The poem Dante sent the Fedeli d’Amore described adream in which “Love”—the spiritualized aspect of Eros—appeared to him withBeatrice. The poetry of the Fedeli d’Amore focused on the members’ own spiritualand mystical experiences, and they paid great attention to dreams and othervisions, something Dante himself did throughout his life. Cavalcanti readDante’s poem and recognized his talent; he replied with a poem of his own andinvited Dante to join the group. The two became close friends, although someyears later, the convoluted twists of Florentine politics led Dante to agree toCavalcanti’s exile in 1300, a year before Dante fell victim to the samepolitical machinations. After a few months as an outcast, Cavalcanti decided toreturn to Florence, but came down with fever—possibly malaria—and died along theway.There is much speculation about the possible esoteric influences at work in theFedeli d’Amore and Dante. Much of this has a political cast dealing withopposition to the church. In 1840, the Italian political radical and Dantescholar Gabriele Rossetti—father of the Pre-Raphaelite painter and poet DanteGabriel Rossetti—published a book, Il mistero dell’ amor platonico nel Medioevo(The Mystery of Platonic Love in the Middle Ages). He argued that the Fedelid’Amore were adepts of a secret doctrine that they referred to using differentwomen’s names, but by which they meant the same “woman,” Sophia, an ideareferred to by Julius Evola. Dante, hérétique, révolutionnaire, et socialiste(Dante, Heretic, Revolutionary, Socialist) by Eugène Aroux argued that Dante’srhetoric concealed subversive political doctrines. Luigi Valli’s Il linguaggiosegreto di Dante (The Secret Language of Dante) suggested that Dante and theother poets of the Fedeli d’Amore spoke in their own “green language” in orderto avoid the Inquisition. These suspicions were brought together by theTraditionalist René Guénon in The Esoterism of Dante, and for an overview of thequestion, the interested reader should begin there.The Fedeli d’Amore seem to have practiced a kind of erotic spirituality whichinvolved the development of what they called the cor gentile, “noble heart,” akind of aristocracy of the soul—not one inherited by blood or wealth—and whichaimed at achieving l’intelleto d’amore, “the intellect of love.” We cannot butnotice the similarity to Schwaller de Lubicz’s “intelligence of the heart.” Theywere, according to some accounts, a “secret group devoted to Sapientia”—that is,Wisdom—and “custodians of a secret doctrine,” incompatible with the exotericteachings of the church.21 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber328] Even more thanthis, they were “a conscious elite” who were “devoted to achieving a harmonybetween the sexual and emotional sides of their natures and their intellectualand mystical aspirations,” and who saw themselves as having “a consciouscivilizing mission,” of the kind usually associated with “esoteric schools.”22[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber329] Their aim was to introduce their ideas intosociety at large in order to transform it. The fact that much of their poetrywas based on their practical experience with dreams and visions and that itaimed to express a body of knowledge anchored in Neoplatonism and other “wisdom”traditions suggests a link to the kind of pursuits we have seen in individualslike Suhrawardi.THE TEMPLAR CONNECTIONThe source of the Fedeli d’Amore’s inspiration remains debatable; two of themost often suggested candidates are the Knights Templar and the Sufis. The Orderof the Knights Templar was established in 1118 to protect Christians travelingin the Holy Land during the Crusades. Eight knights in service to Hugh dePayens, a French nobleman, received permission from King Baldwin II of Jerusalemto use the Temple Mount, a site sacred to Christians, Jews, and Muslims, astheir headquarters. The ruins of the Temple of Solomon are said to lie beneaththe Mount; and the Dome of the Rock, the Muslim shrine that houses the stonefrom which Mohammed ascended to heaven, is also there. At the time Hugh dePayens and his knights arrived, it was the sight of the Al Aqsa Mosque, whichthey were given to use. The knights renamed this the “Templum Domini,” theTemple of the Lord, hence their name Knights Templar.Their popularity soon spread, and Christians wanting to defend the Holy Landagainst the heathens were expected to support the Templars. Although the Knightstook a vow of poverty, they received many donations of money, land, matériel,and volunteers; any nobleman wishing to join them had to donate his land andwealth to the order. Many did, and the Templars’ resources increased. Althoughthey lived communally, the Templars soon became fabulously wealthy, and in ashort time they became the most powerful bankers in Europe; much of modernbanking has its roots in Templar wealth. In 1129, at the Council of Troyes, theTemplars were officially sanctioned by the church. At this time they alsoreceived the important blessing of Bernard of Clairvaux, founder of theinfluential Cistercian Order (as we saw earlier, in 1145, Bernard would be sentto Provence to nip the Cathar heresy in the bud). In 1139, a papal bull issuedby Pope Innocent II granted the Templars free passage and exemption from taxes.They were also given the medieval Christian equivalent of a “license to kill,”and were made answerable only to the pope. Usury—lending money at a profit—andkilling were both forbidden by the church, but the Templars got around theserestrictions. With their military prowess and success, they quickly became oneof the most powerful forces in Christendom.In 1291, Acre, the last Christian outpost in the Holy Lands, fell and theCrusades were over. The Templars wished to return to France and to acquire landsin the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy. But the tide was turning againstthem. They were immensely wealthy and powerful, and answered to no one but thepope, a status that caused some trepidation in France, especially with KingPhilip IV (inaptly named the Fair), who was already in debt to the Templars. Hehad recently asked for another loan in order to continue a war against England,and the Knights had refused, so Philip had reason to hold a grudge against them.Exactly what led to the Templars’ downfall is still debated. The likely scenariois that Philip, angry at the Templars’ refusal of a loan and envious of theirwealth, persuaded Pope Clement V, his childhood friend, that there was somethingnot quite right about them and that they should be investigated. The Catharschism was still fresh in people’s minds—why did the Templars wish to acquireland in Cathar country?—and the charges of heresy and blasphemy brought againstthem found willing believers. They were said to deny Christ’s divinity, to havespit and urinated on the cross, to practice sodomy, to consort with demons, andto worship a god called Baphomet. Eventually, on Friday, October 13, 1307,Templars were rounded up across France and arrested (giving rise, it is said, tothe bad reputation of Friday the thirteenth). The Inquisition stepped in andobtained confessions by its usual method of torture. Many were killed, and in1314, Jacques de Molay, the last Templar Grandmaster, was burned at the stake inParis. Legend has it that before he died, de Molay put a curse on Philip andClement, saying that they would both be judged by God within a year. If true, deMolay was right: both Philip and Clement died less than a year after hisexecution.The fate of the Templars has given rise to much speculation. One suggestion isthat not all of the Templars were arrested and that some escaped to Scotland,where they were eventually involved in the rise of Freemasonry. Templar themesabound in Masonic history, and with the unknown masons responsible for theGothic cathedrals, the Templars are seen as esoteric ancestors from whom modernFreemasonry is descended.23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber330] Their very namesuggests “sacred geometry,” and the building of Solomon’s Temple is a centralpart of Masonic practice, the “temple” being man’s spiritual constitution. Likethe Cathars, the Templars are said to have saved a treasure from the destructionof their ranks. Much mystery surrounds this Templar treasure, if indeed it everexisted. It is said to have been a collection of ancient scrolls, much like theGnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi, revealing the true history and nature of thechurch: that it is the opposite of Christ’s real teachings. Others suggest thatthe treasure has something to do with the Ark of the Covenant.In our context of Dante and the Fedeli d’Amore, another suggestion seems moreapt: that the Templar treasure was not an object or thing but a teaching, abelief or set of ideas. Something similar can be said of other such “secrettreasures,” such as the philosopher’s stone of the alchemists or the Holy Grail.Such symbolic interpretations of “lost mysteries” may seem dull compared to thesearch for and discovery of some actual tangible thing, some miraculoussubstance that can turn lead to gold or the fabled goblet from which Christdrank at the Last Supper. But if there is some link between Dante and theTemplars, this approach strikes me as the most promising.As the Templars’ wealth was well-known, their “secret treasure” could not havebeen gold or jewels. That the Templars were thought to have obtained thistreasure in the Holy Land is suggestive. We have seen that with the esotericexodus from Alexandria, the teachings of the Neoplatonists, the Gnostics, andthe Hermetists moved east and found a home in thinkers like the pagans of Harranand Suhrawardi. These teachings in some way centered around Sophia, aroundwisdom and the love of it. Solomon is associated with Wisdom and with Sophia,and the Song of Solomon—also known as the Song of Songs—is an overtly sexualwork that can be read as an expression of the erotic spirituality associatedwith the Fedeli d’Amore. The yearning of the lovers to unite is also theyearning of the self to be united with the soul, or the philosopher with Sophia,much as may have been the aim of the Cathar consolamentum. Given that theTemplars were accused of sexual perversions and blasphemy, it seems not toofarfetched to wonder if they may have practiced some form of the eroticmysticism associated with the Sufis, and that they sought the kind of directspiritual experience and embraced the kind of perennial philosophy—with its ideaof the essential unity of all religions—we have been looking at in this book.THE SUFI CONNECTIONThere are clear links between the Templars and Dante. Dante uses the seal of theTemplar Grandmaster, an eagle and a cross, as a symbol in The Divine Comedy. Healso has especially vile places in hell set aside for Philip the Fair and PopeClement V. The elect in heaven wear white robes similar to those worn by theTemplars. Some, like René Guénon, have argued that Dante was a member of anauxiliary branch of the Templars, La Fede Santa (“The Sacred Faith”), an ideafirst presented by Gabriele Rossetti. Others have suggested that Brunetto Latini(1210–1294), Dante’s teacher, was a Templar, or at least a member of La FedeSanta, and that he initiated Dante. The descriptions of hell in The DivineComedy are supposed to be literal accounts of Dante’s initiation experience inan underground cave.24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber331] Perhaps most suggestiveis the fact that Dante’s last guide in Paradiso, who leads him to his mysticalvision, is Bernard of Clairvaux, who gave the Templars his blessing and whowrote their rules. Dante is also said to have taken a mysterious journey toParis while the immolation of Jacques de Molay took place.25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber332]It may be true that, as William Anderson writes, many of Dante’s “most obscureallegorical passages receive their most coherent explanation when related to thecrisis of the Templar order.”26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber333] Yet while theTemplars certainly have a high status in the esoteric history of the West—Guénonbelieved the Kali Yuga, our present spiritual “dark age,” began with theirdestruction, while one writer declares that “the Knights Templar remain . . .the single greatest force for turning the spiritual mind of the west”—there aresome problems with seeing them as practitioners of sexual mysticism andexponents of the prisca theologia.27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber334]The Templars were fundamentally a military order, and while a few of them mayhave made contact with mystical orders or individuals in the East, the majorityof them most likely had little time or interest in esoteric knowledge. Theirrules included a strict vow of celibacy, which would make them “a most unlikelychannel for themes devoted to the praise of beautiful ladies.”28[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber335] And while Bernard of Clairvaux blessed theTemplars, he had, we’ve seen, a less positive attitude toward the Cathars, withwhom the Templars are linked in this chain of associations. Yet there does seema strong connection between the kinds of themes that concerned the Fedelid’Amore and Dante, and the kind of erotic mysticism that the Templars may haveencountered in the East.As Henry Corbin has shown, the Arab Andalusian Sufi master and saint Ibn ‘Arabi(1165–1240) had his own “Beatrice experience” in Mecca in 1201, decades beforeDante. While staying with a noble Iranian family, ‘Arabi met Nizam, the shaikh’sdaughter, who “combined extraordinary physical beauty with great spiritualwisdom.”29 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber336] “She was,” Corbin writes, “for Ibn‘Arabi what Beatrice was to be for Dante.” Corbin makes the point that both theallegorists and the literalists are wrong when they argue over whether or notBeatrice or Nizam were “real” people or “only” symbols. Both were “real girls,”but at the same time each was “a theophanic figure, the figure of Sophia aeterna(whom certain of Dante’s companions invoked as Madonna Intelligenza).”30[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber337] By “theophanic,” Corbin means that it isthrough Beatrice and Nizam’s beauty that the divine appears; they, and other ofthe troubadours’ “beautiful ladies,” are simultaneously flesh and bloodindividuals, but also archetypes, something along the lines of walking, talkingPlatonic Forms of beauty.31 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber338] That is to say,when seeing Beatrice and Nizam, Dante and Ibn ‘Arabi engaged in a form of whatSchwaller de Lubicz called symbolique, the ability to see mutually exclusiveideas simultaneously. This is a function of Schwaller de Lubicz’s “intelligenceof the heart,” whose similarity to the Fedeli d’Amore’s intelleto d’amore wehave noted. This is an ability, it seems, that has its source in the right brainand is accomplished through the use of the imagination, allowing us to grasprealities that elude our usual left-brain view of the world, which can only seethings in terms of “either/or.”“If we fail to grasp this twofold dimension simultaneously,” Corbin writes, “welose the reality both of the person and the symbol,” something those who arguethat Beatrice or Nizam must be either “real” or allegorical, are prone to do.32[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber339] That such “double vision” is part of both theSufi and troubadour tradition Corbin makes clear by linking Ibn ‘Arabi with thegreat Persian Sufi poet Rumi, mentioned in Chapter Six, whom he calls “theIranian troubadour of that religion of love whose flame feeds on the theophanicfeeling for sensuous beauty.”33 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber340] Corbin goes onto say that “Fedeli d’Amore [is] the best means of translating into a Westernlanguage the names by which our mystics called themselves in Arabic orPersian.”34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber341]“The Faithful of Love” can be understood to mean something more than aparticular group of poets working in a particular historical moment at aparticular place, as literal historians would limit them to. They can representa wider, larger association of sympathies and vision across time and space, thekind of “ahistorical continuity” we have spoken of before. Sensibilities commonto the Fedeli d’Amore and to the erotic mysticism of the Arab poets were sharedby the Sicilian poets who gathered in the court of the Holy Roman EmperorFrederick II, who preceded Dante by a generation and who shared Neoplatonistthemes with the troubadours. For them, as for Dante and the Sufis, “the soulcould be ennobled and purified through love and through the appreciation ofpoetry and music,” a belief we saw sprouting in the fertile soil of “Gothicjoy.”35 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber342] “Beauty will save the world,”Dostoyevsky’s Prince Myshkin says in The Idiot, and the “faithful followers oflove,” both those of Dante’s local group and others, agree with him.DANTE’S INNER VOYAGELike all great masterworks, The Divine Comedy can be read on several levels, andDante, in his adoption of four levels of reading—his “polysemousinterpretation”—tells us that there are different ways to understand his accountof his inner journey. In a letter to his benefactor, Can Grande (“Big Dog”), towhom he dedicated The Divine Comedy, Dante spelled out what he meant. Therewere, he said, two basic ways of reading, the literal and the symbolic, adistinction we have come across before. But symbolic reading itself hasgradations, what Dante called the allegorical, the moral, and the anagogic.The literal reading of Dante’s journey is simply the state of the soul afterdeath. His narrative can be read as a Christian vision of what happens to thesoul when we die. “Allegorical” in Dante’s time had a particular meaning; itmeant showing how events in the Old Testament prefigured those in the NewTestament, how the Old Testament is a kind of “pre-echo” of Christ’s coming, andhow he is its fulfilment. The moral sense is a kind of psychological reading; ittells us of the state of the soul. The literal sense of Dante’s opening line“Midway along the journey of our life/I woke to find myself in a dark wood”tells us that, at around thirty-five, Dante found himself in a dense forest. Themoral reading means that Dante found himself in a state of alienation, ofuncertainty about himself and his life, what we call a “midlife crisis.”The level of interpretation that concerns us most is the anagogic, thespiritual, which in modern terms we can say relates to changes in Dante’sconsciousness. “The inner journey of the poet” that Dante undertakes is, asKathleen Raine puts it, “an exploration of the psyche, of the inner worlds andstates of the poet himself.”36 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber343] As Swedenborgwould say some centuries later, the hells Dante enters are not literal places oftorment, but “states” of the soul, constricting circles of selfishness andegocentricity which the poet must confront before he can be free of them. Herethe literal, left-brain approach must be abandoned and a more metaphorical tacktaken, something Dante told Can Grande in his letter.37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber344] And while The Divine Comedy is full of Dante’spersonal animosities and political views, as well as some fairly orthodoxChristian teaching, it is also an attempt to synthesize all the knowledge thatwas available at the time, of both the spiritual and the secular worlds, into auniversal vision. It is an attempt, that is, at unifying our two disparatecognitive halves into a coherent whole.It is not too difficult to find signs that Dante’s inner journey shares in manyof the esoteric themes encountered in this book. The three main settings for hisinner voyage—hell, purgatory, and paradise—can be seen as the basic blueprintfor spiritual awakening. Hell is the material world we find ourselves in, withits allurements and traps and restrictions. It is a kind of false half-life, andlike many of us, when Dante awakens to the fact that it is leading nowhere, thatits temptations are hollow—when, that is, he finds himself in the dark wood—heis disturbed and seeks a way out of it.Purgatory represents the initiatory trials, the purifications and spiritualstruggles necessary to free the soul from the weight of matter and prepare itfor its spiritual awakening. This happens in paradise, when the soul, hithertolost in darkness, has risen in the light of the divine and, having been freedfrom false desires and vision, shares in the brilliance of the true light andbeholds the unity of all creation. That it is the Virgin who grants Dante thesupreme vision, and that this consists of an “exalted light,” tells us that hismystical experience is in the Sophianic and Neoplatonic tradition. Dante eventells us that when Dionysius the Areopagite thought of the “angelic orders,” henamed them “true and best.”38 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber345] That Dante’sjourney takes place from Good Friday to Easter links it to similar “rebirth”narratives we have looked at, and that he sees God as three concentric circlessymbolizing the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit reminds us of one of Plotinus’s fewconcessions to imagery, when he depicts the One, the Intellect, and the WorldSoul in the same way.Dante’s inner geography is also in line with the different but similarontological ladders we have encountered so far. The journey from the circles ofhell, up through Mount Purgatory and paradise, leads to the same celestialtrajectory as the Hermetic “journey through the planets.” Having passed from theearth, Dante must travel through the “seven heavens” (the planets) that willlead him to the “eighth” and “ninth heaven,” rather as the Hermetist traveled tothe “eighth” and “ninth sphere,” or as the Kabbalist worked his way through thesephiroth. Here, the seven deadly sins of hell, after being transformed throughDante’s struggles in purgatory, become the cardinal virtues in service to thedivine order, just as the Hermetist transmuted the heavy weight of the planetsinto spiritual energies transforming the soul.At the top of this mystical spiral, Dante has a vision of the transcendent God,of the Neoplatonic One, the “tenth heaven” that is beyond time, space, andmatter. Here Dante is beyond words; he has reached the union with the divinesought by those who walk the via negativa. Yet Dante asks the “Light supreme” torelent a little, so that he is not entirely overcome and so that, in his words,he “may burn/One single spark of all Thy glory’s light/For future generations todiscern.”39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber346] Like all writers, Dante wants tocommunicate his experience, to capture it so that it will not disappear, “as thesun melts the imprint on the snow.”40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber347] Theultimate experience of the divine may be beyond expression, but Dante the poet,a traveler on the via positiva, knows that man needs beauty, images, and symbolsin order to truly love. We should be thankful that the divine granted Dante hiswish, and dimmed its glory, so that we can share in some small part of it.This plea for the need for images and symbols links Dante to the Imaginal World,to Suhrawardi’s intermediary realm, through which the reader of The DivineComedy has just journeyed. Like “the stranger” in Suhrawardi’s initiatory tales,Dante meets an inner figure who will serve as his guide, something C. G. Jungwould also do some centuries later when he embarked on his own descent into theunderworld. In the first two parts of Dante’s voyage, through hell andpurgatory, his guide is Virgil (70 B.C.–19 B.C.), the Roman poet who, like Homerbefore him, and like Orpheus before Homer, made the journey into the underworld.But Virgil, who represents the best of the classical world, can only take Danteso far. When he reaches the limits of the earthly realm he must hand over hischarge to Beatrice, who will take Dante further. We can say that philosophy andreason (the left brain) must allow insight and intuition (the right brain) totake charge now. In order to reach Beatrice, Dante has had to climb throughMount Purgatory, much as the stranger in Suhrawardi’s initiatory tales must makehis way up the difficult slopes of Mount Qâf, the cosmic mountain, in order tofind his true self and reach the spiritual city, Hūrqalyā.The outskirts of Hūrqalyā, we’ve seen, start at the “convex surface” of the“Ninth Sphere, or Sphere of Spheres” which encompasses the whole cosmos, much asthe Primum Mobile or “Ninth Heaven” of Dante’s geocentric system is the lastlayer of materiality before the transcendent realms of the unmanifest source. Inpointing out these similarities between Dante’s journey and Suhrawardi’s accountof his own inner voyages, I am not suggesting that Dante somehow knew ofSuhrawardi’s work, although we have seen that there is reason to believe thatthe Arabic and Sufi versions of central Neoplatonic themes most likely informedthe Sophianic tradition within which Dante worked. More important, andinitiatory in its own right, is the recognition that Dante and Suhrawardi’saccounts are similar because they both journeyed to the same place, to the“inner worlds and states of the poet himself.” That is, into the human mind or,as we have already called it, the Mundus Imaginalis, the Imaginal World thatresides within and without all of us.Although Dante’s and Suhrawardi’s inner worlds are decorated, so to say, withthe symbols and iconography of their own particular place and time—Catholic andIslamic, as the case may be—the basic terrain, the fundamental geography is thesame. We can say that both share a kind of similar topography of theimagination. This is a tradition, not in Guénon’s sense of a specific doctrinehanded down through the ages, but in Kathleen Raine’s sense of a “learning ofthe imagination.” It is a tradition that has its source, not in a “secretteaching,” revealed to mystic sages at the dawn of time, but in the human minditself.DANTE’S COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESSIn his book Cosmic Consciousness, R. M. Bucke includes Dante in the list ofhistorical figures in whom he argues that the “cosmic sense,” the next stage ofhuman consciousness, has appeared. Dante is in good company: Jesus, the Buddha,Plotinus, and Jacob Boehme, among others, are with him in the top ranks.Although a Christian may be satisfied with knowing that at the end of hisjourney Dante “saw God,” Bucke relates Dante’s vision to other traditions, andsays that Dante’s “expression . . . of the Cosmic vision . . . is a parallelstatement with the Qur’an, the Upanishads, Suttas, the Pauline Epistles,” butalso with works of literature like Honoré de Balzac’s La Comédie humaine (atwist on Dante’s “divine” comedy), Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, andShakespeare.41 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber348]As William Anderson notes, Bucke was the first to locate Dante’s mysticism inthe context of the perennial philosophy, and not solely in the Christiantradition.42 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber349] This is important, but I would gofurther and say that Bucke places Dante’s vision not only in the context of theperennial philosophy, but also in that of the evolution of consciousness. Thissuggests that, although it is decorated in Christian iconography, Dante’s visionwas not rooted solely in the Christian faith. Or we can say that, while thesetting and cast of characters of Dante’s journey are Christian, the mechanismof Dante’s vision, what happens to his consciousness while it is taking place,transcends the Christian narrative. But this is merely to state the premise ofthe perennial philosophy: that the fundamental vision transcends any specificexpression of it, “transcends” in this sense, meaning not limited to it. If, asthe title of a book by Frithjof Schuon, one of the Traditionalists, has it,there is a “transcendental unity of religions,” then the “transcendental” visionrelated to this cannot be limited to any one religion, just as, say, the “poeticexperience” can’t be limited to any one poet or subject matter of poetry.P. D. Ouspensky, no stranger to mystical states of consciousness, addressed thisissue more than a century ago. Considering the difficulties involved in tryingto express the insights of mystical experience, Ouspensky saw that invariablya man who has had mystical experiences uses, for expressing and transmittingthem, those forms of images, words and speech which are best known to him, whichhe is accustomed to use most often and which are the most typical andcharacteristic for him. In this way it can easily happen that different peopledescribe and convey an entirely identical experience quite differently [myitalics]. A religious man will make use of the usual clichés of his religion. Hewill speak of the Crucified Jesus, of the Virgin Mary, of the Holy Trinity, andso on. A philosopher will try to render his experience in the language of themetaphysics to which he is accustomed . . . A theosophist will speak of the“astral” world, of “thought forms” and of “Teachers.” A spiritualist will speakof the spirits of the dead.43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber350]Ouspensky himself carried out a series of experiments inducing altered states ofconsciousness, and he said of his own mystical experiences that they werenothing like anything he had read in other accounts of similar experiences.Ouspensky’s remarks take us a good way toward understanding the need for alanguage of mysticism, a language of “higher states of consciousness” thattranscends that of the different religious or philosophical contexts in whichthey occur. It also helps us to make sense of the perennial thorny question,invariably raised by skeptics, of why different accounts of mystical experienceare so different, why they do not share in the same commonality that accounts ofour normal, everyday world do. If I go to my local supermarket, my experience ofit will not be exactly the same as someone else’s, but neither will it differradically or in any fundamental sense. Because we are different people, ourperspectives on it will naturally differ, but not enough to suggest that wereally visited two very different places. But when Suhrawardi, Dante,Swedenborg, Steiner, Jung, and other inner voyagers tell of their journeys, theydo seem to be speaking about very different experiences. Swedenborg goes toheaven and hell, Steiner reads the “Akashic record,” Jung enters the “collectiveunconscious,” although Corbin’s notion of the Imaginal World and KathleenRaine’s ideas about the “learning of the imagination” can help us here.It strikes me that this idea of a kind of “meta-language,” which can help usdecipher different mystical experiences, would be of most help if itconcentrated on what was happening to the person having them, rather than ontheir content. “Comparative symbology,” of the kind that Henry Corbin, KathleenRaine, Jung, and others have worked out, is important and essential. It isthrough this that we can begin to map out these strange inner but oddlyobjective worlds, by showing the similar themes, images, and symbols that these“different but the same” interior terrains—in the sense that the Fedelid’Amore’s “beautiful women” were all different but also all the sameWoman—possess. But it is just as important to look at the seer as at what isseen. In this context I am less interested in whether or not Dante saw God insome strict sense, as a devout Christian might be, as in what was happening toDante when he saw him. What was going on in Dante’s consciousness when the“cosmic sense,” as Bucke puts it, came to him?My own guess is that Dante somehow brought together the usually opposed cerebralhemispheres. Or, if we want to avoid localizing what took place too strictly inDante’s brain, we can say that he brought together our two usually opposed modesof consciousness, our two ways of knowing, and reached that rare harmony that Icall the “Goldilocks state.” Dante was one of those infrequent geniuses who canunify the opposing sides of human nature as well as the cognitive expressionsspecific to each. Dante was able to pursue both episteme and gnosis. He wasaware of and conversant with all of the rational (Aristotelian) knowledge of theday. He studied politics and was an active politician. He studied jurisprudenceand wrote on government. He knew philosophy and theology well and was wellversed in the Scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas—who is among the many famouscharacters he encounters in the underworld. He knew his Bible. He studiedhistory and knew the Ptolemaic astronomy of the time. Dante was also anextremely contemporary man, “up-to-date,” and what sets The Divine Comedy apartfrom earlier epics is his clear grasp of current events and the introduction of“real life” characters into his spiritual narrative. Dante was a hard-nosed,no-nonsense, clear thinker who, if he believed it was the right thing to do,could send his friend into exile. But he was also a poet, one attuned to beautyand the charms of the erotic, and an intensely religious man who felt theconcrete reality of the spirit. And he was also a mystic in pursuit of Sophia.Dante held the entire world of his time in himself and felt its contradictions.The Divine Comedy was a way of bringing the disparate elements of his worldtogether to form a picture of the whole. He was, as John Ruskin called him, “thecentral man of all the world,” holding in perfect balance “the imaginative,moral and intellectual faculties at their highest.” That unity of being iscertainly one of the central aims of the esoteric tradition.A similar unity, I suggest, happened in Dante’s consciousness. I am not thefirst to suggest that Dante’s vision was the result of a fruitful cooperationbetween the two sides of his brain. William Anderson, to whom I have referredoften in this chapter, suggests as much in his remarkable book, Dante the Maker,to which I am gratefully indebted. For all I know, others have said so too.Anderson makes the suggestion in several places, but one passage in particularstruck me as especially insightful, given what Iain McGilchrist says about the“inhibitory” relationship between the two cerebral hemispheres, how each oneworks to achieve a cooperative balance by “inhibiting” the excesses of theother. Anderson refers to the “two kinds of knowledge” posited by ThomasAquinas, the “active searching” for knowledge and the “intuitive possession” ofit, which we can, as Anderson does, relate to the left and right brain. AsAnderson writes,if we remember what Aquinas says of the two kinds of knowledge—that the lower,reason, is the active searching for knowledge, and the higher, intellect, is theintuitive possession of it—then we get a glimpse of what that higher knowledge,symbolized by Beatrice as the light between truth and the intellect, might bewhen gained through the proper balance between the two hemispheres . . . WhatDante experiences in the purification of his will as he ascends Mount Purgatory,and in the enlightenment of his intellect as he soars into the heavens is aconstant interchange between the hemispheres, each correcting and balancing theother [my italics].44 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber351]This expresses one of the central concerns of this book: the fruitful interplayof the opposites. In terms of the erotic spirituality we have been looking at,we can say that when the Lover and the Beloved—the philosopher and Sophia, orreason and intuition—combine in their mystic marriage, their hieros gamos, theyproduce interesting offspring. I have used Jung’s idea of a “transcendentfunction” as an overall term to refer to this result. One form in which thetranscendent function manifests, Jung tells us, is the mandala, the magic circleof Tibetan Buddhism that Jung, following his own inner voyage, came to see as asymbol of the Self, of the totality of the psyche, the union of the consciousand unconscious minds.45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber352] Mandalas appear indifferent ways, one of which is the great rose windows of the Gothic cathedrals.Just before his vision of God, Dante has a vision of an enormous rose, thepetals of which are the souls of the faithful, and which symbolizes divinelove.46 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber353] Everyone he has met in heaven,including Beatrice, has a place in it.Is it too much to suggest that, just as it would in Jung, the transcendentfunction produced in Dante a kind of mandala, that is, a symbol of theunification of the opposites, of the All and the One, that represented the unityin diversity of the outer world, as well as the unified consciousness necessaryto produce it? It is instructive that Dante gave up politics and becameconvinced that it was only through art, through the via positiva, the effectivecombination of intellect and intuition—the critical (left) and creative (right)powers—that he could pass on some of the knowledge he had gained. He even wentbeyond the aims of the Fedeli d’Amore by writing a work that would transcend thecultural milieu of fourteenth-century Florence and act as a kind of“time-release capsule,” making available the timeless ideas and symbols of theunitive experience for generations after him. In this way he helped make theinner journey of the poet possible for ourselves.MEISTER ECKHART AND THE VIA NEGATIVAWhile Dante was creating perhaps the greatest initiatory work of the medievalvia positiva, a German contemporary of his was laying the groundwork for perhapsthe greatest medieval expression of the opposite path, the via negativa. Asmentioned earlier, the esoteric and the mystic paths, though related, are notidentical. The esotericist seeks the experience and knowledge of theintermediary planes that lie between the material world and the One; he isinterested in the Imaginal World, and in the different levels of reality andconsciousness it encompasses. The mystic has little interest in anything butunion with the divine. Both ways are rooted in the Neoplatonic ladder of being,but while one is interested in mapping out each step of the way, the other wantsto reach the top by the shortest route possible.While Dante projected an entire cosmos in order to contain his beatific vision,the theologian and philosopher Meister Eckhart (1260?–1327?) worked to empty hisconsciousness of everything but the immediate presence of God. Eckhart’s focuson the direct and unimpeded experience of the divine exemplified the great waveof lay mysticism and spirituality that swept through the Rhineland in thefourteenth century and troubled an unstable church already challenged by theCathars and Knights Templar. As the Mysteries of antiquity provided a morepowerful emotional experience than the routine worship of the gods, so too thegrassroots spirituality fed by Eckhart’s vision offered a more transformativeform of devotion than the increasingly legalistic strictures of the church.This independent spirituality attracted many followers and took different forms,such as the contemplative Friends of God, led by Eckhart’s followers, JohnTauler (1300–1361) and Henry Suso (1295–1365), and the more antinomian Brethrenof the Free Spirit. The church has never taken kindly to amateur spirituality,believing that such matters should be left in the hands of professionals, and ittook steps to dampen what it called “enthusiasm” whenever it appeared. In 1311,the Brethren of the Free Spirit were declared heretical by Pope Clement V—whoordered the arrest of the Templars—and accordingly persecuted. The lessrambunctious Friends of God were not persecuted; they in fact remained withinthe church and were a kind of response to the Dionysian revels of the Brethrenof the Free Spirit, although the fact that they died out after only twogenerations may have saved them from the Brethren’s fate. Along with the BlackDeath and the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453), the inability of the church toaccommodate a more living spirituality was a factor adding to the turbulence andchaos of the late Middle Ages. The time was rife with a sense of imminentdisaster and apocalypse. The end of the world, many believed, was coming. Acentury earlier, the Calabrian monk and mystic Joachim of Fiore (1135–1202) hadprophesized that a new age of the Holy Spirit was on its way, following the agesof the Father and the Son. Mankind, Joachim said, would then achieve directcontact with God, and no longer have need for the church, a prediction theBrethren of the Free Spirit, who were followers of Joachim, had tried to maketrue. Rome was not happy with this, but Dante put Joachim in Paradise, and thefact that the beginning of the age of the Holy Spirit coincided with thepurported year of Meister Eckhart’s birth, 1260, may not have been entirely thework of chance.Dante and Eckhart shared much in common; for one thing, the combination ofmystical insight and intense intellectual hunger, although in each theexpression of this union took different forms. Both also had trouble with theauthorities. Dante, we know, was exiled. In his later life, Meister Eckhart wasaccused of heresy, tried, and was found guilty, although he died beforereceiving the verdict. He was accused of pantheistic tendencies; like Eriugena,he spoke of nature’s “manifest theophanies” and preached that there was no needto hear sermons, “for every creature is full of God and is a book” and that “Godis present in a stone or a log; only they do not know it.”47[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber354] For such beliefs, he was posthumously foundguilty of being “deceived by the father of lies,” and, like Socrates andSuhrawardi, of “sowing thorns and thistles among the faithful and even thesimple folk” by the men who tried him.48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber355] YetEckhart’s remarks are not strange or threatening to anyone with a sense ofSchwaller de Lubicz’s “intelligence of the heart” or Bergson’s intuition or the“participatory” mode of consciousness associated with the right brain. Yet thesesubtle insights are invariably lost on those who view life literally.In some sense we can say that the parallel positive and negative ways, rooted inDionysius the Areopagite and embodied in Dante and Eckhart, reached a kind ofculmination at this point, just as Europe was about to undergo thetransformation that would eventually lead to the modern world. As EvelynUnderhill said in her classic work Mysticism, “These two giants stand side byside at the opening of the [fourteenth] century; perfect representations of theTeutonic and Latin instinct for transcendental reality.”49[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber356] For Teutonic and Latin, we can read vianegativa and via positiva, a differentiation that would inform the ProtestantReformation in the sixteenth century and which would change the face of Europe.Although supressed after his death and forgotten for centuries, MeisterEckhart’s work was rediscovered in the nineteenth century, mostly through thework of the German Romantic philosopher and Christian theosopher Franz vonBaader (1765–1841), and he has since become a central figure in modern westernmysticism. Some recent scholars suggest that Eckhart’s true lineage is withinthe German philosophical tradition, and wish to save him from the dubious worldof New Age mysticism. Yet the German philosophical tradition itself containsmany who were fellow travelers with mystics, so the differentiation is perhapsmore academic than useful. In recent times, Eckhart has been enormouslyinfluential, and figures as disparate as the philosopher Martin Heidegger, theZen scholar D. T. Suzuki, the contemporary spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle, andthe Christian priest and theologian Matthew Fox find common ground in theirinheritance from Meister Eckhart.A FAITHFUL HERETICEckhart von Hochheim was born around 1260 in Tambach, a Thuringian village innortheast Germany near the town of Erfurt. Little is known of his childhood andfamily life; some accounts say he was the son of a knight, yet others dismissthis. It is possible he may have studied in Paris as a youth under theAristotelian philosopher Siger of Brabant.50 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber357]What we do know is that at around sixteen, Eckhart entered the Dominicannovitiate at Erfurt. In 1280, he was sent to the famous Dominican House ofStudies, the Studium Generale, at Cologne, which was founded by Albertus Magnus.Eckhart was there for only a short time before Albertus Magnus died, butaccounts say he met the great philosopher and theologian and was taught by someof his students, one of whom was Thomas Aquinas. Albertus Magnus brought theideas of Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus and the theology of Christianity, Islam,and Judaism into a creative synthesis, a version of the perennial philosophy; hewas also, as mentioned, one of the first in the West to study alchemy. Eckhartabsorbed this heady curriculum, which also included the work of Porphyry,Proclus, Augustine, Origen, Dionysius, and Eriugena. Although Albertus Magnus’sNeoplatonism was soon eclipsed by the scholasticism of his pupil Aquinas, themystic spirituality he fostered had a powerful influence on the Christians ofthe Rhineland.Eckhart proved a brilliant student and able administrator, and following hisordination as a priest in 1293, he went on to have a remarkable career in thechurch. In Paris, he worked as a lecturer and studied for his degree as masterof theology. Between 1293 and 1302, when he was granted the degree, which wasthe highest academic honor at the time—and from which his title of “meister”comes—he was made prior of Erfurt and also vicar of Thuringia. Other titlescame, including being made regent master at the St. Jacques Dominican House ofStudy, the First Provincial of Saxony, the vicar of Bohemia, as well asprofessor of theology. Eckhart is generally considered a mystic; if he was one,he was in the tradition of Emanuel Swedenborg and Rudolf Steiner, two other mendeemed mystics who were also highly efficient organizers.Eckhart was put in charge of reforming several of the Dominican Houses and hewas also made responsible for the spiritual guidance of Dominican nuns andseveral women’s lay spiritual groups, such as the Beguines. These popularwomen’s groups reflect both the turn toward the feminine and the interest inindependent spirituality common to the time; as one commentator remarked, theycontributed to “one of the most spectacular upsurges of mystical spirituality inthe history of Europe.”51 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber358] Not surprisingly,Clement V, who had suppressed the Templars and declared the Brethren of the FreeSpirit heretical, suppressed the Beguines, and in 1310, the mystic Marguerite ofPorete was burned at the stake for heresy in Paris. Among other things, she wasaccused of promoting the “heresy of the free spirit,” a charge laid againstEckhart as well. Marguerite, along with other women mystics, such as Hildegardof Bingen (1098–1179) and Mechthild of Magdeburg (1207–1294), a Beguine, was aninfluence on Meister Eckhart’s beliefs. Eckhart believed in an equality of thesexes and promoted a casual friendship between men and women, in contrast to themore sharply segregated policy of the church. He was also, as Albertus Magnuswas, open to insights from other faiths, and was conversant with Jewish thinkerslike Moses Maimonides and the Sufi saint Ibn ‘Arabi, among others. Much of whatwe know of Eckhart’s teachings comes to us from the many nuns and Beguines whomemorized his sermons and wrote them down, although in their efforts to eraseEckhart’s work, the Inquisitors seized many of these accounts and destroyedthem. Were it not for the efforts of these spiritual women, the little we haveof Eckhart’s writings might have been even less.What troubled the church was that Eckhart preached the same sort of union withGod that the Sufi mystics sang of under the cover of a mysticism of the erotic.“God and I are one,” Eckhart told his congregation. “Through knowledge I takeGod into myself, through love I enter into God.”52[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber359] Other sayings make the same point. “The eyethrough which I see God is the same eye through which God sees me; my eye andGod’s eye are one eye, one seeing, one knowing, one love.” “Our Lord says toevery living soul ‘I became man for you. If you do not become God for me, you dome wrong.’”53 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber360] Probably the most well-known, aswell as the most threatening from the church’s perspective, is “God needs me asmuch as I need him,” an insight that achieves the dual heresy of diminishingGod’s omnipotence while emphasizing man’s importance.54[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber361] This sort of union with the divine has alwaysbeen frowned upon by the church—understandably, as it subverts its authority,although Eckhart made a spirited defense of his faithfulness and orthodoxy and,as in the case of other heretics, much of what he says can be found inscripture.55 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber362] Yet as we’ve seen throughout thisbook, “dynamic” religion, meaning personal and experiential, does not get alongwell with the “static” variety, and it is usually the dynamic individuals whosuffer from this dissonance.According to Eckhart, the fundamental ground of all being is God—or, inNeoplatonic terms, the One—and through a process of letting go, of emptyingourselves of everything that stands in the way of recognizing and experiencingthis—the via negativa—we can come to know God and to be One with Him. Or to bemore precise, not to know God, which we cannot, as he is beyond knowledge, butto love him and to feel his love. This process of inner emptying is at the heartof the anonymous fourteenth-century mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing, whosetitle encapsulates the essence of the via negativa, and whose aptly unknownauthor was, like Eckhart, influenced by Dionysius the Areopagite. The aim ofthis work was to instruct a novice on the essentials of the contemplative life.Physical withdrawal, in the clichéd sense of retiring to a cave, is notessential. This work can and should be done in the midst of life. Eckharthimself said that if it was a choice between mystical rapture and giving a sickperson soup, one should forget the rapture and get the soup. What was important,both for Eckhart and the unknown author of The Cloud of Unknowing, was“psychological withdrawal,” a letting go of attachments, possessions,relationships, and personal concerns. As the old Sufi saying has it, one shouldbe in the world, but not of it. As the psychologist Ira Progoff remarked, “theaim of the work is to lead beyond all theological conceptions and doctrines, andbeyond all attachments to religious objects and observances.”56[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber363] We should, the anonymous author tells us,learn to love God without his characteristics; love him not because he is good,loving, or merciful, but simply because he is (the similarity to the Neoplatonicconception seems fairly clear here). “It is good to think about the kindness ofGod, and to love Him and to praise Him for it, [but] it is far better to thinkabout his naked being and to praise Him and love Him for Himself.”57[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber364]As with Eckhart, this “ground” of “naked being” is the same as our own, and bylosing one’s self in order to find it, one finds one’s “true self,” as it is.This is best achieved by getting rid of everything that can take our minds awayfrom this. As Progoff writes, “Attachment to the symbolic forms and sacredfigures of man’s religions can easily become an impediment in the ultimate questof the spirit.”58 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber365] The philosopher Alfred NorthWhitehead said, “Religion is what the individual does with his solitariness,” aninsight with which Eckhart and those that followed him would agree.59[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber366]Eckhart had different names for this process of getting rid of whatever comesbetween oneself and God, but probably the most well-known is Gelassenheit, aGerman word that does not have an exact English equivalent but can be understoodas “detachment,” “releasement,” or simply “letting go.” It plays a central rolein the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, whose concern with our “forgetfulness ofbeing” is close to Eckhart’s own vision, with his attention to Istigkeit, or thesheer “is-ness” of things, and it is also used by Iain McGilchrist tocharacterize the right brain’s mode of letting things be as they are, as opposedto the left brain’s tendency to manipulate them into how it thinks they shouldbe. The “dispassionate equanimity” related to the Greek notion of ataraxia(Chapter Three) comes close, but is too negative. We can see it as a positiveletting-go in order to let things be as they are. “When a man’s heart grievesfor nothing, then a man has the essence and the nature and the substance and thewisdom and the joy and all that God has,” Eckhart tells us. “Then the very beingof the son of God is ours and in us we attain to the very essence of God,” hesays of this kind of detachment.60 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber367] One cannothelp but think of the Buddhist quieting of desire and of countless “dropouts”who quit the rat race in order to find a better life. “I have no money, noresources, no hopes; I am the happiest man alive,” Henry Miller declared at thestart of his most famous work, Tropic of Cancer, an account of la vie bohème inthe Paris of the 1930s.61 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber368] Eckhart might nothave appreciated the book, but he would have agreed with Miller’s joy.Yet while Eckhart and those who followed him continued on their solitary pathtoward the “dark brilliance” and “empty fullness” of the divine, the westernmind was gearing up for a trip down the via positiva unlike any it had seen forsome time."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENAN ESOTERIC RENAISSANCE[../image/153618.jpg]In the spring of 1336, just before the start of the Hundred Years’ War, theItalian poet Petrarch (1304–1374) did something that marked a shift in westernconsciousness: he climbed a mountain to see the view. Petrarch is second only toDante in the ranks of Italian literature, and is considered Italy’s greatestlyrical poet. With Dante he shared the inspiration of an unrequited love, in hiscase the mysterious and elusive Laura.1 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber369]Petrarch’s passion for the literature of antiquity is seen as the sparkinitiating the Renaissance.2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber370] Yet for some, itwas his strange desire to scale an inhospitable height, for no reason other thana scenic one, that marks him as one of the first “modern” men.The mountain in question, Mount Ventoux, in the Provence region of France, istoday easily accessible and is famous for being on the route of the Tour deFrance. In Petrarch’s time it was a formidable peak and the idea of climbing it,or any other mountain, simply to see the view, was unheard of. Yet that is whatPetrarch did. In a letter to Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolero, an Augustinianprofessor of theology and Petrarch’s former confessor, Petrarch says, “Today Iclimbed the highest mountain in this region, which is not improperly calledVentosum (Windy).” “The only motive for my ascent,” he explains, “was the wishto see what so great a height had to offer.”3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber371]Petrarch had lived beneath the mountain’s shadow since his childhood—his familyhad moved to Avignon, then seat of the papacy, when he was eight—and one wondersif there is any connection between Petrarch’s climb and the fact that the areahad been home to the Cathars and troubadours.That Petrarch’s desire to climb Mount Ventoux was unusual for the time is clearin the response of an old shepherd he and his brother, who accompanied him,encountered on the way. When Petrarch told the old man of his plan, he reactedwith alarm and tried to dissuade the two from what was clearly a mad idea. Theshepherd himself, some fifty years earlier, had the same notion, but he did notsucceed, and all he got from scrambling on the rocks was torn clothes and abruised body. Since then, no one else had thought to do it, until now, and hewarned Petrarch that nothing good would come of it.As Owen Barfield has argued, it was not until the Romantics of the lateeighteenth century that the idea of contemplating nature as something beautifulin itself—and not as one of God’s “manifest theophanies” or for utilitarianpurposes—became popular. In A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775),the English man of letters Dr. Johnson often complains of the many lakes andmountains he and his companion James Boswell had to go around; they made thetrip long and tedious, Johnson grumbled. And in 1777, Goethe made his ownmountainous ascent when he scaled the Brocken, the highest peak of the HarzMountains, a climb that, even four centuries after Petrarch’s, was stillconsidered crazy.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber372] Yet after the publicationof William Wordsworth’s and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Lyrical Ballads in 1798,“nature” suddenly became something that people went out of their way toexperience “in the wild.” Before then, untamed nature was not sought out, andthe idea of a beautiful garden was of a well-sculpted topiary.5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber373]The fact that Petrarch was moved by some obscure desire to see what the top ofMount Ventoux “had to offer” makes him for many the first sign of a significantchange in western man’s attitude toward the world. That Petrarch himself istroubled by his curiosity comes through in his account. We have seen that ashift in the western perception of nature had begun with Eriugena and the riseof the Gothic. Until then the natural world had been seen as the province ofpagans and the devil, unworthy of man’s consideration and a temptation to avoid.But with the return of the “sacred feminine,” nature too was seen in a newlight. Petrarch participates in this, yet his conscience as a good Christianmakes his dazed appreciation of “the wide expanse of view” spread out before himuneasy, and he chides himself for admiring “the things of the world,” when histhoughts should be focused on his soul.6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber374] Hetakes comfort in a passage from St. Augustine, yet his guilt in enjoying theview surrounding him seems forced.7 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber375] Petrarchis torn between two worlds, the Christian one that makes him scorn the “worldlyobject before me,” and the new vistas that startle him.8[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber376] Yet it seems clear that for all his guiltabout his “weakness,” this strange new world has captivated him.This sense of Petrarch straddling two ages and two worlds has struck severalcommentators. For the cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt, Petrarch’s“indefinable longing for a distant panorama” makes him “one of the first trulymodern men.”9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber377] For the philosopher ErnstCassirer, Petrarch’s “desire to immediately contemplate nature” is “testimony tothe decisive change in the concept of nature that began in the thirteenthcentury.”10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber378] For Hans Blumenberg, Petrarch isboth “deeply Medieval” and “early modern.”11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber379]And for the archetypal psychologist James Hillman, Petrarch’s ascent emphasizes“the complexity and mystery of the man-psyche relationship,” making him a“discoverer” of nature, but also of the inner worlds too.12[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber380] That Burckhardt speaks of an “indefinablelonging for a distant panorama” reminds us of the notion of Sehnsucht, a Germanword central to German Romanticism that has no strict English equivalent, butwhich can be approximated by “unfulfillable longing.” In Faust, Goethe writes ofan “unbelievably sweet yearning” that drove his hero to roam “through wood andlea.”13 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber381] This is the essence of Sehnsucht andRomanticism; if Petrarch was afflicted with this nearly half a millennium beforeGoethe, he was clearly ahead of his time. Poets had of course written aboutnature before, but the sense of some “indefinable longing” associated with it isnew. The “distant panorama” that Petrarch sought in the outer world was mirroredin the new inner panoramas that western man was beginning to seek out inhimself.A CHANGE IN PERSPECTIVEAnother philosopher who saw profound significance in Petrarch’s ascent was JeanGebser. For Gebser, Petrarch’s ascent marks “the discovery of landscape” andushers in a new epoch, what Gebser calls the “perspectival world.” For Gebserthis was “the first dawning of an awareness of space that resulted in afundamental alteration of European man’s attitude in and toward the world.”14[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber382] For Gebser, Petrarch was the “first to emergefrom a space dormant in time and soul and into ‘real’ space.” If we compare thesense of space that we find in medieval tapestry with that of perspectivepainting, which was just beginning to appear around the time of Petrarch’sascent of Mount Ventoux, we can get some idea of what Gebser means.In medieval tapestry, figures and their landscapes are flat, two-dimensional;differences in size are determined not by spatial location, but by importance,so, for example, a church or other religious subject in the background willappear larger because of its spiritual significance.15[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber383] There is a sense that people of the MiddleAges did not feel space in the same way we do, as an empty expanse through whichwe move, or as a box in which we are contained. In Saving the Appearances(1957), Owen Barfield suggested that medieval man did not feel he was withinspace as if it were a container. Rather, for Barfield, medieval man wore theworld like a garment. Medieval man, Barfield suggests, saw the world quitedifferently than we do. For him the air was “filled with light proceeding from aliving sun, rather as our own flesh is filled with blood from a living heart.”The night sky was not a “homogenous vault pricked with separate points of light,but a regional qualitative sky . . . from which . . . the great zodiacalbelt . . . the planets and the moon . . . are raying down their complexinfluences on the earth.”16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber384] Barfield says thatalthough he may not have heard it, medieval man believed in the music of thespheres and he took for granted the correspondences between things on Earth andthose above: the moon’s correspondence with growth, the sun’s with gold, Venus’swith copper, that of Mars with iron, and Saturn with lead. For Barfield, thismeant that our medieval ancestors lived in a much more “participatory”relationship to the world than we do. They were “in” the world in a way that weare not, much more like figures in a painting than objects in a box. There was,we can say, a felt continuity between themselves and the world around them.All this changed, Gebser argues, with the rise of the “perspectival age.” Ifpeople of the Middle Ages were like figures in a painting, we are much more likevisitors to a gallery. Prior to this change, western man was “unperspectival.”He did not see the world in terms of his physical location within it, but interms of its hierarchical significance and symbolic meaning. With the rise ofperspective, this sense of hierarchical significance and participatorycontinuity faded. Although the separation of consciousness from the world began,Gebser believed, around 1225 B.C. with the rise of the mental-rational structureof consciousness, it did not reach its peak until the emergence of the“perspectival age.” It was at this point that the separation of consciousnessfrom the world—and, according to Gebser, from its unmanifest source,“Origin”—became complete. Petrarch’s trepidation in gazing on the “wide expanse”that left him “dazed” was, we’ve seen, informed by his conscience as a goodChristian. But it was also informed by his awareness that with his ascent ofMount Ventoux, he had cut loose his moorings and was now adrift. It was as ifsome figure in a medieval tapestry suddenly found that he could step out of thefabric of his world and move about at will. Or as if we found ourselves able tomove about freely in a film, a thrill that “virtual reality” entrepreneurs hopeto cash in on. As many sensitive minds do, Petrarch experienced in advance whatwould soon become commonplace; as Ezra Pound said, artists are the “antennae ofthe race.” With Petrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux, human consciousness, atleast in the West, became aware of distance, depth, and all that we take forgranted as “empty space.” We had detached ourselves from our ground and were nowfloating freely. In a very different sense, we were “in” the world, but not “of”it.ROOM TO MOVEThe new vistas of space that dazed Petrarch also presaged a change in howwestern man saw himself. As one scholar argued, “the man of the Middle Ages washumble, conscious almost always of his fallen and sinful nature,” and felthimself to be “a miserable foul creature watched by an angry God”—as hisreligious authorities persuaded him he was.17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber385]Now there was a shift to a rather opposite view. Man began to appreciate that hewas something more than a sinful wretch who had to endure this “vale of tears”in order to find salvation in the next world. Petrarch’s rediscovery of thegenius and greatness of the past made it clear that he had revealed a “newfoundation for the appreciation of man.”18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber386]Petrarch had tapped the “Great Memory” and found that there was reason tocelebrate man in his own right, and not see him as only a miserable sinner. Thegreat poets and thinkers of the classical age could provide profound insightsand offer models of moral and spiritual development that did not depend ondiminishing the human. The “humanities” became a guide to the good, the true,and the beautiful within the human soul. Man could stand on his own two feet andembrace the world around him, knowing that it was not sinful to do so, but anexpression of his own humanity.This new freedom was exhilarating but with it came a danger. It was at thispoint, Gebser argues, that the mental-rational structure of consciousnessentered its “deficient mode.” What had been an advantage was now becoming ahandicap. We can say that, with its deficient mode, the mental-rationalstructure had become overripe and was beginning to rot. The separation ofconsciousness from Origin that marked the beginning of the mental-rationalstructure and made possible the rise of philosophy, logic, science, and all therational forms of thought that we rightly value, now began to work to ourdisadvantage. By entering this mode, consciousness’s separation from Origin hadbecome total and man no longer felt a connection to the world. Just as Petrarchfelt dazed and confused by the vistas he saw before him, western consciousnessbegan to experience the uncertainty of its place in the cosmos.In a certain sense we can say that Petrarch’s arduous climb marked childhood’send for western man. To have the apron strings cut and to move about freely iswithout doubt necessary and exciting, but it can also be frightening. Thecelebration of the purely human values that characterized the Renaissance andled to our modern, scientific outlook—for which, needless to say, we have muchto be grateful—also led to our loss of meaning and alienation, to our sense ofbeing, in the novelist Walker Percy’s phrase, “lost in the cosmos.” From here onin, it became more and more clear that we were on our own.Yet any freedom worth having is dangerous, and the same “perspectival shift”that opened the way to our uncertain modern universe also sparked the last greatrevival of Hermetic thought. Some of those who benefited by Petrarch’s madadventure were the readers of a rediscovered Hermes Trismegistus.A BYZANTINE PLATOGeorge Gemistos Plethon’s (1355–1452/54?) attendance at the Council ofFerrara-Florence (1438–1445) is one of the secret turning points in the historyof western consciousness. It was during this visit that Gemistos adopted thename Plethon, a variant of Plato’s own. Gemistos’s knowledge and advocacy ofPlato’s philosophy so impressed the Florentine humanists he met during hisvisit, that all who heard him would have agreed with Marsilio Ficino thatGemistos had “spoken of the Platonic mysteries like a second Plato.”19[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber387] Like many we have encountered in this book,Gemistos Plethon is one of our secret teachers.Plethon (although he didn’t adopt the name until late in life I will refer tohim by it) was born in Constantinople and raised in a well-off and educatedChristian family. As a young man, he studied in Constantinople and also inAdrianople, which at the time was the capital of the Ottoman Empire; like Cairoand Baghdad before it, Adrianople had become a center of learning and we canassume Plethon made the most of it. Not much is known of Plethon’s early life.It is said that at the age of fifteen, he “visited Western Europe in the trainof Emperor John Palaeologus,” and it seems he was educated with the aim ofbecoming a teacher of philosophy.20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber388] Plethonwas lucky in his choice of career. Much more of Greek philosophy survived in theeastern empire than in the western, and the Byzantine church had also absorbedmore of Neoplatonism than its western counterpart. Around 1407, when he was pastfifty, Plethon left Adrianople and traveled through Cyprus and Palestine beforereturning to Constantinople. A few years later, he moved to Mistra, a town inthe southern Peloponnese near the ancient site of Sparta that was known for itstolerance, and where the ancient Hellenistic traditions that Plethon loved stillsurvived.Plethon’s love of Plato and the Neoplatonists was not without danger. One ofPlethon’s students in Mistra, George Scholarius, who would later becomepatriarch of Constantinople, took argument with Plethon’s appreciation of Plato,who was still considered a dangerous influence in the Aristotelian-dominatedchurch. The Byzantine church was more open to Platonic ideas than Rome, but anycriticism of Aristotle was still fraught with peril. Scholarius convinced theByzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus that Plethon’s ideas bordered on heresy.The emperor knew and respected Plethon, but to placate Scholarius he had Plethonconfined to Mistra. Plethon had little interest in religious disputes, and themore relaxed atmosphere of Mistra suited him; his confinement in fact was whollybeneficial. In Mistra, Plethon taught philosophy, astronomy, and history, andedited various collections of classical writers. He also wrote several worksarguing how the fragmenting Byzantine Empire could be reorganized along thelines of Plato’s Republic. Like Meister Eckhart, Plethon was an ableadministrator and held many important positions. He was also a judge and amember of Constantinople’s senate, and was frequently consulted on a number ofissues by the emperor and other officials.In 1428, the emperor John VIII Palaeologus consulted Plethon on the possibilityof unifying the eastern and western churches. One motivation for this was thefact that the Ottomans were edging closer to Constantinople, and the Byzantinechurch needed help in keeping the Turk at bay. Plethon himself had no love forthe Latin church, and his advice was solely motivated by realpolitik. In 1438,the emperor invited Plethon to join the advocates of the Greek church attendingthe Council of Ferrara, which was to discuss the unification (it was soon movedto Florence for several reasons, one of which was plague).Plethon was a secular thinker, but his knowledge and wisdom were assets. Alongwith several other advisers—one of whom was his ex-student now enemy,Scholarius—Plethon made the journey west. It was unusual for a man of his age totake such a trip—Plethon was in his eighties—but odd as it sounds, it was theturning point in his career. His voyage to Italy must have been interesting. Onboard ship with him was the German philosopher, theologian, and later cardinal(1449), Nicolas of Cusa (1401–1464). Nicolas had been in Constantinople to helpwith arranging the council. His philosophy of “learned ignorance” (de doctaignorantia), founded in the “negative theology” of Dionysius the Areopagite, andof the reconciliation of opposites—including different faiths—helped create thepro-Neoplatonic intellectual atmosphere that made possible the “esotericRenaissance.”21 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber389]PLATO, ARISTOTLE, AND THE PRISCA THEOLOGIAPlethon was bored by doctrinal disputes, and to keep busy while the churchmensplit hairs, he agreed to speak to the Florentine humanists about Plato and,more specifically, about the prisca theologia of which Plato was a centralexponent. Plethon benefited in having had access to many more philosophicaltexts in the original Greek than his Latin counterparts; much of what they knewof Aristotle and others had come to them second hand through Arabic sources,which Plethon corrected. It is no exaggeration to say that Plethon, the “secondPlato,” reintroduced the first to western Europe. His command of dialectic wasexemplary and the churchmen whose familiarity with Aristotle he improved were atonce in awe and in fear of this Greek whose lectures were fragrant with heresy.Plethon’s main argument was that Plato’s thought was much more in harmony withChristianity than Aristotle’s—for all of Aquinas’s scholasticism—and that whereAristotle differed from Plato, he simply misunderstood him.One of Plethon’s lectures was about Aristotle’s and Plato’s ideas of God.Plethon showed that Plato’s idea of God was much more grand and in line with thechurch’s than Aristotle’s, and he is generally credited with sparking the Platoversus Aristotle debate that raged throughout the Renaissance.22[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber390]Yet while Plato was important to Plethon, he shared his place of honor withanother. Plethon was a keen reader of the Chaldean Oracles, which he believedoriginated with Zoroaster, the great Persian sage and religious prophet. Asmentioned earlier, we know the Chaldean Oracles really emerged in second-centuryRome with the theurgic family known as the Juliani. Plethon didn’t know this;for him, the Chaldean Oracles were a fount of the “primal theology” he impressedhis audience with in Florence, and Zoroaster was their source. Plethon had cometo the Chaldean Oracles through a collection edited by the eleventh-centuryByzantine monk and philosopher Michael Psellus (1017–1078/96?). Psellus, likePlethon, was a scholar and lover of Greek and he also had a hand in another workthat, even more than the Chaldean Oracles, would have an enormous influence onthe “esoteric Renaissance.”Plethon believed the “Chaldeans” had corrupted some of the oracles, and hedeleted the suspect ones from Michael Psellus’s collection. He wrote acommentary on the rest, calling it Magical Sayings of the Magi, Disciples ofZoroaster. The result has been described as “the most extraordinary kind ofOriental mysticism and magic.”23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber391] It may bethat Plethon came to see Zoroaster as the source of the “primal theology”through a Jewish scholar named Elissaeus, with whom Plethon studied during histime in Adrianople.24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber392] Elissaeus may have beena follower of the Ishraqi school of illumination, stemming from Suhrawardi, whowe know anchored his “science of lights” in the pre-Islamic Persian theosophy ofZoroaster. As with Suhrawardi and the Imaginal World, through meditation andprayer, the devotee of the Chaldean Oracles achieves a visionary state, a kindof “inner theurgy.”25 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber393] Suhrawardi we know hadhis own version of the chain of adepts, an idea that Plethon discoursed upon tohis Florentine audience. Plethon’s great initiates included Zoroaster, Eumolpus(founder of the Eleusinian Mysteries), King Minos of Crete, the oracle ofDodona, Chiron, and the Seven Sages, as well as more familiar figures likePythagoras, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry, and Iamblichus.26[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber394] If indeed Plethon received his inspiration forhis ancient lawgivers and sages from Elissaeus the Jew, who instructed him inthe illuminist philosophy of Suhrawardi, then it seems we can trace at least onespark of the esoteric Renaissance back to Alexandria, as Suhrawardi himselfreceived inspiration from the esoteric exodus from that city.27[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber395] This would not be the only influence comingfrom that city of sects and gospels.Plethon left Florence in 1441 and returned to Mistra, where he started his ownpolytheistic “mystery school.” Here he and his students studied philosophy andsaid prayers to statues of the pagan gods. The Council had not been a successand the proposed unification of East and West did not take place. There is asense that Plethon had some intuition of a coming crisis and tried to preservewhat he could of the Hellenistic world he loved. As with his ideas aboutreforming the Byzantine Empire along Platonic lines, Plethon seems to havethought beyond the need to reform the church—as many of the Florentine humanistsdid—and more toward a revival of the pagan religions, something along the linesof Suhrawardi’s Zoroastrian “science of lights.” The philosopher and scholarGeorge of Trebizond, who attended the Council of Ferrara-Florence, wasscandalized by Plethon’s prediction that a new universal religion, based on arevival of paganism, would take the place of Christianity and Islam. Trebizondwas a staunch Aristotelian and he countered Plethon’s pro-Platonic philosophywith a work of his own.28 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber396]Plethon’s last and most heretical work, Nomoi (Book of Laws), brought together amedley of beliefs, combining Zoroastrianism with astrology, Neoplatonism, andthe Brahmins of India, as well as elements of Sufism and mystical Christianity,all linked together through his pagan polytheism which he hoped would providethe basis for a new society. It was never published, and after Plethon’s death,the book fell into the hands of his ex-pupil Scholarius, who burned it but savedjust enough to justify his actions to the authorities.THE RETURN OF HERMES TRISMEGISTUSPlethon’s Florentine lectures met with great success, and with no one more thanCosimo de’ Medici (1389–1464), the city’s great power broker.29[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber397] Cosimo had heard Plethon, and his words hadfired him. The idea of a “primal theology” at the root of all religionsimpressed him deeply, and Plethon’s championing of Plato led Cosimo to aninspired idea: he would start his own Platonic Academy, right there in Florence.It would, of course, require someone knowledgeable in Greek and well versed inphilosophy to head it. Luckily such a person was immediately at hand.It is unclear exactly who put the word in Cosimo’s ear, but the name MarsilioFicino (1433–1499), a young scholar of Greek and philosophy, was spoken ofhighly. In 1459, the twenty-six-year-old Ficino was interviewed by Cosimo andmade a good impression. By 1462, Ficino was installed in a villa in Careggi, inthe hills above Florence, and a revived Platonic Academy was open for business.It would do well. Soon Ficino’s Platonic Academy attracted numerous artists,poets, and philosophers eager to learn about the ancient philosophy, whichFicino expounded with style and insight. Important figures from his time andbeyond felt his influence, so much so that it is no exaggeration to say thatFicino “wrought a deep and lasting change in European society” and that “thewhole intellectual life of Florence . . . was under his influence.”30[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber398] We may agree with James Hillman that makingFicino solely responsible for the quattrocento is an overstatement, but it isone that comes fairly close to the truth.31 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber399]Around the same time, Cosimo, an obsessive collector of books and manuscripts,had acquired a collection of Plato’s texts that required translation into Latin.Plethon’s intuition of a coming crisis had come true. The Latin church did notcome to the aid of its Greek cousin, and in 1453, a year after Plethon’s death,Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. As the Turk drew near, many Christianscholars fled, bringing with them whatever of their libraries they could carry,selling what they could to fuel their flight. It was through this frantic escapethat Plato had arrived at Cosimo’s door.Cosimo was an old man but he had a noble ambition: he wanted to read all ofPlato before he died. To this end he gave Ficino the task of translating his newcollection. But just as he was about to begin, Cosimo ordered him to stop.Another collection of texts had arrived, and these, Cosimo believed, were evenmore important. One of Cosimo’s book scouts had come across something inMacedonia that he knew his employer would like. It was a near completecollection of the Corpus Hermeticum, the sacred works of the ancient sage andteacher Hermes Trismegistus. It had been lost for a millennium. Scraps of it hadappeared over the centuries, and the collection that came to Cosimo’s and thenFicino’s hands was most likely the version of the Hermetic writings put togetherby Michael Psellus, who had edited the Chaldean Oracles that so impressedPlethon.32 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber400] Plato was of course important. ButHermes Trismegistus shared top billing with Zoroaster as a source of the priscatheologia.33 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber401] It was from this source that thedivine Plato had drunk and so, Cosimo thought, Hermes had precedent. Ficinoagreed and got to work. It was a great sacrifice for Cosimo. He got to read theCorpus Hermeticum, but died before Ficino could get back to Plato.That Plato took a backseat to Hermes has not been lost on commentators. FrancesYates, whose groundbreaking work opened the door to the “esoteric Renaissance,”calls the situation “extraordinary.”34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber402] Some ofthe Hermetic writings were known in the Middle Ages. The Greek original of theAsclepius had been lost, but a Latin translation—incorrectly ascribed toApuleius, author of The Golden Ass—was well-known. It had been through this workthat Ficino and the other Florentine humanists had come to understand theimportance of Hermes Trismegistus. It was the Asclepius that drew the ire of St.Augustine, who condemned its advocacy of theurgy, and which led him to condemnall magic as the work of demons. It is also in the Asclepius that Hermes makeshis gloomy prophecy about Egypt’s coming “dark days.” But while the Asclepius isa work of magic and prophecy, the works of the Corpus Hermeticum have adifferent character. Most of the Florentine humanists were also good Christiansand they could be expected to hesitate when dipping into a work of magic that animportant figure like Augustine considered dangerous. But these texts weredifferent, and the belief that with them they had gained access to a source ofthe “primal theology” excited Ficino and his friends.A MELANCHOLY PLATONISTFicino was the son of a doctor and one suspects that he would have followed inhis father’s footsteps had it not been for the influence of his mother. Sheappears to have been of a dark, brooding, melancholy nature and also to havepossessed certain psychic gifts. Accounts say she predicted her mother’s deathand her husband’s riding accident accurately, and that with her frail physiqueand emotional sensitivity, she was considered somewhat odd.35[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber403] Ficino seems to have inherited his mother’scharacteristics. He had a melancholy nature which his physical frailty anddeformity—he was hunchbacked and dwarfish in appearance—could not have helped.The picture one gets of him is of a sensitive, retiring, physically shy butmentally active individual, who enjoyed company, conversation—although he had astammer—music, and the arts.Yet in a sense Ficino did inherit his father’s role as a healer. Ficino’sparticular attraction to Hermetic ideas led to his developing them into a kindof Renaissance psychotherapy.36 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber404] His father hadattended men’s bodies, but he would heal their souls. It was as a “Doctor ofSouls,” a name he had given to Plato, that Ficino would be known to hiscontemporaries, and it was in the same capacity that a kind of Ficino revivaltook place in the 1980s and ’90s. This was mostly through the work of JamesHillman, whose influential book Re-Visioning Psychology, published in 1975, castthe “loveless, humpbacked, melancholy” Ficino as a precursor to Hillman’s owndoctrine of the “centrality of soul,” crucial to his “archetypal psychology.”37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber405]Ficino first came across Plato through his Latin teacher, who also introducedhim to his second love, music; as part of his later esoteric practice, Ficinowould compose music and sing the Orphic Hymns, something Gemistos Plethon did aswell. His interest in Plato was further piqued by lectures he attended at theUniversity of Florence, where his instructor encouraged him to continue withGreek. Ficino had a knack for it, and the little Plato he encountered providedmuch more felicitous examples of the language than Aristotle. Yet Aristotle’sinfluence was inescapable, and Ficino’s obvious preference for the hated Platosoon got him into trouble. He was accused of heresy by the archbishop ofFlorence, forbidden to study Greek, and advised to reread his Thomas Aquinas.Ever the accommodating soul, Ficino did as he was told—but continued with Greek.He took classes in medicine at the University of Bologna and it seemed he was onhis way to a medical career after all when Cosimo’s desire to reinstate theproscribed Plato led him to headhunt for the right man for the job. Ficino mayhave been born under a bad sign—he was a Libra, and Saturn was in the ascendantat the time of his birth, apropos, it seems, for his future career. But here atleast the stars were in his favor.It is as a translator and explicator of Plato’s philosophy that Ficino is bestknown, and it is clear that he took his role seriously. He reenacted theSymposium every November 7, the date of Plato’s original philosophical drinkingparty, although in most ways his dedication to the philosophical life was muchmore ascetic. He rose early, worked steadily, was vegetarian and sparing inthat. In many ways Ficino’s daily life is reminiscent of the Pythagorean ideal.His sexuality remains ambiguous. He may have been homosexual. He did speak of a“unique friend,” Giovanni Cavalcanti, a poet and member of Ficino’s PlatonicAcademy, who lived with Ficino for many years in Careggi. Not surprisingly,Ficino characterized their relationship as “Platonic love”—a term he introducedto the West—and their friendship, and Ficino’s others, is thought to have beenchaste. As his appreciation of the Symposium suggests, Ficino was more likelyinterested in an eroticism of the soul, not the body.The soul, in fact, was everything for Ficino. His major work, Platonic Theology,a massive tome consisting of eighteen books which Ficino labored on for fiveyears, has the immortality of the soul as its central concern. It was an attemptto bring together Platonic philosophy and Christianity, a union that wouldoccupy many Renaissance minds yet which his Byzantine benefactor Plethonopposed.38 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber406] The notion of an immortal soul hadalready been part of Christian doctrine, but it was not made Christian dogmauntil the Lateran Council of 1512–1517, a decision almost certainly influencedby Ficino’s work.HERMETIC THERAPYFicino also explored the secrets of Hermes Trismegistus. Magic throughout theMiddle Ages was considered demonic. We have seen the bad reputation theAsclepius had. Another work that Ficino knew, not ascribed to HermesTrismegistus but linked to him, was the Picatrix, an Arab manual of spiritevocation and astrology based on a variety of sources: Hermetic, alchemical,Sufi, and others. One source is thought to have been Jabir ibn Hayyan, who, aswe’ve seen, was known to the West as Geber. It was most likely written in theeleventh century and translated into Latin in the thirteenth century. It is akind of guide to talismanic magic, talismans being certain symbols thought toattract celestial energies. In a Neoplatonic sense, the Picatrix is a text ontheurgy.Ficino’s reading of the Neoplatonists convinced him that their theurgicpractices were not, as St. Augustine had argued, demonic, but were based on theuse of natural forces, on, in fact, the Anima mundi. To draw down beneficialstellar influences and to repel baleful ones became for him a kind of practicalastrology, a way of using the vital energies of the Anima mundi to compensatefor the celestial cards one was dealt at birth. In Ficino’s case, the fact thatat his birth Saturn was in the ascendant accounted for his melancholy character;the fact that he had also inherited his mother’s disposition, and that he hadchosen philosophy as a career, only made things worse. Astrologically, Saturn isthe planet of time, limits, restrictions, and responsibilities; it is also knownas the “Great Teacher.” All philosophers have what we might call an excess ofSaturn, hence their serious, pensive character. We can say in Ficino’s case, hehad it doubly so. To compensate for this, the philosopher needs to balancethings with more jovial (Jupiter) and venereal (Venus) influences. Ficinodeveloped a theurgic means of doing this.Medieval man felt the influence of the stars as a fate he was unable to avoid,yet Ficino shared in the new sense of man’s own inherent powers by using thestars’ own energies to guide his destiny. Through the power of the Hermetictalismans, Ficino could draw down the venereal and jovial energies needed tocounterbalance his saturnine disposition. They acted, in a way, as “astralmagnets.” The talismans were able to do this because, as symbols, they werecloser, in an ontological sense, to the Anima mundi. And as they were Hermeticsymbols, and stemmed from the prisca theologia—that is, the ancient source—theywere even more powerful. Through the power of correspondence, they were able toattract the desired celestial energies or repel unwanted ones. Ficino in factbelieved that through knowledge of the correspondences between symbols and theAnima mundi, the Hermetist could “repair” parts of the world that had “fallenfrom grace,” a belief that caused him some trouble with the church.39[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber407]Talismans and the symbols they employed occupied a position closer to thePlatonic Forms out of which, as a good Neoplatonist, Ficino believed God hadcreated the world. In this sense they occupied a similar place to Suhrawardi’sHūrqalyā, the intermediary Imaginal World that exists in between the realm ofpure intellect (the Forms) and the physical world. Through using the power ofthe talismans Ficino was, in a sense, drawing on God’s own powers. In this wayhe had shown that man could now become a cocreator with God.Along with the talismans, Ficino also devised a way of using the naturalcorrespondences between earthly things and the Anima mundi. The participatorymode of consciousness associated with the right brain is aware of the “networkof connections that links everything with everything else,” and earlier we sawan example of this in Owen Barfield’s description of how medieval man saw theworld around him. For the Hermetist, certain colors, scents, music, naturalforms, minerals, times of day, numbers, and other items were associated withdifferent celestial and planetary energies. In some way, these are able toabsorb beneficial forces from the stars. Ficino’s “Hermetic therapy” worked byusing the knowledge of these correspondences to create an environment that wouldattract the stellar influences one desired; hence Frances Yates’s remark thatsomeone following Ficino’s Hermetic prescriptions was rather like the client ofan expensive psychiatrist, who could afford to buy beautiful objects and spendtime meditating on paintings or listening to music. Strumming a lyre, singing anOrphic Hymn, burning incense, drinking wine, and meditating on a talisman whileat ease in your private chamber were the means by which Ficino’s therapy worked.Through their knowledge of the Hermetic correspondences, Ficino’s “patients”could create a kind of celestial “strange attractor,” funneling the stellarinfluences into their own home. Ficino brought together many of his ideas about“Hermetic therapy” in his Renaissance “self-help” books, On Making Your LifeAgree with the Heavens and The Book of Life, giving his readers a knowledge thatallowed them a kind of control over their lives denied to their medievalancestors.THE MAGIC OF ARTIt is clear that Ficino’s “therapy” employed the via positiva and it is throughhis impact on the artists of the Renaissance that he had his greatest influenceon the western soul. While the Neoplatonic theurgists wanted to imbue statues ofthe gods with life, the Renaissance artists who came under Ficino’s spell didsomething perhaps even more miraculous. As Frances Yates writes, “it is chieflyin this imaginative and artistic sense that we should understand the influenceof the Renaissance magic . . . inaugurated by Ficino . . . The operative Magi ofthe Renaissance were the artists and it was a Donatello or a Michelangelo whoknew how to infuse the divine life into statues.”40[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber408] This ability of the Renaissance artist toimbue inanimate objects with a strange, powerful life—which remains as vitaltoday as when it first appeared—is a clear example of the new confidence inman’s own godlike powers, symbolized by Petrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux. Oneexample of Ficino’s influence on a Renaissance masterpiece is Botticelli’sPrimavera (1482), which, aptly enough, is an allegory of the return of life inthe spring. The painting, Yates tells us, was directed by Ficino and represents“a practical application of [Ficino’s] magic, as a complex talisman, an ‘imageof the world,’ arranged so as to transmit only healthful, rejuvenating,anti-Saturnian influences to the beholder.”41 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber409]Ficino believed that the purpose of art was to remind the soul of its origin inthe divine world, to create a kind of “homesickness” for the higher realms. Itgave, in a way, a direction for the yearning for “distant panoramas” which,we’ve seen, began with Petrarch.RETURN OF THE MAGIAnother Renaissance magician who in his own way sought out distant panoramas wasthe philosopher Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), who came intoFicino’s orbit in 1484. Pico was born in Mirandola, near Modena, and was raisedin a brilliant and wealthy family. Even as a child he displayed an astonishingmemory, and early on his mother decided he would have a career in the church. Asa teenager, he studied law in Bologna. For the next several years, he went tovarious Italian and French universities where he mastered Greek, Latin, Hebrew,Arabic, and Chaldee. Pico’s temperament was the polar opposite of Ficino’s tactand circumspection, his fiery character earning him recognition as the “mostromantic of the Humanists.”42 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber410] When his motherdied in 1480, Pico turned his attention to philosophy. At around the same time,he began a friendship with a young Dominican monk, Girolamo Savonarola(1452–1498), who later became infamous through the “Bonfire of the Vanities,” apublic burning of books, artworks, musical instruments, practically anythingthat could possibly give rise to an “occasion of sin” or to celebrate man at theexpense of God. (Today a similar cultural vandalism is regularly performed bythe Taliban and more recently ISIS.) Savonarola’s rabid antihumanism—Ovid andDante were among those whose works he destroyed—can be seen as a desperateattempt to push back the clock, to, in a sense, reject the shift in westernconsciousness triggered by Petrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux.Pico had read the Chaldean Oracles and had discovered the Kabbalah. He wasfamiliar with the works of the Hermetica, and the idea of the prisca theologialed him to the notion of synthesizing the Christian, pagan, and Hebrewtraditions into one doctrine. This was the basis for the nine hundredtheological theses he planned to defend in a public debate in Rome. In 1486,while waiting to start the debate, he published the theses. Pope Innocent VIIIhad a look at them, got wind of Pico’s plan, and put a stop to it. Thirteen ofPico’s theses were condemned outright, and the rest did not fare much better.The general criticism was that they “reproduced the errors of paganphilosophers” and that they seemed to endorse magic.Pico’s magic was not the harmless natural kind that Ficino had convinced theauthorities was behind his talismans and “Hermetic therapy.” Pico had somewhatgrander designs, and an idea of why the church found his theses dangerous can beseen in the one we have already quoted: “There is no science which gives us moreassurance of Christ’s divinity than magic and the Kabbalah.” Pico’s boldstatement was meant to assert Christ’s supremacy, but for the learnedtheologians who questioned him, he seemed to be saying that Christ was merelyone magician among others, an idea with which the church could not agree. Facedwith certain arrest, Pico fled Italy but was stopped in France, where he wasimprisoned.Pico was eventually allowed to return to Florence a few years later butsomething had changed in him, and the follower of Plato, Hermes, and the othersages of the prisca theologia had now become a disciple of the dour Savonarola,agreeing with him that “the least little child of the Christians is better thanSocrates and Plato.” He gave away his fortune and burned his poetry. He haddecided to become a wandering evangelist but was prevented from starting thisnew career by his untimely death at thirty-one. The cause of his death remains amystery and there is some suspicion that he may have been poisoned, a notuncommon occurrence in Renaissance Florence.Before his flight and arrest, Pico was able to deliver his famous Oration on theDignity of Man, which contains the essence of his theses. Its celebration of thenew belief in man’s own powers contrasts sharply with his later chastenedhumility. Pico’s aim was to show that humanity could get to the roots of beingitself, to the logos behind creation. Where Ficino limited himself to drawing onthe beneficial energies of the Anima mundi, Pico went further and argued thatman had access to godlike powers, to the Forms themselves. The Oration has beencalled “the manifesto of humanism” but Pico’s aim was for something much morelike “superhumanism.”43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber411] In a sense we can seehim as the godfather of the “human potential movement” that began in the 1960s.The Oration begins with a remark by Abdala the Saracen—thought to be a cousin ofMohammed—who, when asked what in the world was most worthy of wonder, hadanswered “man.” Pico remarks that in the Asclepius—perhaps not the best work touse in his defense—Hermes says much the same: “What a great miracle is man.” (Sowould Shakespeare in Hamlet: “What a piece of work is a man!”) Pico’s centralargument is, as Colin Wilson put it, that man is a god who “has forgotten hisheritage and come to accept that he is a beggar.”44[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber412] His aim was to remind man of his roots,something the entire Hermetic tradition wished to do.Pico points out man’s peculiar position in the cosmos. Unlike all other createdbeings, man has no fixed nature nor fixed place; as the Asclepius and Poimandrestell us, man is dual-natured, with equal parts of the earth and the spirit. Heis also a microcosm, a little cosmos, containing the whole of creation in hisown being. “The Supreme Maker decrees,” Pico writes, that man “should have ashare in the particular endowment of every other creature . . . We have givenyou, O Adam, no visage proper to yourself.”45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber413]“We have made you a creature neither of heaven nor of earth, neither mortal orimmortal, in order that you may, as the free and proud shaper of your own being,fashion yourself in the form you may prefer.”46[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber414]As Petrarch had discovered, man was not chained to the earth nor was he only alowly worm, wretched and sinful. Man, Pico tells us, can make of himself what hewill. He can “descend to the lower, brutish forms of life” or “rise again to thesuperior orders whose life is divine.”47 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber415] (InPico’s posthumously published Treatise Against Astrology, he embraces Ficino’sbelief that man can alter his fate and free himself from the dominance of thestars.) It is man’s choice how he will live, which parts of himself he willdevelop and which reject: “Whichever of these [the brutish or the superior formsof life] a man should cultivate, the same will bear fruit in him.”48[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber416]Critics as far apart as the Traditionalist René Guénon and the feminist thinkerCharlene Spretnak have seen Pico’s call to arms as little more than anexpression of a dangerous hubris. For them, Pico’s philosophy is an attempt to“bring everything down to purely human elements” and results in the complete“humanization” of the world, at the expense of both nature and the sacred.49[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber417] There is much to consider in these criticismsand we should remember that Pico himself abandoned his own philosophy in favorof Savonarola’s antihumanism. Yet such caveats should not obscure the importanceof Pico’s ideas. I think we must agree with Frances Yates that “the profoundsignificance of Pico della Mirandola in the history of humanity can hardly beoverestimated.”50 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber418] After him, western man wasconfident again in his own powers and in his ability to act upon the world andcontrol his destiny.Someone who agreed with Pico was Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), who was burned atthe stake at the Campo de’ Fiori in Rome in 1600. His execution marks anunmistakable shift in the church’s attitude toward Hermes and magic. Bruno wasborn in Nola, then part of the Kingdom of Naples, in the foothills of MountVesuvius, an appropriate birthplace for someone of his explosive character. Hislife was one long, wearying, and eventually disastrous conflict with theecclesiastical authorities.Bruno’s execution is generally seen to be the result of his championing of theCopernican heliocentric solar system against the longstanding Ptolemaicgeocentric one. Copernicus’s groundbreaking (“universe shattering,” actually)book On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres was published in 1543, justbefore he died. Like Ficino, Copernicus was a wary sort and it was only withgreat difficulty that his friends finally persuaded him to let his work seeprint. As Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince make clear in The Forbidden Universe,Copernicus was well steeped in the Hermetic philosophy, and they make a strongargument that the central idea of Copernicus’s theory—that the Sun, and not theEarth, is the center of our patch of the universe—was itself a Hermeticinsight.51 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber419] Their book is key to understandinghow much of the science that would soon denounce the Hermetic, occult, andesoteric view of the world as superstitious nonsense, itself emerged from thevery worldview it sought to annul.Yet while Bruno accepted Copernicus’s “discovery”—Aristarchus of Samos (310–230B.C.) had presented his own heliocentric theory ages earlier, and Copernicushimself gives credit to two members of the Aurea Catena, Pythagoras and hisdisciple Philolaus (a teacher of Plato), for helping him—the real reason for hisauto-da-fé was his belief in an infinite universe filled with innumerableworlds, a vision that is much more like our own, and which he shared withNicolas of Cusa, Gemistos Plethon’s shipmate. For Bruno (and Nicolas), the Earthwas not the center of the universe but one star among countless others in aspace that was endless. The fact that Bruno also wanted to see a return of theancient Egyptian religion—much as Gemistos Plethon wanted to see a revival ofpagan beliefs—with himself at its head could not have helped. Bruno believed thechurch had brought about the decline of man and was responsible for the kind ofspiritual “dark days” prophesied in the Asclepius. Like Pico, Bruno made it hismission to reawaken men to their true position in the cosmos, and in perhaps hismost controversial work, The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast, he celebratesthe return of the Egyptian gods and portrays himself as their avatar.TRIALS OF THE MAGICIANLike many at the time, Bruno began his career in the church. At seventeen, heentered a Dominican order. It was when he was preparing to be ordained, at theage of twenty-four, that Bruno’s remarkable powers of memory seem to have becomeapparent. Pico, too, displayed an impressive memory, but Bruno seems to havesurpassed even his. In The Art of Memory (1966), Frances Yates argues that Brunorevived “magical memory,” an ancient mnemonic discipline that would become anindispensable part of the magician’s armory. In order to remember their longorations, Roman rhetoricians would memorize a series of places in an imaginarybuilding and they would decorate these “inner rooms” with various images relatedto the subject of their speech. As they inwardly walked through their “memorypalaces,” the different images reminded them of the appropriate part of theirspeech, some of which were hours long. Today, with concerns about memory lossand ADHD due to overindulgence in computers and video games, the kind of memorythe ancients seemed to enjoy and which Bruno revived strikes us as nothing shortof magical. As we will see, it was precisely for magical purposes that Brunodeveloped it.Bruno’s intransigence began when he threw away images of the saints, keepingonly a crucifix, something the participants in the Protestant Reformation(1517–1648) were busily doing themselves. At the same time, he seems to haverecommended several “dangerous” books to a fellow monk; one of these may havebeen the works of the humanist Erasmus, whom the church had banned. Moreoffenses followed, the most serious being his defense of the Arian heresy. Brunowas forced to flee Naples and the Inquisition, and he did not stop running untilhis arrest in 1592. For thirteen years, Bruno traced a dizzying route throughmuch of Europe, crisscrossing the Continent in a fruitless search for a stableresting place. Many of Bruno’s troubles were of his own making. His querulous,often paranoid character lost him his friends and earned many enemies.Yet Bruno did more than argue, and during his Wanderjahre, he earned a degree intheology, lectured in philosophy, was in and out of the church, put on and tookoff his monk’s habit, gave demonstrations of his “magical memory,” and performedother feats that seemed to many much more like “black magic.” From Italy heentered France, then Switzerland, then England, where he tried to get a teachingposition at Oxford, and where he lectured on the return of the Egyptian gods aswell as the Copernican system. He then went to Germany and Bohemia (today theCzech Republic). In Prague, Bruno spent six months at the court of the HolyRoman Emperor Rudolph II, known for his alchemical and all-round eccentricinterests; other of Rudolph II’s guests included the magician John Dee and his“scryer” Edward Kelly, the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, and thealchemists Michael Maier and Michael Sendivogius.52[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber420] Bruno informed Rudolph II that he, theemperor, was the “new Hermes Trismegistus.” Bruno’s flattery did not secure hima home in Prague—most likely Bruno really reserved the notion of being a new“thrice great one” for himself—and he was forced to move on.More travels and controversy followed. The end was in sight in 1591, when Brunoattended the Frankfurt Book Fair. Bruno had written about his “magical memory”and a reader of his work invited him to Venice to tutor him in this art. It wasa dangerous risk to return to Italy, but Bruno needed the work and he bet on theInquisition having a worse memory than his. Yet his argumentative personalityonce again cost him, and his patron, weary of Bruno’s demands and concernedabout his claims to godhood—and his own possible complicity in them—mentionedhis name to the Inquisition. Bruno was soon arrested on charges of blasphemy,heresy, magic, and preaching the belief in many worlds. For his encounter withhis inquisitors, Bruno had armed himself with a selection of magical talismans,more powerful than the kind Ficino used, and it seems he carried himself offwell. But then the pope stepped in, and in 1593 Bruno was on his way to Rome.He remained in jail for the next seven years, the length of his trial.Heliocentrism was not made heretical until 1616, so technically it did notfigure in the charges against Bruno. (The church held its anti-Copernicanposition until the mid-eighteenth century; today it maintains an observatory.53[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber421]) Along with preaching the belief ininnumerable worlds, the worse charges against Bruno were those of practicingmagic. It was Bruno’s bad luck that he was up against a character as martial ashimself, Cardinal Bellarmine, who would confront Galileo, another willfulpersonality, some years later. Bruno recanted on many points where it was clearhe had contradicted church dogma, but on the issue of innumerable worlds herefused. He might have taken a feather from Galileo’s cap—if we can excuse theanachronism—and recanted this as well, muttering under his breath “There arestill many.”54 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber422] But Bruno found compromisedifficult, and like others the church found too dangerous to ignore, he was sentto the flames.MAGICAL MEMORIESBruno is remembered today as a martyr to free thought and a victim of thechurch’s tyranny. But his real importance is as a magician and visionary, and itis in his ideas about “magical memory” that this is most clear. Bruno tookseriously the Hermetic injunction that in order to understand God, one must makeoneself equal to him. His means of doing this was through his “magical memory.”Bruno devised a method of impressing on his consciousness divine images of thecelestial archetypes, what he called “the seals of the stars,” much in the waythat Ficino had used talismans to attract beneficial astral energies. For Bruno,these images were “shadows” or reflections of the Platonic Forms—the title ofhis book The Shadow of Ideas says as much. Taking the images from the Hermeticbooks, Bruno made talismans and then fixed these symbols in his memory,furnishing his mind in the same way that the ancient rhetoricians furnishedtheir “memory palaces.”As with Ficino, these Hermetic images had great power, and it was through themthat Bruno believed he performed magic and impressed his will upon the world.Ficino would never be so bold as to say it, but Bruno had no hesitation indeclaring that in this way he became a cocreator with God. His images, rangingthrough the Great Chain of Being from minerals to man, constituted an inneruniverse, at the center of which was the magician, just as the sun was at thecenter of the new Copernican cosmos. In this way Bruno stood outside space andtime and achieved the “cosmic consciousness” that was the goal of the ancientHermetists. From humbly using the “natural” energies of the Anima mundi, theRenaissance magician had now become something much more like God himself.THE END OF MAGICBy the time of Bruno’s death, the church had turned away from anything to dowith magic or Hermes Trismegistus. It had seemed for a time that there was agood chance that at least some Hermetic ideas would find a place within thechurch’s compass. Ficino’s attempt to bring Plato and Christ together had madean impression, and not a few within the church thought that if not a union ofthe two, at least a broadening of the church’s view to include worthy fellowtravelers like Hermes was possible. Evidence for Hermes’ brief high standing canbe seen in the mosaic pavement at the entrance to the Cathedral of Siena, put inplace by Giovanni di Stefano in 1488. Here Hermes is flanked by two sibyls,ancient oracles who, like Hermes himself, were considered prophets of Christ. Aninscription relates that Hermes was a contemporary of Moses, whoserepresentation seems to be bowing before the Egyptian. Another figure may beAsclepius, and Hermes’ hand rests on a tablet containing a passage from theAsclepius.Even more striking are the Hermetic frescoes in the Appartamento Borgia in theVatican. Painted by Bernardino di Betto—better known as Pinturicchio—for the“Borgia pope” Alexander VI, a devotee of magic, the frescoes display the careerof Hermes in his many forms, one of which is as the teacher of Moses. Otherfigures include Isis and the Apis bull, which was identified with Osiris, andformed one half of the syncretic god Serapis whose Serapeum in Alexandria wasdestroyed by Patriarch Theophilus in 391. The bull was a symbol of the Borgiafamily, and in the frescoes, the Borgia bull is identified with Apis. Theconnection with Osiris suggests that in some way Alexander VI saw himself aslinked to the ancient Egyptian gods, and he may have had an interest in theirrevival that predated Bruno’s.55 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber423]There were other hopeful signs. In 1540, the humanist, biblical scholar, andCatholic apologist Agostino Steuco coined the term philosophia perennis(“perennial philosophy”) to account for the harmony he saw between the paganphilosophies and the church. In 1579, the alchemist and bishop of Aire, FrançoisFoix de Candale, argued that the Hermetic books should be made canonical, anoutlook that informed the Venetian philosopher and scientist Francesco Patriziwhen, toward the end of the century, he petitioned Pope Clement VIII to haveHermetic ideas taught in Christian schools. Patrizi shared with Plethon acriticism of Aristotle and held the belief that Plato and other pagan thinkersheralded Christ.56 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber424]Many respected minds defended Plato and Hermes, but it was not the best time toask the church to embrace magic. Works like Cornelius Agrippa’s (1486–1535)Three Books of Occult Philosophy (1531), a mammoth compendium of the dark artsand “one of the most important works in the western magical tradition,” seemedto return to the kind of thing associated with the Picatrix.57[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber425] A pious Christian, Agrippa argued for the needto know the true God and the importance of a strong faith, but with its focus onplanetary spirits, elementals (spirits of fire, water, air, and earth), the evilpower of menstrual blood, folk remedies, numerology, and other suspectpractices, to many his work smacked more of sorcery than philosophy.58[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber426] Agrippa himself had been taught by thecryptologist and abbot Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516), who had also taughtParacelsus. Trithemius was accused of conjuring demons, and his association withthe unlucky Doctor Johann Faustus (1480–1539), whom he called “the mostaccomplished alchemist that ever lived,” could not have helped his reputation;stories of Faust’s pact with the devil began to appear in 1587.59[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber427]John Dee (1527–1609), Queen Elizabeth I’s astrologer and a guest of Rudolph II,contacted angels through the services of his medium, Edward Kelly, by allaccounts a dubious character. The angels spoke to Dee in a curious language hecalled “Enochian,” named after the biblical figure whom the Muslims associatedwith Hermes Trismegistus.60 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber428] Dee was as much amathematician and early scientist as a magician, and in the early days beforescience’s triumph, its association with magic—through their shared use ofmathematics—did not serve it well.61 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber429] Therising antimagic sensibility conflated anything to do with mathematics ornumbers with evil “conjurations,” and books of mathematics were considered justas pernicious as those containing spells.62 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber430]Dee—who according to his biographer, anticipated in some ways Newton andGalileo—was eventually accused of black magic; his library was vandalized and hedied in poverty and obscurity.63 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber431]What turned the consciousness of the time so vehemently against magic? In onesense we can see it as a turn away from the via positiva embodied in theRenaissance and a movement toward the via negativa. It was precisely accusationsof a concern with worldly beauty and magic made against Catholicism thatprompted Martin Luther to nail his famous theses to the door of the Wittenbergchurch in 1517, thus inaugurating the Protestant Reformation. Among otherthings, Luther was disgusted with the practice of “indulgences.” These wereassurances given to the faithful that for a price, a priest would intercede ontheir behalf or that of a loved one, arranging things so that their salvationwould go smoothly. It was a way to secure a good seat in heaven, more or less.The money went to help rebuild the basilica of St. Peter in Rome, which may havebeen a worthy cause; like the Gothic cathedrals, we can see it as an expressionof the via positiva. Yet Luther and the Protestant Reformation he triggered werevery much informed by the via negativa, and saw such designs as so muchfrippery. Like Meister Eckhart, they were interested in a direct route to Godand had no time for intermediaries.More to the point, they saw little difference between a priest arranging thingsin the afterlife and a magician consulting the Picatrix to command a demon. Infact, as D. P. Walker argues in Spiritual and Demonic Magic: From Ficino toCampanella, the Catholic Mass can be seen as a kind of Ficinian magicalritual.64 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber432] All the elements are there: music,magical words, incense, lights, wine, and a form of theurgy or, more precisely,theophagy, the ingestion of the god in the form of the Communion wafer. It wasthis sort of practice, coupled with a polytheistic pantheon of saints and theimages associated with them, that sent Protestant iconoclasts raging in citieslike Zurich, Copenhagen, and Geneva, destroying statues and paintings in a waythat made Savonarola’s bonfire seem like a picnic.The Reformation had no interest in magic, and the church already had its own.Neither needed or wanted Hermes or anyone else. The kind of fundamentalism theProtestants endorsed was much like the kind that sent Suhrawardi to his deathand had the Arab leader Amr ibn al’Aas burn the books of the library ofAlexandria. The Protestants burned books too. In England in 1550, during thereign of the teenage king Edward VI, the first raised as a Protestant, hugebonfires blazed in Oxford, and entire libraries were thrown into them. Among thevolumes burned were works of mathematics and science. Much like Abbot Amalric,who during the “sack of Béziers” made no distinction between Cathar andfaithful, and ordered his army to “kill them all,” leaving it to God to “knowhis own,” the Protestant Puritans ignored the difference between magic andanything else they couldn’t understand.HUMAN OR SUPERHUMAN?The church had other reasons for closing ranks and shutting the door on theprisca theologia. For a time during this period, there was a jockeying forposition among the different competitors for what we might call the dominantview of man’s place in the cosmos.65 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber433] Briefalliances were made, but in the end, of the four competing views—that of thechurch, rising science, humanism, and the Hermetic philosophy—it was Hermeticismand the esoteric or “occult sciences” that fared the worst.Ironically, it was not the church nor nascent science that dealt the Hermetictradition a serious if not fatal blow, but the very humanism that emerged fromPetrarch’s interest in the past and penchant for mountain climbing, and whichinformed the Hermetic revival itself. In 1610, the French Huguenot IsaacCasaubon, considered the most learned man in Europe, was asked by James I ofEngland to write a criticism of Cardinal Caesar Baronius’s AnnalesEcclesiastici, a vast Counter-Reformation history of the church. James I wastrying to find a “middle way” between the extremes of Catholicism andProtestantism, and he thought Casaubon was the man for the job. The underminingof Hermes Trismegistus’s reputation was really only some collateral damageincurred during Casaubon’s research.66 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber434]Baronius had repeated the church father Lactantius’s remarks about how HermesTrismegistus had prophesized the coming of Christ. Casaubon knew that as a sageof the prisca theologia, Hermes Trismegistus was supposed to be a source forPlato’s philosophy. But Casaubon also knew that there was no mention of Hermesin Plato, or in any of the other pagan philosophers who were supposed to havereceived Hermes’ wisdom. Casaubon’s scholarly instincts were piqued. Consultingthe Corpus Hermeticum closely, Casaubon came to the conclusion that the Greek itwas written in was a form of Greek that came after Plato. It was not the Greekof the time before Plato; it was a later Greek, not an earlier one. It was, infact, the Greek of Roman Alexandria. Casaubon’s conclusion was that whoeverwrote the Corpus Hermeticum, it was not written at the “dawn of time,” norduring the time of Moses, or at any time earlier than the first centuries afterthe birth of Christ. These texts were not as old as they were believed to be.In the end, Casaubon decided that the writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistuswere really written by Alexandrian Christians who concocted these forgeries inorder to bring pagans to the true faith, by showing that one of the great pagansages of the past had anticipated the incarnation of Christ. Plato did not learnfrom Hermes; the authors of these works incorporated Platonic ideas into them.And they did not speak of “Egyptian wisdom”; the Christian parallels were tooclear for that and accounted for the mistaken idea that the thrice-great one hadsomehow got advance knowledge of Christ. It was a pious fraud, but a fraudnonetheless. This was more or less the understanding of the Corpus Hermeticumfor centuries, but more recent scholarship questions much of it.67[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber435]Casaubon was only following his scholarly instincts and did not intend to castdoubt on the authenticity of the Hermetica. Yet what was at work here werereally two different notions of humanism. I’ve suggested that the humanismassociated with Pico was really a kind of “superhumanism.” It wanted to expandthe idea of the human so that it would embrace the godlike. William Blakecaptured its essence in “The Everlasting Gospel” when he wrote “Thou art a Man:God is no more/Thy own Humanity learn to adore.” Blake wasn’t celebratingatheism; the god he rejects is “Old Nobodaddy,” the demiurge of the Gnostics,whom he associates with Urizen, his mythological embodiment of an unrestrictedrationality.68 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber436] Blake wanted man to celebratehis powers, specifically his imagination. We can see the struggle between Urizen(“Your reason”) and Los, Blake’s symbol of the imagination, as that between theleft and right brain.A similar opposition developed in the early days of humanism. One side looked toGreek philosophy, to Neoplatonism and Hermetism, and was passionate aboutmetaphysics and science. It saw the world from a “cosmic” perspective and wasinterested in the big questions: life, death, destiny, God. It was speculative,inspired, and used intuition as much as intellect. The other side took Rome, notGreece, as its model. Its concerns were good form and rhetoric; the Latinorators were its guides. Rome had no philosophy or religion of its own andborrowed what it had from the Greeks, but it excelled at practical pursuits,like making roads and building empires. This form of humanism was urbane,sophisticated, and skeptical. It focused on getting things “right,” and was lessprone to excess than Pico or Bruno. It counseled curbing enthusiasm in favor ofcool appraisal. Its version of humanism is the one we are more familiar withtoday. We can see it as a kind of “only humanism.”It does not take too much to suggest that “superhumanism” is more slanted towarda right-brain perception, while “only humanism” veers more to the left, with itsexactitude and eye for detail. If this is so, we can see Casaubon’s criticalnit-picking as left-brain humanism bringing down the right.69[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber437] What Pico, Bruno, and others saw as a messageof man’s inherent godhood, Casaubon and earlier humanists like Eramus saw asexaggerated gushing; as Frances Yates said, “an atmosphere of unadulteratedhumanism is not one which is congenial to the Magus.”70[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber438] The “only humanist” is always bringing the“superhumanist” down to earth and chiding him for his bad grammar and excesses.Casaubon himself has gone down in history as the archetype of the dry-as-dustgrammarian. A character of this description is named after him in George Eliot’snovel Middlemarch, and the pedantic scholar in Umberto Eco’s anti-esoteric novelFoucault’s Pendulum shares his name as well. Oddly, the right-brain-orientedhumanism, with its interest in mathematics and philosophy—which itsleft-oriented brother disliked—would soon grow into modern science, occupyingthe now empty space left by the retreat of Hermes. And the church, now free ofits cosmic rival, would for a time have unchallenged dominance in man’sspiritual concerns.Casaubon’s almost offhand undermining of the authenticity of the CorpusHermeticum—and, by association, that of the prisca theologia—happened in 1614.In the years that followed, the Hermetic view slowly but surely lost ground.Marin Mersenne’s attack on the esoteric tradition as a whole—spelled out in theIntroduction—took place in 1623. Any vision of the world that saw it as a livingintelligent whole, infused with spirit, interconnected by subtle correspondencesand invisible forces with which the mind of man could participate, and linked toa higher nonmanifest reality, was henceforth seen as not only incorrect, orheretical, but increasingly as pathological, as, indeed, insane. At best it wasthe product of an ignorant, superstitious sensibility, a debilitating atavismthat should be swiftly eradicated.Three centuries after Petrarch’s mind-shifting ascent of Mount Ventoux, Gebser’sdeficient mode of the mental-rational structure of consciousness was in fullswing. The brief détente between the two sides of our brain that IainMcGilchrist argues took place during the Renaissance was over. After this therewas a decided shift to the virtues of our left cerebral hemisphere: to analysis,measurement, and precision; to parts rather than the whole; to formulae ratherthan mythologies; to explicit facts rather than implicit meanings; to an“either/or” rather than a “both/and”; to clarity, detail, and an increasingdesire to apply the knowledge thereby gained to achieving mastery over the worldrather than participating with it. It was the beginning of the kind of world weknow today, and in the face of it, the esoteric tradition was forced to gounderground."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTESOTERIC UNDERWORLD[../image/153618.jpg]In 1614, the same year that Isaac Casaubon revealed the truth about HermesTrismegistus, a pamphlet appeared in Cassell, Germany, announcing the existenceof a strange secret society. The anonymous authors of this mysterious documentwould not have known about Casaubon’s bombshell. It took some time for thefallout from Casaubon’s revelation to take effect, and many who wereHermetically inclined carried on in spite of it.1[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber439] So the appearance of the Fama Fraternitatis(“The Fame of the Fraternity”), the title of this strange pamphlet, can’t beseen as a response to Casaubon’s erudition. Yet the timing is so apt that one isalmost forced to suspect a connection. My own suspicion is that something likeJung’s synchronicity was involved, in this case on a historical scale.The pamphlet spoke of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, or, as they are alsocalled, the Rosicrucians, and it called on all who read it to join the societyin its work. This was nothing less than a total reconstruction of Europe, acomplete reformation of the science, politics, religion, and social systems ofthe time. The pamphlet was couched in an obscure Hermetic, alchemical, andastrological language, with clear anti-Catholic and anti-Habsburg sentiments—theHabsburgs being the then-reigning royal house of Europe. Two more similardocuments appeared in the following years, and soon practically all of Europewas witness to a “Rosicrucian furore,” with wild speculation about themysterious society dominating the Continent. Yet who or what the Rosicrucianswere remained unknown. Many sought them out, as the pamphlets had advised, butall attempts to make contact failed. Try as they may, no one could find them.The Rosicrucians were so hidden, so secret it seems, that soon they werenicknamed “the Invisibles.” Even René Descartes was piqued by the Rosicrucianmystery and tried to reach them, but to no avail. After a while, the fact thatall attempts to contact the Rosicrucians proved futile turned interest intocontempt and the Rosicrucian furore dwindled into the Rosicrucian hoax. Themysterious society became the butt of jokes and vilification, with accusationsof witchcraft and other evils made against it. Finally the Lutheran pastor andliterary man Johann Valentin Andreae (1586–1654), one of the authors of thesestrange documents, admitted that at least one of them, a weird alchemical textcalled The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz—a kind of surrealist noveldepicting in symbolic form the Great Work of spiritual transformation—was whatAndreae called a ludibrium, which means a “serious joke.” For most, this put anend to the Rosicrucian mystery. It had been, after all, a hoax all the time. Orhad it?If the people caught up in the Rosicrucian furore were unclear exactly what theexcitement was all about, the Rosicrucians themselves, at least according totheir documents, were less confused. The Fama Fraternitatis tells the story ofthe society’s founder, Christian Rosenkreutz, and his search for wisdom in theEast. Like many before him, Christian had journeyed in search of secretknowledge and his initiatory quest has become a kind of archetype for thewestern seeker of wisdom. Whether he ever existed or not is another story. He issupposed to have been born in 1378 and to have died in 1484, which would havemade him 106 at his death. He came from a noble family and, as a child, wasgiven to monks who taught him Latin and Greek. As a young man, Christianaccompanied a monk who wished to visit the Holy Lands. En route the monk died,but Christian carried on. He became ill in the mysterious city of Damcar (mostlikely Damascus) and remained there, where he learned much wisdom from theArabs. He had further travels in Egypt and North Africa, where he perfected hisesoteric knowledge, as well as that of science and mathematics. The sages he metalong the way all seemed to be in accord with each other and were happy to sharewhat they knew, a sign perhaps that what Christian was taught was the priscatheologia. That he learned it in the East may suggest that it had something todo with the mysterious treasure of the Knights Templar.After more travels and learning, Christian returned to Europe wishing to sharehis knowledge, which he hoped could help in a reformation of Christendom. Alas,he met only derision and petty envy. After fruitless attempts to disseminatewhat he had learned, he decided to build a temple to house his knowledge and togather like-minded fellows to whom he could pass it on. Five years later,Christian and his companions set out again to spread the word. Later theyseparated, each going to a different land. Before this, each had taken a vow.They agreed to heal the sick without payment, to wear the dress of the land theyfound themselves in, to meet each year at the temple, the Sancti Spiritus, or“House of the Holy Spirit,” to find someone to take their place when needed, andto keep silent about the brotherhood for one hundred years.Soon after this, Christian died and he and his followers—the originalRosicrucians—slowly passed into myth, but their descendants secretly kept thework of the society going. When the hundred years had passed, it was agreed thatthe society should reveal itself. In 1604, a year marked by heavenly events suchas the discovery of “new stars” (Johannes Kepler sighted a supernova—anexploding star—that year, and it is named after him), which portended greatchanges in the land, Christian’s tomb was rediscovered in a secret room in theSancti Spiritus. His uncorrupted body lay within a seven-sided vault, which waslit by a kind of miniature sun. Geometrical figures decorated the walls andamong other mysterious objects were copies of works by Paracelsus, as well as astrange book containing Christian’s secret knowledge. The members who foundChristian’s tomb took it as sign to reveal themselves to the world and announcethat a great change was on its way and to spread the word among the populace.Hence the mysterious documents eventually turning up in Cassell.What was the “Rosicrucian furore” about and what was the “general reformation”that the members of this mysterious secret society called for? Many have askedthese questions and many have provided answers, some more profitable thanothers. Manly P. Hall’s queries suggest the general tone of inquiry. Were theRosicrucians, Hall asks, “an organization of profound thinkers rebelling againstthe inquisitional religious and philosophical limitations of their time” or justa group of visionaries “united only by the similarity of their viewpoints anddeductions”? Were they a religious or philosophical brotherhood, or were theirdesigns less innocuous? Did they seek “the political control of Europe,” or werethey merely esoteric dilettantes, playing some sort of practical joke?2[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber440] Was it all a silly game enjoyed by a group ofProtestant students, or something much more serious, as Andreae himselfsuggested?3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber441]Questions about who or what the Rosicrucians were remain to this day, which hasnot stopped their name being adopted by more than one occult organizationclaiming them as their ancestors.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber442] Like“gnostic,” “Rosicrucian” has been taken up by many enthusiasts as a catch-allterm indicating a general interest in the occult or the esoteric. For ourpurposes, it has a more specific connotation. In The Rosicrucian Enlightenment,Frances Yates argues persuasively that the Rosicrucian phenomenon was part of anattempt involving Frederick V, the Elector Palatine of the Rhine, to free Europefrom Habsburg and Catholic dominance. In Frederick V, a Protestant, many placedtheir hopes for a Christendom healed of religious strife and open to a moretolerant and pluralistic view. The Rosicrucian manifestoes were, in Yates’sview, designed to promote interest and support in this campaign, and to spellout the vision of a new, progressive Europe. For Yates, they convey “anapocalyptic message of universal reformation leading to a millennium.”5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber443]Such sentiments were not unusual at the time. We’ve seen that Joachim of Fiore’svision of a coming age of the Holy Spirit influenced many dissatisfied with thechurch, and there is reason to believe that the authors of the Rosicruciandocuments were themselves informed with Joachim’s vision.6[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber444] According to Christopher McIntosh, this was atime when “religious and social upheavals had gone hand in hand.” Germanyespecially was a hotbed “of messianic and millennialist ideas.”7[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber445] In this instance, however, the dream of a newEurope sadly did not come true. In 1620, at the Battle of White Mountain nearPrague, Frederick V’s forces were defeated by the armies of Ferdinand II, thenewly crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Ferdinand II was a fanaticallyintolerant Habsburg Catholic and had inherited the throne from Matthias, who hadsucceeded to it himself after the death of his brother, Rudolf II. This was oneof the first battles of the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), which devastated theContinent and left whole regions destroyed. Many believe that if Frederick V hadbeen victorious, the war would have been avoided, and rather than bloodshed andruin, a more progressive Europe may have risen instead.8[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber446]SECRET SOCIETIESThe events leading up to the Battle of White Mountain are detailed and complex,and trace the century-long struggle between Catholics and Protestants followingLuther’s theses turning up at the Wittenberg church. That an esotericbrotherhood professing Hermetic, alchemical, and astrological beliefs should beinvolved in the strife is curious enough, but for our purposes, what is mostinteresting is that after making much hue and cry about the coming millenniumand asking the populace to join in its work, the Brotherhood of the Rosy Crossducked out of view—or, to be precise, wasn’t in it to begin with.Such secrecy may have been prompted by sheer prudence. The Rosicrucianmanifestoes made no bones about their views. In the Confessio Fraternitatis(“The Confession of the Brotherhood”), the second pamphlet to appear, theauthors “do now altogether freely and securely, without hurt, call the Pope ofRome Antichrist,” and Mohammed, too, comes in for a drubbing.9[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber447] Their vision of a mankind free from materialcares and miseries—“hunger, poverty, sickness and age”—would prompt any monarchto fear for his throne.10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber448] Yet such views werenot new, and as we’ve seen, the church had already dealt with several reformistsand revolutionists. Bruno wished to revive the ancient Egyptian pantheon, andthe philosopher Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639) envisioned a church remodeledafter the Hermetic utopian city of Adocentyn, described in the Picatrix, inwhich Ficinian star magic would be the order of the day. Campanella wasimprisoned and tortured for his efforts, although after his release, he didperform some Hermetic therapy with Pope Urban VIII who, like Alexander VI, had ataste for magic.11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber449]The union of politics and the occult these projects embodied suggest that theHermetic utopia envisioned by the Rosicrucians was not new. What was new wasthat the proponents of this dream worked covertly. They were an “occultunderground” and they laid the foundations for what would become a kind ofesoteric counterculture. Whatever the motivation of the individuals behind theRosicrucian phenomenon, that they operated in secret at a time when the Hermeticsciences had lost their respectability is at the very least a remarkablecoincidence. Before this, magicians and seers spoke openly. Plethon, Ficino,Pico, and Bruno addressed the powers that be and compelled them to listen, ifnot always to agree. John Dee, whom Yates sees as a major influence on theRosicrucian phenomenon, engaged in a kind of occult politics that led him to thecourt of Rudolf II. His “mystic imperialism” was sanctioned by Queen ElizabethI, whose astrologer he was, and he even coined the term “the British empire,”much to the queen’s delight. But now such visionaries had to work behind thescenes.There had always been “elite” or “select” spiritual groups in the past. We haveseen some of them with Pythagoras, and other teachers like Ammonius Saccas weresaid to have reserved certain teachings for special students. Even Jesus, itseems, may have had a secret gospel. There has always been a sense that esotericknowledge was strictly for the few. Trithemius, who taught Cornelius Agrippa,counseled that “To the vulgar, speak only of vulgar things, keep for yourfriends every secret of a higher order.”12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber450]Such sentiments seem elitist to us but they make perfect sense and merely stemfrom the recognition that not everyone is interested in esoteric ideas and noteveryone can understand them. But with the “invisible Rosicrucians,” somethingnew seems to have started. In the centuries that followed, the idea that therewere mystic sages and masters in hiding became more and more prevalent. These“secret teachers,” as it were, became a central theme in esoteric lore.Following Hermes Trismegistus’s fall from grace, not only was the knowledge thathe and great sages like him taught “occult,” meaning hidden. Now its teacherswere too.PANSOPHIAThe “universal reformation” envisioned by the Rosicrucians was informed by aschool of thought known as “Pansophy,” which means “all wisdom” or “universalwisdom.” It aimed at a synthesis of Hermetic and occult philosophy, nondogmaticChristianity, and the rising new natural sciences. As with the attempts to wedPlato and Hermes with Christianity, Pansophy wanted to have the best of bothworlds. It was an expression of the same sentiment that lay behind the notion ofthe prisca theologia or philosophia perennis. We can see it as an early attemptto unite the two approaches to knowledge, the epistemic and the gnostic, thatwith the deficient mode of the mental-rational structure—and the rise ofleft-brain dominance—were quickly moving apart. (To coin an ugly word, we cansay that Pansophists sought “epignosis.”) For the Rosicrucians and those whofollowed them, there was no categorical divide or opposition between thesciences of the invisible and the visible worlds. Each complemented the other,and both were needed to have a true, full vision of reality. The same was truein the religious sphere: the dogmatic insistence on the truth of only one beliefled to a narrow and limited view.The proponents of Pansophy, however, had their work cut out for them, for it wasprecisely such narrow, limited views that increasingly dominated both the churchand the nascent science that would soon oppose it. Ferdinand II’s vehementopposition to any compromise with the Protestant upstarts was paralleled byMarin Mersenne’s equally fanatical detestation of everything to do with theHermetic view of the world. Each had their truths secure in hand and would brookno opposition. The idea of the combined pursuit of natural and supernaturalknowledge bringing about a progressive, tolerant, and pluralist new world leftboth cold.Others were more enthusiastic. John Dee was a Pansophist, and combined the studyof mathematics with that of the angels. Another was Rudolf II, during whosereign there was a considerable degree of religious tolerance, patronage ofscience, and the pursuit of occult knowledge, particularly alchemy. AnotherPansophist was the Bohemian philosopher, educator, and scientist John AmosComenius (1592–1670), known today as the “father of modern education.”Comenius is not as well known in the English-speaking world as he should be. Incentral Europe he is a national hero and his birthday is a holiday. A teacher’scollege and an adult education program in Hungary are named after him, andRembrandt painted his portrait. He was asked to be the first president ofHarvard, but declined because he was then leader of the Bohemian Brethren, amystical strain of Protestantism that began with Jan Hus, who was burned at thestake by the Inquisition in 1415. Comenius led the Brethren across a war-tornEurope, and he himself lost his wife, child, and home in the conflict. UNESCOconfers a Comenius medal for outstanding achievements in education.Comenius embodied the utopian, educative strain of the Rosicrucians and hepursued the ideal of knowledge being open and shared by all who desired it, onepursued earlier by Michael Psellus, who offered free university education to anywho wanted it.13 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber451] In many ways we can seeComenius’s efforts as developing a kind of late Renaissance “informationhighway,” a network of philosophers, teachers, and scientists willing to pooltheir insights in the service of the common good. The collapse of theRosicrucian dream with the defeat of Frederick V and the eruption of the ThirtyYears’ War threw Comenius into despair and precipitated a kind of Rosicrucian“diaspora,” with followers of the Brotherhood hounded and forced to go intoexile. This spiritual heartbreak is conveyed in Comenius’s moving work Labyrinthof the World, which depicts a society in which “everything is wrong” and whichmay present the first dystopia in modern literature.14[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber452]In the years following the Rosicrucian phenomenon, one outstanding Pansophistwas the physician, polymath, and Hermeticist Robert Fludd (1574–1637), againstwhom Michel Mersenne seems to have taken particular umbrage, if his diatribesagainst Fludd’s work are anything to go by. Fludd’s vast knowledge and vastambition led to his writing vast works with vast titles. His early defense ofthe now discredited Rosicrucians was called Apologia Compendiaria Fraternitatemde Rosea Cruce suspicionis et infamiae maculis aspersam, veritas quasi Fluctibusalbuens et abstergens (A Compendious Apology for the Fraternity of the RoseCross, pelted with the mire of suspicion and infamy, but now cleansed with theWaters of truth).Within that considerable mouthful Fludd managed to conceal a joke, as fluctibusmeans “flood” or “waters” in Latin; so the filth unwarrantedly cast on theRosicrucians will be cleansed by Fludd himself. This is one of the few lightmoments in Fludd’s work, which in essence aims at proving, at length, that themagic of the Rosicrucians, which he links to the prisca theologia, is both holyand scientific, something Mersenne went to equal lengths to deny. Another vastwork, Utriusque Cosmi Historia—I will not burden the reader with its fulltitle—is a history of the two worlds, the macrocosm and the microcosm. In it,Fludd brought together a wealth of knowledge about medicine, mathematics, music,divination, astrology, “magical memory,” and the rising science of mechanics inan enormous attempt to “encompass the whole of learning” and to “summarize theknowledge of both the universe and man.”15 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber453]Fludd’s Hermetic approach had some hard results. Seeing the heart as the sun andthe blood as the planets—the Copernican view based on the Hermeticvision—Fludd’s accurate recognition of the cardiovascular system anticipated hiscontemporary William Harvey, who is generally credited with discovering it.ALCHEMYA Pansophist who was at the heart of the Rosicrucian ideal was Paracelsus, likeFludd a physician who combined Hermetic science with a close reading of the“book of Nature.” Paracelsus was an alchemist and a healer—he is credited withlaying the groundwork for what we today call “natural” or “alternative” healingas well as modern pharmacology—and some background in alchemy is necessary inorder to understand his importance.We’ve seen that alchemy began in Egypt and that, with the fall of Alexandria, itmade its way to the Arab world. In the twelfth century, Arabic alchemical textsbegan to be translated into Latin, mostly through Spain, where, as we’ve seen,the beginnings of codified Kabbalah began to take root. In 1142, Peter theVenerable, abbot of Cluny, asked Robert of Chester to translate the Koran intoLatin. Chester did, and in 1144, he went on to translate Morienus’s The Book ofthe Composition of Alchemy as well, producing the first work of alchemy toappear in Latin.Alchemy’s entrée into western consciousness was by way of scholars and men oflearning and had little to do with its later clichéd image of boastfulcharlatans engaged in the futile pursuit of turning lead into gold. Chester’stranslations sparked an “Arabic craze,” and a flood of new translationsfollowed, which fueled part of the “twelfth-century Renaissance.” We’ve alreadylooked at Albertus Magnus, who was also known as “Doctor Universalis,” whichsuggests that although he did not use the term, Magnus would not be averse tobeing call a Pansophist. Two who followed Magnus’s example were Roger Bacon (c.1214–c. 1292) and Magnus’s pupil, Thomas Aquinas. Both were practitioners of theHermetic art.Bacon was another polymath and seems to have practiced Pansophy before its time.Like later Hermetic scholars, he was accused of sorcery and he spent some timein prison. After his death, his books were nailed in place and left to rot, soconvinced were his accusers that he had been in league with the devil. LikePetrarch he seems to straddle two ages, that of the medieval and the beginningof modern consciousness. He was accused of wizardry—he was called “DoctorMirabilis” because of his supposed magic powers—but he was also an earlychampion of what became known as the “scientific method.”In Opus Maius (The Greater Work), Bacon developed what he called a “new method”based on “experience” rather than “argument,” which seems a pre-echo ofParacelsus’s later attack on dusty dogmatic thinking as opposed to the immediatestudy of nature. Bacon’s “experience” is seen as a precursor to his namesakeFrancis Bacon’s “experimental method,” and Francis Bacon himself had Rosicrucianleanings, as can be seen in the utopian themes of his Advancement of Learningand New Atlantis, with their call for a “fraternity in learning andillumination.” Yet as Peter Marshall writes in The Philosopher’s Stone: A Questfor the Secrets of Alchemy, Roger Bacon had met Sufis while in Spain and his“experience” may have more to do with “Sufi gnosis, involving divineinspiration,” than with the kind of detached observation we associate withmodern science, a suspicion with which Henry Corbin agrees.16[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber454] Yet Bacon was also often accused of blackmagic. That he was reported to have a “talking head” made of brass, rather likethe animated statutes of the Asclepius, could not have helped his reputation,but then Pope Sylvester II (c. 940–1003), a student of Hermeticism and supporterof all learning, had one as well, so Bacon was in good company.Like the participants in the Renaissance pagan revival, Bacon had a talent forinvention and he had plans and designs for “mechanical marvels” such as a flyingmachine, a submarine, and a kind of early CCTV system involving mirrors.17[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber455] He was introduced to alchemy by his teacher,Robert Grosseteste, who was the chancellor of Oxford and the bishop of Lincoln.Bacon defined alchemy as “the science of a certain Medicine or Elixir” andseparated it into two approaches, what he called “speculative” and “practical”alchemy. Speculative alchemy is concerned with understanding the “generation ofthings from the elements,” and applies a more theoretical approach, whilepractical alchemy confirms alchemical theory and can bring many materialbenefits, especially in medicine. It accomplished this by “speeding up” naturalprocesses and by “making things better or more abundantly by art than they aremade in nature.”18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber456] One practical benefit wasthe ability to prolong life. This was the main concern of Chinese alchemy, andit would gain more importance in western alchemy in later years. Fulcanelli,whom we met in Chapter Five, is said to have discovered this secret and, likeChristian Rosenkreutz, he is believed to have lived an inordinately long life.SUMMA ALCHEMICAThomas Aquinas is most known for his Summa Theologica, the first attempt atsystemizing Christian theology, and which wedded Aristotelian logic to Christianfaith. But he also believed in the alchemical transmutation of metals. One ofthe oddest works of alchemy, the Aurora Consurgens (Rising Dawn) is attributedto him and it has received much attention in Jungian circles. Marie-Louise vonFranz, Jung’s interpreter and an important thinker in her own right, singles itout for special study.19 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber457]Von Franz started with the belief that the attribution to Aquinas must beapocryphal—as with Albertus Magnus, many later alchemical texts were attributedto Aquinas but it is clear they were not from his hand. But this one seemeddifferent. Von Franz learned that shortly before his death, Aquinas underwent astrange experience in which his personality was transformed. While working onhis Summa, he suddenly pushed it away and left it unfinished. When pressed byhis colleagues to continue, Aquinas said he could not and that he now felt thateverything he had written seemed to him only so much worthless straw. For weeksbefore this, Aquinas seemed afflicted with a strange absentmindedness. He seemedto have had a kind of mystical experience while saying mass. At the altar heentered a trance and remained silent and still for some time until someone shookhim and he came to.Similar trance states occurred. A friend took him to visit a cousin who was acountess and with whom Aquinas had spoken openly many times. The friend thoughtthat the countess might be able to communicate with Aquinas to find out what wasafflicting him. But during their visit, Aquinas again sat perfectly still andsilent the entire time. It was after weeks of this that he abandoned working onthe Summa and rejected all of his accomplishments. A similar experience wouldhappen to Swedenborg some centuries later, what the historian of psychologyHenri Ellenberger called a “creative illness,” a sudden psychological crisisprecipitating a complete change of orientation.20[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber458] In Swedenborg’s case, it led to his abandoninghis early scientific work, much as Aquinas abandoned his theology.Aquinas eventually regained a degree of normality and he returned to his churchduties. He was asked to attend a congress in southern France. En route, he hithis head on a tree branch and fell from his donkey. He stayed in a nearbymonastery and his illness returned, with it a conviction that he would soon die.The monks, delighted at having an important guest, implored Aquinas to teachthem something. Gathering his strength, he is said to have begun a seminar onthe Song of Songs (or Song of Solomon). It was while lecturing on this that hecollapsed and died.SOPHIA AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONEVon Franz believed that the Aurora Consurgens is based on notes taken duringAquinas’s fatal seminar. The text seems to recount some sort of “life-shatteringexperience,” which could well have been Aquinas’s “creative illness.”21[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber459] It describes a vision of Sophia, the Wisdom ofGod, the feminine spiritual element, which at that time was making areappearance through the Gothic cathedrals. The philosopher’s stone, the greatgoal of the alchemical quest, is identified with Sophia; and the text, in vonFranz’s interpretation, describes the process through which the author achievesa new psychic alignment, in which ignored elements of the psyche arereintegrated and a new wholeness is achieved.The stages of the alchemical process are understood as the necessarytransformation of the psyche, from the nigredo or darkness of depression,through the purging whiteness of albedo, to the final redness of rubedo, inwhich the male and female principles are joined in the hieros gamos, or “sacredmarriage.” In Aquinas’s case, the idea seems to be that with his intense focuson sharp Aristotelian logic, he had ignored the need for a more intuitiveopenness—had, we could say, overemphasized his left-brain virtues at the expenseof the right—with the result that he experienced what Jung called anenantiodromia, a sudden shift from one point of view or perspective to itsopposite. (That Aquinas knew of the “intuitive grasp” of knowledge as opposed tothe “active search for it” we have seen in William Anderson’s remarks aboutDante’s similar awareness in Chapter Six.) The “sacred marriage” of thesuccessful alchemical work, which brings the opposites together, achieves thisnecessary compensation harmoniously and not through the drastic means of anervous breakdown. Aquinas’s rejection of his theological efforts (hisleft-brain work) is paralleled by other accounts of gnosis, in which the suddenvision is so overwhelming that it leaves the plodding process of deductivereasoning far behind.The kind of spiritualized alchemy found in the Aurora Consurgens was not typicalof the time. And indeed many esotericists have taken argument with what they seeas Jung’s “psychologizing” of alchemy; Schwaller de Lubicz and Julius Evola, forexample, both reject Jung’s approach. Titus Burckhardt, a writer in theTraditionalist school, sums up this response. For Burckhardt, the “secretdepths” of the soul that the alchemist wished to reach should not be confusedwith “the chaos of the so-called collective unconscious,” and the alchemist’s“‘fountain of youth’ in no wise springs from an obscure psychic substratum; itflows from the same source as the spirit.”22 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber460]Jung believed that the alchemists were engaged in what he called “activeimagination,” a way of entering into a dialogue with the unconscious, but thatthey did not know this was what they were doing, and erroneously believed in thereality of physical transmutation.23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber461]Burckhardt rejects the idea that the alchemists pursued their goal “likesleepwalkers [making] passive ‘projections’ of the unconscious contents of theirsouls.”24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber462] But while Burckhardt argues that thealchemists “were never ensnared in any wish-fulfilling dreams of making gold,”others, like Schwaller de Lubicz, argued that an actual transformation of matterdid take place in their work.25 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber463] For better orfor worse, the idea that alchemy is about turning lead into gold—or effectingtransmutations in matter—is one that simply won’t go away.PUFFERS AND MASTERSMore representative of early western alchemy was the work of those known as“puffers,” because of the bellows they used to keep the alchemical furnaceburning. Puffers had no interest in the spiritual side of alchemy and wereintent on making gold, or on convincing others, usually kings, that they could.Some may have genuinely believed in their practice, but others were out-and-outfrauds, keen on receiving ill-gotten gains through pandering to human greed andgullibility. In the Rosicrucian manifestoes, the authors are eager todifferentiate themselves from these charlatans, emphasizing that true alchemy isconcerned with the regeneration of man himself. Yet not all who sought thephilosopher’s stone or universal solvent or the elixir of life were confidencemen, and some accounts suggest that on some occasions at least something morethan greed and gullibility were at work.One of the most fascinating accounts of a genuine alchemical transmutationconcerns the Frenchman Nicolas Flamel. Flamel was a scrivener by trade—that is,a kind of clerk—and he was known for his generosity and good works. He donatedmuch money to charities and churches, far more than a scrivener could afford,and even paid for hospitals to be built. But he was also suspected of being analchemist, and rumor had it that he had actually succeeded in discovering thesecret of the philosopher’s stone. When Flamel died in 1417, his house wasinvaded by a mob seeking to discover his secrets. In 1612, one of his alchemicalworks was published and it revealed how Flamel and his wife, Pernelle, hadcracked the alchemical code. Flamel had a dream in which an angel came to himand showed him a beautiful old book filled with wonderful illustrations. Yearslater, Flamel bought a book and remembered his dream: the book he had bought andthe one the angel had shown him were the same. It was written by an AbrahamEleazar and it described the art of transmuting metals. Flamel told Pernellethat he could understand only a small part of the book, yet he knew it containeda real treasure.For twenty years, Flamel and Pernelle—the archetypal frater mysterium and sorormystica, that is, male and female principles—struggled over the book, but tolittle avail. Eventually, Flamel made the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostelain Spain, hoping to meet someone who could enlighten him. He was in luck.Canches, a Jewish merchant, recognized the book as a work of Kabbalah and heexplained its mysteries to the alchemist. Flamel invited Canches to return toParis with him; he did, but he died along the way.Three years later, at noon on Friday, January 17, 1382, Flamel and Pernellesucceeded in the Great Work: they had made the “red stone” and changed mercuryinto gold. They repeated their success that spring, and from then on, theFlamels’ riches grew, and they generously shared them. One odd part of the storyis that after Flamel’s death, finding nothing in his house, the mob broke intohis and Pernelle’s tombs and found that they were empty. Rumors spread that thealchemical couple had escaped to India; one later report places them at theParis Opera in 1761.Flamel’s story sounds unbelievable, but he did exist, he did practice alchemy,and he did possess great wealth which he shared with needy causes. The Frenchthink so well of him that there is a street in Paris named after him—in theFourth Arrondissement—and in 1900, his house was restored as a nationaltreasure. Others seemed to have replicated Flamel’s success. In 1618, thescientist Jean Baptiste van Helmont (1579–1644), one of the founders ofchemistry (he discovered gases and even coined the name), was given some“transmutation powder” by a stranger. With it, van Helmont was able to transmutefour ounces of mercury into gold. Helvetius—the pseudonym of the Dutch scientistJohann Frederick Schweitzer—left a detailed account of how in January 1667, hechanged half an ounce of lead into gold, using a tiny portion of an unknownsubstance given to him by a strange visitor. When Helvetius complained that suchan amount—about the size of a turnip seed he said—would be insufficient, thestranger took it and broke it in two, telling Helvetius that even this smallcrumb would be enough for the job. It was. Helvetius’s success convinced eventhe philosopher Spinoza, an adherent in his own way of the perennial philosophy.In 1601, the Scotsman Alexander Seton, a contemporary of Helvetius, came to therescue of a Dutch sailor who had shipwrecked off the coast near Edinburgh. Setonlater visited the sailor in Holland and performed a successful transmutation forhim. He then toured Europe, giving more demonstrations before learned doctors,who made detailed accounts. In 1603, the Elector of Saxony, Christian II,imprisoned and tortured Seton, trying to discover his secret. An apprenticealchemist, Michael Sendivogius, helped Seton escape. Seton soon died from hisinjuries, but not before he gave Sendivogius some of his “powder of projection.”Sendivogius became famous as a master alchemist but could not himselfmanufacture the powder.One late and tragic tale of transmutation concerned a young scientist namedJames Price, who in 1782 invited a group of fellow scientists to witness hisdiscovery. Under their watchful eyes, Price succeeded in turning mercury, nitre,and borax first into silver, then into gold, using a white and red powderrespectively. Price’s paper on the experiment drew much attention, but it failedto explain exactly how the transmutation took place. Seton also said that theexperiment took a toll on his health and he feared he could not repeat it. Whenmembers of the Royal Society demanded another demonstration, Price reluctantlyagreed. But when the scientists arrived at his laboratory, Price killed himselfby drinking prussic acid.26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber464] As late as the1890s, the Swedish playwright August Strindberg, a passionate student ofalchemy, believed he had succeeded in extracting gold from iron, an alchemicopus he recounts in his remarkable work, Inferno.That budding chemists were fascinated with alchemy should be no surprise;alchemy is generally seen as a mistaken but helpful precursor to chemistry. Andindeed, the Hermetic Art has been responsible for some important chemicaldiscoveries. We’ve seen that one of the fathers of chemistry, van Helmont, was adevotee. Johann Friedrich Böttger, the German chemist who in 1708 discovered thesecret of making porcelain, was too.27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber465] RobertBoyle, another founder of chemistry, was a practicing alchemist with links tothe Rosicrucians.THE HERMES OF THE NORTHOne of the most important alchemists to make essential contributions to sciencewas the cantankerous “Hermes of the North,” Paracelsus. His real name wasPhilippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, but he thought sohighly of himself that he adopted his new name, which means “higher” or “better”than Celsus, the first-century Roman physician (25 B.C.–50 A.D.), not thesecond-century Platonist who wrote critically of Christianity (see ChapterFour). Paracelsus’s high self-regard is arguably warranted. According to thehistorian of esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Paracelsus is celebratedtoday as “the first modern medical theorist, the founder of iatrochemistry[pharmacology], homeopathy, antisepsis, and modern wound surgery.”28[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber466] We can add to this that he wrote the firsttreatise on an occupational illness—a work on miner’s disease, or silicosis—thathe was the founder of balneology (the study of the medicinal effects of baths),and paved the way for an effective treatment of syphilis. Yet Paracelsus’sself-praise earned him a bad reputation, and for a time it was said that theword “bombast,” meaning highfalutin but insincere rhetoric, originated with him.It doesn’t, but it may as well have.29 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber467] LikeGiordano Bruno, Paracelsus was a brilliant, volatile, and impatient characterwho did not suffer fools gladly and did not hesitate to tell them so. LikeBruno, he made many enemies and, like Bruno, Paracelsus’s life was a long,wearying, and ultimately unsuccessful search for a stable and secure home.Paracelsus was born on December 17 in Einsiedeln, Switzerland; he remains aSwiss national hero, and in Switzerland there is a chain of pharmacies namedafter him, an odd legacy for a secret teacher. In 1943, Joseph Goebbels,Hitler’s spin doctor, applauded G. W. Pabst’s biopic of Paracelsus, in a bid toappropriate the Swiss savant as a Nazi folk hero. What Paracelsus may havethought of this is, of course, unknown. I saw the film ages ago and I rememberit being not bad.Paracelsus’s father, who worked as a doctor, was the illegitimate son of aSwabian nobleman; his mother, who died when Paracelsus was young, was abondswoman of the Benedictine order. Paracelsus was frail and weak as a child,and because of the Swabian wars, Paracelsus and his father soon moved to Villachin Carinthia. Here Paracelsus’s father taught him the basics of medicine.Paracelsus attended monastery schools and also the mining school of the Fuggers,an important banking family. He visited many mines in the area and was laterapprenticed to a mine in the Tyrol. Alchemy held that metals “grew” in theearth, and there is a long German tradition about the secrets and magic ofcaves. Paracelsus’s early exposure to medicine and “earth magic” set thefoundation for the alchemist to come.After studying with Trithemius, who exposed him to Pansophy, Kabbalistic, andalchemical ideas, between 1509 and 1512 Paracelsus worked for his bachelor’sdegree in Vienna. He then went to Ferrara in 1513, and in 1516, received hisdoctorate in medicine. After this, rather than settle into a comfortableuniversity appointment, like Christian Rosenkreutz, Paracelsus took to the highroad in search of knowledge. For seven years he journeyed across Europe,following a dizzying itinerary that had him in Italy, France, Spain (where hestudied Kabbalah), Portugal, England (where he visited tin mines), Germany,Scandinavia, Poland, Russia (where he met shamans), Hungary, Turkey, and Egypt(where he studied alchemy). On much of his journey he worked as an army surgeon.He also fought, and his sword was named “Azoth,” an alchemical term meaning“philosophical mercury,” considered the “first principle of metals.” As hetraveled, he absorbed local traditional knowledge of remedies and cures,learning from anyone he could. This folk knowledge combined with his firsthandwork as a surgeon informed Paracelsus’s revolutionary approach to healing.At the time, surgeons were considered little more than barbers or butchers;aside from a basic instruction in medicine and anatomy, their qualification forthe work was that they possessed the tools of the trade. True doctors werescholars, learned university men well read in Galen—an influential Greekphysician of second-century Rome—and Aristotle, and looked down on the messybusiness of stitching wounds or amputating limbs. Paracelsus was moredown-to-earth and wanted to promote a medicine that would combine empiricalknowledge with practical skill. He thought little of medical men who based theirprestige on books rather than experience. He was also scornful of apothecarieswho made a good living by selling doubtful herbal remedies that dated from theancients; they were more miss than hit, but the prestige of the past ensuredtheir popularity. For a man of the Renaissance, Paracelsus had little love forthe old. His impatience with the medical status quo also informed his social andreligious ideas. He was sympathetic to the Brethren of the Free Spirit and otherforms of grassroots spirituality popular at the time, and in 1525, he wasarrested for supporting a peasant rebellion in Salzburg and just missed beingexecuted.In early 1527, in Strasbourg, Paracelsus fell in with a group of influentialProtestant reformers. He treated one of them successfully, and Wolfgang Capito,his patient’s friend, an acquaintance of Ulrich Zwingli, the Swiss Reformationleader and correspondent of Luther, introduced Paracelsus to the humanistcircles of Basel. In Basel, Paracelsus cured the publisher Johann Froben of aseptic leg and became friends with Erasmus, whom he treated for gout and kidneyproblems. Paracelsus was Catholic, but he was sympathetic to the Reformation,although with typical penetration he called Luther and Pope Clement VII “twowhores debating chastity.” His skill at curing Froben led the Protestanttheologian Johannes Oecolampadius to secure Paracelsus the position of townphysician. This should have been the start of a stable career, but things didnot work out that way.Paracelsus’s position included the right to lecture at the university, and hewas eager to use this to promote his new ideas about medicine. The universityauthorities were not so eager. They had not been consulted about Paracelsus’sappointment and they made their displeasure known. Paracelsus could have quietedthings by submitting to the formal act of reception necessary to an externalgraduate. It would have been a simple show of respect, but Paracelsus’simpatience got the better of him and he refused. He then issued a proclamationin which he insisted that he would lecture daily on his own ideas, not Galen’sor Aristotle’s, and in German, not Latin. This in itself was revolutionary andin line with Luther’s similar treatment of the Bible, which he had recentlytranslated into his mother tongue to make it available to the common folk.To make things even worse, during the student festivities on St. John’s Day(June 24), Paracelsus burned copies of Galen and Avicenna, declaring that theyand other old dogmatists were worth less than the hairs of his beard; evenesotericists, it seems, burn books sometimes. Paracelsus had a talent forinvective and had a way of making a point. Lecturing on the benefits ofputrefaction—“Decay is the midwife of great things,” he once said—he illustratedhis thesis by presenting a group of learned dons with some of his shit.30[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber468] It is no wonder he made few friends and manyenemies. “I am different: let this not upset you,” Paracelsus once said. Sadlyit did.The university faculty responded to Paracelsus’s book burning by disputing hisright to lecture or to sponsor doctoral candidates. Paracelsus protested and thetown council took his side, a rare occasion in his life. At the same time,Paracelsus complained about the apothecaries’ business practices. This only madehim more enemies. The tables turned when Paracelsus’s friend and protectorFroben died. Satirical pamphlets about him appeared calling him “Cacophrastus”(kakos means “bad” in Greek) and singing Galen’s praises. When he complainedagain to the council, they ignored him. Injury was soon added to insult. Awealthy churchman had promised to pay Paracelsus a tidy sum if he cured him.Paracelsus did, but the churchman only gave him a pittance. Paracelsus took hisgrievance to the law, but he was awarded only a modest fee, and his ferociousoutburst at the injustice put him in contempt of court. Fearing arrest, he tookto the road, and remained on it the rest of his short life.The rest of Paracelsus’s story is a tragic tale of a brilliant but explosivepersonality banging his head against several walls, while at the same timeachieving deep insights into the links between man, nature, and the spiritualworlds. Paracelsus wrote many books on medicine, philosophy, theology, andprophecy during his wandering, most of them couched in a difficult prose. As theRosicrucians did, he envisioned great changes ahead and saw signs in the skythat confirmed this. His insights, however, were lost on most who encounteredhim. In 1529, he reached Nuremberg but the local physicians got wind of hiscoming and banded against him. He challenged them to a kind of duel and curednine out of fifteen lepers (how well the locals did is unclear). He developed anew treatment for syphilis—“the French disease”—and argued that the currentcure, based on mercury and American guaiac (pockwood) was ineffective. TheFuggers, who had cornered the lucrative guaiac market, were not pleased withthis and banished him from town; his book about syphilis was banned. InParagranum, which he wrote in Beratzhausen, he argued that medicine must bebuilt on “four pillars”: nature, astrology, alchemy, and virtue. In 1531, hecompleted his Opus Paramirum (Work Beyond Wonders), which contained his theoryof the three substances, sulfur, salt, and mercury, that made substantialchanges to alchemical theory. It also spoke at length of his new chemical-basedmedicine—as opposed to the traditional “four humors” approach—as well as sex,digestion, nutrition, and also “illnesses of the imagination,” a remarkableanticipation of neurosis and psychosomatic disturbances.It would be tedious to recount all of Paracelsus’s travels and travails—theinterested reader is directed to Philip Ball’s excellent biography The Devil’sDoctor. For some time he wandered among Swiss peasants in the Alps, eventuallyreaching Innsbruck dressed in rags. He fought the plague in Sterzing butreceived little thanks. By the late 1530s, some recognition of his work began toappear. In September 1537, in Pressburg, he was feted at a ceremonial dinner inhis honor. His reputation and finances recovered, and in Vienna he was grantedtwo audiences with King Ferdinand. He visited his home town of Villach again,but then began another bout of wandering. His own health was poor, and in late1540, he accepted an invitation to settle again in Salzburg. His years in thewilderness were finally over but luck was not with him. On September 21, 1541,he had a stroke and a few days later he died. He was forty-eight. There is somesuspicion he was poisoned and some legends say he was pushed from a cliff, orfell from it in a drunken stupor. Most likely he was simply worn out by alifetime of struggle.ALCHEMICAL CHANGESParacelsus shared with Ficino, Pico, and the Renaissance magicians the newvision of man sparked by Petrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux, and it is nosurprise he inspired the Rosicrucians. God had given man powers and abilitiesand it was his duty to use them. It was a sin and insult to God if one didn’t.It was not enough to know what the ancients, however worthy, had said. Man mustuse his own senses and intuition to reach the truth. This was not given, onceand for all, in ages past, but must be gained again and again by man through hisown efforts. Paracelsus’s alchemy was based on the idea, voiced by Roger Bacon,that man can improve on nature, can speed up or intensify her processes.We should note that with alchemy, the character of the esoteric quest changes.If in the Platonic and Gnostic traditions the emphasis is on a knowledge, aremembering or awakening (gnosis), that aids the seeker in the return to thesource—the journey through the planets or the ascent of the Chain of Being—inalchemy the emphasis is on transformation.This in itself should alert us to a difference. The Neoplatonic One isunchanging, eternal, and immutable. It is the essence of being. Alchemy is aboutbecoming, about growth, change, development, about something lowly turning intosomething “higher.” (“Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi,” “Our gold is not thevulgar gold,” the alchemist Gerhard Dorn said.) The two are not mutuallyexclusive, and indeed, there are what we can call different “styles” or themesor motifs of esoteric work that overlap and run parallel with each other. Thereis the “quest” motif, as seen in the search for the Holy Grail. In this we“find” something, a hidden magical treasure like the Golden Fleece. There is the“mystic marriage,” the union of yin and yang, male and female, microcosm andmacrocosm, that forms part of alchemy as well as Hermeticism—and is also one ofthe central themes of this book. Here we are “reunited” with a lost or forgottenother half—in our case, our other brain. We can say that alchemy is about“making” something.Paracelsus believed that God created things in what he called their “prime,” nottheir “ultimate” form, a nod, perhaps, to Aristotle’s notion of “entelechy.” Hisvision was of a world in constant transformation, a living, growing, dynamicunity. Alchemy’s focus on transmuting lead into gold, or the ignoble into thenoble, seems to fit in with the evolutionary ideas that would come to dominatethe modern mind. It also seems to depend to a greater degree on man’s ownefforts, which is in line with the alchemical insight that what is really thesubject of transformation is oneself. To that extent, the alchemist was a kindof “self-made man,” a very modern notion indeed. He is not given anything excepthis natural powers and abilities, and it is up to him to make the most of them.It is through his use of these that he can become something more.The Belgian Gerhard Dorn (1530–1584), a follower and translator of Paracelsus,makes this point. He developed the “inner” aspect of Paracelsus’s work and paidless attention to furnaces and alembics, focusing instead on the powers of themind—no mystery then that Jung made much of Dorn’s writings. Dorn is the authorof one of the most oft-quoted alchemical maxims: “Transform yourselves from deadstones into living philosophical stones!” A similar formula of his makes muchthe same point: “Never look outside for what you need, until you have made useof the whole of yourself,” an aphorism that would not be out of place among theGnostic sayings found in Nag Hammadi. “As faith works miracles in man,” Dornsaid, “so this power, the veritas efficaciae [true efficacy], brings them aboutin matter. This truth is the highest power and impregnable fortress wherein thestone of the philosophers lies hid.” As Peter Marshall remarks, for Dorn, thephilosopher’s stone is man, or at least can be discovered within him.31[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber469]IMAGINAL MEDICINEParacelsus says much the same. His medicine is based on themacrocosmic/microcosmic principle, which says that man is a small universe, thatall the powers of the cosmos, both visible and invisible, also reside in him.Paracelsus sought to activate the correspondences that exist between the greaterand lesser cosmoses. Our health depends on these being well aligned. Accordingto Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Paracelsus was the first to systematically applythis Hermetic approach to nature.32 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber470] AsGoodrick-Clarke expresses it, Paracelsus believed that man can have a “directknowledge of Nature on account of a sympathy between the inner representative ofa particular object in his own constitution and its external counterpart.”33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber471] This sympathy between the inner world and theouter—the essence of the macro/microcosmic polarity—is our primary means of“acquiring intimate and total knowledge.”34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber472]Paracelsus’s task as a physician was to grasp the correspondence between man’sinner world and that of nature, an idea we have come across in Owen Barfield. Itwas through this knowledge and way of knowing that Paracelsus effected his curesand laid the groundwork for much of both modern mainstream and alternativemedicine.Paracelsus’s “direct knowledge” sounds very much like the kind of “directperceiving” Stan Gooch suggests our Neanderthal ancestors enjoyed and whichallowed them “a real knowledge of aspects of human life and human biology, ofsome of the functions of the planet’s geology and perhaps some knowledge even ofatomic and molecular structure.” It is also reminiscent of Schwaller de Lubicz’s“intelligence of the heart,” Bergson’s “intuition,” and the other variants ofthese we have come across in this book. This way of knowing involves somethingmore than the brain, or at least something more than only one half of it. Thewhole person must be involved.Something similar seems to have been at work in an account of the effects of thepowerful psychoactive drug ayahuasca, reported by the anthropologist JeremyNarby in his book The Cosmic Serpent. Narby wanted to know how the indigenousAmazonian people who use ayahuasca in their religious ceremonies learned of itsproperties, and also those of the thousands of other plants they used. Suchknowledge, Narby thought, could not have come through trial and error. Thenatives told Narby that they learned all of this from the plants themselves:they told them all about it, while they were under the influence of the drug.Narby tried ayahuasca himself and had a remarkable experience in which two giantboa constrictors spoke to him and passed on ancient wisdom.35[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber473] His experience led Narby to research snakesymbolism in world culture, and he was surprised to discover how often thecombination of snakes and secret knowledge turned up, something Leonard Shlainalso remarked upon in The Alphabet Versus the Goddess.36[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber474] We have seen that psychedelic and othermind-altering drugs, like ayahuasca, work by inhibiting the brain’s—possibly theleft hemisphere’s—“filtering mechanism,” allowing more of “reality” than weusually perceive to enter consciousness. This “more” entails the “network ofconnections linking everything to everything else,” and which would include, oneassumes, the correspondences between our inner world and nature’s. We shouldalso note that we have seen that this more “open” consciousness is older thanour own, and that the wisdom Narby’s boa constrictors imparted was ancient. WhatNarby’s natives learned in the ayahuasca trance, Paracelsus seems to haveperceived naturally—although the fact that Paracelsus regularly prescribed opiumand used it liberally himself may suggest that he too relied on some help.37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber475]THE INNER FIRMAMENTCentral to Paracelsus’s ideas was the imagination. He called it the “innerfirmament,” the microcosmic parallel to the starry sky above. As Petrarch knewwhen gazing from the summit of Mount Ventoux, vast distances stretch within usas well as without us. It is through understanding and grasping these that mancan align his own being with that of the cosmos.“The first step in the operation of these sciences,” Paracelsus said, “is this:to beget the spirit from the inner firmament by means of the imagination.”38[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber476] As were Giordano Bruno and Suhrawardi,Paracelsus was acutely aware of the power of the imagination. We have seen thatwith his ideas about the “illnesses of the imagination,” Paracelsus knew thatthe mind has a direct influence on the body, something Cornelius Agrippaunderstood as well. Agrippa had written that “imagination does, of its ownaccord . . . change the physical body with a sensible transmutation, by changingthe accidents in the body, and by moving the spirit upward or downward, inwardor outward.”39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber477] Agrippa is saying that ourmoods have a direct impact on our physical health, something modern medicinerecognizes as well.40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber478]Paracelsus concurs and goes even further. “Resolute imagination is the beginningof all magical operations,” he says. “It is possible that my spirit . . .through an ardent will alone, and without a sword, can stab and wound others.”41[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber479] Such power, it would seem, would be behind theotherwise unaccountable efficacy of “black magic” and the “evil eye,” convincingaccounts of which crowd dozens of books about the paranormal and the history ofmagic. The novelist John Cowper Powys, whose A Glastonbury Romance is one of thegreat mystical novels of all time, was so disturbed by his own ability to“exercise some kind of ‘evil eye’ on people” that he developed a kind ofneurosis about it and engaged in obsessive rituals in order to protect thosearound him. “The feeling that comes over me at such times,” Powys wrote, “is oneof most formidable power.” As his readers know, Powys had a gargantuanimagination and it is not surprising that he felt at times that he “really wasendowed with some sort of supernatural power.”42[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber480]As became clear in the Renaissance, the artist and the magician are very closecousins, and the tie linking them is the imagination. “Thoughts are things,”Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater said in their classic Theosophical workThought Forms; and according to Agrippa, Powys, and Paracelsus, they can be verypowerful things indeed. It was with this in mind that Owen Barfield gave awarning in Saving the Appearances about what he called the responsibility of theimagination. “Imagination is not,” Barfield wrote, “simply synonymous with good.It may be either good or evil.”43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber481] As with manythings, it depends on the use to which it is put. As the poet and magician W. B.Yeats warned the members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, “whatever webuild in the imagination will accomplish itself in the circumstances of ourlives.”44 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber482]As we saw in Chapter Five, imagination is not the same thing as fantasy. That,for Paracelsus, was the “madman’s cornerstone,” an “exercise of thought withoutfoundation in nature.”45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber483] We know whatParacelsus means. Obsessive thoughts, ruminating over some mistake, pointlessbrooding over ills and problems can lead to serious mental disturbances. Buteven less excessive states like daydreaming can be wasteful. We can think offantasy as the mind idling; the engine is running, but the car isn’t goinganywhere. Insights can come to us in this state, but in order to grasp theirsignificance, we have to put the motor in gear, as it were, and drive—that is,focus our mind on them.This is imagination: the directed focus of the mind, throwing a spotlight onreality. As mentioned earlier, this has a distinct noetic character; it showsthe imagination as an “organ of knowledge.”46 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber484]It is through this that we can “surpass given reality” and “surmount thesolitude of the self,” which, as Paracelsus, Swedenborg, and other innervoyagers knew, “can become an obsession bordering on madness.”47[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber485] Imagination takes us out of ourselves bytaking us into ourselves, into that greater self that Paracelsus and our othersecret teachers had knowledge of and wanted to share. Paracelsus’s “trueimagination” is not an escape from reality but a means of grasping more of it.As Colin Wilson writes, “Imagination is the explosive flare that lights up innerspaces, revealing meaning.”48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber486] Paracelsus knewthis, but like Christian Rosenkreutz, those he tried to teach this to—most ofthem at least—lacked the imagination to grasp it. But then, Paracelsus’s ownpedagogic methods were not always inviting.IMAGINATION AND THE PHILOSOPHER’S STONEOne alchemist who seems to have picked up the Paracelsian torch is Mary AnneSouth (1817–1910). Her story takes place in the mid-nineteenth century, but ifthe reader does not mind the anachronism, this seems the place to tell it. Herwork, as obscure as it is—in typical alchemical style, much of it is willfullybaffling—seems to be saying that the secret ingredient in the alchemical opus isthe mind itself.Mary’s father, Thomas South, with whom she lived in Hampshire, England, had adeep interest in mesmerism and hypnosis, both of which derived from the work ofthe Bavarian physician Franz Anton Mesmer. Mesmer believed that the universe waspermeated by currents of vital energy, which he called “animal magnetism.” For atime in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Mesmer’s ideas were immenselypopular although, as in the case of Paracelsus, the medical establishment wasdead against them. It was only by accident that a student of Mesmer’s discoveredhypnosis. Making “magnetic passes” over a patient—in order to get his “animalmagnetism” flowing—it was found that he had entered a trance. Thomas South wasalso profoundly interested in spiritualism, the belief that the living couldmake contact with the dead through people called “mediums,” who entered a trancein order to speak with them. Thomas belonged to a circle who studied such thingsand who performed séances. Mary shared his interest, as well as Thomas’s love ofthe ancient world. He taught her ancient Greek and Latin, and from being hispupil she became his secretary and then colleague. Lyndsay Clarke based hisnovel The Chymical Wedding on the sometimes strange relationship between Maryand her father.Thomas attached great importance to the ancient Greek Mysteries. He rejected theidea accepted by most nineteenth-century classicists—and made widely popularsome years later by Sir James George Frazer in The Golden Bough (1890)—that theEleusinian Mysteries were merely a way in which people ignorant of science could“explain” the seasons, why, that is, leaves fall in autumn and flowers bloom inthe spring. (We remember this is because Persephone is allowed to leave Hadesonce a year but must return.) Thomas believed something more profound was atwork and Mary agreed. They believed that the ancient sages of Egypt, Greece, andRome knew something that modern science had forgotten but which was justbeginning to be rediscovered by the mesmerists, spiritualists, and other“psychic researchers”—although the name was not yet coined—of their time. Bothbelieved, much as Porphyry did in the third century, that the Mysteries andmyths of the ancients spoke symbolically and that if one could crack their code,the ancient wisdom could be revived.Among the ancient works that Mary and her father studied was the Hermetica, andthey paid special attention to the fabled Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus.Mary decided to translate the Emerald Tablet, and it was while doing so that sheand her father felt they discovered something profound. Alchemy was seen then—asit is for the most part today—as a precursor of chemistry. But the more theylooked into Hermes’ wisdom, the less this seemed to make sense. They came to theconclusion that what alchemy was about had more to do with the ancient Mysteriesthan with chemicals and their combinations. The Hermetic Art, they realized, wasa code for the Mysteries of the ancients. And what the Mysteries taught had todo with what the mesmerists and spiritualists of their time were rediscovering:the mysteries of the mind itself.In 1846, Mary published a short book, Early Magnetism, which related the work ofMesmer and the hypnotists to the ancient Mysteries, as well as to mysticism andspiritual revelations, and Mary herself seems to have experienced some sort ofmystical experience around this time. Her father thought the book came close toexpressing the insights they had uncovered between the ancient Mysteries andmesmerism. But it seems he felt that they deserved a more substantial effort. Hedecided to provide this in an epic philosophical poem, not surprising for astudent of the ancient Greek philosophers. Mary took a different route andproduced a very strange and unwieldy work entitled A Suggestive Inquiry into theHermetic Mystery with a Dissertation on the More Celebrated of the AlchemicalPhilosophers, published in 1850 at the Souths’ own expense.Thomas was intent on his poem and gave little attention to Mary’s book. But whenhe finally read it, he was shocked—panic-struck would not be an exaggeration.Something in the book so disturbed Thomas that he recalled all the copies thathad been sent out to libraries or for review. He also gathered any copies theyhad left, and on the lawn of their home in Hampshire he burned them. Only a fewcopies survived and the book wasn’t reprinted until 1918, some years after Maryhad died at the age of ninety-two. Thomas seems to have destroyed his poem aswell.49 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber487] Mary was devastated, but she seems tohave agreed with the destruction of her work, although it did end her literaryambitions. Years later she gave one of the few surviving copies to AnnaKingsford, a leading English Theosophist, and the book had a kind of “cult” lifein theosophical circles.Why did Thomas South burn his daughter’s book? Some have suggested sheerjealousy motivated him: Mary had done a better job of communicating theirinsights than he had and he couldn’t accept this. While there may be some truthin this—Thomas South’s poem was, at best, inspired doggerel—the fact that Maryseems to have agreed with her father’s extreme act, and that he also seems tohave destroyed his own work, suggests that something else may also have beeninvolved. Her father died shortly after destroying the book, but Mary made noeffort to republish it nor to write another. In 1859, she married a clergymannamed Atwood with whom she spent the rest of her life (she is often listed asMary Atwood in histories of alchemy) and no further revelations came from her.The Mason W. L. Wilmhurst, who wrote about the Souths, suggests that the“responsibility of publicly displaying a subject of extraordinary and sacredmoment” proved too much for them; he also suggests that Thomas had somehow “gotreligion” and wanted to recant his pagan beliefs.50[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber488] As Colin Wilson argues, neither of thesereasons seems adequate. The occultist A. E. Waite, writing on alchemy, gave Maryshort shrift and argued that her basic idea was that alchemy was a spiritualdiscipline, having nothing to do with transmuting matter. This, however, was notnews, and a sort of Christian spiritual alchemy, which saw Christ as thephilosopher’s stone, had been around for some time. It was certainly notsomething that warranted burning her book. But a look at A Suggestive Inquiry infact confirms the opposite of Waite’s suggestion.51[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber489] Mary does believe that an actual transmutationdoes take place, and the first part of her book offers evidence forthis—although given that she is at pains to conceal as much as she reveals, herwriting requires some unraveling. The examples of transmutation that she offersare much like those I mentioned earlier: Flamel, Helvetius, van Helmont, and soon. Yet in the second part of the book, “On the True Subject of the Hermetic Artand Its Concealed Root,” she tells us that “No modern art or chemistry . . . hasanything in common with Alchemy.”52 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber490] So whileshe seems to be saying that an actual transmutation does take place, it is notbrought about by chemical means.The essential ingredient, she tells us, is what the alchemists called the primamateria, the “first matter” or the Universal Matter, the fundamental stuff outof which everything is made, something like the arche sought by Thales andAnaximander during the axial age. Those she calls “pseudo-Alchemists” believedthat transmutation could take place from one metal to another as they were, intheir present form. Her remarks about these “puffers” can easily be read to meanthat she rejected transmutation per se. “Since species are indestructible,” shewrites, “therefore, the transmutation of metals has been regarded as asophistical proposition and not a true art.” Yet, she continues, “it is notspecies that they [the true alchemists] profess to transmute; nor do they everteach in theory that lead as lead or mercury as mercury . . . can be changedinto gold, any more than a dog into a horse or a tulip into a daisy . . . but itis the subject matter, the radical moisture of which they are uniformly composedthat . . . may be withdrawn by art and transported from inferior forms, beingset free by the force of a superior ferment or attraction.”53[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber491] This “subject matter” and “radical moisture”is the prima materia. The alchemist must first arrive at this, and then thetransmutation can be achieved.What is this prima materia? Mary knows, but she does not want to let the cat outof the bag too easily. She speaks not so much in a “green language” but in avery convoluted one, which leads the reader to suspect she is writinggobbledygook. But this is part of alchemical and esoteric practice. What she hasto say is important and she does not want it to fall into unworthy hands. Herbook was the first overall survey of alchemy, an attempt to convey its essenceto an interested reader. It would be read not only by alchemists but also by thesimply curious. Gurdjieff’s jaw-breaking masterpiece, Beelzebub’s Tales to HisGrandson, is replete with esoteric insights and knowledge, but it is written inso rebarbative a style that only the most dedicated reader gets to these. Manyare put off, and this was Gurdjieff’s intention; he did not want casual readersbut true seekers. A Suggestive Inquiry is similarly dense and circuitous, but adetermined reader can find clues to Mary’s meaning.She speaks of “concentrating the vitality” and a “concentrative energy.”54[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber492] She quotes Plotinus’s account of his mysticalexperience in Thomas Taylor’s translation—the Souths were members of a secretsociety founded by Taylor: “Often when by an intellectual energy I am rousedfrom body and converted to myself . . . and become the same with a nature trulydivine . . . I arrive at that energy by which I am elevated beyond every otherintelligible” (italics in the original).55 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber493] Shealso makes liberal reference to the theurgic powers of the Neoplatonists, which,we remember, could bring life to inanimate objects. “Nothing vitally alterativeis achieved,” she tells us, “unless the vital force be present and in action.”56[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber494] One comes away from these and similar remarksfeeling that she is talking about the mind, consciousness, and the imagination.Her ideas about the philosopher’s stone and prima materia seem to echo GerhardDorn’s counsel that the alchemist should “Never look outside for what you need,until you have made use of the whole of yourself.” What the alchemist needs toperform the transmutation is within himself, and it is his mind. Somehow, bysome act of concentration brought about through the mesmeric trance, the mind,the imagination itself reaches into matter and changes it. This was the GreatArcanum and it was this that Thomas and Mary South agreed should not berevealed. As was Owen Barfield, they were aware of the responsibility of theimagination.This idea should not trouble those who take a more Jungian view of alchemy, northose who reject Jung and believe some real transmutation, and not only apsychological realignment, takes place. Jung himself, with his ideas aboutsynchronicity, suggests that in some strange way the mind, or at least itsunconscious part, can “arrange” reality and produce those strange experiences of“meaningful coincidence,” when a correspondence between what is happening in mymind and what is happening in the world takes place. And while Mary Anne South’stheory of transmutation does involve an “inner alchemy,” it does result in areal “outer” transformation. But then, such “participation” between inner andouter is a central theme of this book, and it is something that we have reasonto believe the ancients that Mary and her father studied knew more about than wedo.THE MYSTIC COBBLERMary Anne South did not have a monopoly on writing difficult books. Anothermaster of inner alchemy whose prose provides its own peculiar challenges is the“Teutonic philosopher” Jacob Boehme. Unlike Mary, Boehme was not a student ofthe ancient mysteries but an untutored, pious Bohemia shoemaker. But perhapsBoehme did not need to study. In 1600, he had a mystical experience in which he“saw and knew more in one quarter of an hour than if I had spent many years at auniversity.”57 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber495] Boehme seems to have had anexperience of the kind of “knowing” we looked at in Chapter One. The result ofBoehme’s vision was a geyser of alchemical, gnostic, and mystical insight,expressed in a style that is at once exasperatingly vague and strikingly vivid.Yet Boehme’s often incomprehensible writings were enormously influential,informing the work of William Blake, Jung, Martin Buber, Coleridge, Novalis, andthe philosophers Hegel, Schelling, and Heidegger, among others. The Romanianphysicist Basarab Nicolescu has even argued for strong parallels betweenBoehme’s mystical vision and the findings of postquantum physics.58[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber496] Other of Boehme’s readers included, notsurprisingly, Mary Anne South and her father, and Frances Yates has pointed outthe similarities between Boehme’s ideas and those of his contemporaries, theRosicrucians.59 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber497] While Yates recognizes thereis no direct historical connection between them, the “ahistorical continuity” wehave mentioned seems to have been at work here.Jacob Boehme was born in 1575 in Alt-Seidenberg, near the town of Görlitz inSilesia (modern-day Poland). He was the fourth of five children to be born tohis parents, Jacob and Ursula. Jacob’s father was a well-off Lutheran peasant,and after it appeared that his son was too poorly to herd cattle—and that heoften went off on his own, forgetting about them—he apprenticed him at the ageof fourteen to a shoemaker. Jacob was a dreamy child, with a slight build andself-effacing character. His early biographer and disciple, Abraham vonFranckenberg, relates that at some point in his youth, Boehme met a stranger whoforetold that he had important work to do and that he was destined forgreatness. Most modern researchers consider this story apocryphal and indeedthere are several legends about the young Jacob that need to be taken with somesalt.Boehme had only an elementary education, although he read the Bible and waslater fond of Paracelsus and other mystical writers. His apprenticeship lastedthree years, after which he traveled, exactly where is unclear. One story isthat he was forced to leave the apprenticeship because his workmates and masterdidn’t care to have a prophet in the house; Boehme himself, with his taste forreading, most likely found them coarse and vulgar.60[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber498] He returned to Görlitz in 1600, set himself upas a shoemaker, and married Katherine Kuntzschmann, who bore him four children.Not long after this, the destiny foretold by the mysterious stranger began tounfold.One day Boehme found himself staring at a burnished pewter dish. The sun’sreflection on it seems to have sent him into a mystical trance. As Franckenbergtells it, it was as if he suddenly saw into the heart of nature and couldunderstand the world and everything in it. He was “introduced into the innermostground or center of the recondite or hidden nature,” and saw what he latercalled “the signature of things.”61 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber499] Theexperience unsettled Boehme and he walked out into some nearby fields to clearhis head. But the feeling of actually seeing into the trees, leaves, and grassaround him remained. Paracelsus had said that it was possible to see into theessence of things: “we may look into Nature in the same way that the sun shinesthrough a glass.”62 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber500] Boehme seems to haveexperienced this. He seems to have had a profound experience of Bergson’s“intuition” and Stan Gooch’s “direct perceiving,” and it remained with him therest of his life. R. M. Bucke includes him with those in whom the “cosmic sense”has appeared, but admitted that his writings were “well-nigh unintelligible tothe merely self-conscious mind.”63 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber501]Boehme kept his vision to himself. It was not until another similar experiencehappened that he decided he must write it down. He spoke of his initialvision—not mentioning the pewter dish—and it was here that he spoke of “learningmore in one quarter of an hour” than if he had been for years at university. Hesaw and recognized, he said, “the Being of All Beings, the foundation and thatwhich is beyond foundation and is fathomless.” He saw “the birth of the HolyThreeness of God, the origin and primordial condition of this world and allcreatures through divine wisdom.”64 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber502] Therewere, Boehme saw, three worlds. Two of these, the divine world, which is“angelic and paradisiacal,” and a dark world of fire and “wrath,” are beyond thesenses. The third world, our own, Boehme says, is the product of an everlastingstruggle between these two invisible worlds.Boehme came to write down his vision only after a period of intense depressionand resistance. But after a number of “violent storms,” his spirit broke throughand he experienced the Godhead “as a bridegroom embraces his beloved bride.” Theresult was his first book, Aurora, also known as Morgenröte (Morning Redness inthe Rising Sun). It soon gathered a small group of readers; one of these, thenobleman Karl von Endern, made several copies and distributed them. One fellinto the hands of Gregorius Richter, the pastor of Görlitz, who was not pleasedwith what he read. He fumed that a humble, uneducated cobbler like Boehme shouldhave the temerity to write of such things. Aside from this, it smacked ofheresy.It’s doubtful Richter grasped much of Boehme’s vision, but he no doubt noted theseveral sharp criticisms of the deadness that the Lutheran church had falleninto that Boehme had included. Richter decided to teach this uppity shoemaker alesson, and one Sunday in church Boehme was astonished to find himself underattack. In a sermon on false prophets, Richter singled Boehme out and loudlycriticized his work. Boehme had none of Paracelsus’s aggressiveness, and afterthe service he approached Richter apologetically to ask what he had done wrong.Richter shouted, “Get thee behind me, Satan!” and told him to leave town. Heremained Boehme’s enemy for the rest of his life. The next day Richter convincedthe town council to banish Boehme. The dismayed prophet spent an uncomfortableevening outside the town gates. The council saw better the day after and allowedBoehme to return on the condition that he wrote no more.Boehme was an obedient sort and he agreed. For several years he didn’t write aword. But word of Aurora had spread and Boehme found that he had a following.Alchemists, doctors, philosophers, even clergymen visited theshoemaker—eventually he went into the linen trade—and spoke with him about hisvision and pressed him to break his oath and write again. Boehme impressed themby being able to tell a plant’s properties simply by looking at it; he was alsoable to understand the meaning of a foreign word simply by its sound. Languageand words were important to Boehme, and he sought to understand the original,Adamic language of Eden. “There was,” George Steiner wrote, “no deeper dreameron language, no sensibility more haunted by the alchemy of speech, than JacobBoehme.”65 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber503]It was the prompting of his friends and followers, and his belief that what hehad experienced was God’s will—“When the sun goes up in my spirit, then I amcertain”—that, in 1618, led him to return to writing. In the last years of hislife—he died in 1624—Boehme produced a torrent of words, not all of themunderstandable, doing his best to convey to his readers what he meant by “thesignature of things.” Yet once again, his nemesis Richter made things difficultfor him. A friend gathered some of Boehme’s writings and had them printed underthe title The Way to Christ. Unfortunately, a copy again reached Richter and hereacted explosively. He attacked Boehme again from the pulpit and published ahysterical polemic against him, saying his work stank of shoe polish and thedevil, incensed that this ignorant upstart should claim to understand God.Boehme was again told to leave town, but by this time he had made manyinfluential friends, and through one of them, he was invited to the PrinceElector’s court in Dresden. Here he spoke with many Lutheran theologians; theyagreed that much of what he said escaped them but that there was nothingheretical in it. Boehme had found a new home and he moved his family there.Sadly, he died of gastric fever shortly after. The story is that at the momentof his death he said, “And now I go to Paradise.” His archenemy Richter hadpreceded him but the pastor who took his place refused to preach a funeralsermon for him, and the one who finally did admitted to being bullied into it.THE SIGNATURE OF THINGSAfter his death, Boehme’s fame spread over Europe, and in Görlitz today there isa statue to him. He is considered the founder of modern Christian theosophy,which is not the same as Madame Blavatsky’s brand. The Christian mystic seeksunion with God. The theosopher seeks this as well, but he also wants theknowledge and understanding of him. According to the Christian existentialistphilosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, Boehme is “the greatest of Christian gnostics,”and Berdyaev’s own profound philosophy draws much from Boehme’s notion of theUngrund, “the groundless,” the fundamental absolute “nothingness” at the sourceof reality, what Berdyaev called “meontic freedom.”66[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber504] Like Meister Eckhart, Christian theosophydraws much from the via negativa. “If you can swing yourself up for a momentinto that in which no creature dwells, then you will hear what God speaks,”Boehme tells us.67 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber505] In England, Boehme’stheosophy was carried on by John Pordage and Jane Leade, who started thePhiladelphian Society in 1670, a pious organization dedicated to Boehme’s work.Boehme’s wilder flights of insight were the inspiration for the Dutch ChristianKabbalist Johann Gichtel, “the hermit of Amsterdam,” who edited the first majorcollection of Boehme’s writings. Like Boehme, Gichtel was hounded by churchauthorities and was saved from suicide by a mystical vision.68[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber506] Later Christian theosophists inspired byBoehme include the Kabbalist Friedrich Oetinger; “the unknown philosopher” LouisClaude de Saint-Martin; and Karl von Eckartshausen, whose mystical work TheCloud Upon the Sanctuary sent Aleister Crowley on his dubious road toillumination.69 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber507]Boehme’s vision is fundamentally Christian but he expresses it in a difficultalchemical language, much of which he borrowed from Paracelsus. What sets himapart from other Christian mystics is the sense of a titanic struggle going onat the heart of reality, the tension between what Boehme called Love and Wrath.Wrath is a force of “dryness, harshness, and contraction,” much like the“granulation” that Schwaller de Lubicz says is a result of “cerebralconsciousness.” Love unifies. This antagonism is not rooted in Lucifer’s mutiny,as in the standard Christian account of the origin of evil. For Boehme itemerges from God’s own nature. God himself is self-divided. Boehme sees God as adynamic process of self-creation, rather than an eternal order and hierarchy:“Nowhere in nature is there calmness, eternal order—everywhere there is theconflict of opposing principles.”70 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber508] Theopposing principles are Being and Nothingness. In one sense we can say God isfighting for his life.A great spiritual Yes and No are at odds with each other and the result is theuniverse. This battle goes on in ourselves, and Boehme uses the alchemicalsymbols of the seven planets and metals and Paracelsus’s three forces (sulfur,salt, mercury) to try to convey his vision of what is happening in our innerworld. We spend most of our time enveloped in Wrath, in the pursuit of our ownaims and desires. It is by letting go of these—Boehme, like Meister Eckhart,speaks of Gelassenheit—that we can feel God within us and take part consciouslyin his struggle. Adam fell victim to his own will and rejected Sophia, who wassupposed to be his consort. By doing this, he lost his original wholeness, buthe—and we—can regain this through a process of spiritual regeneration, in whichwe fuse together the disparate parts of our being into a new, higher unity.Without putting too fine a point on it, I think we can see Boehme’s strugglebetween self-will and Gelassenheit in terms of the tension between the two sidesof our brain.This fusion takes place through understanding what Boehme calls the “sevencharacteristics,” which for him serve the same purpose that the seven planetsdid for the Hermetists. They mediate between the original unity and the multipleworlds we inhabit. They exist here in a confused mixture, but by meditating onthem we can understand their essence and, as we can with the two opposingforces, bring them into unity.No doubt this highly selective account of Boehme’s difficult philosophy doeslittle justice to the depth and intensity of his work. What strikes me mostabout Boehme is that, as with the alchemy in which his ideas are rooted, hepresents a much more modern view of existence than what went before. We nolonger think of an eternal order in the universe, but of Big Bangs, explodingstars, and colliding galaxies. God did not make us as final, fixed creatures; wehave evolved to who we are through a long and strenuous struggle. We live, in J.G. Bennett’s phrase, in a much more “dramatic universe” than the ancients did,and Boehme’s vision seems in line with this.71 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber509]He died just as Marin Mersenne’s attack on the Hermetic world was gaining steam.The world that came after this was something different."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETHIS IS THE MODERN WORLD[../image/153618.jpg]As the seventeenth century progressed, the Hermetic, Pansophic vision lostground. Yet this was also a time when works on alchemy flourished. Manyillustrated alchemical texts were printed in this period, and much of what ispopularly known about alchemy comes from them. Texts like the De LapidePhilosophico and the Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, as well as earlier ones fromthe late sixteenth century, like the Splendor Solis and the RosariumPhilosophorum, were much sought after and today provide modern readers with thefamiliar but still unsettling imagery we associated with alchemy.Red dragons, green lions, hermaphrodites, kings and queens lying naked in abath, smiling suns and moons, the homunculi or “little man,” the alchemical egg,an old king being executed, the ouroboros (a snake eating its own tail), andother images equally strange and evocative inhabit the alchemical landscape.Like the “green language,” these images were meant to reveal secret knowledge tothose who could grasp it, and conceal it from those who could not. A lateroffspring of “alchemical art” are the works of “hyperphysical cartography” thatappeared throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, examples of whichare the Rosicrucian enthusiast John Heydon’s The Wise Man’s Crown (1655) and theanonymous Secret Figures of the Rosicrucians (1785–1788).1[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber510]These were complex and sophisticated attempts to “map” universal knowledge, toillustrate the varied correspondences between the macrocosm and the microcosm.At a time when much of the physical globe was being mapped, such “metaphysicalmaps” brought together alchemical, Kabbalistic, Hermetic, and scientificknowledge to form complex diagrams made of concentric circles, triangles, text,and illustrations in order to create a representation of the “unseen.” Editionsof Jacob Boehme’s writing, like Theosophische Werke, published in Amsterdam in1682, are full of haunting illustrations that often offered more ready access toBoehme’s profound ideas than the difficult terrain of his prose.2[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber511]The alchemical side of the Rosicrucian experiment was carried on by people likethe German Michael Maier, who for a time was the personal physician of RudolfII, the alchemical Holy Roman Emperor. Like Paracelsus, Maier combined alchemywith medicine, and following the great Swiss savant, he was the most important“alternative health” figure of the time.Like Robert Fludd, whom he very likely met during his years in England, Maierdefended the Rosicrucians when they came under attack. He is even thought tohave tried to drum up support for Frederick V with King James I of England,father of Elizabeth, Frederick’s bride. A Christmas greeting Maier sent the kingcontained an illustration of a rose with eight petals, in the center of whichMaier had written in Latin: “Greetings to James, for a long time King of GreatBritain. By your true protection may the rose be joyful.” It was in fact JamesI’s decision not to help Frederick V in his battle against Ferdinand II thatmany believe turned the tide against the Rosicrucian dream and led to FrederickV’s defeat.James I, however, was not the best king to ask to support an esotericenterprise. He had a hysterical fear of magic and witchcraft and wrote a book,Demonologie, condemning it. This is not surprising; in 1590, a coven of witcheshad apparently confessed to trying to drown James I and his queen, Anne ofDenmark, as they returned to England after their wedding. James I—who was JamesVI of Scotland at the time—then began a pogrom on witches. Later he refused anaudience with John Dee when Queen Elizabeth’s astrologer badly needed support.In effect this condemned Dee to the poverty and neglect of his final years.Maier is responsible for some of the most remarkable works of alchemical art,most representative of which is his Atalanta Fugiens (Atalanta Fleeing), whichappeared in 1618, a kind of seventeenth-century example of multimedia. Throughpoetry, images, and music, Maier uses the myth of Atalanta’s ravishment byHippomenes, as told by Ovid, to illustrate the coniunctio oppositorum, or unionof the opposites at the heart of alchemy. Maier was not the first to linkalchemy and music. Indeed, some of the earliest operas dealt with similarthemes, such as Jacapo Peri’s Euridice, which dates from 1600. ClaudioMonteverdi, opera’s first “star,” was a practicing alchemist.Like the late Neoplatonists, Maier believed that ancient myths needed to beinterpreted symbolically, and in his Arcana Arcanissima (The Secret of Secrets)of 1614, he gives an alchemical reading of Greek and Egyptian mythology. Herethe hero of his tale journeys in search of the phoenix, the fabled bird thatreturns to life out of its ashes. At the Nile delta he meets Hermes, who showshim the divine creature’s dwelling place. Maier’s Themis Aurea, of 1618, is inlarge part a defense of the Rosicrucians. Here he depicts the brotherhood asinheritors of an ancient esoteric tradition, and argues that they are dedicatedscientists and healers committed to using their knowledge and wisdom in theservice of a better world. Maier himself, sadly, was a victim of the Rosicrucianpogrom and Thirty Years’ War. By all accounts he was killed in 1622, during asiege of Magdeburg by forces loyal to the Habsburgs. Yet the Rosicrucian dreamof using knowledge to create a better world had not died. Some still believedthat like the phoenix, it too would rise again from the flames.AN INVISIBLE CHURCHOne of the most ironic outcomes of the Rosicrucian diaspora is that many of theideas at the heart of the Rosicrucian experiment, and the Hermetic philosophythat informed it, would serve as the basis for a worldview rather different thanthe one the Rosy Brotherhood had in mind.Following the Rosicrucian debacle, Johann Valentin Andreae turned his attentionaway from Hermetic science and focused his energies on establishing a kind ofChristian utopia, exemplified in his visionary work Christianopolis, “the Cityof Christ.” Readers of this pious work familiar with the Rosicrucian philosophywill find ample evidence of it within its pages. Andreae’s aim in presenting the“serious joke” of the Rosicrucian manifestoes was, it seems, to inspire theirreaders not so much to join the Rosicrucians, as to become them. The literalidea of some secret society clandestinely planning to subvert the status quo wasthe joke. No such group existed—at least not yet. This is where the “serious”part of the hoax came in. The aim of the manifestoes was to express the idealsof the mythical fraternity and inspire those moved by them to go out and work tomake them real. In this way they would indeed join the fraternity, which was an“invisible” brotherhood of people of like mind, working, each in their own way,to bring about much needed change.Those who understood Andreae’s meaning and answered this call included RobertFludd, Michael Maier, and John Comenius. Jacob Boehme had come under theinfluence of someone with a similar idea, Caspar Schwenckfeld, a German Pietist,theologian, and preacher who wrote of an “invisible church,” not one of stone,and the idea of a “hidden” “interior” church is at the heart of Karl vonEckartshausen’s The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary, an eighteenth-century mysticalclassic.3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber512] One of the problems facing organizedreligion is that it too easily hardens into a “static” state. By Andreae’s andBoehme’s time, this was happening to the Protestant church. It sought a“confessional conformity” when what was needed was a spiritual transformation,an ongoing one, as the danger of inspiration crystallizing into dogma is everpresent. The vilification of the Rosicrucians that followed the defeat ofFrederick V led Andreae to abandon his esoteric approach. Instead, he repackagedthe Rosicrucian ideals in a highly Christianized form, and organized various“Christian societies” in order to disseminate them.THE INTELLIGENCERLike much else, most of Andreae’s societies were eradicated during the ThirtyYears’ War, but at least one member of one of them managed to escape the carnageand attempt to revive the Rosicrucian dream. Samuel Hartlib belonged to one ofAndreae’s societies, but when life under the Habsburgs’ wrath proved tooperilous, he left his native Poland and headed to England. Hartlib was incontact with Comenius and shared his ideas about universal education andPansophy. He was also in contact with Elizabeth, the exiled queen of Bohemia,who held court in The Hague. After the death of Frederick V in 1623, those whostill believed in the Rosicrucian ideals gathered around his queen, who stillhad hopes of somehow challenging the Habsburgs’ rule.Hartlib was so inspired by the Rosicrucians that he became one. He was apassionate astrologer, Hermeticist, and follower of Paracelsus, and he tried toestablish a “Pansophic college,” the Collegium Lucis, or “College of Light” inChichester. Its aim was to produce “teachers of mankind.”4[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber513] Hartlib’s Rosicrucian college never quite gotoff the ground, but Hartlib’s most vital role was as a kind ofseventeenth-century networker. He was what was called an “intelligencer”: hepursued a Pansophic goal by keeping up-to-date on a dizzying number of topicsand shared his knowledge with his numerous contacts. One of his ideas was whathe called an “Office of Addresses,” a kind of “citizen’s information bureau,”which made available a wide range of material on a number of subjects, what wemight call an early form of Wikipedia. One of Hartlib’s contacts was JohnWorthington, an academic associated with the Cambridge Platonists, a group ofPansophic philosophers led by Ralph Cudworth, who kept the Hermetic torchburning in spite of Isaac Casaubon’s debunking. Others in Hartlib’s address bookincluded the diarist Samuel Pepys and the poet John Milton.The England Hartlib arrived in was much like Bohemia before the Thirty Years’War. On the brink of its own civil war—which pitted the Roundheads against theCavaliers and saw the public beheading of Charles I in 1649—England’sintellectual and political climate was strangely liberal and promising. In 1640,Hartlib addressed Parliament, expounding his philosophy of Pansophy anduniversal education, and proposing practical ideas that Parliament could act on.He must have felt his speech was a success, as he urged Comenius and John Drury,a Scots preacher who had met Hartlib in Poland and who shared his belief ineducational and religious reform, to come to London. It seemed that finally,there was a good chance that the Rosicrucian dream might come to fruition.Sadly, it was not to be. Comenius and Drury were well received by Hartlib’scircle, but in 1642 civil war broke out and all plans for a universalreformation were shelved. Drury left for The Hague and Comenius headed toSweden. In The Way of Light, written during his time in England, Comenius calledfor the spread of knowledge and for a “college” to be founded in order toaccomplish this. At the end of Labyrinth of the World, Comenius’s pilgrimescapes from the maze of worldly events and finds himself in “the Paradise ofthe Heart,” where angelic teachers impart to him “secret knowledge of diversethings.” Similar angelic teachers peopled Andreae’s Christianopolis. Comeniuscalled these angelic teachers an “invisible college”—much like the “invisiblechurch” of Caspar Schwenckfeld. His hope that such an institution could befounded on earth had not diminished, although the necessary conditions seemed aselusive as ever.THE INVISIBLE COLLEGEIn 1645, while civil war raged, several scientific enthusiasts—or “naturalphilosophers,” as they were then called —gathered in London in informal meetingsto share their passion and discuss ideas. Two of the people involved had closeties to the Rosicrucian dream through their contact with Charles Louis,Frederick V’s son. One was Theodore Haak, an exile from Bohemia, member ofHartlib’s circle and a follower of Comenius. Another was John Wilkins, thefuture bishop of Chester and author of a popular work Mathematical Magick, whichrefers to the Rosicrucian manifestoes and is based on some of the ideas of JohnDee and Robert Fludd; the title, Wilkins said, came from Cornelius Agrippa.5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber514] Around the same time, Robert Boyle, analchemist and the founder of chemistry, referred to an “invisible college” insome letters. In a letter of 1646, written to his former tutor, Boyle asked forsome books that would make him “extremely welcome to our Invisible College.”Boyle wrote that the members of this “invisible college” endeavored to “putnarrow-mindedness out of countenance” and strove to “take the whole body ofmankind to their care,” rather Rosicrucian-sounding ideals. In a letter of 1647to Hartlib, Boyle called him “the midwife and nurse” of this college and saidthat the “whole society is concerned in all the accidents of your life.”6[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber515]It seems clear that Boyle’s “invisible college” was the circle around Hartlib,and it was out of this that Hartlib had hoped to create an educationalestablishment along Pansophic and Rosicrucian lines. What did emerge fromHartlib’s vision was something different. There is, it seems, a clear linkbetween Hartlib’s “invisible college” and the founding of the Royal Society, theoldest and most prestigious scientific society in the world.The events leading up to the founding of the Royal Society in 1660 are complex,but in essence it involved natural philosophers from two independent groupscoming together. One group, led by John Wilkins and inspired by Hartlib, heldPansophic and Rosicrucian ideals. The other was motivated more by the ideas ofFrancis Bacon. Bacon, we’ve seen, followed some Rosicrucian ideals, but hisambition and pragmatism led him to move more toward the kind of mechanical viewof the world promoted by Marin Mersenne. Bacon famously said that nature “mustbe put on the rack and tortured for her secrets,” but before becoming a symbolof the archetypal experimental scientist, he embraced a Hermetic view of theworld and, according to the Italian historian Paolo Rossi, was a firm believerin the Anima mundi.7 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber516] Given this, it issurprising that Bacon joined Mersenne in attacking the work of Dee, Fludd, andParacelsus. But like Dee and Michael Maier, Bacon sought the favor of James Iand he knew the paranoid king held no truck with magic. While it seems he sawthe virtue and value of the Hermetic view, Bacon also knew that it was best toplay his esoteric cards close to his chest. With the prevailing wind moving in amechanical direction, Bacon decided it was favorable for his career to bend withit. The fact that Bacon enjoyed several court appointments and that his upwardmobility led to being made lord chancellor in 1618 seems to argue that he playedhis cards right.Among Hartlib’s correspondents was Baron Skytte, a Swedish nobleman who sharedHartlib’s ideas and who was among the group of natural philosophers partial tothe Pansophic view. In 1660, the proto-Royal Society sought the king’sendorsement—indeed, they could not be a royal society without it. Propositionsconcerning the society’s aims and ideals were put before Charles II, the firstking of England following the Restoration, by Baron Skytte. Many of the Baconiangroup were Royalists who were in exile during Oliver Cromwell’s Commonwealth,but had now returned. Hartlib, whose ideals informed the Pansophic group, hadfound favor during the Commonwealth, and he was now looked on with suspicion.The proposals Baron Skytte had put before the king were of a Pansophiccharacter, but Hartlib’s dreams were sadly dashed again. At a meeting, Skytte’sview of the society was soundly voted out; even Boyle’s support failed to movethe Baconians. They pursued the royal charter on their own and received in it1662. Skytte returned to Sweden and Hartlib died the next year. One factorinvolved in the rejection of the Pansophic vision must have been that in 1659,an edition of Dee’s Spiritual Diary was published, giving his account of hiscommunication with angels. It contained a preface by Meric Casaubon—Isaac’sson—that accused Dee of consorting with devils.In the midst of religious and political tensions, the Baconians prudentlydistanced themselves from ideas about “universal wisdom” and narrowed theirprospects down to pursuing “real” science, the Marin Mersenne brand. They werealso acting in response to the anti-Baconian sentiment that dominated during thedour years of the puritan Cromwell’s Protectorate. The “official” history of thesociety’s founding, published in 1667, underplayed its early Pansophicconnection, and failed to mention anything about an “invisible college.” JohnWilkins, who shared Hartlib’s views, remained as the society’s secretary, buthis active role was diminished. Pansophy, it seems, was dead. Or had it, likethe esoteric current as a whole, only moved underground?“LET NEWTON BE!”The most famous member of the Royal Society was Isaac Newton (1642–1727),generally considered the greatest scientific genius of all time. It is not toomuch of an exaggeration to say that Newton created the modern world practicallysingle-handedly. His major work, Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,published in 1687, usually referred to as the Principia, is considered the mostimportant book ever written, even more than the Bible. We live in a Newtonianuniverse, or at least we did until the arrival of Einstein.It would be tedious and unnecessary to point out all of Newton’s contributions.From the law of gravity to the infinitesimal calculus, history can be dividedinto pre- and post-Newton periods. As Alexander Pope wrote in honor of hispassing, “Nature, and Nature’s Laws lay hid in night: God said ‘Let Newton be!’and all was light.”Yet in what has to be the greatest irony in the history of western esotericism,the man responsible for the clockwork cosmos that William Blake railedagainst—accusing him of “single vision and Newton’s sleep”—and contemporary NewAgers hold responsible for practically all our ills, was himself a passionate,obsessive devotee of the Hermetic sciences. Newton not only wrote reams aboutalchemy—some one million words to be exact—he was committed to discovering thephilosopher’s stone and was particularly fascinated by the story of NicolasFlamel. In recent years, the fact that Newton’s discoveries, which led to ourmodern world, were secondary to his main pursuits has become more or less commonknowledge. But for a long time any whiff of the alchemical retort associatedwith Newton was quickly blown away. It was only in the 1940s that the fact thatNewton, father of the modern world, was secretly a secret teacher came,appropriately, to light.In 1936, the economist John Maynard Keynes bought a collection of Newton’spapers, which had been languishing in neglect; some had even been kept hidden.When Keynes began to read them, he was astonished. Keynes discovered that Newtonwas “different from the conventional picture of him.” In 1946, in an address tothe Royal Society, part of a tercentenary celebration of Newton’s birth, Keynesspelled out exactly how different.8 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber517] Newtonwas, Keynes wrote, “more extraordinary than the nineteenth century cared to makeout of him”—the century par excellence of the mechanical view of the world andthe deficient mode of Gebser’s mental-rational consciousness structure. Newtonwas not, Keynes came to see, “a rationalist . . . who taught us to think alongthe lines of cold and untinctured reason.” He was not “the first of the age ofreason,” Keynes said, but “the last of the magicians . . . the last wonderchildto whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage.” Newton was a magicianbecause “he looked on the universe and all that is in it as a riddle.” It was a“secret” strewn with “mystic clues” that turned it into a “philosopher’streasure hunt” fit for an “esoteric brotherhood.”That Newton belonged to such a brotherhood, in spirit if not in literal fact, isfor the most part ignored today. If it is acknowledged, it is a source ofembarrassment or, at best, a grudging admission that to some small degree,Newton’s interest in alchemy did play a part in his discoveries. Even Timemagazine had to admit that Newton’s “laws” owed “something to alchemy.”9[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber518] More robust appraisals deny that Newton’salchemical interests have any importance at all. Christopher Hitchens—withRichard Dawkins, one of the most vocal modern advocates of atheism—responded toKeynes’s revelations by calling Newton “a spiritualist and alchemist of aparticularly laughable kind.”10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber519]This, however, was not the opinion of those who knew Newton. For hiscontemporaries, Newton was a serious student of Hermetic science who pursued itwith a dedication that left most of his fellows looking like amateurs. He was,as the cliché goes, looking for the mind of God. One suspects that with hisPansophic interests, Newton may have had a better chance of finding it than hiscounterparts do today.GENIUS AT WORKNewton was born in Woolsthorpe, near Grantham, on Christmas Day in 1642. Hisfather, a farmer, had died three months earlier. Newton’s mother remarried, andwhen he was three, she abandoned Newton to be brought up by his grandmother.Newton was a sickly, solitary child who hated his mother and stepfather so muchthat he planned to set fire to their house with them in it. In a confession hewrote at the age of twenty, this murderous fantasy rated very highly.11[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber520] He did not form close emotional relationships,and his early abandonment led to a basic mistrust of life. A colleague atCambridge said of Newton that he was “of the most fearful, cautious, andsuspicious temper that I ever knew.”12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber521] Newtonspent most of his adult life as a recluse; he was, as the psychologist AnthonyStorr writes, “preoccupied with his work to the exclusion of almost everythingelse, with little social contact with other human beings, and no close relationswith either sex.”13 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber522]Newton seemed to have a pathological reluctance to publish his work, fearingthat his ideas would be stolen or subject to criticism that he could not endure.Probably the most famous example of his paranoia is the feud with thephilosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz over who had invented calculus first;Leibniz, like Descartes, had also tried to make contact with the Rosicrucians.Newton had similar feuds with John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal ofEngland and founder of the Greenwich Observatory, and Robert Hooke, a fellowmember of the Royal Society, with whom Newton quarreled about priority ingravity and other touchy subjects. These proprietary squabbles seem much likethe “petty envy” Christian Rosenkreutz encountered when he wished to share theknowledge he had gained in the East. For all his Hermetic obsessions, Newtonseems not to have embraced the Rosicrucian ideal of sharing knowledge, as hiscostive attitude to publication suggests. According to one biographer, “Newtonhardly ever published a discovery without being urged to by others; even when hehad arrived at the solution of the greatest problem that astronomy has everfaced he said nothing about it to anybody.”14 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber523]Newton showed a facility with mechanics from an early age, but his life’s workbegan when as a boy he bought a prism at a county fair. Thus started thefascination with light that resulted in his treatise Opticks, which waspublished in 1704. Newton might have become a farmer like his father, but in1661, he won a scholarship to Cambridge. He was what was called a “sizar,” astudent who earns his keep doing menial tasks. At first Newton seems to havebeen an average student, giving no sign of what was in store. In 1665, Newtongraduated and, because of the threat of plague, he left Cambridge and returnedto Woolsthorpe, where he remained for two years. There he experimented with hisprism, made his first forays into inventing calculus, and, most famously, had anapple fall on his head.Whether an apple really did hit Newton’s head or not, an idea certainly did.What came to Newton was the hunch that whatever it was that made the apple fallalso kept the moon from falling into the Earth, or the Earth falling into thesun. What that something eventually turned out to be was a mysterious forcewhich no one had seen and which acted on things at a distance, that is, with nomedium carrying its influence from source to target. In other words, gravity.Pretty much everything Newton is known for came out of those two years inWoolsthorpe. After this time, he made no new major discoveries.Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was made a Fellow. Two years later, atthe age of twenty-seven, he was made professor of mathematics, occupying theLucasian Chair in Mathematics, which Stephen Hawking, who would also like toknow the mind of God, until recently did as well. In 1668, Newton’s fascinationwith optics led to his inventing the first practical reflecting telescope. Thisbrought him to the attention of his peers; four years later, he was made amember of the Royal Society. By the early 1680s, he had turned his mind togravity again, his interest pricked by Robert Hooke’s remarks about havingdevised a proof that whatever force acted between the planets, it was inverselyproportional to the square of the distance between them. This had occurred toNewton too, some twenty years earlier, but his reluctance to publish meant thatno one knew it.Newton’s caution led to his feud with Hooke, much to Hooke’s regret; Newton wasa bad enemy and he went out of his way to erase Hooke’s reputation, verysuccessfully in fact.15 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber524] The architectChristopher Wren—responsible for rebuilding much of London after the Great Fireof 1666—offered a prize to whoever could devise the kind of proof Hookementioned. (Most historians consider Hooke’s claim wishful thinking, as he neverdelivered the proof he claimed to have.) The astronomer Edmund Halley—after whomthe comet is named—mentioned this contest to Newton and asked what he thought.Newton remarked that yes, the inverse square law was correct, and that he hadalready calculated it. Halley asked to see the proof but Newton had shelved itand promised to send it to Halley later. Halley told the Royal Society ofNewton’s claim and suggested that when Newton delivered on his promise, thesociety should publish it. Three years later, Newton came through, and thePrincipia was born. In a very real sense it marked the end of Newton’s life as ascientist.ALCHEMICAL NEWTONBut not as an alchemist. One project Newton turned to after the Principia wasbiblical chronology. This had been a topic of great interest since 1654, whenBishop James Ussher had argued that, according to his close reading of theBible, the world had begun in 4004 B.C., on Sunday, October 23, to be exact.Newton’s own starting point was 4000 B.C. There were other similarchronologies—Johannes Kepler, one of the giants on whose shoulders Newtonfamously stood, had devised one—but Newton’s is unusual for the fact that heprojected it into the future and, in a vision of what he called “alchemicalhistory,” predicted that the end of the world would come around the middle ofthe twenty-first century.16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber525] The fact thatNewton also predicted that Christ would return in 1948 may suggest that we cantake his future history with some grains of salt.17[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber526]Another biblical mystery that gripped Newton was the secret of Solomon’s Temple.Like the Hermeticists and Neoplatonists, Newton believed that Egypt was thesource of all wisdom. He believed that the ancients had held the key to allknowledge, and the secret to discovering this was hidden in the symbols of theHermetic tradition. Newton also believed that Solomon was the greatestphilosopher of all time, and he devoted much time and thought to“reconstructing” Solomon’s Temple, which he saw as a kind of “frame” throughwhich he could understand the pattern of history.18[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber527] Like the Traditionalist school of René Guénon,Newton believed that “the first religion was the most rational of all otherstill the nations corrupted it.” Like Gemistos Plethon, Newton believed that atthe “dawn of time,” man did know the mind of God. He had forgotten it since, butNewton was determined to remember.Newton’s interest in alchemy may have begun in his early days at GranthamSchool, when he lodged with a chemist. His lifelong hypochondria may havestarted then too. Like Paracelsus, Newton took laudanum—a mixture of opium andalcohol—and he also concocted unusual remedies for mostly imaginary ills, the“illnesses of the imagination” Paracelsus had warned about. He read much at thistime: Aristotle, Plato, and Francis Bacon, whose own Rosicrucian views settledinto Newton’s mind. One powerful Hermetic influence came from his tutor, HenryMore, one of the Cambridge Platonists who, like John Worthington— one ofHartlib’s networkers—dismissed Isaac Casaubon’s erudite nit-picking. Morebelieved that behind the natural world was a universal spirit, something alongthe lines of the Neoplatonist’s Anima mundi, and he passed this on to Newton.By 1663, Newton began a “philosophical” notebook in which he jotted downreflections on a number of topics, one of which was “Of Gravity and Levity.”Another was optics and the mystery of color. As Peter Marshall argues, Newton’sintuitions about gravity and color emerged from his interest in alchemy, whichspoke of “hidden forces at work in nature and stressed the possibility oftransformation.”19 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber528] Changes in color during thealchemical process were taken as a sign of transformation; this was known as the“peacock’s tail.” According to Marshall, Newton had an inordinate fondness forred, decorating his room at Cambridge in it. Red symbolizes the last stage ofthe alchemical opus, and another name for the philosopher’s stone is the “redelixir.”Newton read widely in alchemical literature and built up an extensive library onthe subject, one of the largest of the time. Ramon Lull, Basil Valentine,Michael Maier, Michael Sendivogius, the Rosicrucian manifestoes, Jacob Boehme,and other important alchemical authors found space on Newton’s crowdedshelves.20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber529] Newton annotated Maier’s works, andhe wrote at length on the Rosicrucians. Newton also made transcripts of manyalchemical works, translated others, made detailed cross-references betweendifferent texts, and compiled an alchemical glossary of over seven thousanditems. Much of his notes was written in code, partially out of Newton’s paranoiabut also out of the belief that such knowledge should be kept from unworthyhands. He himself tried to live piously and believed that “They who search afterthe Philosopher’s Stone [are] . . . obliged to live a strict religious life.”Newton also knew, as did Mary Anne South, that “alchemy does not trade withmetals as ignorant vulgars think,” and that its work “is not of that kind whichtends to vanity & deceit but rather to . . . the knowledge of God.” This is inorder “to glorify God in his wonderful works” and “to teach a man how to livewell.” The knowledge of how this can be done can be found in nature, but it wasalso found in what Newton called the “sacred signatures,” works of spiritualtruth such as Genesis, the book of Job, and other biblical texts.21[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber530] Other important “signatures” were the CorpusHermeticum and the Emerald Tablet, which Newton translated and about which hewrote a long and detailed commentary. 22 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber531]Newton’s perseverance in his alchemical studies became legendary. More than oneacquaintance observed that he could go for long periods without food or rest andthat he was never so happy as when he had gained a new insight in his work. Hehad a genius for absentmindedness. William Stukeley, an early Freemason and theantiquarian responsible for the modern interest in ancient sites likeStonehenge, knew Newton and was one of his first biographers. Visiting Newton,Stukeley was kept waiting. After some time, Stukeley grew hungry and decided toeat the lunch that Newton had ignored. When Newton finally appeared, he liftedthe lid on his lunch plate and remarked, “Dear me, I thought I had not dined,”and put it back.23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber532]As Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince make clear, recognition that Newton’salchemical pursuits informed his scientific work appeared as early as the 1960s,but such insights were out of step with the accepted picture of the father of“the age of reason” and made little impact.24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber533]Yet more than one scholar saw that the work for which Newton is justlyrecognized today came about not in spite of his alchemical interests, butbecause of them. As Picknett and Prince write: “If Newton had never become privyto the Hermetic philosophy, he would never have achieved his work and the worldwould be—literally—much the poorer for it. It is universally acknowledged thatif the Principia had never been written, our modern technological world wouldnot exist. But without the Hermetica, Newton would not have written thePrincipia. Emphatically Newton did not make his great scientific discoveriesdespite his esoteric belief, but because of them.”25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber534]NEWTON’S BREAKDOWNThe strain of writing the Principia, as well as conducting his alchemicalresearch, took its toll on Newton, and by the early 1690s, it was beginning toshow. In 1693, he began a strange work, Praxis, in which it seems that he claimsto have achieved “multiplication,” another name for “transmutation,” the centralaim of alchemy. Peter Marshall ponders this possibility and asks whether, if itwas true, would Newton have had to rethink the mechanical philosophy that hepresented in the Principia?26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber535] According to thehistorians of science J. Edward McGuire and Piyo M. Rattansi, Newton did leave adraft of sections of the Principia that he intended to rewrite for a newedition, which would include more of his ideas about the Hermetic sciences.27[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber536]That edition did not appear, but the idea remains a tantalizing suggestion.Marin Mersenne died in 1648. He would undoubtedly have applauded the Principia,but we do not know what he would have thought about its author’s alchemicalpursuits or quest for the mind of God. We can only speculate on what impact aHermetically widened Principia would have had on western consciousness. Inmid-1693, Newton suffered a nervous breakdown. He abandoned Praxis after only afew short chapters and it remained unfinished. His paranoia increased and hebelieved that his friends Samuel Pepys—Samuel Hartlib’s neighbor—and thephilosopher John Locke were conspiring against him. Newton was always subject todepression, often violent outbursts, and strong feelings of guilt. After asleepless week, Newton’s mind cracked and he was overwhelmed with delusions. Theoverwork and solitude were a strain, but there is also the suggestion that hewas poisoned by the fumes of some alchemical experiment.By the end of the year, Newton had recovered, but he seems to have experiencedthe kind of enantiodromia that turned Thomas Aquinas against his Summa. Heabandoned science and alchemy and, in 1696, left Cambridge for London. There heturned his attention to theological questions. He became president of the RoyalSociety in 1703, and remained so until the end of his life. He was appointedwarden of the Mint, and later master of the Bank of England, an ironic positionin that alchemy was illegal and subject to the death penalty. This was not outof religious reasons but because of the odd chance that alchemists could makegold. If so, it would ruin the economy. Having Newton in charge of the treasurywas rather like leaving a fox in charge of the chicken coop. But Newton broughtthe same dedication to this task that he had to his alchemical and scientificones. He had no qualms about sending counterfeiters to the gallows and did sowhenever necessary. He died in 1727, having brought into existence a world quiteunlike the one he believed we actually live in.THE MASON’S WORDOne of the books in Newton’s alchemical library was the Theatrum ChemicumBritannicum, a compilation of English alchemical literature compiled by EliasAshmole, published in 1652. It was one of Newton’s most consulted works andthere is small wonder why. Ashmole had gathered many texts that were availableonly in manuscript form and were sequestered in private libraries. The number ofalchemists represented is impressive: Thomas Norton, George Ripley, and EdwardKelley are among them, and Ashmole also includes Geoffrey Chaucer’s satiricpoem, “The Canon Yeoman’s Tale,” which lampoons “puffers” and tells the story ofa fraudulent alchemical priest. Ashmole was a solicitor, alchemist, antiquarian,and astrologer, and he had a particular fascination with the Rosicrucians. Hecopied out by hand English translations of the Rosicrucian manifestoes and wrotea letter in Latin asking to join the fraternity. He never sent the letter—notbecause he had changed his mind, but because like so many others he didn’t havetheir address.Ashmole was one of the founders of the Royal Society; he was part of the groupwho favored Francis Bacon’s experimental approach to natural philosophy. Hesupported the Royalists during the civil war, and when the monarchy wasrestored, he received many benefits. Like Newton, Ashmole acquired a hugelibrary, and like the Hermetic Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, he was an obsessivecollector of curiosities, unusual natural or man-made objects, a hobby that manyat the time with the funds and leisure enjoyed. In 1677, Ashmole donated hislibrary and collection to the University of Oxford; it formed the basis of theAshmolean Museum, the first university museum in the world. Another of Ashmole’scurious accomplishments is that he is one the first men in England to beinitiated into Freemasonry.Ashmole’s initiation took place under less than propitious circumstances. Ithappened in 1646, when he was a prisoner of war. He had been captured by theRoundheads (supporters of Parliament against the king) in Lancashire, andAshmole’s initiation was one of many that took place under the auspices ofbattle.28 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber537] Ashmole’s involvement withFreemasonry continued throughout his life. In 1682, he noted in his diary thathe had attended a lodge meeting at Mason’s Hall in London as the senior member,and that they later dined at the Half Moone Tavern in Cheapside. Ashmole died in1692.Ashmole was not the only person involved in the Royal Society who had links toFreemasonry and the Rosicrucians. Sir Robert Moray, a Scot, was a soldier offortune and a spy and, like Ashmole, he fought on the side of the king duringthe civil war. Also like Ashmole, his initiation took place in wartime; inMoray’s case, it happened in Newcastle. In 1641, just before the outbreak of thecivil war, Scotland was involved in a revolt against England. Successful, theScots headed south and captured Newcastle, and there, in March 1641, Moray wasmade a Freemason. Scotland later sided with Parliament against the king, butMoray was one of the few Scots who fought on the side of the Royalists. Duringthe Commonwealth, Moray lived in France, but with the Restoration, he returnedto England and was instrumental in the Royal Society gaining Charles II’spatronage. Moray was friends with the “inner alchemist” Thomas Vaughan, whopublished the first English translation of the Rosicrucian manifestoes; Thomas’stwin brother, Henry Vaughan, the metaphysical poet, used alchemical motifs inhis work.29 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber538] Other members of the RoyalSociety, like Christopher Wren, were Masons. Oddly Newton was not, given hisinterest in Solomon’s Temple, a central theme in Masonic philosophy.That Freemasonry was in some way connected to the Rosicrucians is not an unusualidea. In 1638, the Scot Henry Adamson published a poem, “The Muses Threnodie,”that contained the lines: “For what we presage is not in grosse,/For we bebrethren of the Rosie Crosse;/We have the Mason Word and second sight/Things forto come we can foretell aright.”30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber539] Thissuggests that Freemasonry and the Rosicrucians were linked, and that both wereprivy to paranormal abilities. In 1676, a Masonic pamphlet featured a humorousreference to what must have been an interesting dinner party. It read: “To givenotice, that the Modern Green-Ribboned Cabal, together with the AncientBrotherhood of the Rosy Cross, the Hermetick Adepti and the company of AcceptedMasons intend all to dine together on the 31 of November next.”31[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber540] The association of Masons, Rosicrucians, andHermeticists is clear, and the notice also advised those attending to bringtheir spectacles, otherwise some of the guests might prove “invisible.” Suchlinks suggested to one Masonic researcher that Freemasonry was a directdescendant of the Rosicrucians. In his “Historico-Critical Inquiry into theOrigins of the Rosicrucians and the Freemasons,” Thomas De Quincey, the “Englishopium eater,” argued that the Freemasons “arose out of the Rosicrucian mania.”De Quincey seems to have recognized that Andreae’s “hoax” had a serious intentand speaks of its “elevated purpose.” He concludes that “Freemasonry is neithermore nor less than Rosicrucianism as modified by those who transplanted it toEngland.”32 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber541] Those who transplanted it wereHartlib, Comenius, and Fludd.It would be gratifying to accept De Quincey’s conclusion, but there are problemswith it. There are clear resemblances between the Rosicrucians and Freemasonry,but the dates argue against a direct lineage. There is evidence for Freemasonrythat is earlier than the Rosicrucian diaspora. In 1583, James VI ofScotland—soon to be James I of England—made William Schaw his master of works.Schaw oversaw all building under James VI’s rule and he was responsible fororganizing the different lodges of builders. Along with all the other necessaryrequirements in order to secure work, Schaw made a curious addition to what eachstonemason would have to provide. He made it a rule that each new applicantwould be tested in “the art of memory and the science thereof.”33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber542] Mention of an “art of memory” reminds us ofGiordano Bruno and the Renaissance adepts. Is it this memory Schaw referred to?He could be thinking of ordinary memory, a useful tool in any practice. But whyrefer to it as an “art” and “science”? If Schaw was speaking of “magicalmemory,” then this seems evidence that some Hermetic ideas were involved instonemasonry well before the Rosicrucian experiment.THE ROOTS OF FREEMASONRYAs with so many of our secret teachers and teachings, the origins of Freemasonryare shrouded in the mists of time. They also suffer from a surfeit ofsuggestions. We have already seen one Masonic origin story link it to theKnights Templar. The Templars, in fact, serve as a connecting thread runningthrough a fascinating and fatiguing assortment of possible sources for the rootsof Freemasonry. In recent years, a shelfload of books have appeared anchoringFreemasonry in a number of speculative foundation stories, ranging from theshroud of Turin and John the Baptist to the Essenes and the Ark of theCovenant.34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber543] Manly P. Hall suggests thatFreemasonry reaches back to lost Atlantis, and that it and the Rosicrucians wereresponsible for the founding of America.35 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber544]Hall’s suggestions echo in the work of David Ovason and Robert Hieronimus, whosebooks argue that the United States was intended to be a kind of Rosicrucianutopia and that Washington, D.C., was designed according to the sacred geometryassociated with Freemasonry.36 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber545]An offshoot from Masonic mythology are the Illuminati, a breakaway group thatfor a time in the late eighteenth century briefly troubled the government ofBavaria. Currently they are enjoying a comeback in popular culture. From DanBrown to Jay-Z—and with much in between—the Illuminati are either planning todestroy the Vatican, or are a super-exclusive elitist club, open to rich rapstars and politicians intent on establishing a New World Order.Although more conservative ideas about Freemasonry’s origins exist—according tothe historian Jasper Ridley, they have little if nothing to do with theTemplars—Masonic history itself can be extravagant.37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber546] The most common story accepted by Masons isthat Freemasonry goes back to the murder of Hiram Abiff, architect of Solomon’sTemple. Hiram Abiff knew the secret of the temple—the Mason’s “Word”—and whenthree “ruffians” accosted him and demanded it, he refused. They murdered him,and in the ritual that raises a Freemason to the third degree and makes him aMaster Mason, Hiram Abiff’s murder is reenacted.In a Masonic text known as the “Old Charges” that dates to 1400, part of what isknown as the Cooke and Regius manuscript, it is said that Masonry goes back toantediluvian times. After the Flood, its secrets were recovered, and they arethe basis for the knowledge of Hermes Trismegistus and the wisdom of Pythagoras.In other accounts, God himself is a Mason; evidence of this is the fact that hebuilt the universe in six days. Adam was a Mason too, and it was Masons whobuilt the Tower of Babel.38 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber547] For some,Freemasonry reaches back to the ancient Mystery schools.39[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber548] For others, mostly since the FrenchRevolution, the Masons are secretly dedicated to world dominion. In 1924, theconspiracy theorist Nesta Webster published Secret Societies and SubversiveMovements, in which she claimed that Freemasons, communists, and Jews wereplanning to take over the world. Webster’s work was in many ways a rehash of thenotorious Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a scurrilous forgery published inRussia in 1905, which claimed that the Masons, in league with a cabal ofinternational Jewry, were busy undermining western civilization. Some of theProtocols’ appreciative readers were Adolf Hitler and the Traditionalist JuliusEvola.The Protocols were proven to be a forgery—in 1921, a series of articles in TheNew York Times did that—and Nesta Webster’s hysterics did not reach far beyondthe lunatic fringe (although Winston Churchill took them seriously), yet an auraof danger still surrounds the Masons. Today the occult or mystical aspect ofFreemasonry has given way to its character as an Old Boys’ Club, membership ofwhich is helpful in one’s career advancement. Yet for all its protestations,Freemasonry has never quite shaken off the suspicion that it is up to no good.THE CATHEDRAL BUILDERSIn the most likely account of the origins of Freemasonry, it emerges from themedieval stonebuilders’ guilds. As Jasper Ridley remarks, during the Middle Agesthere was a common feeling that the masons were somehow “different” from otherpeople.40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber549] For one thing, while most peoplethen rarely left the town they were born in, masons moved around; they, as itwere, followed the money. Very few buildings then were made of stone, and masonshad to travel to reach the castles, churches, cathedrals, and abbeys they workedon. Their work too was different; often it involved the sacred. The masons whodid the fine-tuning, working on the cathedral carvings, formed a kind of elite.Much of this work involved sacred symbols, alchemical glyphs, and the secret“green language.” Whether every mason who worked with these understood them isunknown, but we must assume some did. In France, such elite masons were known asthe Compagnonnages. In Germany they were called the Steinmetzen. These mastercarvers worked with what was called “freestone,” a softer material that allowedfor precision work. The rank-and-file masons, who laid the building’sfoundations, worked with “rough stone,” a harder, unwieldy material. Over time“freestone mason” was shortened to “freemason.”41[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber550] These “freestone masons” needed to recognizefellow masons in foreign towns, and so they developed secret signs, handshakes,and passwords, and guarded these fiercely. This helped to ensure that only truemasons would be allowed to do their work, which, as it was involved withcathedrals and other sacred sites, was connected to the great religiousmonuments of the past, such as Solomon’s Temple.Masons were also required to lead a moral and religious life. They had a duty toGod and to the church. They must obey the king and show fealty to their master.One “charge” given to masons was not to sleep with their master’s wife ordaughter. Another forbade card-playing, fornicating, or frequenting pubs.42[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber551] A mason was also never to reveal his master’ssecrets, his tricks of the trade, as it were—a possible source of the story ofHiram Abiff.These ethical and moral strictures—or something much like them—became part oflater Freemasonry and epithets like “upright,” “four square,” and “on thelevel,” which indicate soundness, integrity, and fairness—why should a “square”deal be better than a “round” one?—have entered common language. But whileFreemasonry’s origins remain a mystery, another mystery is what is known as theshift from “operative masonry” to “speculative masonry,” which happened sometimebetween 1550 and 1700.OPERATORS AND SPECULATORSAt some point, emphasis shifted from actual masons working withstone—“operative”—to an interest and concern with the meaning and symbolism ofarchitecture, with “speculating” about it. We can see this as a reverse of theshift that turned alchemy into chemistry. “Inner alchemy” began with an interiortransformation, but the chemistry that appeared in the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries concentrated on “real” changes in the chemical combinationsof matter. “Freestone masonry” began as a “hands-on” experience with actualstone, and transformed into a “spiritual masonry,” aimed at building an “inner”temple.Exactly why and how this happened is unknown, but we can assume that“speculative masonry” shared in the wide hunger for a more immediate and liberalreligious experience that characterized the Rosicrucian experiment and theheretical movements that preceded it. What is clear is that by the earlyeighteenth century, the masons were no longer a “trade union” submitting to thestrictures of the Catholic Church, but had become a society of “intellectualgentlemen who favored religious tolerance and friendship between men ofdifferent religions, and thought that a simple belief in God should replacecontroversial theological doctrines.”43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber552]In a development that has never been satisfactorily explained, aristocratic menof cultured leisure suddenly took a profound interest in the activities ofstonecutters and laborers. Or more precisely, not in their activities, but inthe meaning behind them. One source for this interest must have been the KingJames and other vernacular versions of the Bible. These took control ofreligious thinking away from the church, and their account of the building ofSolomon’s Temple aroused curiosity about the masons’ work. The result was thatideas of religious tolerance, promoted by the Rosicrucians, became part of themasons’ legend, which was associated with sacred architecture. These ideas hadtheir roots in the Pythagorean and Platonic vision we have looked at in thisbook. Masonic symbolism is Hermetic in origin. The Masonic Great Architect, whocreates the universe and shapes the rough stone of humanity, making it a fittemple, finds his ancestor in the Platonic and Hermetic cosmic craftsman. Partof the Masonic initiation ritual includes a kind of Hermetic ascent through theplanets, and in Mozart’s Masonic opera, The Magic Flute (1791), which depictsthe archetypal struggle between darkness and light, Egyptian and Hermeticsymbols abound. In The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, Manly P. Hall even sees aconnection between the legend of Hiram Abiff and the kind of Egyptian initiationrituals aimed at separating the soul from the body, and which Plato spoke of as“practicing dying.”DEISM AND THE DIVINE ARCHITECTThe Masonic origin story recounted in James Anderson’s Book of Constitutions,published in 1723, depicts God as the Divine Architect. This concept fit in wellwith the Deism of the Enlightenment, a religious position that grew out ofNewton’s mechanical cosmos. This saw God as the Creator of the Universe, but acreator who, once his handiwork was done, no longer interfered with hiscreation. Once set in motion, the clockwork universe would carry on with no needof supernatural intervention. The meaning of the Creator’s work could beunderstood through reason and observation, not revelation.44[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber553] The slow accumulation of scientific fact wouldreveal the truth about God, a religious position known as “naturalism,” aphilosophy with which William Blake found much fault because it allowed no placefor free will or the imagination, and reduced man and the universe to littlemore than very complicated machines.45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber554] In thisway, we can see Deism as a very left-brain religion, relying solely on reasonand the senses and leaving out of account anything that reason cannot explain.While not all Freemasons were Deists, their desire to avoid sectarian squabblesled to their anchoring spirituality in what we might call a religious commonsense, which emphasized reasonableness over everything else. While for a timeDeism made possible a truce between religion and the swiftly rising scientificoutlook, the need for a Creator soon fell away. When Napoleon remarked to theFrench astronomer Laplace that he had left God out of his account of theuniverse, Laplace replied that he had no need of that hypothesis, a sentimentechoed recently in Stephen Hawking’s The Grand Design, which argues that therewas no need for God, given that the universe arose from “spontaneous creation.”Deism allowed men of the Enlightenment to compartmentalize their spiritual andscientific beliefs and so avoid for a time the religious bickering that hadcharacterized the last few centuries. This sense of harmony and reasonablenessinformed English Freemasonry, which soon found a place within mainstreamsociety. The Grand Lodge of England was established in 1717. With its emphasison moral and ethical responsibility, it quickly became associated with thevalues of sobriety and propriety, egalitarianism and civic-mindedness. Withinthe Masonic lodges, men from different social backgrounds and standing couldmeet each other as equals, just as those of different religious beliefs could.It was this belief in the equality of men that drew the founding fathers of theAmerican Revolution to Freemasonry, which spread throughout the colonies viamilitary “field lodges,” the kind through which Elias Ashmole and Robert Moraywere initiated, rather as Mithraism spread among Roman soldiers.While much has been written about the “Masonic roots of America,” we should becautious in ascribing the kind of detailed “secret” planning that Manly P. Halland other writers see in the beginnings of the United States to the fact thatMasonic emblems and motifs make up much of American symbolism, from the GreatSeal to the Washington Monument. It is true that many signatories of theDeclaration of Independence were Masons, but as Michael Baigent and RichardLeigh argue in The Temple and the Lodge, there is no evidence that a Masonicconspiracy was at work in the founding of America, although they do admit thatsome Rosicrucian ideas may have reached the New World as early as the Jamestownsettlement.46 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber555] The truth is that there wereMasons on both sides during the American Revolution, and British generals andthose of the rebels were equally brothers in the craft. Yet while we shouldn’tsee in the origins of America a Masonic–Rosicrucian plot to create the NewWorld, we should recognize that the progressive and Masonic notions of liberty,equality, tolerance, brotherhood, and the “rights of man” that made up theAmerican vision were “in the air,” and that they permeated the Zeitgeist throughthe spread of Freemasonry. Many people who would never read the intellectualsources of these ideas—David Hume, John Locke, or Voltaire (who was aMason)—nevertheless discovered them within the progressive atmosphere of theirMasonic lodge.CONTINENTAL FREEMASONRY AND HIDDEN SUPERIORSWhile English Freemasonry found a home within the established order of society,its continental counterpart soon became a Masonic black sheep. This was becauseof its association with the Jacobite cause, which wanted to return the Stuartsto the English and Scottish thrones. In 1688, James II, a Catholic, hadunexpectedly sired a male heir. This horrified the English nobility because theysaw the threat of a possible Catholic dynasty. They convinced James II’sdaughter Mary, a Protestant, and her husband, William of Orange (Holland), toforce James II to abdicate.When William’s troops reached England’s shores, James II escaped to France,where he remained in exile. For the next sixty years—until 1745, and itscollapse at the Battle of Culloden—the Stuart cause found support in France,Sweden, Spain, and other countries that had a stake in returning a Stuart to thethrone. The Jacobite cause (“Jacobus” is the Latin equivalent of James) bledinto Scottish Freemasonry, and secret Masonic fraternities devoted to theStuarts flourished and gave the craft a subversive, threatening character. Inorder to make clear its fealty to the Hanoverian regime, English Freemasonry hadto publicly renounce its Jacobite elements, some of which had acquired a badreputation through their involvement with the Hell Fire Club, a society devotedto paganism and general carousing.47 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber556] Ineffect, English Freemasonry went through the same purging that the Royal Societyhad: it rejected its politically incorrect elements and produced a document,James Anderson’s Constitutions, that asserted its unthreatening, compliantcharacter.English Freemasonry was limited to three main degrees: Entered Apprentice,Fellow Craft, and Master Mason. There were “optional” and “higher,” moremystical degrees, but these were now available only on the Continent. Thesubversive taint associated with continental Freemasonry infected these higherdegrees, and soon continental Freemasonry was seen as dark, mysterious, andaltogether sinister. One element of continental Freemasonry that became acentral part of modern esotericism was the idea of “hidden superiors.” This wasintroduced in the 1740s by the German Baron Karl Gotthelf von Hund, who foundeda form of Freemasonry known as “Strict Observance,” which traced its originsback to the Knights Templar. It was called “Strict Observance” because itdemanded unquestioning obedience to certain leaders Hund referred to as “unknownsuperiors,” hidden chiefs whose identity was secret.Hund was a typical eighteenth-century Masonic “noble traveler,” who made his wayacross Europe, acquiring initiations as he went. He was first initiated intoFreemasonry in 1741, in Frankfurt. Hund later claimed that in Paris in 1743, hewas initiated into this new Templar Freemasonry by someone he knew only as “theKnight of the Red Feather.” Who this was has never been confirmed, but Hundhinted that his initiator was Charles Edward Stuart, “Bonnie Prince Charlie,”the Young Pretender, who, he claimed, was the Grandmaster of all Masons. Hundinitiated others, and his Templar-based Freemasonry would have a long history.In 1908, during a séance, René Guénon received a message from Jacques deMolay—the last Templar Grandmaster—telling him to “revive the Temple,” that is,to start a new Templar-oriented Masonic lodge. Guénon did, but it did not last,and in 1911 he received another message telling him to close the lodge. Guénondid, and his association with Freemasonry ended in 1917.Hund continued to promote his Strict Observance Rite, but in the early 1750s, hewas faced with an embarrassing situation. When new converts asked for moreinformation about his “hidden superiors” and their work, Hund had to admit thathe could tell them nothing. He had not heard from his masked leaders for sometime and feared he never would. They said they would contact him again with newinstructions, but Hund heard nothing more. Like the “invisible Rosicrucians,”Hund’s “hidden superiors” were nowhere to be found.Baigent and Leigh suggest that Hund’s “hidden superiors” were important JacobiteMasons and that with the collapse of the cause in 1745, they had simplydisappeared. They were arrested, possibly dead, or had drifted back into life.Hund may also have been the dupe of Masonic con men: he was wealthy, earnest,idealistic, passionate about chivalry and its codes, hence his perpetuation ofthe Templar–Freemasonry myth. Or he may have made it up, with good intentions.Strict Observance was designed to bring rigor back to what in many ways hadbecome something of a gentleman’s club, and it continued on, even with the endof the Jacobite cause. Another possibility is that Hund’s “hidden superiors”were something else entirely . . .Whatever the truth behind Hund’s “hidden superiors,” along with the “invisible”Rosicrucians, they came to have a very concrete influence on esoteric history,transforming in the centuries to come into Madame Blavatsky’s “hidden masters,”the “secret chiefs” of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Gurdjieff’s“inner circle of humanity,” to name just a few of their incarnations: elusive,mysterious individuals who guide a faltering humanity on its path toenlightenment.A SCANDINAVIAN DA VINCIOne important esoteric figure who may have found his way to continentalFreemasonry was the scientist, religious philosopher, and “inner voyager”Emanuel Swedenborg. According to the research of Marsha Keith Schuchard,Swedenborg was initiated into a Jacobite lodge in London in 1710, during hisfirst visit to the city, and he is thought to have renewed his contacts withthis group and to have made contact with other similar societies during the1740s, when he came to London again.48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber557]Swedenborg was born in Stockholm in 1688. His father, Jesper Swedberg—the namewas changed to Swedenborg in 1719 when the family was ennobled—was a regimentalchaplain, pastor, and theologian who later became a bishop. Swedenborg was adeeply religious man, but his spirituality took a form radically different fromhis father’s. By the end of his life in 1772, Swedenborg was known throughoutEurope as the man who had visited heaven and hell and returned to tell aboutthem. He did, in lengthy, unwieldy volumes which recounted in dry, precisedetail the facts about the spiritual worlds. Today, in secular Sweden, he ishardly mentioned without some note of embarrassment, but Swedenborg’s readersincluded some of the most creative and influential people of the last twocenturies. A short roll call would include William Blake, W. B. Yeats, HelenKeller, Jorge Luis Borges, Arnold Schoenberg, C. G. Jung, August Strindberg, andRalph Waldo Emerson.Although a Christian, Swedenborg’s vision transcends his religion; D. T. Suzuki,who introduced Zen Buddhism to the West, called him “the Buddha of the North.”Most people who know of Swedenborg associate him with the New Church, which isbased on his teaching. This rose up more than a decade after Swedenborg’s deathand he had nothing to do with it. Swedenborg did speak of a “new church,” but hesaw it more along the lines of Johann Valentin Andreae’s “invisiblebrotherhood,” Caspar Schwenckfeld’s “invisible church,” or the “interior church”of Karl von Eckartshausen, an “open community where regenerated men and womenwould find rules for life through divine grace and love,” not a sect.49[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber558] Having said this, I should mention that oneNew Church missionary was John Chapman, otherwise known as “Johnny Appleseed,”an early conservationist who spread Swedenborgian ideas as well as apple treesacross much of the eastern United States. Swedenborg’s vision of “regeneratedman” had its roots in a symbolic reading of the Bible as well as in Hermetic,Neoplatonic, and Kabbalistic thought, and along with Newton he was one of thegreat Pansophic thinkers of his time.As a child, Swedenborg had visions; he often spoke of “unseen” playmates whotold him things that astounded his parents, and by his early teens he haddeveloped a curious habit. While at prayer, he discovered how to control hisbreath so that it seemed he was hardly breathing. Doing so, he said, allowed himto focus more intently on God. Breath control has long been recognized as ameans of altering consciousness; the young Swedenborg seems to have discoveredthis for himself. This habit stayed with him, and it informed his reflections onthe link between breath and the brain, one of Swedenborg’s many insights intoneurophysiology which were later confirmed by modern science. Another curiousphenomenon the young Swedenborg experienced was something he called “the sign.”This was a kind of inner light, an interior “flame” that Swedenborg saw wheneverhis meditations led him in the right direction. This “confirmatory brightness,”as he called it, assured him that he was close to some breakthrough.The teenage Swedenborg was introduced to Hermetic ideas by his brother-in-lawErik Benzelius, a brilliant scientist and theologian. Benzelius was a Hebraist.He had edited Philo of Alexandria and he knew F. M. van Helmont, who hadannotated Knorr von Rosenroth’s translation of the Kabbalah Denudata (TheKabbalah Unveiled). F. M. van Helmont was the son of the alchemist and chemistJean Baptiste van Helmont, and the “M” stood for Mercurius. Benzelius, animportant Swedish Enlightenment figure, was a Pansophist with a deep interest inthe Kabbalah; he was also a friend of the philosopher Leibniz.Swedenborg was also exposed to the Hermetic tradition in his university studies.The professor who presided over his dissertation lectured on Pythagoras, Plato,and Plotinus, and the emanationist doctrine of Neoplatonism found a place inSwedenborg’s later scientific and spiritual writings. Swedenborg also readPansophic thinkers like Comenius.Swedenborg showed a real flair for science, but his father’s religious beliefshad no place for this. After graduating from university, Swedenborg tookBenzelius’s advice and traveled. Swedenborg sought out knowledge and he metothers, like himself, with an intense passion for learning. In London, Paris,Amsterdam, Rome, Milan, Hamburg, and other cities, Swedenborg met and conversedwith many of the leading scientists of the day. Many shared a Rosicrucian,Pansophic ideal. He absorbed mathematics, mechanics, astronomy, anatomy, andother disciplines with an embarrassingly voracious intellectual appetite.Swedenborg also learned many “hands-on” skills, picking up watchmaking,cabinetry, brass working, marble inlay, and other trades from the many craftsmenhe lodged with. While in London during his first visit, he invested inscientific instruments. His letters to Benzelius were read by the CollegiumCuriosorum, “the Guild of the Curious,” Sweden’s equivalent of England’s RoyalSociety. Swedenborg’s reports led to him becoming the editor of Sweden’s firstscientific journal, Daedalus Hyperboreus (Northern Inventor), and the guildasked him to meet with John Flamsteed, England’s Astronomer Royal. Swedenborgalso met with Edmund Halley and he tried, unsuccessfully, to meet Newton.Swedenborg entered the competition sponsored by Greenwich Observatory fordevising a method of establishing longitude at sea; he just missed winning, butwas beaten by John Harrison, inventor of the chronometer.On his return from his five-year grand tour, Swedenborg worked with ChristopherPolhem, Sweden’s most famous inventor. Swedenborg had already devised plans fora number of inventions, ranging from a submarine, an aqueduct, and a machinegun, to an airplane, automobile, and eighteenth-century home entertainmentsystem.50 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber559] While with Polhem, he put hisengineering flair to great use. Among Swedenborg’s efforts were a dry dock atthe port of Karlskrona; Sweden’s first salt works; the Tröllhättan Canal—whichlinks Sweden with the North Sea—and perhaps his most remarkable feat ofengineering: moving the king’s navy fifteen miles across land in order to fightthe Norwegians in the Battle of Fredrikshald in 1718. Yet Swedenborg’sengineering ability, remarkable as it was, was not his real passion and hissights were set on bigger game.SOUL SEARCHINGIn 1719, when his family was ennobled, Swedenborg fulfilled his responsibilitiesas a member of the Swedish Diet. He had already been appointed a specialassessor of mines. But Swedenborg’s “ruling love”—as he would later callit—compelled him to pursue the Big Questions, such as the structure of thecosmos, and the relationship between the soul and the body. For the next fewdecades, along with all of his practical obligations, Swedenborg studied theworks of the great scientists and traveled to meet them, intent on cracking thecosmic riddle.Many of Swedenborg’s insights into astronomy and neuroscience were ahead oftheir time and were subsequently confirmed by later scientists. He wrote reamson the structure of the cosmos, human anatomy, and the workings of the brain,along with technical treatises on mineralogy and mining. He was up-to-date onthe latest developments in the new science of Descartes and Newton—like SamuelHartlib, Swedenborg was a dedicated “intelligencer”—but Swedenborg alsorecognized the limits of this burgeoning worldview. Newtonian science limiteditself to laws based on sensory evidence, but Swedenborg wanted to get behindphenomena to their causes. “The sign that we are willing to be wise,” he wrote,“is the desire to know the causes of things, and to investigate the secret andunknown operations of nature,” a dictum suitable for an alchemist’slaboratory.51 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber560]In his first major work, The Principles of Natural Things, Swedenborg speculatedon the nature of the universe.52 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber561] He wanted toknow how the finite physical world emerged from an infinite, unmanifest source,a question that occupied many previous minds. Swedenborg’s speculations led himto ideas that in many ways anticipated our notions of holograms and fractals, aswell as the “implicate order” and “unbroken wholeness” of the physicist DavidBohm.53 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber562] The French astronomer Laplace,mentioned earlier, shares credit with Immanuel Kant for developing the nebulatheory of solar and planetary formation, but Swedenborg may have anticipatedthem, and inspired Kant, who inspired Laplace.54[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber563] Swedenborg’s contributions to astronomy,ignored for years, were confirmed by his countryman, the Nobel Prize–winningphysicist and chemist Svante Arrhenius, in his book Emanuel Swedenborg as aCosmologist, published in 1908. Arrhenius was one of the first scientists toinvestigate the “greenhouse effect,” and he was an early advocate of“panspermia,” the notion that life came to Earth from outer space, an idea onceagain in the news.55 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber564] Swedenborg himselfbelieved in a very strong form of the “anthropic cosmological principle,”arguing not only that our universe is one in which intelligent life forms likeourselves must come into being; he believed that the universe existed in orderfor beings like ourselves to exist.56 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber565]Swedenborg made equally important discoveries about the brain, such as theexistence and importance of neurons, and the significance of the frontal lobesfor higher mental functions. He also recognized important differences betweenthe cerebral hemispheres and, as mentioned in Chapter One, he paid specialattention to the cerebellum, which, along with Stan Gooch, he believed played acrucial role in spiritual experiences.57 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber566]Swedenborg’s anatomical studies convinced him that the purely material andmechanical explanations for life were inadequate. Any serious attempt tounderstand its nature required understanding the soul. It was clear that lifehad its roots not in chemical reactions, but in the same unmanifest source that,he argued, lay behind the universe. As the Neoplatonists did, he saw the answerin a gradual descent from a purely spiritual origin to our own physical world.But where and how did the two meet? Where was “the seat of the soul”? This wasnot an unusual question. Descartes himself believed that it lay in the pinealgland, a mysterious organ within the brain whose function is still notcompletely understood, although its importance in the production of the aminoacid melatonin, necessary for the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin,is clear. For the ancient Hindus, the pineal gland was the location of the“third eye,” the “opening” of which led to visionary states. Swedenborg himselfwas interested in such states, and in the 1740s, during another stay in London,he made efforts to achieve them.COUNT ZINZENDORF, THE MORAVIANS, AND RABBI FALKIn 1744, Swedenborg returned to London. As Marsha Keith Schuchard suggests,Swedenborg’s trip may have involved an intelligence mission for the Jacobitecause, but what emerged was something else. Along with meeting scientists,Swedenborg became involved in the Fetter Lane congregation of the Moravians, thename Comenius’s Bohemian Brethren adopted after they came under the protectionof Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf. While a student, Zinzendorf started areligious society, the Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed, dedicated tospreading the message of the Gospels; some of its later members included thearchbishops of Canterbury and Paris and Christian VI, King of Denmark.58[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber567] During a visit to Dusseldorf, Zinzendorf had amystical experience looking at a painting of Christ.59[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber568] It depicted Jesus with his crown of thorns andit moved Zinzendorf powerfully. He had a sudden, vivid experience of the “fullyhuman” Christ, the opposite of the Gnostic Docetist view that saw Christ’s bodyas a phantom. Zinzendorf’s Christ was human, through and through, and forZinzendorf this included his sexuality. It became clear to the count that onlyby experiencing Christ’s full humanity could one be saved. This was theinspiration for Zinzendorf’s form of sexual spirituality, centered around thecrucified Christ.Deep meditation on Christ’s sexual organs, as well as his wounds, would,Zinzendorf believed, lead to spiritual experience. This meditation, however, wasnot limited to the inner world. In a form of Christian tantra, Zinzendorfpreached that the true Christian experience required the practice of ritualizedsex. Zinzendorf believed that for the truly faithful, “all the senses must bemobilized, the whole body must participate.”60 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber569]Zinzendorf believed in the Kabbalistic idea—also found in alchemy—that in sexualunion, male and female “repair” the rifts in the fallen world and achieve aunified, androgynous state.Zinzendorf believed that through the Kabbalah, Jews and Christians, Protestantsand Catholics could all come together, a vision of religious unity that occupiedmany at the time. Sexual climax echoed the original emanation of the sephirothout of the Godhead. For Kabbalists, God himself makes love to his Shekhinah, hisfemale emanation. Zinzendorf Christianized this erotic mysticism and saw theHoly Spirit as feminine; the product of her union with God was Christ. Alongwith Kabbalah, Zinzendorf was also influenced by the teachings of Sabbatai Zevi,the “false messiah,” who saved himself from decapitation by Sultan Mehmet IV in1666 by renouncing his messianic claims and converting to Islam. Many of Zevi’sfollowers abandoned his teaching after this ignominious retreat, yet others sawit as similar to Christ’s crucifixion, and embraced debasement and humiliationas ways to holiness. This “reversal” shared in the metaphysics of antinomianismand led to a form of “holy sinning,” different expressions of which we have comeacross in this book. “Holy sinning” means in effect that “anything goes,” andfor Zinzendorf that “anything” meant sacred sex. Along with visualizing Christ’sgenitals and seeing his wounds as a vagina—hence making him a cosmic androgyne,like the Kabbalistic Adam Kadmon—the Fetter Lane congregation often enjoyed“love feasts” that resulted in communal unification of the opposites.Swedenborg himself was deeply interested in the spiritual aspects of sex, astudy that he pursued well into his later years. In one of his last books,Conjugial Love, written in his eighties, Swedenborg says that in heaven angelsengage in mutually satisfactory and perpetual sex. Throughout his lifeSwedenborg kept mistresses—he remained a bachelor—and he advocated sex outsidemarriage. This was not a cover for licentiousness, but a recognition of theprofound link between sexuality, altered states of consciousness, andspirituality, something we have come across in the Fedeli d’Amore. Swedenborghimself practiced a form of erotic meditation that allowed him to maintain anerection and hover in the erotic trance for long periods.Along with worshipping with the Moravians in Fetter Lane, it seems likely thatSwedenborg met a fascinating, enigmatic figure during this visit to London.Rabbi Samuel Jacob Hayyim Falk was born into a Sabbatian community in Galicia(Poland) where he became known as a Ba’al Shem, a “Master of the Divine Name,” atitle given to practicing Kabbalists. He was almost burned as a heretic, andafter traveling through Europe, he arrived in London in 1742. He set up analchemical laboratory on London Bridge, and ran an esoteric school from hishouse in the East End. Falk seems to have been the magical magnet attracting adiverse group of esotericists: Rosicrucians, Freemasons, alchemists, Kabbalists,and Moravians.One of his students was Cagliostro, the colorful magician and healer who stormedacross Europe, spreading his own brand of Egyptian Freemasonry which, it issaid, was taught to him by the mysterious Comte de Saint-Germain. Reminiscingabout his years in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, W. B. Yeats spoke of“hidden superiors” from whom the order’s legitimacy derived, and some havesuspected that Falk may have been whom Yeats had in mind.61[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber570] Swedenborg seems to have been among thiscircle, and he was most likely introduced to Falk through one of the Moravians.Swedenborg learned different Kabbalistic eroto-spiritual meditations from Falk,and from all accounts these contributed to the crisis that changed Swedenborg’slife.ON THE WAY TO HEAVENBy the time Swedenborg met Falk, he had been practicing his breathing exercisesfor years. It seems he had also tried automatic writing and wanted, as had JohnDee, to communicate with angels. Something else Swedenborg practiced throughouthis life was a curious ability to hover in that strange state between sleepingand waking. This condition, known as “hypnagogia,” allows for a consciousexperience of the unconscious; Swedenborg shared this facility with other secretteachers, such as Rudolf Steiner and C. G. Jung.62[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber571] His breathing exercises, extended experiencesof hypnagogia, and Falk’s eroto-spiritual Kabbalistic meditations contributed toSwedenborg’s breakthrough into the spiritual worlds.In July 1744, Swedenborg seems to have had his “creative illness.” One day heentered a trance and became uncommunicative; the two “good Israelites” in theroom with him may have been Falk and an associate. The next day Swedenborg seemsto have had a mental breakdown. Like Sabbatai Zevi, he believed he was theMessiah and that he would be crucified. The following day, Swedenborg disrobed,rolled in the mud, and handed out money. He had already experienced a visitationby Christ. After hearing a thunderous boom and a great rush of wind, Swedenborgseems to have had an out-of-body experience, at the end of which he foundhimself face-to-face with Jesus. Soon after, Swedenborg abandoned his scientific“search for the soul” and devoted himself to the symbolic exegesis ofscripture—the “spiritual hermeneutics” of Henry Corbin—and his voyages to thespiritual worlds, heaven and hell.63 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber572] Hismultivolume work Arcana Coelistia contains Swedenborg’s “internal”interpretation of Genesis and Exodus.Swedenborg’s accounts of his journeys to heaven, hell, and the intermediaryrealm he called the “spirit world” are the most readable of his writings and arecollected in his book Heaven and Hell, a kind of Rough Guide to the afterlife.Here Swedenborg speaks of his own voyages in the Mundus Imaginalis, the ImaginalWorld that Suhrawardi entered several centuries before him. As we’ve seen,mystical or visionary experiences take on the symbols and expressions of theculture of the person having them. In Swedenborg’s case, these were Christian.But Swedenborg’s Christianity is esoteric and his interpretations of the angelicand devilish realms do not depend on faith or belief. Swedenborg himselfabhorred the Catholic Church and felt the Atonement was an insult to the dignityof man. Like Blake, Swedenborg’s Christianity is “man-centered.” His ultimatevision is of the Grand Man, the macrocosmic human, what he called the “humanface of God.”Swedenborg’s heaven is not unlike life on earth, except that time, space, andother physical constraints no longer apply; they are, Swedenborg tells us,“states” rather than physical realities, and what appears to us as sequentialand separate in heaven is simultaneous and unified—a distinction not unlike thatbetween left- and right-brain consciousness. His heaven is not filled withcherubs and harps, but with effort and work, what he calls “the active life.”64[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber573] Swedenborg’s hell seems as harrowing asDante’s. Insatiable desires, incessant bickering, and interminable darknesstorment its inhabitants. After death, one reaches either destination, Swedenborgtells us, by passing through the “spirit world,” a kind of bardo realm orpurgatory, where the truth about oneself unavoidably comes to light. Whatstrikes most modern readers about Swedenborg’s heaven and hell is that they arepsychological and spiritual states, and not places we go to. They exist here andnow; we enter them through our choices and decisions. Those interested ingrowing beyond themselves and in the work of the divine naturally enter heaven.Those who cling to the self and its desires are already in hell.Not all are taken with Swedenborg’s spiritual travelogue. Ralph Waldo Emerson,one of his readers, whose Transcendentalism is rich in Hermetic, Neoplatonic,and eastern ideas, said of Swedenborg’s hell that “a vampire sits in the seat ofthe prophet and turns with gloomy appetite to images of pain.”65[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber574] William Blake rejected Swedenborg’s neatdistinction between the angelic and devilish, and sought a “marriage of heavenand hell.” One idea emerging from Swedenborg’s work has had an undeniable impacton modern esotericism and culture at large. This is his doctrine of“correspondences.” Its essence is the recognition that there are direct linksbetween the heavenly and earthly worlds and that the phenomena of the physicalworld are a kind of symbol or “alphabet” of the higher ones. “The whole naturalworld corresponds to the spiritual world,” Swedenborg wrote, “not only thenatural world in general, but also in every particular.”66[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber575]As the Nobel Prize–winning writer Czeslaw Milosz—nephew of the mysticalSwedenborgian poet O. V. de Lubicz Milosz, friend of Schwaller de Lubicz—put it,“Swedenborg’s world is all language.”67 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber576] ForSwedenborg, one “reads” the world as one reads a book, and the language ofthings points to their spiritual source. Through reading the book of the worldand the scriptures symbolically, Swedenborg, like Joachim of Fiore, theRosicrucians, and others, came to see that humanity was on the brink of a newage, one sign of which was the “new church,” made up of spiritually akinminds—not mortar and bricks—that Swedenborg believed would come after him.Swedenborg’s “correspondences” grew beyond his use. One reader of Swedenborg wasthe nineteenth-century French poet Charles Baudelaire. While manyreaders—perhaps most—probably won’t avail themselves of Arcana Coelistia, theymay be aware of how Baudelaire used Swedenborg’s idea. In his poem“Correspondences,” Baudelaire takes Swedenborg’s idea and applies it to thehaunting, elusive resonances that link colors, scents, shapes, and sounds.“Nature is a temple,” Baudelaire tells us, through which we pass “symbolically.”Baudelaire’s poem creates an atmosphere of shifting forms and landscapes inwhich “perfumes and colors are mixed in strange profusions.” The effect is asense of “the strange expansion of things infinite,” the suggestion that thingsare something more than they seem, that some mystery envelops them, an aura ofpossibility, the analogical way of seeing the world that we have seen is linkedto a right-brain mode of consciousness. Swedenborg believed that in an earliertime the truth of correspondences was common knowledge, but that we have lost itbecause of our self-obsession, which suggests something like the loss of ourmore right-brain mode of consciousness.Baudelaire’s poem triggered a fascination with synesthesia, the strangecondition in which sensory modes blend, in which one hears colors and seessounds, and which suggests a unity behind phenomena. Perhaps the best-knownexample of this is Arthur Rimbaud’s poem “Vowels,” which ascribes differentcolors to the letters: A, black; E, white; I, red; O, blue; and U, green.68[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber577] Such associations harken back to theKabbalistic notion of an Adamic language (Boehme), a primal speech in which theunity between speaker and world is undefiled. The art movement that emerged fromthis, Symbolism, was responsible for some of the most important works of thelate nineteenth century, from the operas of Richard Wagner to the paintings ofGustave Moreau and Odilon Redon—both of whom were occult enthusiasts—and theintensely Hermetic poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. Along with the Modernism thatfollowed, Symbolism was saturated in occult, Hermetic, and esoteric ideas. Itshowed that the world was not the mechanical clockwork of the materialistscientist, but a forest of question marks, each suggesting some possible answerto the riddle of life. And Swedenborg was responsible for this.69[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber578]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENTHE ROMANTIC CENTURY[../image/153618.jpg]The years leading up to the French Revolution saw one of the most esotericallycharged periods in modern western history. As the Baroness d’Oberkirch, anobserver of high society at the time, remarked, “Never, certainly, wereRosicrucians, alchemists, prophets and everything related to them so numerousand so influential.”1 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber579] We may think we have amonopoly on such interests, as our insatiable curiosity about conspiracytheories, aliens, religious sects, gurus, and other exotic items suggests. Butthe period leading up to the rise of the guillotine also saw the birth of“popular occultism.” Not only was the popular press filled with stories thatwould suit our own tabloids, the literary genre of “occultism” finds its rootshere too.2 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber580]Probably the most influential work of this kind was the multivolumed Le Mondeprimitif (The Primal World) by the eccentric Court de Gébelin, which appeared in1773 and was an immediate best seller. Court de Gébelin was a Protestanttheologian with a passion for ancient languages, which he believed held the keyto what he called a lost, “primitive”—in the sense of original—science, whichhad become corrupted and debased over time. This form of the prisca theologiacould, he believed, be retrieved through a deep study of the earliest forms ofhuman speech. The encyclopedist and mathematician Jean le Rond d’Alembert wasone of Court de Gébelin’s readers, as was Louis XVI, and the popularity of LeMonde primitif proved so great that Court de Gébelin eventually built his ownmuseum, where he lectured to packed audiences. His most popular ideas were thoseabout the Tarot, and it is here that this enigmatic pack of playing cards makesits “occult” appearance.The Tarot deck had been in circulation since the Renaissance and its origins aremost likely found in the Neoplatonic and Hermetic influences of the time, whichwere expressed in images based on the ancient practice of “triumphs” orparades.3 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber581] But it was not until Court deGébelin that an Egyptian origin of the cards was proposed. Court de Gébelinargued that the Tarot came “out of Egypt,” and that it contained the lostknowledge of these mysterious people. Following Court de Gébelin was a curiouscharacter known as Alliette, who wrote under the pseudonym “Etteilla,” his namedspelled backward. Etteilla added that the Tarot, initially conceived by HermesTrismegistus, was created after the Flood, by a council of magi who spent manyyears on its design. Etteilla called it “the Book of Thoth,” a misnomer thatremains associated with the Tarot to this day. Etteilla seems to have been avery astute occult businessman; he sold talismans, held classes in practicalmagic, and, not surprisingly, gave Tarot readings.Another who promoted “popular occultism” was Antoine Fabre d’Olivet, whosemission was to synthesize every known fact, an expression, it seems, ofEnlightenment Pansophism. Like Court de Gébelin, Fabre d’Olivet studied ancientlanguages—Latin and Greek, as well as Arabic, Chaldee, Syrian, Samaritan, andChinese—and also plunged into the young discipline of Egyptology. Fabre d’Olivetbelieved that the ancient wisdom of Egypt was embedded in the Old Testament,specifically Genesis. This had suffered in translation and he sought to restorethe ancient Hebrew to its pristine origin. Like many we have come across in thisbook, Fabre d’Olivet believed that in its true state, the Bible needed to beunderstood on different levels and that in its most important sense it needed tobe read symbolically.LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND MESMERISMEsoteric ideas also fed the growing social tensions that would, in a few years,give way to revolution. One such influence was the work of the German scientistand healer Franz Anton Mesmer. Mesmer belongs to that select group of people whohave added to our vocabulary. The word “mesmerize” comes from him, but in thisMesmer has suffered an historical irony. For us “mesmerize” is a synonym for“hypnotize,” yet in reality the hypnosis that arose from Mesmer’s work hadnothing to do with it. It emerged from the recognition that Mesmer’s fundamentalidea was wrong. When treating one of his patients, the Marquis de Puységur, astudent of Mesmer, noticed something strange. The young man had fallen asleepbut when de Puységur tried to wake him, he couldn’t. He had entered a trance.When, exasperated, de Puységur shouted, “Stand up,” to his amazement his patientdid, but he remained asleep. De Puységur spoke to him and asked questions, allof which he answered while remaining unconscious. He seemed to be in a statesimilar to somnambulism, “sleep-walking.” When he finally did awake, he had nomemory of what had occurred. The marquis had accidentally discovered hypnosis,but the phenomena would not be named until 1843, when the Scottish physicianJames Braid coined the term.The exact mechanism of hypnosis remains obscure but the effect seems to be tonarrow consciousness down to a single point. Given that the person hypnotizedusually does not remember what has happened while he was in the trance, we canassume that what is narrowed down is our usual left-brain ego awareness. InFrankenstein’s Castle, Colin Wilson suggests that the remarkable abilitiespeople often display while under hypnosis may be rooted in the powers of theright brain. If this is the case, then we can see hypnosis as a means of puttingour left brain to sleep while the right remains awake and open to thesuggestions of the hypnotist.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber582]Mesmer is often called the discoverer of hypnosis, but what he actually believedwas that the universe was filled with an invisible vital energy which he called“animal magnetism,” “animal” in this sense meaning animated, living, or, inolder parlance, ensouled.5 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber583] This energypermeates the cosmos and connects everything with everything else. This unseenvital fluid is responsible for our health; illnesses are caused by blockages ofour animal magnetism, and the “mesmeric passes” that caused the Marquis dePuységur’s patient to fall into a trance were aimed at increasing thecirculation of animal magnetism within his body.It is not too difficult to see the similarities linking Mesmer’s animalmagnetism, the Neoplatonic “sympathy of all things,” and Marsilio Ficino’s ideasabout helpful and baleful stellar influences. We can also see that Mesmer’sideas about a “universal fluid” will inform Eliphas Levi’s thoughts on “astrallight,” what he calls the “universal agent,” which he links to the imaginationand which Madame Blavatsky will borrow from when speaking of the “Akashicrecord.” There are also clear resonances between Mesmer’s animal magnetism andthe “orgone energy” of Wilhelm Reich and the chi of traditional Chinesemedicine. Mesmer’s animal magnetism also bears a family resemblance to the “Odicforce” of Baron von Reichenbach—which would reappear in the twentieth century as“Kirlian photography”—and the “soul force” of Joseph Rodes Buchanan, associatedwith psychometry, the ability to psychically “read” the history of objects.Mesmer’s own links to the Hermetic and Paracelsian tradition are evident in hisdoctoral dissertation, “The Influence of the Planets on the Human Body” which hesubmitted in Vienna in 1768, a sign that the discredited esoteric view of manand the cosmos was still active. Mesmer was not an occultist—at least heconsidered himself a man of science—but in The Discovery of the Unconscious,Henri Ellenberger suggests that during his university days, Mesmer was supportedby secret societies.Early on in his practice, Mesmer used actual magnets, which seemed to encouragethe sluggish animal magnetism of his patients. He had a high success rate. Buthe soon came to see that he himself was a magnet; it was his own vital animalmagnetism that enlivened his patients. He married a wealthy Viennese widow andsoon became a popular patron of the arts, as well as a sought-after physician.He was friends with the composers Gluck and Haydn—both Masons—and knew theMozart family well.In 1778, Mesmer moved to Paris, encouraged by his success in Vienna, but also byone important failure, Maria Theresia Paradies, a young blind pianist whomMesmer claimed he could cure. Her parents allowed her to live with Mesmer, andMaria believed that his magnetic treatment worked. But many didn’t and theywondered why so many of Mesmer’s patients were young women and why certain partsof their bodies—such as their thighs and bosom—needed so many magnetic passes.An examination showed that, sadly, Maria’s sight had not improved, although sheherself believed it had. She was removed from Mesmer’s home, and when theViennese police intervened, Mesmer decided to leave Vienna.Paris was a strangely tense city. Mesmer’s haughty manner and powerfulpersonality served him well, and soon he began to repeat his early successes.Mesmer set up “magnetic baths” and devised a group treatment called banquetsthat allowed for several patients to be “mesmerized” simultaneously. There wasalso a great deal of what we might call “group therapy,” with patientsstimulating each other’s magnetism. The cure began with the “magnetic crisis,” akind of “mesmeric convulsion,” after which the clots in one’s magnetism wereunblocked and one’s natural, “primitive” health was restored. It was thefrequent dishabille of Mesmer’s female patients, and the orgasm-like fit of the“magnetic crisis” that soon had tongues wagging.As with Paracelsus, the medical establishment was not keen on Mesmer. Theythought his cures were fakes, his treatment quackery. And like Paracelsus,Mesmer was vain and arrogant. His downfall began when he was forced to submit toan investigation by the Academy of Sciences, the French equivalent of England’sRoyal Society; one of the committee’s members was Benjamin Franklin. Theyignored Mesmer’s successes—these were chalked up to hysterical patients and thepower of suggestion—and focused on Mesmer’s central claim: to have discovered anall-pervasive vital fluid. Not surprisingly, they found no evidence for this andbranded Mesmer a fraud. Mesmer became the target of abuse. His aristocraticclientele and superior manner were out of step with the Revolution, and he leftFrance. He continued to find patients and was able to retire comfortably butembittered near Lake Constance. He died in 1815.RADICAL SPIRITSMesmer had started “Societies of Harmony” around France, designed to spread hismessage of “natural health.” Like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose ideas about the“social contract” and “noble savage” helped fuel the Revolution, Mesmer believedthat health was man’s natural state, and it was only a corrupt society thatsickened him. Although he was not political and in fact courted royalty and thearistocracy, Mesmer’s ideas were absorbed by radicals wanting to bring theleisured class down. As today, they believed that vested interests prevented“the people” from gaining access to “miracle cures.” They argued that just as anindividual’s natural health and regeneration were triggered by the magneticcrisis, so too society must go through a similar crisis before its own healthcould be regained. A radical “getting back to nature” was envisioned, a returnto a pristine state of pure harmony.Some agents of harmony combined mesmerism with Swedenborg’s beliefs about theregeneration of man. Esoteric Freemasonry was often the linchpin uniting thetwo.6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber584] One group, the Order of Elect Cohens(“priest” in Hebrew) was led by the Swedenborgian, Rosicrucian, and FreemasonMartinez de Pasqually, who is believed to have been initiated by Baron Hund’s“unknown superiors.” They used theurgic means of prophecy, a method also used bythe group around the Benedictine Antoine-Joseph Pernety, who made contact with asupernatural entity he called “la chose,” “the thing.”Another group was led by Jean-Baptiste Willermoz, a Strict Observance Mason fromLyons, who had been initiated into the Elect Cohens. Willermoz was also a memberof one of Mesmer’s Societies of Harmony. When Pasqually died in 1774, Willermoztook his master’s theurgy and combined it with Mesmer’s ideas. He gathered agroup of women he called the crisiacs, who were peculiarly susceptible toWillermoz’s magnetic passes. In their “magnetic trance,” these modern-day sibylscommunicated gnomic messages from Swedenborg’s “spirit world.” Mostpronouncements concerned the coming new age and the return of the ancientwisdom—much like today’s “channelers”—but at times the communications were moreobscure. Willermoz would then call in one of the most important figures of thetime for help in deciphering the secret code.THE UNKNOWN PHILOSOPHERLike Willermoz, Louis Claude de Saint-Martin was a member of Pasqually’s ElectCohens. At first attracted to theurgy, he eventually abandoned it for a moremeditative, theosophical approach, influenced by Jacob Boehme, whom hetranslated into French. Saint-Martin had been initiated into Pasqually’s lodgewhile stationed in Bordeaux in 1767. From early childhood, the frailSaint-Martin was drawn to the mystic path and interior world, and he pursuedthis in an unusual way. With Europe at peace, he recognized that an armycommission would provide the time and independence needed for his studies, andhe remained a military magician with the rank of lieutenant until 1771.With Pasqually’s death, Saint-Martin began the series of writings for which heis known today. I say “known,” but for much of his career, Saint-Martin’sauthorship was obscure. He signed his mystical, philosophical works as “theUnknown Philosopher,” partly because of the uncertain climate of the time, butalso because of Saint-Martin’s association with several secret societies. InLyons, he became friends with Willermoz and frequented the city’s many esotericcircles. He was also friends with Mesmer’s disciple de Puységur. Saint-Martinjoined a Society of Harmony, but in the end he left, concerned that Mesmer’sfocus on a physical fluid was too materialistic and would attract the curiosityof dubious astral spirits.One astral spirit that troubled Saint-Martin had been called up by Willermoz’scrisiacs. This entity, which Willermoz called “the Unknown Agent,” had commandedhim to establish an esoteric group within his Rectified Scottish rite, anoutgrowth from Strict Observance which abandoned Baron Hund’s Templar roots inexchange for Pasqually’s theurgic slant. This new group would receive messagesfrom the Unknown Agent directly. Willermoz asked Saint-Martin for advice ondecoding these communications, yet something about these directives from beyonddisturbed Saint-Martin and he soon abandoned the attempt to decipher them.Saint-Martin’s vision, which he expressed in poetic, metaphysical works like OfErrors and Truth, The Man of Desire, The New Man, and The Spirit of Things, canbe summed up in his notion of “repair,” a metaphysical responsibility incumbentupon man that shares much with the practice of tikkun associated with theKabbalah of Isaac Luria.7 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber585] Saint-Martinrejected the rising mechanical view and its increasing diminution of man. Heshared Pico della Mirandola’s view that man was endowed with godlike potentialand Marsilio Ficino’s belief that through these powers man could “repair” thefallen world. This indeed was our responsibility and task. “The function of mandiffers from that of other physical beings,” Saint-Martin wrote, “for it is thereparation of the disorders in the universe.”8 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber586]Saint-Martin believed that behind our humble recognition that the Earth was nolonger the center of the universe lay diffidence and laziness. He believed that“the present-day avoidance of the belief that we are the highest in the universeis the reason that we have not the courage to work in order to justify thattitle.” Such duties are too laborious and we would rather, he said, “abdicateour position and our rights than realize them in all their consequences.”9[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber587]Saint-Martin recognized that man was a sleeping god, a spiritual giant afflictedwith amnesia, and his job was to sound as clear and persuasive a wake-up call aspossible. In this he was a herald of Romanticism, the sudden awakening of man’simaginative powers that characterized the new century. For some yet unknownreason, the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw what we can onlycall an explosion of imaginative energy, a widespread recognition of the vastinner spaces that Petrarch had briefly glimpsed from the vantage point of MountVentoux. Across Europe, artists, poets, musicians, and philosophers weresuddenly ablaze with a godlike and often demonic energy, an expression of the“superhumanism” we saw in Pico della Mirandola. Often this was triggered by aninterest in the occult and esoteric, a development I chart in my book A DarkMuse.Saint-Martin’s work was an attempt to halt the spread of the “only humanism”that, by our own time, has become the unquestioned assessment of ourselves.Saint-Martin’s books provide sudden flashes of insight into what by the 1960swould be called “human potential,” the recognition that lying dormant deepwithin us are “vestiges of the faculties resident in the Agent” which producedus—in other words, the divine. With Paracelsus, Saint-Martin knew that the keyto awakening these latent abilities was the imagination. He knew that althoughthe soul leaves the body at death, yet “during life, the faculties may extendbeyond it, and communicate with their exterior correspondents without ceasing tobe united to their center.”10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber588] Like Plato,Plotinus, and others, Saint-Martin knew that we are something more than ourphysical shells. This was a vision that would set Europe afire in what we cansee as the Romantic century.BLAKE AND COLERIDGEMuch of Saint-Martin’s vision was shared by his younger contemporary WilliamBlake. It is even possible that they met. In 1783, the Reverend Jacob Duché,ex-chaplain to the Continental Congress, founded the London TheosophicalSociety, a radical Swedenborgian group that also studied the works of JacobBoehme. Along with other esoterically inclined individuals—such as the painterPhilip de Loutherbourg and the Swedish alchemist Augustus Nordenskjold—one ofits members was Blake. In 1787, Saint-Martin visited the group, along withCagliostro, who was a friend of de Loutherbourg and who often stayed at his homein Hammersmith. For all his bad reputation—most of it unearned—Cagliostro was asincere student of Hermeticism and a devoted Mason and he would have hadsympathy with Saint-Martin’s doctrine of “repair.” It is unknown if Blake wasthere during their visit; if so, it would have been an interesting evening.Blake is usually seen as a naïve natural mystic, responsible for childlike workslike the Songs of Innocence, and for visionary insights about seeing a “world ina grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower,” which have by now sadly becomeclichés. Or he is seen as a raving madman, producing wild, ecstatic paintingsand incomprehensible epic poems centered around his unwieldy personal mythology.Both of these pictures of Blake are false.Although Blake did have visions early on—his father once beat him for talkingabout angels in a tree—he was not unschooled and his later visionary works arenot, as some Jungians have suggested, spontaneous expressions of the archetypes.As the poet and Blake scholar Kathleen Raine has argued, Blake was a student ofthe esoteric tradition, and his immense body of work is best understood as hisown synthesis and expression of the “perennial philosophy”: one of his poems isentitled “The Everlasting Gospel.” We have seen that Blake, like Boehme, whom hestudied, had a deep intuition about the ongoing creative tension between ouropposing modes of consciousness, and an uncanny insight into our “fallen state”of left-brain dominance, which he depicted as the tyranny of Urizen, the symbolof reason and the limiting of energy, and opponent of his contrary, theimagination.11 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber589] Imagination was all for Blake.“This world of Imagination is the World of Eternity; it is the Divine bosom intowhich we shall all go after the death of the Vegetated body.” “There exist inthat Eternal World the Permanent Realities of Every Thing which we see reflectedin the Vegetable Glass of Nature.”12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber590] Blake sawas his task the “mental fight” that would free man from the chains of theencroaching materialist view. He labored to cleanse the “doors of perception”and “open the immortal eyes of man Inwards, into the worlds of thought, intoEternity, Ever expanding in the Bosom of God, The Human Imagination”(Jerusalem).Although Blake wrote of wildflowers and grains of sand, he was not a “naturepoet,” as was William Wordsworth, with whom he took argument. With Saint-Martin,the Gnostics, and many others, Blake believed man had fallen from his originalspiritual state into this dense, difficult world of matter, what he called “theland of Ulro,” and the “dark Satanic mills” (Milton), which are usually seen assymbols of the Industrial Revolution, were for Blake the “starry wheels” of theNewtonian clockwork universe. For Blake, the land of Ulro congealed around men’sminds when they lost touch with their true being, which was the imagination,which Blake saw as the essence of Jesus’s teaching. He called Jesus “theImagination” and said that he “was all virtue and acted from impulse not fromrules,” a sensibility shared by many who sought a more immediate spiritual life,and not one bordered by dogma.Blake saw the imagination as the primary force behind creation, an insightshared by his younger contemporary, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, one of the Romanticpoets who carried on Blake’s “mental fight.” In his Biographia Literaria,Coleridge distinguishes between imagination and fancy in a way that later“spiritual hermeneuts” like Henry Corbin would applaud. “Primary” imaginationColeridge held to be “the living power and prime agent of all human perception.”It was a “repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in theinfinite I AM.” Fancy, Coleridge saw, as a rearranging of things alreadycreated. It is “no other than a mode of memory” which receives “all its materialready-made from the law of association.” In between these, Coleridge placed whathe called “secondary imagination,” the creative imagination of the artist, poet,and thinker, which echoes the primary imagination of the “infinite I AM.”Secondary imagination creates just as the primary imagination does, but on alower level; fancy does not create, but only “plays” with what is alreadycreated.13 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber591] Unicorns or flying pigs arefanciful, but Blake’s apocalyptic paintings are works of creative imagination.We see here the difference between daydreams and creative insight, as well asthat between what Paracelsus called “true imagination” and whimsy.Coleridge was also, like Blake, profoundly aware that “the essential duality ofNature arises out of its productive unity.” This is a more abstract way ofexpressing Blake’s dictum that “Without Contraries there is no Progression.”Like Blake—and Boehme, whom he read—Coleridge saw that this duality, or in histerm, “polarity,” was organic. The mechanistic philosophy, which by themid-nineteenth century could more or less claim victory, Coleridge saw as anatomistic mosaic, “the relations of unproductive particles to each other.” LikeBlake, for Coleridge this was a “philosophy of Death” and held good only for“dead nature.” All life, however, he knew consists in the “strife of opposites,”in their uniting and separating to form new unities and divisions, what hecalled their “polar tension.”14 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber592] Coleridgeappreciated Blake’s insights and developed his own; both drew on the reservoirof symbols and intuitions that make up what Kathleen Raine called the “learningof the imagination,” the universal tradition housed in our minds.THOMAS TAYLOROne secret teacher who tutored Blake and Coleridge and many poets after them wasthe “English Platonist” Thomas Taylor. Taylor produced the first Englishtranslations of the complete works of Plato and Aristotle, as well as manytranslations of Plotinus, Proclus, and “the divine Iamblichus.” Taylor alsowrote important essays on the Orphic tradition and the use of Orphic mythologyby the Neoplatonists. During his lifetime, Taylor’s work was criticized orignored by the literary and philosophical mainstream but it was read avidly bymany of the most important figures in English literature: along with Blake andColeridge, these included Shelley, Keats, Yeats, as well as Yeats’s friend themystic poet “AE” (George Russell). Taylor’s worked crossed the Atlantic andinformed Ralph Waldo Emerson and his fellow Transcendentalists; in his bookRepresentative Men, Emerson ranked Taylor among “the Immortals” andappropriately placed him next to Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. Inreading Taylor’s work, Emerson said, one encounters “the majestic remains ofliterature,” as if one was “walking in the noblest of temples.” He was “a betterman of imagination, a better poet, than any English writer between Milton andWordsworth.” Other important figures in esoteric history who spoke highly ofTaylor were H. P. Blavatsky; her secretary, the Gnostic and Hermetic scholar G.R. S. Mead; and the esoteric encyclopaedist Manly P. Hall. Another of Taylor’sreaders was Mary Ann South.15 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber593]According to John Livingston Lowes in his classic study The Road to Xanadu,Taylor was one of Coleridge’s “darling studies,” and his translations fired thepoet’s imagination and inspired signature Romantic works like “The Rime of theAncient Mariner” and “Kubla Khan.” “Thomas Taylor, the Platonist” Lowes wrote,“fired with the ardour of a devotee, was doing for England what Marsilio Ficino,three centuries before, had done for Italy.”16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber594]A one-man Platonic Academy, Taylor made available the perennial philosophywhich, for him, was “coeval with the universe itself; and however its continuitymay be broken by opposing systems, it will make its appearance at differentperiods of time, as long as the sun himself shall continue to illumine theworld.”17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber595] Taylor was also an early advocate ofanimal rights. Following Thomas Paine’s The Rights of Man and MaryWollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Women, in 1792, Taylor publishedunder a pseudonym A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes, which argued thatanimals deserved the same treatment as humans, well in advance of today’s“biocentricism.”18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber596]One appearance the perennial philosophy made, as Kathleen Raine has shown, wasas an inspiration for the Romantic movement in England. It is no exaggeration tosay that for Raine, English Romanticism is Neoplatonism, in symbol, imagery, andaim, and that Taylor was the source. I am not sure if it is still taughttoday—it is a sad sign of the times if it is not—but one of the earliest poems Ilearned in school was Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan,” with its haunting images of a“stately pleasure dome,” “Alph, the sacred river,” and the “damsel with adulcimer.” I did not know at the time, nor do many realize today, that theseimages and the rest of Coleridge’s strange dream landscape were born from hisreading of Taylor’s translations. In a “wish list” Coleridge wrote to a friendshortly before writing the poem, he asked for copies of Taylor’s translations ofIamblichus, Proclus, and Porphyry (he also asks for a work by Ficino).19[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber597] The “caverns measureless to man,” “sunlessseas,” and “caves of ice” that evoke a strange nostalgia for somewhere we havenever been and stimulate a thirst for the beyond are, according to Raine,memories of our past existence in the spiritual realms, symbols of that“learning of the imagination” that, in different ways, informed the work ofDante, Suhrawardi, Plato, and other inner voyagers.Taylor was born in London in 1758, the son of a Dissenting minister. He wouldhave become a minister himself, except for an unacceptable marriage, which madehim the black sheep of his family and forced him out on his own. He abandonedhis religious studies—he would soon display his lack of sympathy with thechurch—and had to fend for himself. Most of Taylor’s life was lived in poverty.He early on showed a great love of mathematics, but his interest in it wasPythagorean, and although for much of his adult life he worked as a banker, hisattraction to numbers was more mystical than calculative. He suffered poorhealth, was quiet, earnest, and somewhat dreamy. At one point he invented whathe called a “perpetual light” that used phosphorus. Taylor may have dreamed thatthis eternal flame would lead to riches and fame; unfortunately, whiledemonstrating his invention at Freemason’s Hall, it exploded and nearly caused afire.He had a talent for languages and a powerful memory. It is said that he and hiswife conversed only in ancient Greek and it was in his early twenties that hefirst encountered Plato. He was soon enthralled and it was while reading Proclusthat Taylor had a mystical experience. It affected him so much that he named hisson after the philosopher. Like the Hermetists he was translating, Taylorbelieved that one can only know the divine by becoming it, and at least once inhis life he did. He spoke little about his experience but did record a“perpetual serenity, unceasing delight, and occasional rapture.” One effect ofhis illumination was that his soul would “spontaneously utter musicalsounds”—much as lyrical poets like Keats, whom he influenced, did—whichindicated an “inner harmony,” “echoes of the perpetual felicity she enjoys.”20[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber598]Taylor was saved from the dreary life of a bank clerk by being invited to give aseries of lectures on Plato at the house of the successful artist and friend ofBlake, John Flaxman. Many of the intelligentsia of the time attended, andFlaxman and his friends were able to secure Taylor a position with the Societyfor the Encouragement of the Arts (later the Royal Society of the Arts). It wasat these lectures that Taylor met Blake. The two became friends and Blake soonsat, at least for a time, at Taylor’s feet. Taylor told Blake that the ancientswrote obscurely, in myths and arcane symbols, and that they needed to be readand deciphered in order to reach their true meaning. Blake listened to Taylor,absorbing the Neoplatonic philosophy that, along with the Gnostics, Boehme,Swedenborg, Paracelsus, and alchemy—and of course the Bible and his ownvisions—Blake would transform into his own unique mythology. In England today,Blake’s poetry, set to music by Sir Hubert Parry, forms the patriotic hymn“Jerusalem”; few who appreciate it realize they are responding to Blake’sesoteric vision.Taylor spoke of Orpheus, Hermes, Zoroaster, and the prisca sapientia, the“primal wisdom” of the ancients, much as Marsilio Ficino had to Renaissanceartists, and it is interesting to note that in his paintings, Blake tendedtoward Michelangelesque figures. Blake, however, had a more prophetic thanphilosophical temperament and his spiritual homeland was more Jerusalem thanAthens or Alexandria. At one point, he submitted to learning mathematics fromTaylor but soon gave it up, deciding that God was not so much a geometer as anartist. Blake’s antipathy to measure and what he called “ratio” and its stiflingcircumference of the free imagination was embodied in his painting of Newton,which shows him at the bottom of the sea—water is a Neoplatonic symbol of“matter,” formless without the animating soul—armed with a compass, capturingthe vital continuity of life in neat geometric patterns.GOETHEThe Romantics did not know, as we do, that Newton was as much an esotericist asBlake. Another who took argument with Newton’s mechanizing of reality wasBlake’s older contemporary, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Germany’s greatest poetand one of the chief architects of the Romantic movement. It is said that hisearly work, The Sorrows of Young Werther, written when he was twenty-five,taught Europe how to cry. It also made Goethe an overnight success, somethingBlake, who labored in obscurity, never had.Goethe was not a visionary and his work is not prophetic. He is much more urbaneand classical, and his most famous work, the archetypal magical cautionary tale,Faust, is filled with an often caustic wit. Where Blake thundered against“single vision and Newton’s sleep”—induced by the landscape of Ulro—anddeveloped a complex gnostic mythology to replace it, Goethe had a more measuredresponse to the limitations of Newtonian science.21[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber599] He also had the supreme self-confidence thatcomes with the knowledge of one’s genius. Goethe decided to beat Newton at hisown game, and his Farbenlehre, or Theory of Colors, is his riposte to Newton’sOpticks.Goethe has been called the “last universal man,” a tribute to the breadth anddepth of his interest and accomplishments. He was a Pansophist, “the last manwho grasped everything thought to be significant in the realm of knowledge: theseveral arts and their histories, medicine, law, literature, classical culture,the sciences, philosophy.”22 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber600] Goethe believedNewton had reached his conclusions about color through “torturing” nature andrejected them. For Goethe color was really a product of the “polarity” betweenlight and dark.23 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber601]Goethe also was an early evolutionist. For the popular mind, Charles Darwin“discovered” evolution in the mid-nineteenth century, but there were manyevolutionary thinkers before him, and Goethe was one of them. Goethe’s greatestevolutionary triumph came in 1784, with his discovery of the intermaxillary bonein humans, which linked us to other mammals, a revolutionary idea at the time.Some see “Goethean science” as “analogy run wild,” but it has increasinglyproved more than a poet’s fancy and has informed recent developments such aschaos theory and complexity.24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber602]Goethe’s evolutionary ideas came from what he saw as nature’s “transformative”character, its constant growth and metamorphosis, which Goethe believed was thework of an animating spirit, much like the Anima mundi, and not the result ofrandom mutations or “survival of the fittest.” Goethe’s beliefs, and indeed allof his scientific pursuits, were influenced by his interest in alchemy andHermeticism.25 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber603] As a young man, he wasintroduced to alchemical ideas by his spiritual mentor, the Pietist Fräulein vonKlettenberg, a follower of Count Zinzendorf, who gave him Paracelsus, BasilValentine, J. B. van Helmont, and George Starkey to read.Goethe also profited by some alchemical medicine. At one point, he had a nervousbreakdown and was treated for it by a mysterious Dr. Metz. Metz spoke of a“universal medicine” and the Kabbalistic and Hermetic texts that showed how toprepare it. Whatever Dr. Metz’s miracle cure was, it worked. “The salt wasscarcely taken,” Goethe wrote, “than my situation appeared relieved; and fromthat moment the disease took a turn which, by degrees, led to my recovery.”26[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber604] Goethe later set up an alchemical laboratoryin his parents’ house. Here he tried to make “liquor silicum,” melting quartzflint with a mixture of alkali. This should have produced a transparent glass,which Goethe intended to use as his prima materia, but after many attempts headmitted he had failed.Goethe devoured Boehme, Swedenborg, Thomas Vaughan, and the Corpus Hermeticum,and he became particularly fascinated with the Rosicrucian manifestoes. As itwas for the “invisibles,” the rose and the cross was a powerful symbol forGoethe, an emblem of the unification of the opposites, and he began a poem, “DieGeheimnisse” (“The Mysteries”), about the brotherhood but left it unfinished. Areading of Andreae’s Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz inspired Goethe’sown enigmatic alchemical fable, The Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and theBeautiful Lily, which would have a profound effect on Rudolf Steiner.ACTIVE SEEINGAnother aspect of Goethe’s work which had a great impact on Steiner, and whichputs him in the tradition of Imaginal thinkers such as Suhrawardi, Paracelsus,and Henry Corbin, are his studies in plant “morphology”—a term, incidentally,that he coined. These are contained in his book The Metamorphosis of Plants,published in 1790. Goethe was at the height of his fame, but his ideas were sostrange that his usual publisher wouldn’t accept the work.27[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber605] Goethe argued that all existing plants hadtheir roots in a common ancestor, what he called the Urpflanze or “primalplant,” a kind of botanical Platonic Form, and that all the organs of plantswere modifications of one structure, the leaf. Goethe believed that he couldactually see his Urpflanze with his imagination, which, like Suhrawardi andother Imaginal thinkers, Goethe believed was an organ of knowing. Goethe came tothis discovery during an early morning visit to Palermo’s botanical gardens,recounted in his Italian Journey.28 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber606] He foundhis thoughts returning to an “old fancy,” and looking at the variety of plants,Goethe asked, “Among this multitude might I not discover the Primal Plant? Therecertainly must be one. Otherwise, how could I recognize that this or that formwas a plant if all were not built upon the same basic model?” From thismeditation, Goethe’s ideas blossomed into a full-grown theory of knowledge basedon what he called “active seeing,” a way of observing phenomena by imaginativelyparticipating with them, a form of “direct perception.”Goethe’s “active seeing” was a means of putting himself inside what he wasobserving, as Schwaller de Lubicz’s “intelligence of the heart” put him inside arock or a bird. It was, we can say, a form of right-brain consciousness, orrather a combination of right and left. Well in advance of Werner Heisenberg,Goethe had hit on the fundamental insight that “The phenomenon is not detachedfrom the observer, but intertwined and involved with him.”29[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber607] We do not observe the world from behind aplate-glass window. We are “in” it, and the kind of attention we direct at itdetermines the kind of world we see. Goethe observed this phenomenon, not withthe cold detachment of the mechanical scientist, but with the warmth andinvolvement of the artist. He was “involved” in what he observed, and thatinvolvement was key. Truth for Goethe was not reached by treating nature as amachine. It was “a revelation emerging at the point where the inner world of manmeets external reality . . . It is a synthesis of world and mind,” somethingParacelsus and others knew and which today, after a century of quantum physics,we may be just beginning to understand.30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber608]This is an essential insight and bears repeating. Truth for the modern scientistis, as in The X-Files, “out there” in the “objective” world, and ourconsciousness merely reflects it as a mirror would. In more recent times,developments like postmodernism and deconstructionism deny any “objective”truth—some go so far as to deny any “objective” world—and consider allpronouncements about it “subjective” and relative, although how they account forthe supposed truth of their own statements escapes me. Goethe is saying thattruth, reality, knowledge—all are aspects of the same thing—are not simply “outthere,” nor are they only “in here,” but they arise from the meeting of theinner and the outer, from the polarity of both. “There resides in the objectiveworld,” Goethe wrote, “an unknown law which corresponds to the unknown lawwithin subjective experience.”31 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber609]“Meaning,” then, is not only subjective, “inside our heads.” There is real,“objective” meaning in the world, but we only “access” it by our activeengagement with it, not by passively reflecting it. If we think of a book, thismay become clearer. The “meaning” of a book is in its words, sentences,paragraphs, and chapters. It is “really” there, in black and white. But unless Iread it, that meaning remains mute. Reading is more than my simply looking atthe pages and reflecting them, as a mirror would. I have to make the mentaleffort of absorbing the words, connecting them, and assimilating them to myexperience. The meaning isn’t something I make up arbitrarily. It isn’t“subjective” in that sense, but in order for it to emerge, I have to meet ithalfway. I have to direct a certain energy and focus to it, what the philosopherEdmund Husserl called “intentionality.” Without this, I can read a page severaltimes without grasping what it says. We all have had the experience of lookingat our watch to see the time and forgetting it immediately after. We saw thewatch, we “reflected” it, but we did not “actively see” it; not enough ofourselves was in the act of seeing to grasp the time. Goethe is saying the sameabout the world. There is meaning in phenomena, but unless we direct the samekind of attention to them as we do to reading a book, we won’t see it. The kindof science that sees the world as a machine is like someone looking at a bookand saying it is made of paper and squiggles of ink. It is, but that is not allit is. Goethe’s “active seeing” is a way of reading the world, of getting pastits squiggles and ink—the matter of which it is made—to its meaning.NOVALISGoethe’s approach to understanding the world as a living spirit was shared byhis younger contemporary Friedrich von Hardenberg, whose works, most of whichappeared after his death, were published under the pen name Novalis. Novalis wasthe archetypal Romantic. He died from tuberculosis—“consumption”—in 1801 at theage of twenty-eight, and if there is one Romantic symbol that captures theessence of Sehnsucht, it is the elusive “blue flower” of Novalis’s unfinishednovel, Heinrich von Ofterdingen.Like his remark that “all philosophy is homesickness,” Novalis’s blue flowersymbolizes the feeling that the earth is not our true home, and that we havearrived here from “somewhere else.” But like Goethe, Novalis was more than apoet, and for all his homesickness, he had a deep love of the earth. In hisshort life, Novalis attempted, like Goethe, to encompass the whole world, andaddressed himself to mathematics—something Goethe and Blake hated—chemistry,mineralogy, geology, physics, politics as well as Plato, Pythagoras, and theNeoplatonists. In this he embodied the Hermetic, Pansophic ideal of a trulyglobal knowledge, a pursuit captured in his aphorism “The genuine poet isall-knowing—he is an actual world in miniature.”32[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber610] This vision of a macrocosmic/microcosmic unityinforms all of Novalis’s work and is voiced again and again throughout it. Wecan see it in other aphorisms, such as “We will come to understand the worldwhen we understand ourselves,” and “Man is a sun and his senses are planets.”33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber611]Like Goethe and Meister Eckhart, Novalis was no retiring mystic, but an ableadministrator. Like Swedenborg, he was appointed an assessor of mines, and thisposition allowed him to combine his interest in mineralogy with alchemicalreflections on the forces of growth within the earth. By his early twenties, hebecame well-known and gathered around himself some of the most influentialthinkers and writers of the time: the philosophers Friedrich Schlegel, JohannGottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Schelling; his fellow poet Ludwig Tieck; and, onoccasion, even the Olympian Goethe. These kindred spirits Novalis called the“Friends in the Night,” the band of fellow seekers with whom he shared the questfor universal knowledge.Like Blake, Goethe, and Coleridge, Novalis saw the world as a unity of polarforces and the creative tension between them, and he recognized that the humanmind had a unique role in bringing them into life. “The brains,” he wrote, “thethinking organs—are the world producers—nature’s genitals.”34[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber612] He planned a vast encyclopedia that wouldembrace his wide, Pansophic view. It was never completed and remains, as much ofNovalis’s work does, in fragments. But each fragment is a spur to furtherthinking and meditation, and Novalis looked at his aphorisms as “pollen,” seedssent out to impregnate other minds.As the Neoplatonists did, Novalis sees the world as a gradation ofconsciousness, as increasing or decreasing levels of spirit. Man’s task was tounite the levels, to join nature and spirit and thereby become God, as theancient Hermetists believed. This is the alchemical work of spiritualtransformation which will regenerate the earth just as it does man. As afragment of his Encyclopedia has it, “Paradise is strewn over the earth—andtherein has become unknown. Its scattered lineaments are bound to coalesce—itsskeleton is bound to become enfleshed. Regeneration of paradise.”35[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber613] Here Novalis shares with Saint-Martin andBlake a sense of man’s—our—great responsibility, our task of awakening ourselvesso that the world too may be awakened.NATURPHILOSOPHIEA similar sensibility informed what was known as Naturphilosophie, an earlynineteenth-century philosophical and scientific movement practically forgottentoday, that shared much with Romanticism and took its cue from Goethe’s ideasabout a “living” nature. Where the increasingly dominant mechanical view saw theworld as a collection of atomistic bits, pushed and pulled by physical forcesand subject to strict causality, Naturphilosophie saw the world as an expressionof spirit, as, in Goethe’s words, “God’s living raiment.” In different ways thedifferent thinkers associated with this school—G. H. Schubert, FriedrichSchelling, Carl Gustav Carus, Alexander von Humboldt, Franz von Baader—allsought to express the essential unity of nature and spirit, of the inner andouter worlds. Unlike the mechanistic view, which sees the two as absolutelyseparate, with a material, causal world as primary, and our consciousness of itan accidental development, Naturphilosophie saw the world and our consciousnessof it as a unity, as two sides of one ever-growing, ever-differentiating “life,”ranging from inanimate matter to our thoughts.Rather than being driven by causal forces, this “living nature” had its ownteleology. It was purposive and was moving toward something, rather than beingblindly pushed from behind. For the Naturphilosophen, nature “was steadilytransformed from a simpler, less organized, earlier state to a higher, moredeveloped, later state,” which sounds rather like the fundamental aim ofalchemy.36 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber614] Nature’s aim was total expression,and the diversity of nature was the product of the polarity between nature’surge to manifest and the “restraints” to which it subjects itself. The physicalforces of electricity and magnetism, studied by many Romantics—Percy ByssheShelley was a keen student, and Frankenstein, written by his wife Mary Shelley,is based on the idea of electricity as the source of life—were an expression ofthe polarity through which nature differentiates itself. As in Boehme, whoseideas informed much of Naturphilosophie, this results in a much more “dramaticuniverse,” filled with tension and growth, rather than a mechanical one, filledwith law and repetition.It also results in a much more symbolic nature, one that is more like a work ofart than a machine, or like a person with whom we have a relationship. As didPansophy, Naturphilosophie did not see itself as an alternative to mechanicalscience, but as its complement. It provided a way of “reading” nature, ofdeciphering its text and metaphors, its correspondences with our inner world.As Antoine Faivre writes, for Naturphilosophie the world is full of “symbolicimplications” and “invisible processes” that correspond to human feelings. Sofor Faivre, as for Novalis, “knowledge of Nature and knowledge of oneself gohand in hand.”37 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber615] Man, for Naturphilosophie,was not one accidental creature among others, but nature’s most recent andsuccessful attempt to produce a being that could understand itself; that is, manis nature’s attempt to become self-conscious. And just as nature resides in us,we, the human, reside in nature. We share with it certain basic patterns,certain archetypes, that can be found in different but similar manifestationsthroughout its variety.It was the recognition of these patterns that led Goethe to believe that withhis Urpflanze he had reached the source of all possible plants. In a letter tothe philosopher and poet Johann Gottfried Herder, Goethe said that with the aidof his “primal plant,” “one can then invent further plants ad infinitum, which,however, must be consistent.” They would be plants that could exist, not“shadows or glosses of the poet’s or painter’s fancy,” but ones that “possess aninherent rightness and necessity.”38 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber616] Hereagain is the difference between Coleridge’s “primary imagination” and merefancy. Nature is not some infinitely plastic stuff that, subjected to externallaws and the mechanical forces of causality, can be made to take any shape wechoose, that can be, as Bacon advised, “tortured” into delivering the desiredresults. She manifests according to her own inner necessities, which the poet,scientist, artist, and philosopher can grasp through understanding the samenecessity within themselves, the “unknown law” in the subjective world aligningwith the same law in the objective one.THE NIGHT SIDE OF NATUREAnother aspect of nature that occupied Naturphilosophie was what came to becalled its “night side,” and what we would call the “paranormal,” the darker,mysterious operations of the human mind. G. H. Schubert was a physician andnaturalist with an interest in “animal magnetism” and other unusual phenomena,such as clairvoyance and prophetic dreams. His book Symbolism of Dreams,published in 1814, was a huge success and was later read by Freud and Jung. Likehis fellow Naturphilosophen, Schubert saw God in both nature and the human soul,and he was fascinated by the strange powers of what would soon be called “theunconscious.” His book Views from the Nightside of Natural Science (1808) was apowerful influence on the Romantics, especially E. T. A. Hoffmann, the writerand music critic—an early champion of Beethoven—whose short stories deal withvisions, trance states, dreams, and other strange mental phenomena.Hoffmann is most known today in English-speaking countries for Offenbach’s lightopera Tales of Hoffmann and Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker, but he is amore psychologically disturbing writer than these works suggest; his stories andnovels, full of esoteric references and “altered states of consciousness,” readlike a meeting between Edgar Allan Poe and Hans Christian Andersen. OtherNaturphilosophen like Joseph Ennemoser, a mesmerist whose work would influenceMadame Blavatsky and Adam Karl von Eschenmayer, another “animal magnetism”enthusiast, shared Schubert’s interest in nature’s night side.The most popular book on the subject was The Seeress of Prevorst, by the poet,physician, and friend of Goethe, Justinus Kerner, which became a success in1829. It tells the story of a remarkable psychic. Kerner was consulted byrelatives of a woman named Friederike Hauffe, from the town of Prevorst, who wassuffering from a wasting disease (one suspects tuberculosis). She was alsosubject to frequent trance states in which she saw spirits of the dead. Kerner’sinvestigation revealed that Friederike was capable of much more. She was able topredict the future and could see into the human body and accurately diagnosediseases, a talent the twentieth-century psychic and prophet Edgar Cayce laterdisplayed. Friederike could also read through her stomach; when Kernerblindfolded her and placed manuscripts on her midriff, she could read themperfectly. She told Kerner that her spirit could leave her body. She also toldhim that if he put her in a “magnetic trance,” the spirits would tell her whattreatment he should give her. While in her trance, she displayed clairvoyanceand related information given to her by the spirits that proved accurate.Friederike also produced the knocks, raps, and other sounds associated with“poltergeists”—a German term meaning “noisy spirits”—and was able to levitateobjects. She produced a complete and complex “spiritual teaching” and spoke ofan ancient “universal language” that was spoken in the “inner world.” Thesephenomena drained Friederike’s energies, and three years after meeting Kerner,she died.39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber617]In 1845, The Seeress of Prevorst was translated into English by Catherine Crowe,a British author of children’s stories and popular novels, and became a hugesuccess. In her day, Crowe was a well-known figure and counted among heracquaintances Charles Dickens and Charlotte Brontë. She was also interested in“altered states of consciousness”; in his memoirs, Hans Christian Andersen tellsof seeing her inhaling ether at a party in Edinburgh.40[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber618] Crowe had an interest in psychic phenomena,and many of her stories deal with supernatural themes. She was a reader ofNaturphilosophie and the German Romantics. Although Coleridge had a taste forthe supernatural, as did his friend Thomas De Quincey, Germany was seen as theland of ghosts, visions, and strange phenomena. In 1849, Crowe produced her ownbook on the subject, The Night-Side of Nature; another success, this became hermost popular work, staying in print for more than a century. It was also thefirst real attempt to treat the paranormal scientifically, predating the Societyfor Psychical Research by more than thirty years.Although by today’s standards Crowe’s work would not be considered“scientific”—her accounts are anecdotal for the most part—their sheer number areenough to convince an open-minded reader of the reality of her subject. Sheranges over dreams, precognition, doppelgängers, apparitions, spirits, ghosts,poltergeists, mesmerism, and much more with a patient, insightful, and criticalmind; her still readable book remains one of the few sources in English forinsight into “abnormal psychology” in the days before Freud. Throughout her bookshe refers to theurgy and the Neoplatonists, and her central idea is what shecalls “the dweller in the temple”—the soul—which, when released from theconstraints of the body, enjoys what she calls “spiritual seeing, or intuitiveknowing.” She speaks of “one universal sense, which does not need the aid of thebodily organs; but, on the contrary, is most efficient when most freed fromthem,” an insight we have come across before.41[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber619] “It has been the opinion of manyphilosophers,” she writes, “that in the original state of man . . . thatknowledge which is now acquired by pains and labor was intuitive. . . . Degradedin its nature . . . man has lost the faculty of spiritual seeing; but in sleep,when the body is in a state of passivity . . . the spirit, to a certain degreefreed from its impediments, may enjoy somewhat of its original privilege.”42[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber620]HERE COME THE SPIRITSBy the 1830s, mesmerism was a popular topic in America, but it had really beenthere from the start. Benjamin Franklin had been among the group that denouncedMesmer as a fraud, but another hero of the Revolution, the Marquis de Lafayette,told George Washington that he was considered one of Mesmer’s most enthusiasticstudents and that he was as devoted to Mesmer’s ideas as he was to Americanindependence.43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber621] But it was not until somedecades later that ideas about “animal magnetism” and the “magnetic trance”became widely known. Their audience was primed for them to some degree by thework of the Transcendentalists. We’ve seen that Emerson was a reader ofSwedenborg and Thomas Taylor, and references to Hermes, Pythagoras, Zoroaster,the Neoplatonists, and other esoteric sources abound in his writings andjournals.In 1851, Bronson Alcott, another Transcendentalist, introduced Hermes to theBoston literary crowd in her salons, and more than one commentator has remarkedthat in many ways the Transcendentalists paved the way not only for MadameBlavatsky and the Theosophical Society, but also for our own modern New Age.44[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber622]Emerson was not the only American writer interested in these pursuits. EdgarAllan Poe was introduced to mesmerism through a book, Facts in Mesmerism,published in 1840 by the English cleric Chauncy Hare Townshend, a friend of thenovelist, esotericist, and early psychic investigator Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton.Lytton was a friend of the French magician Eliphas Levi and his supernaturalstories, like the classic “The Haunted and the Haunters,” approach ghostsscientifically. His mammoth Rosicrucian novel, Zanoni, is one of the mostimportant esoteric works of the nineteenth century, packing into its dense pagesan encyclopedic amount of Hermetic lore; and his early science fiction novel,The Coming Race, anticipates Nietzsche’s ideas about the “superman” by more thana decade.45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber623]Poe used Mesmer’s ideas in some of his stories, such as “The Facts in the Caseof M. Valdemar,” “A Tale of the Ragged Mountains,” and most directly in“Mesmeric Revelation.” This last was read by a Swedenborgian group who believedthe account of the spirit world Poe gave was accurate and wrote to Poe to tellhim so. Typically tactless, Poe wrote back that he had made it up.Yet Poe was interested enough in mesmeric visions to attend magnetic séancesheld by “the Poughkeepsie Seer,” Andrew Jackson Davis, whose voluminousspiritualist tract, The Principles of Nature, became an instant best seller whenit appeared in 1847.46 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber624] Poe’s own attempt at acosmological work, Eureka, was a flop, yet it communicated much that he hadalready said in “Mesmeric Revelation,” and its many intuitive bull’s-eyesconcerning black holes, the expanding universe, curved space, galactic clusters,and other astronomical insights that have since been verified suggest that insome way he too had experienced some “direct perception.”47[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber625] Poe’s Marginalia shows that he was interestedin dreams, trance states, and that strange intermediary state between sleep andwaking known as “hypnagogia,” of which Swedenborg made much use.Mesmerists, Swedenborgians, spirit healers, and clairvoyants formed a kind oftraveling sideshow in America, bringing their messages from beyond to backwoodsfamilies as well as to cultured societies. But it was not until a particularencounter in an unassuming farmhouse that a full-blown spiritualist craze wouldbegin. In March 1848, in Hydesville, New York, in an area of the country knownas the “Burned-Over District” because of the many religious revival movements ithad seen, something strange happened. On a farm where the Fox family lived, twosisters began to hear strange “knocks” and “raps” that seemed to come fromnowhere. A search of the farmhouse could not locate their source, and the girlsbegan to speak of a “Mr. Splitfoot,” who they pretended was behind the sounds.Hearing the noises again one evening, as a joke, Kate Fox said, “Mr. Splitfoot,do as I do!” and snapped her fingers. Immediately another “snap” was heard. Hersister Margaret joined in and did the same and when the “snaps” continued, theirmother did too. Mrs. Fox seems something of an amateur psychic investigator, asshe then proceeded to ask Mr. Splitfoot questions, which “he” answeredcorrectly. She then asked the obvious question, “Are you a spirit?” suggesting“he” knock twice if so. Two thunderous bangs replied. Eventually it turned outthat Mr. Splitfoot was the spirit of a man who had been murdered in the housebefore the Foxes lived there. “The invasion of the spirit people,” as one writercalled it, had begun. After this, spirits started turning up all over thecountry and in other countries too.Soon table-turning, ghostly hands, musical spirits—floating tambourines turnedup frequently—and the mediums who contacted them appeared in abundance on bothsides of the Atlantic. Spiritualism even entered American politics. In 1872,Victoria Woodhull, a medium, mesmerist, early communist, and advocate of “freelove,” became the first woman to run for the U.S. presidency; needless to sayshe didn’t win.48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber626]Speaking with spirits and contacting the dead were not, technically, new. Homer,Virgil, and Dante had written about such communications, and the oracles ofancient Greece and Rome were as commonplace as e-mail is today. Theurgistscontacted astral entities, and magicians like John Dee spoke to angels. But nowit wasn’t poets, sibyls, or high priests who made contact, but ordinary people.Andrew Jackson Davis had little education—more than he claimed, most likely, butby no means could he have been called an intellectual or philosopher. The Foxsisters were adolescents. It seems the spirits were moving with the spirit ofthe time and had decided to become democratic.There were, of course, spiritual celebrities. The most famous was the ScotDaniel Dunglas Home, whose performances were extraordinary and to this day havenever been explained by any rational—that is, reductive—means.49[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber627] Home could not only contact the dead, predictthe future, and generate “raps.” He could hold live coals, levitate an oak tableor piano, and, most famously, float out one third-story window and in throughanother. He could also elongate his body and materialize figures from the past.After Home attended a lecture on Cagliostro, the Grand Copht turned up in Home’sbedroom and chatted with him, sitting on his bed.50[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber628]Exactly why the spirits chose the middle of the nineteenth century to make amass appearance remains unclear—if we accept that something more than sheerchicanery was involved. Setting aside any possible social, economic, political,or other “reasonable” answer, we can consider an idea proposed by an obscureEnglish esotericist, C. G. Harrison, and later developed by Rudolf Steiner.51[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber629] This suggests that in the nineteenth century,certain occultists, concerned with the rise of materialism, conferred on howbest to deal with the situation. The conservatives maintained that the esotericknowledge of the reality of the spirit must remain secret, otherwise it couldbecome trivialized and watered down. The radicals wanted to disseminate theknowledge as widely as possible, to ensure the greatest effect. The radicals wonout and “the invasion of the spirit people” was planned to counter the dominanceof materialist science.THE FRENCH CONNECTIONFrance, too, saw its own master spiritualist. The educationalist Hippolyte LéonDenizard Rivail was one of France’s most well-known intellectuals; he was a kindof Comenius of his time, a proponent of “universal education,” ready and able todispense it. He was also a follower of Mesmer. Two daughters of a close friendhad taken up the spiritualist craze, and Rivail took the opportunity to studythem. The sisters were especially interested in “automatic writing,” letting thespirits guide their hand. Rivail wrote a series of questions for them to put totheir contacts. Their answers amazed Rivail.The spirits had communicated a complex and profound spiritual philosophy, whichincluded Mesmer’s ideas about “animal magnetism.” But there was more. Theuniverse, it seemed, was pervaded by spirits and we, our bodies, are onlytemporary homes for these invisible souls. Each life allows the spirit toadvance somewhat in its evolution, but it must return to another body to takethe next step. In essence, Rivail’s experiment led to a fusion betweenspiritualism and reincarnation, and after a séance in which the spiritsobligingly danced tables and chairs around the room, Rivail abandoned his workas an educationalist to spread the word.He adopted a new name, Allan Kardec—the spirits had suggested it, based on nameshe had in past lives—and wrote a book under it. The Spirits’ Book appeared in1856 and was an overnight sensation. Kardec’s “spiritism,” the name he chose todifferentiate his teaching from mainstream spiritualism—which, like Swedenborg,did not accept reincarnation—was, until his death in 1869, extremely popular inFrance. Today it is one of the major religions of Brazil.THE PROFESSOR OF TRANSCENDENTAL MAGICAround the same time as Rivail was hearing from the spirits, another Frenchmanwas making other esoteric waves. Alphonse Louis Constant was an ex-priest turnedradical socialist writer and artist, but when his young wife left him for theeditor of a political journal, he made the transformation that would change hislife, becoming, in due course, “the Professor of Transcendental Magic.” Constantcame under the influence of an eccentric Polish mathematician and astronomernamed Józef Maria Hoene-Wronski, who had developed a visionary system ofmessianic philosophy. Hoene-Wronski had studied at the Marseille observatory forseveral years, but when he published his findings he was forced to leave.Hoene-Wronski’s theories about the origin and structure of the universe weredecidedly Pythagorean, and he combined a mathematical mysticism with a messianicbelief in a coming new age. Hoene-Wronski’s commitment to an absolute anduniversal visionary knowledge was combined with his attempts to “square thecircle,” to develop a perpetual motion machine, and to invent a “prognometre,” adevice that would accurately predict the future.Hoene-Wronski called his system Messianisme, and it sparked in the cuckoldedsocialist a profound if uncritical study of the Kabbalah, Hermeticism, and otheresoteric traditions. Abandoned by his wife, Constant plunged into these deepwaters, and when he emerged he was reborn. He took a new name, Eliphas Levi, theHebrew equivalent of his old one, and began a career as an occultist. The firstfruit of this transformation was Dogme de la haute magie (Dogma of High Magic)which appeared in 1854. Its follow-up, Rituel de la haute magie, appeared in1856. (As mentioned, in 1896, both were translated as one volume, TranscendentalMagic, by the occult scholar A. E. Waite.) With these and some later works—likeLes clefs de grand mystères, published in 1861 and translated into English byAleister Crowley as The Keys of the Great Mysteries—Levi triggered what has beenseen as the first “occult revival” of the modern world.There had been a kind of dud English occult revival earlier in the century, whenFrancis Barrett published The Magus in 1801. But although Barrett held classesin occult studies, his work is really a collection of earlier magical texts andis a dull read, lacking the romance and mystery of Levi’s work. Most modernstudents of magic and the Kabbalah recognize that Levi is an often unreliablesource. His work is full of dark musings about the Talmud and Zohar, but hiscommand of Hebrew was practically nonexistent and, as A. E. Waite pedanticallypoints out, much of what Levi writes about Kabbalah and other traditions isnonsense. Yet in an important sense this misses the point. What Levi captured inhis dramatic and sonorous prose is the adventure and excitement that linked arenewed interest in the occult with the Romantic spirit of the age. Levi may bewrong on most things, but he is never dull, and he appeals directly to theimagination and to the belief, embodied in Romanticism, that we are much morepowerful beings than we assume.Magic, for Levi, was not about conjuring spirits or performing miracles,although he delved into both; it was about restoring fallen man to his truestature of a god. Levi’s magic was “a science which confers on man powersapparently superhuman.”52 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber630] With Paracelsus,Goethe, and Blake, Levi emphasized the importance of the imagination. Whencombined with the will—which had received great attention through itsassociation with the “power” of the mesmerist, something the novelist Honoré deBalzac, a devotee of Swedenborg, had written about—this can master the “astrallight,” what Levi called a “universal agent.” This astral light was not only,like Mesmer’s “animal magnetism,” a subtle medium for the magician’s will; itwas also a kind of cosmic film on which everything that has ever happened hasleft its trace, an idea of which Madame Blavatsky would make much use. It wasthe magician’s task to master the astral light—that is, his imagination—and thiswas accomplished through the power of his will.Like Samuel Hartlib, Levi was a kind of “intelligencer,” and made contact withothers who shared his Hermetic interests. One such was Edward Bulwer-Lytton, whowitnessed Levi perform a magical ritual on the roof of the Pantheon, a largebazaar on Oxford Street in London.53 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber631] Levi hadperformed an earlier ritual in London, after a mysterious woman in blackapproached him and requested him to perform a ceremonial invocation. He did andsucceeded in conjuring the spirit of Apollonius of Tyana. Levi also receivedoccult visitors, students eager to learn from the Professor of TranscendentalMagic, as he came to be called. Many flocked to his small Parisian apartment,such as the English Rosicrucian Kenneth Mackenzie, and Levi’s Italian discipleBaron Nicolas-Joseph Spedalieri.One central occult idea that Levi contributed—and which has since beenrecognized as inaccurate—was uniting the Tarot with Kabbalah. Levi linked thetwenty-two “paths” on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, symbolized by the twenty-twoletters of the Hebrew alphabet, with the twenty-two Tarot “trumps,” known as the“major arcana”; he also linked the four minor suits (wands, cups, swords, discs)with the four letters of the Tetragrammaton, the unpronounceable name of God.54[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber632] (YHVH had already been linked to the fourancient elements—fire, water, air, and earth—the fixed signs of the zodiac, andthe four Evangelists.)Levi also popularized the idea that the Tarot was the mysterious Book of Thoth,a nonexistent work the “search” for which still titillates modern seekers.55[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber633] The Tarot became a kind of esoteric archetypefor Levi. He found evidence of its influence practically everywhere, and hebelieved it originated in a kind of “universal Kabbalah.” Levi’s Kabbalisticstudy was mostly of the Christian Kabbalah that emerged from Pico dellaMirandola, and did not reach to its Jewish sources; it is not surprising thatKabbalah scholars like Gershom Scholem would find his ideas absurd.Nevertheless, bringing Kabbalah and the Tarot together was a brilliant strokeand was accepted by practically all subsequent occultists. If later researchsuggests that Levi’s linkage of the Tarot with Egypt and a “universal Kabbalah”is based more on his stirring imagination than historical facts, this does notmean that it is entirely rubbish. The fundamental “method” of esotericism isanalogy, and Levi’s’ mistake has been a very fruitful one. His work reached notonly other occultists like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and began atradition of French occultism that included René Guénon and Schwaller de Lubicz,it also influenced some of the major figures in French culture. The poetsBaudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud; the novelist J. K. Huysmans; the founder ofSurrealism, André Breton; the composers Claude Debussy and Erik Satie; and thepainter Odilon Redon were all touched by Levi’s ideas. On a less highbrow note,the image of Baphomet—supposed idol of the Templars—that adorns many heavy-metalalbum covers as well as clothing was originally designed by Levi.56[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber634] He is seldom credited.THE INCOMPARABLE HPBLevi died in 1875, shaken by illness and the hardships of the Franco-PrussianWar. That year was something of an esoteric milestone. Along with Levi’s death,it saw the birth in England of the dark magician Aleister Crowley, a central ifcontroversial figure. It also saw the founding of the most influential esotericorganization of modern times. On September 13, 1875, on New York City’s eastside, the Theosophical Society was born. Three figures played essential roles inits birth: William Quan Judge, a twenty-four-year-old Irish immigrant who hadjust passed his New York bar examination; Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, amiddle-age agriculturalist, journalist, ex-Civil War officer, and a member ofthe commission that investigated Abraham Lincoln’s assassination; and aremarkable Russian immigrant, the journalist, traveler, psychic, revolutionary,spiritualist, and all-around curmudgeon, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, known to heracquaintances as HPB. Although she remains to many outside the esoteric milieu avery secret teacher, to those who recognize her importance, she is as much acreator of the modern world as Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud.57[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber635] In many ways, were it not for Blavatsky’simpact, the rest of this book could not have been written, as many of itsremaining figures emerged, one way or another, from the esoteric treasure chestshe very energetically opened.Madame Blavatsky led a life, as the cliché goes, shrouded in mystery, and it isnot until her appearance in New York in 1873 at the age of forty-two that anyverifiable accounts of her activities begin.58 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber636]We know that she was born Helena von Hahn in 1831 in Ekaterinoslav, then inRussia, now Dnipropetrovsk in the Ukraine. Her mother was a popular novelist anddaughter of a princess; her father a military man descended from Germannobility. From an early age Helena displayed psychic abilities—or so her sistersaid—and was headstrong. Her mother died when Helena was eleven and she thenlived with her maternal grandparents. The discovery of her great-grandfatherPrince Pavel Dolgorukov’s occult library—he was a Strict Observance RosicrucianFreemason—was a revelation, as was learning about Prince Pavel’s involvementwith a plan to “change the map of Europe” along esoteric lines. Ideas about“hidden superiors,” “invisible” esoteric masters, and “universal reformations”took hold at an early age.Two other events set Helena on her road of discovery. One was meeting PrinceAlexander Golitsyn, a Freemason who traveled through Europe and the East insearch of fellow seekers of knowledge. Alexander’s grandfather and namesake hadbeen a Freemason, a student of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin and Karl vonEckartshausen and an acquaintance of Franz von Baader. An intimate of TsarAlexander I, the elder Golitsyn had encouraged the tsar to read Saint-Martin,Eckartshausen, Boehme, and Swedenborg. Young Prince Golitsyn talked to theteenage Helena about his travels and about the men and women he had met, who,like him, were, as Gurdjieff would later call himself, “seekers of truth.” Heencouraged her to travel “in search of the unknown,” and at the firstopportunity she did.That chance occurred after the second event that set her on the path to destiny:her marriage at seventeen to Nikifor Blavatsky, the forty-something vicegovernor of the province of Erivan in southern Russia. Why she made thisquestionable and unconsummated alliance—HPB remained a lifelong celibate—isunclear, but soon into it she wanted out, and after three months she gallopedoff alone in the direction of Tiflis. After a failed attempt to ship her to herfather in Odessa (she escaped to Constantinople), from late 1849 to her passingthrough immigration in Battery Park in July 1873, what actually happened in herlife remains highly debatable.If Paracelsus’s, Giordano Bruno’s, and Apollonius of Tyana’s itineraries werepacked, young Helena’s sounds dizzying. From leaving her crestfallen husband toturning up in lower Manhattan—with occasional pit stops back home—her boot heelswandered to Turkey, Egypt, France, North America, South America, England,Germany, Greece, India, and other parts, in search of inner wisdom and ancientknowledge. Along the way she fought on the barricades with the Italiannationalist Mazzini, crossed the United States in a covered wagon, survived thewreck of the Eumonia—a sea disaster as famous in its day as the Titanic—heldséances in Cairo, taught music in Russia, ran an artificial flower factory, andmuch more.Although it is difficult if not impossible to verify much that either she orothers said she did, the remarkable thing is that there seems enoughcircumstantial evidence to suggest that at least some of her adventures weretrue. The most controversial part of her travelogue is her journey to Tibet at atime when white European males found it impregnable. She allegedly arrived therein the late 1860s, on her third attempt, at the command of two Hindu teachers.One of these teachers, the Master Morya, she claimed in later life to have hadvisions of since her childhood, and to have met in London in 1851 at the GreatExhibition. He told her she had a special mission and that it would requiredevoting three years of her life to receiving occult training in Tibet.Blavatsky claimed that in a secret location in the Himalayas, Master Morya andhis colleague Koot Hoomi taught her the occult knowledge and esoteric teachingsthat she brought to the increasingly materialistic West in order to save it fromcomplete self-destruction.When Blavatsky arrived penniless in New York in 1873—traveling steerage fromFrance in order to help a stranded family—she was a woman with a mission, andshe did her best to let everyone know. One person she went out of her way toinform was Colonel Olcott. Olcott had an interest in spiritualism and wasreporting on a “haunting” in a farmhouse in Chittenden, Vermont, for The DailyGraphic. Blavatsky read his articles and went to Chittenden purposely to meethim. The gentlemanly Olcott was bowled over by Blavatsky’s forthright and blowsymanner. She smoked like a chimney, wore extravagant clothes, and had a“colorful” vocabulary. But what impressed Olcott most were her psychic powers.Upon her arrival, the farmhouse was visited by Russian, Georgian, and Kurdishspirits, dancing to Blavatsky’s tune. HPB showed Olcott that she was somethingmore than a passive medium; she was a magician. The control over “phenomena”that she displayed in Chittenden convinced Olcott that Blavatsky was a woman ofpower. Then and there Olcott became her press agent, Platonic soul mate, and“chum”—or, depending on your point of view, partner in a folie à deux.Blavatsky told Olcott about her mission and her masters (Olcott would soon meetone himself) and the colonel informed his readers of her amazing powers. She wasnot just another spiritualist and she soon drew fire because of her claim thatthe spirits mediums communicated with were more likely astral hobos andectoplasmic deadbeats, bored lowlifes of the “other side,” and not dear AuntBetty or Uncle Tim. Mediumship, spiritualism were not the true spiritual path,she argued. They were passive, retrograde practices. The true path of spiritualevolution demanded the kind of control and discipline she had mastered in Tibetand which she was ready to teach to the right students. After a few misalliancesand a failed “Miracle Club,” the way ahead became clear. With Olcott, Judge, andseveral other seekers, the Theosophical Society was born.ANCIENT WISDOM, MODERN WORLDThere were occult or esoteric societies prior to the Theosophical Society. Onewas the Orphic Circle, a mesmerist group associated with Emma Hardinge Britten,a prominent spiritualist and the author of Art Magic and possibly anotherinfluential work, Ghost Land, both of which appeared in 1876. Britten was anearly member of the Theosophical Society before she had a falling-out withMadame Blavatsky. Another group was the elusive Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor,led by the mysterious Max Théon, which incorporated some ideas of the eccentricmixed-race occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph, whose interest in drugs andsex-magic predates Aleister Crowley’s and whose turbulent life ended when heblew his brains out in 1875 at the age of forty-nine. Joscelyn Godwin suggeststhat both groups may have had a hand in triggering the “spiritualist craze.”59[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber637]But the Theosophical Society was something different, and much of its earlysuccess came from Blavatsky’s powerful personality and media savvy. She was anexcellent self-promoter, getting her name in the papers regularly, and she andOlcott made an impressive team. The Theosophical Society was also concerned withmore than spirits and mesmerism, which, by the late nineteenth century, werebeginning to lose their appeal. As we saw in Chapter One, part of its focus wason recovering the lost knowledge and wisdom of the ancients, of philosophers andmystics like Plotinus, Iamblichus, and Porphyry, which had been forgotten in themodern age. It also aimed to study the phenomena of spiritualism and mesmerismscientifically—again in advance of the Society for Psychical Research—and todevelop ways of actualizing the psychic powers latent in man. But it wasBlavatsky’s mission to “form a nucleus of a universal brotherhood of humanity,without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color” that perhaps set theTheosophical Society apart from earlier groups and linked it to the kind of“universal reformation” we saw with the Rosicrucians and Freemasons and withwhich she believed her great-grandfather had been involved. This egalitarianism,combined with an emphasis on personal spiritual experience and effort, made itan agent of the kind of “superhumanism” associated with Pico della Mirandola andRomanticism, and fit well with the democratic temper of the time. It appealed topeople seeking a more rewarding spiritual life than that offered by the churchbut also to those of a scientific bent who nonetheless were dissatisfied withthe increasingly reductive approach of modern science.Blavatsky found herself battling on three fronts—against religion, science, andspiritualism—and she did surprisingly well. The Theosophical Society’s motto,“There is no religion higher than truth,” had wide appeal. Many earlytheosophical recruits came not from society’s outcasts, as one might suspect,but from its best and brightest. Two prominent early members were the Civil Warhero and purported inventor of baseball, Abner Doubleday, and “the Wizard ofMenlo Park,” Thomas Edison, who had by this time invented the phonograph and wason his way to the lightbulb.UNVEILING ISISBlavatsky’s first major work of occult philosophy, the massive Isis Unveiled,appeared in 1877 and was an immediate success, its first edition of one thousandcopies selling out in a week. Many more printings followed and the book hasnever gone out of print. A review in The New York World gives us a clue as towhat Blavatsky aimed to accomplish. It called the book “an extremely readableand exhaustive essay upon the paramount importance of re-establishing theHermetic Philosophy.” Strange stories gathered about how it was written;Blavatsky apparently was able to “see” passages in books she didn’t possess andhad no access to, through the medium of the “Akashic record,” Levi’s “astrallight.”Some spiritualist critics, happy to nip at Blavatsky’s heels, argued the bookwas full of plagiarisms—Blavatsky quotes a legion of authors—but a reader todayisn’t bothered by such pedantry. What he or she discovers is a torrent ofesoteric inspiration, synthesizing practically all previous occult philosophywith the then latest developments in science, history, and other disciplines.Blavatsky had read and assimilated an enormous amount of material—akashically orotherwise—and presented it to the modern reader in a forceful, driven, at timesexasperated—she does not shy from table-thumping—but readable style. With itschampioning of truths and realities that narrow scientific reductionismignored—everything from mesmerism, precognition, and reincarnation, to“elementals,” planetary evolution, and magic, with much else in between—IsisUnveiled reintroduced ideas that had been obscured by limited “left-brainthinking” to an audience eager for clues as to what lay beyond, and kick-startedan occult revival.Along with ideas about the Akashic record, Blavatsky argued that, contrary toDarwin and his followers, the entire universe, from the smallest clod to thegreatest galaxy, is involved in a long, continuous process of cosmic andspiritual evolution, the essential element of which is consciousness. As thecultural historian Theodore Roszak pointed out, Blavatsky presents the firstphilosophical—not religious—critique of Darwinism, anticipating Samuel Butler’sLife and Habit (1878), which is generally credited with this, by a year.Blavatsky also argued the central theme of the “perennial philosophy”: that allreligions have emerged from a common, primal source, once again voicing therecurrent Hermetic insight, and wish, that the different faiths should abandontheir fruitless squabbles and focus on the real work of getting mankind up astep on the evolutionary ladder. It was an exciting and moving vision, and itcame at the right time. Western consciousness, fed on reductive science, had bythen entered a metaphysical black hole, one expression of which was the idea ofthe unavoidable “heat death” of the universe brought about through theirrevocable process of entropy, “the second law of thermo-dynamics.” This arguedthat all of the energy in the universe would eventually flatten out into alukewarm, lifeless, cosmic puddle and would remain that way throughout eternity.In contrast, Blavatsky offered a vision of a growing, expanding, consciousuniverse, in which the smallest part—Blake’s grain of sand—was able to containthe whole, and with it, move toward achieving Godhead.INDIA AND DOWNFALLBy the end of 1878, Blavatsky made a decision that would eventually lead to herdownfall: she chose to leave New York and relocate to India. Exactly why she didremains unclear but by February 1879, she and Colonel Olcott had reached thesubcontinent. It was from here that the Theosophical Society would achieve itsgreatest victories, but it is also here that Blavatsky’s reputation suffered ablow from which it never really recovered. After five years of unqualifiedsuccess in which the society attracted thousands of recruits, including manyamong the higher classes and British expatriates, and Blavatsky and Olcottreceived many honors and much good press—both had converted to Buddhism—a darkcloud appeared in the form of an old friend.60 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber638]Emma Coulombe, whom Blavatsky had known from her séance days in Cairo, wrote toHPB from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), telling of hard times. Blavatsky invited her tojoin the society and keep house for her in Bombay (now Mumbai). It was an offershe would later regret.Soon after this, in 1884, HPB and Colonel Olcott went to England and France. InLondon, the recently founded Society for Psychical Research (SPR) suggested theyinvestigate the claims made about Blavatsky’s psychic powers. She had alreadyrecruited Alfred Percy Sinnett, an influential newspaper editor, whose books TheOccult World and Esoteric Buddhism were very popular and introduced Blavatsky’sideas to many readers, among them Rudolf Steiner and W. B. Yeats. Sinnett spokeof her miraculous ability to “materialize” objects, the most uncanny of whichwere letters from her mystic Masters, who, by now, were called “Mahatma,” whichmeans “great soul.” These letters appeared, literally, out of nowhere, usuallyfalling from the empty air above their recipient’s head. Sinnett himself carriedon an extensive correspondence with the Masters in this way, more than thirteenhundred pages of elaborate esoteric communication, in red and blue ink, whichare available for study in the British Library. HPB called the magic thatprovided the letters “precipitation,” and it was something she had learned inTibet. Newspapers around the world carried accounts of Blavatsky’s“materializations,” and the SPR was keen to investigate them. HPB and Olcottagreed.By this time, Emma Coulombe, angered by some perceived slight, had told aChristian missionary magazine that HPB’s powers were a fake and that she hadbeen recruited to help her old friend pull the wool over many eyes. The“precipitated” letters were simply slipped through cracks in the floorboards,and the Masters were phoneys too. Most damaging, Emma said she had letters fromBlavatsky to prove it. Blavatsky had few good words about the Christianmissionaries—she was a fervent critic of Christianity and chided themissionaries for taking the natives away from their own infinitely preferablereligion—and she also was less than complimentary about the British Raj. Themagazine was only too happy to hear Emma’s revelations, and soon the rest of theworld heard about them too, including the SPR. The upshot was that when RichardHodgson arrived to investigate HPB’s “precipitations,” he swallowed EmmaCoulombe’s story whole and reported to the SPR that Blavatsky was one of thegreatest impostors in history. She was also most likely a Russian spy, workingagainst the British in the “Great Game,” the tussle for influence in Tibet andnorthern India between the tsar and Queen Victoria.Blavatsky denied Emma’s claims, said her alleged letters were forgeries, andcame back to India to defend herself. She was also incensed by Hodgson’saccusation that she was a spy. But Olcott and others in the society thought itwould be a mistake to launch a legal battle in which Blavatsky would be obligedto reveal the true identity of her Masters, something she had sworn never to do.In any case, any action would lead to a show trial against Theosophy, andeveryone wanted to avoid that. Blavatsky was a volatile character and liable toexplode in the process of rebutting the allegations against her. In the end, HPBtook the calumny upon herself, and in 1885, left India—a country she loved andwould never see again—and for some years became something of a wanderer,crisscrossing Europe as had the mages of old. She may have found some recompensein the fact that in 1986, the SPR retracted Hodgson’s report as highly flawedand stated that Madame Blavatsky had been “unjustly condemned.” A century aftershe took the blame, Blavatsky, if not completely cleared, at least had somethingof a day in court.61 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber639]SECRET DOCTRINESBlavatsky eventually settled in England in 1887, where she spent her last days.Many of them were occupied in producing her second enormous work of occultphilosophy, The Secret Doctrine, which was published in 1888 and is even longerthat Isis Unveiled. Blavatsky claimed it was a commentary on stanzas from TheBook of Dzyan, an unknown ancient work written in the equally unknown ancientlanguage of “Senzar,” which HPB said she learned during her time in Tibet.The Book of Dzyan, Blavatsky tells us, is the source of all eastern and western“wisdom traditions,” and the two volumes of The Secret Doctrine amount to acosmic history of man and the universe. They speak of the Earth going throughdifferent stages of evolution—what she calls “rounds”—and of the different“root” and “sub” races that have lived on it prior to us, such as the Atlanteansand the Lemurians. Much has been made of Blavatsky’s attention to race, mostlyby a few racist esotericists and by critics of esotericism who believe it isracist by definition. Yet anyone who reads much of Blavatsky’s huge oeuvre soonsees that race actually plays a very small part in it, and that what there ismust be seen in light of her overarching mission to inaugurate a new, modern,universal “brotherhood of man.” There is much evidence in Blavatsky’s life toshow that she was not racist.As with Isis Unveiled, it is difficult to give a précis of The Secret Doctrine,but its central aims can be summed up in three propositions. One is that itseeks to establish the existence of one absolute Reality, which precedes allmanifestation and transcends our ability to speak of it, something we’ve heardin regard to the Hermetic One, the Neoplatonic Nous, the Kabbalah’s En-Sof, theSunyata (or void) of Mahayana Buddhism, Jacob Boehme’s Ungrund, and the negativetheology of Meister Eckhart. Blavatsky also wants to establish the eternity ofthe universe as a “boundless plane,” in which the ebb and flow of creation, its“periodicity,” is played out. For Blavatsky, the universe is ever creatingitself out of itself, its apparent “destruction” merely the prelude to a new“creation” (so no final “heat death”). And, perhaps most important, she arguesfor the identity of every individual soul with the Oversoul, a universalconsciousness through which each soul undergoes the process of a cosmicevolution, a transformative journey through all states of existence, from stoneto God. With these objectives, Blavatsky takes the reader on a thrilling,challenging, and not infrequently bewildering voyage through the occult historyof the world. Whether she is successful depends on the reader, but those whopersevere will find that the sudden stunning views and insights are worth theeffort.Writing The Secret Doctrine took its toll on Blavatsky, who was never in goodhealth and whose enormous size and scandalous diet did not help; in her lastdays she weighed more than two hundred pounds and had to be pushed around in aperambulator. In London, she started an Esoteric Section of the TheosophicalSociety—an offshoot of her earlier Blavatsky Lodge—in which she instructedselected students in the finer details of her ideas. She later formed an InnerGroup from some of its members, some of whom went on to play important roles inesoteric history. The fiery suffragette and socialist Annie Besant came in tothe Theosophical fold in 1889, after reviewing The Secret Doctrine for The PallMall Gazette. After meeting Blavatsky, she was converted, a life change for theatheist Besant that churned up much gossip. She would take over running theTheosophical Society from Colonel Olcott in the new century. G. R. S. Mead wenton to become a respected scholar of Gnosticism and Hermeticism and to start hisown Quest Society, and William Wynn Westcott was one of the founders of theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.Blavatsky received many visitors. W. B. Yeats was charmed by her and said shehad an “air of humour and audacious power.” She told Yeats that “nothingmattered but what happened in the mind. If we cannot master the mind, ouractions are of little importance.” Probably the most influential and surprisingof Blavatsky’s visitors was Mohandas Gandhi, who later described Theosophy as“Hinduism at its best.”Gandhi was taken to meet Blavatsky in 1889, when he was a young law studenttrying his best to be English. He had met two young Theosophists and wasembarrassed to admit that he had never read the Bhagavad Gita, a classic ofIndian spirituality. Such works had been frowned upon by his Christianmissionary teachers. After he met Blavatsky, it became the most important bookin Gandhi’s life; his doctrine of Ahimsā, nonviolence, he said, emerged from hisreading of it. Gandhi joined a Theosophical lodge and remained deeply interestedin Theosophy for the rest of his life. On January 30, 1948, the day he wasassassinated, Gandhi had written about Theosophy in his journal Harijan, sayingthat “Theosophy is Hinduism in theory, and Hinduism is Theosophy in practice.”Such accounts are regularly left out of most writing about Blavatsky’s influencein the world.Blavatsky died on May 8, 1891, at the age of sixty. She had a medley of ailmentsand, unlike today’s spiritual people, treated her body with contempt; the ideaof being concerned with her “health and well-being” would have prompted anunprintable remark and a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette. She may not haveknown it, but the years after her passing saw something like an esoteric BigBang, the consequences of which we are still trying to understand."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENTOWARD THE NEW AGE[../image/153618.jpg]The decades following Madame Blavatsky’s death saw a remarkable blossoming ofesoteric ideas, an occult revival that continued until the outbreak of World WarI, and which rivaled the Renaissance and Romantic movement for inspiration,insight, and influence. The fin-de-siècle, as this period is known, is generallyconsidered a time of decadence—epitomized in J. K. Huysmans’s eccentric novelAgainst the Grain (1884) and Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)—butit was also a time of intense creativity and experiment. Elements of the ancientwisdom often joined forces with modern and progressive ideas to create anatmosphere in which old familiar ways of life were challenged and practicallyanything seemed possible. While concerns about the decline of the West and itsspiritual exhaustion were rife—witness the success of Max Nordau’s studyDegeneration (1892), which argued that practically all of modern art andliterature was inspired by disease—the years between 1890 and 1914 were alsofilled with an exuberance and optimism that to our more cynical eyes seemsincredible. The century about to dawn offered, it seemed, a blank slate on whichwestern man could write his destiny, and for many the future looked infinitelypromising.R. M. Bucke’s Cosmic Consciousness, for example, a riposte to Nordau publishedin 1901, saw mankind moving into a higher stage of consciousness and liberatedfrom material concerns through a kind of world socialism. Nietzsche’s prophecyof a coming superman informed speculations on human evolution, and the belief inprogress and mankind’s perfectibility combined with ideas of karma andreincarnation to produce an effervescent, highly charged milieu. Newdevelopments in science and technology suggested a power over the physical worldunlike any before, while investigations into the “night side” of nature revealedthe hidden abilities of the human mind.It was a paradoxical time, when the stridently modern met ancient “lost”knowledge and produced a curious sensibility, in which much that was“up-to-date” had its roots in the mysterious past. Some writers have suggestedthat the occult revival of this time was a reaction to the rise of modernity andan attempt to avoid it, what the historian of the occult James Webb called “theflight from reason.”1 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber640] But as in theRenaissance, in many cases the “modern” itself had its source in what had beenlong forgotten. As in our own time, with science and mysticism oftenneighbors—witness Fritjof Capra’s The Tao of Physics—Einstein’s relativitytheory and notions of non-Euclidean space informed accounts of astral travel andthe fourth dimension. At the same time, a widespread dissatisfaction withwestern materialist science and its disenchanted universe—as well as with anincreasingly moribund Christianity—led many to take a journey to the East, andto embrace a variety of oriental philosophies that are still with us today.In fact, it seems clear that much, if not all, of what we consider our own NewAge can be traced back to this forgotten “positive fin-de-siècle.”2[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber641] Many of the interests informing the new,progressive ways of life have a very familiar ring. Yoga, natural medicine,getting back to nature, higher consciousness, experimentation with drugs, freelove, feminism, gay rights, meditation, vegetarianism, animal rights,multiculturalism, homeopathy, interest in indigenous people and traditionalbeliefs, spiritualism (channeling), mythology, communal living, anticapitalism,a fascination with ancient civilizations, occultism and the supernatural, arejection of cold reason in favor of feeling and intuition, a turning away frommodernity and progress while at the same time a fervent millennarian belief in acoming “new age”: these and many other alternative ideas informed the westernZeitgeist at the beginning of the twentieth century.THE SPAWN OF HPBMany of the prime movers of this early modern occult revival got their startthrough Theosophy, which by the end of the nineteenth century had become aworldwide movement, informing many areas of life. The Russian painter WassilyKandinsky and his Dutch colleague Piet Mondrian, for example—two giants ofmodern art—were Theosophists. Theosophical ideas are at the core of their work,and a good argument can be made that abstract art grew in theosophical soil.3[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber642] Along with the lectures and writings of RudolfSteiner, himself a major Theosophist, one of the main influences on Kandinsky,generally recognized as the first abstract painter, was the book Thought Forms,written by Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater, another leading Theosophist, andpublished in 1905.4 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber643] As mentioned earlier, thebasic idea of Thought Forms is that “thoughts are things.” The illustrationsaccompanying Besant and Leadbeater’s text, portraying different thoughts,feelings, emotions, and ideas in colorful abstract forms, informed Kandinsky’sattempt to capture the spiritual world on canvas, an objective he spells out inhis influential book Concerning the Spiritual in Art (1912).5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber644]Other arts were also theosophically informed. Nicholas Roerich, the artist andmystic who designed the sets and provided the inspiration for Igor Stravinsky’sscandalous 1913 ballet Le Sacré du Printemps—which riotously inaugurated the ageof modern music—would later claim to be guided in his expeditions to theHimalayas by one of Blavatsky’s Masters. The Russian composer AlexanderScriabin, famous for works like The Poem of Ecstasy (1908), was a Theosophist;his last work, left unfinished at his death, was to be a gigantic Mystery dramaon Theosophical themes, combining music, art, dance, theater, poetry, andritual. The American writer Jack London was a Theosophist, and reincarnation isthe central theme of his novel The Star Rover (1915). And L. Frank Baum, theauthor of The Wizard of Oz (1900), became a Theosophist in 1892.Theosophy also reached into scholarship, and many who first introduced easternideas and philosophies to western minds were influenced by theosophical beliefs.W. Y. Evans-Wentz, who brought The Tibetan Book of the Dead to western readers,was a Theosophist, as were the influential Buddhist scholars Christmas Humphreysand Edward Conze. D. T. Suzuki, who introduced Zen Buddhism to the West, wasalso a Theosophist. Politics, too, had its share. We have already mentionedGandhi, but Jawaharlal Nehru, who would become the first prime minister ofIndia, was initiated into the society as a teenager in 1902. And our ownmultifaith aspirations have a pre-echo in the first World Parliament ofReligions, which took place in 1893 during the World’s Columbian Exposition inChicago. Here the Theosophists Annie Besant and William Quan Judge, and theSinhalese religious reformer Anagarika Dharmapala (a student of Blavatsky whohad been inspired by Colonel Olcott’s Buddhist missionary work) shared a stagewith Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus—Swami Vivekananda opened theproceedings—atheists and agnostics, a tangible expression of Theosophy’sadvocacy of the “perennial philosophy.”MOUNTAINS OF TRUTHTheosophy also had a hand in starting what would later be called the“counterculture.” In 1889, Alfred Pioda, a member of the Swiss parliament and acommitted Theosophist, planned a “Theosophical cloister” in the sleepy villageof Ascona on the shores of Lago Maggiore in Ticino, the Italian-speaking cantonof Switzerland. Ascona already had a “radical” reputation: in 1873, one of itsresidents was the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. The cloister was to bebuilt on a hill named Monescia overlooking the lake, and Pioda’s collaboratorsincluded Countess Constance Wachtmeister, Madame Blavatsky’s Swedish travelingcompanion; the German Theosophist and occultist Franz Hartmann; and the Dutchnovelist, psychiatrist, and spiritualist Frederik van Eeden, who in 1913 coinedthe term “lucid dream.”Pioda’s plan didn’t pan out, but in 1900, Ida Hoffman, a Montenegran pianoteacher, and Henri Oedenkoven, son of a wealthy Belgian industrialist,rechristened the hill Monte Verità, the “Mountain of Truth,” and founded a“co-operative vegetarian colony” there, devoted to “getting back to nature” and“experimental living,” which in many cases meant nudism, sun-worship, and freelove. Soon scores of esoteric and cultural notables headed to Ascona, eager toescape the stress of city life and “get off the grid” in the beautifulnear-Mediterranean microclimate. Well in advance of the 1960s “love generation,”anarchists, vegetarians, nature worshipers, free-love advocates, poets,painters, occultists, and musicians who rejected mainstream society “droppedout” in the curiously spiritual atmosphere of Monte Verità. Among those whoclimbed the “Mountain of Truth” were the novelist Hermann Hesse, the dancerIsadora Duncan, the choreographer Rudolf Laban, the radical Freudian and sex anddrugs guru Otto Gross (a colleague and patient of Jung), the occultist and spyTheodor Reuss, Rudolf Steiner, the sociologist Max Weber, the novelist D. H.Lawrence, and the anarchist Erich Mühsam, who was later assassinated by theNazis.The most characteristic figure of Monte Verità was the Naturmensch GustavGräser, known simply as “Gusto,” a poet and painter determined to be free of“civilization.” Gusto made his own clothes, plucked food from the trees, madehis own furniture, and lived in a cave with his wife and children. In MonteVerità on a rest cure, Herman Hesse submitted to Gusto’s natural health regime,which meant exposing his naked body to the elements; in Hesse’s case, thisresulted in sunburn and torn flesh.6 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber645]In 1920, the original Monte Verità experiment ended when Hoffman and Oedenkovenmoved to South America, but it received a new lease on esoteric life a decadelater when the Dutch socialite Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn opened her nearby CasaGabriella to the famous Eranos Conferences. These prestigious gatherings werepresided over by C. G. Jung and included some of the major names of post–WorldWar II spiritual and esoteric scholarship, such as Henry Corbin, JosephCampbell, Gershom Scholem, Mircea Eliade, and James Hillman. For the JungianErich Neumann, the Eranos Conferences constituted a modern “link in the GoldenChain” of adepts; Eliade himself likened them to what took place during theRenaissance and the Romantic movement.7 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber646]Curiously, Fröbe-Kapteyn had originally planned for the auditorium she had builtto be used by the Theosophist Alice Bailey, but after holding a few “spiritualsummer schools” there, Bailey abandoned the idea, saying that the area wasassociated with black magic and witchcraft.PSYCHIC SOCIETIESExperiments in new ways of living were not limited to Mountains of Truth, and inmany European cities the new progressive sensibilities mixed with a revivedinterest in the occult. Paris, St. Petersburg, London, Munich, Prague, Rome, andother cosmopolitan centers had a thriving occult underground. One expression ofthis was a determined attempt to understand the spiritual world scientifically,to refine the work started a generation earlier by the Naturphilosophen,Catherine Crowe and Bulwer-Lytton.The Society for Psychical Research was founded in England in 1882 by theclassicist F. W. H. Myers, the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, and the psychologistEdmund Gurney. Their motive was the belief that the “objective and intelligentinvestigation” into spiritualism and related phenomena “could provide answers tothe troubling metaphysical questions of the time.”8[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber647] As mainstream religion withdrew in the face ofan encroaching materialist science, the big questions of life and death and goodand evil were seen as either meaningless or unanswerable, and the debate betweenreason and faith was increasingly polarized. With an inadequate religion and adismissive science, Myers and his colleagues wondered if the evidence forghosts, spirits, precognition, telepathy (Myers coined the term), clairvoyance,and other “psychic phenomena” might help throw light on the “actual truth as tothe destiny of man.”9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber648] The central questionregarding the “destiny of man” was, for the members of the SPR, the possibilityof life after death. Myers gathered an enormous amount of evidence for this inhis posthumously published masterpiece Human Personality and Its Survival ofBodily Death (1903), a massive two-volume work in which Myers developed his owntheory of the unconscious—or, as he called it, the “subliminal mind”—in advanceof Freud.Myers’s ideas influenced fellow psychologists such as Pierre Janet, ThéodoreFlournoy, and C. G. Jung. Unlike today, when most scientists shy from publicadmission of any “spiritual” views, in the positive fin-de-siècle such timiditywas rare, and soon after its inception the SPR drew to its cause many of themost famous minds of the time, including Alfred Russel Wallace, “co-discoverer”with Darwin of the theory of evolution; the physicists William Barrett and LordRayleigh; the chemist and Theosophist William Crookes; the philosopher andBritish Prime Minister Arthur Balfour; the physiologist Charles Richet; andArthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes (unlike his creation, Doyle was afervent spiritualist). Freud and Jung were members, and the SPR also attractedthe philosopher Henri Bergson, whom we have met throughout this book, and hisfriend and fellow philosopher William James.James straddled the related concerns of psychical research and investigationinto mysticism and altered states of consciousness, one result of which is hisclassic work The Varieties of Religious Experience, published in 1902. Jamesagreed with Myers that any account of human life must include evidence comingfrom “abnormal” psychological states, such as mediumship and mysticalexperience, and he argued that personal experience was a more valid proof of Godor spirituality than any theology, dogma, or system, an idea we have come acrossbefore. James himself was not a stranger to such states, and during anexperiment with nitrous oxide—well in advance of the psychedelic generation—heexperienced “depth beyond depth of truth” and recognized that “our normal wakingconsciousness, rational consciousness, as we call it, is but one special type ofconsciousness, whilst all about it, parted by the filmiest of screens, there liepotential forms of consciousness, entirely different.” “No account of theuniverse in its totality can be final,” James saw, “which leaves these otherforms of consciousness quite disregarded.”10 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber649]Needless to say, the materialist account of the universe did leave these otherforms of consciousness quite disregarded, and in many instances prided itself ondoing so.James’s breadth of inquiry was impressive and, along with Bergson, he also tooka deep interest in the rise of what he called the “Mind-cure movement,” thegospel of “positive thinking” that formed part of the optimistic character ofthe fin-de-siècle. In The Varieties of Religious Experience, James sings thepraises of the “healthy-minded attitudes” of “courage, hope and trust” whichhave resulted in, by James’s account, nothing short of miracle cures, with theblind restored to sight, the lame walking, and invalids free of their ailments.As with much of our own contemporary New Age literature, James recognized thatmany “mind-cure” tracts are so “moonstruck with optimism and so vaguelyexpressed” that many educated people find them difficult to swallow. Yet heargues that this shouldn’t prevent us from recognizing the practical resultsfrom what he calls America’s “only decidedly original contribution to thesystematic philosophy of life,” an application, in its way, of Paracelsus’srecognition of the power of imagination over our health.11[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber650]GOLDEN DAWNSW. B. Yeats, who also experimented with drugs, mostly hashish and peyote, inorder to explore other forms of consciousness, left the Theosophical Societybecause of his interest in ceremonial magic, an occult pursuit that Blavatskyabhorred. He soon found congenial company in the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, arguably the most famous occult group of modern times. The Golden Dawnfused Hermetic, Egyptian, Rosicrucian, Kabbalistic, and theurgic teachings intoa unique blend that informed most of the popular magic of the last half century.All of its work was aimed at achieving the “knowledge and conversation” of one’s“Holy Guardian Angel,” the order’s version of the “higher self,” derived from amedieval Kabbalistic tract known as The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelinthe Mage. As with the Theosophical Society, many of the most influentialoccultists of the twentieth century emerged from the Golden Dawn or one of itsoffshoots: a short list would include Israel Regardie; Dion Fortune; A. E.Waite; the writer on mysticism Evelyn Underhill; and the horror fiction writersArthur Machen and Algernon Blackwood.The most well-known story of the Golden Dawn’s origin—which is most likelyapocryphal—concerns a cipher manuscript found in a secondhand bookstore inLondon’s Farringdon Road. Wynn Westcott—later a member of Madame Blavatsky’sInner Group—could not decipher it and he asked a friend, Samuel LiddellMacGregor Mathers, for help. Mathers was an eccentric character. He combined anatural predilection for magic with a passion for military history and aninveterate taste for fantasy and self-dramatizing; oddly enough, he was alsomarried to Henri Bergson’s sister, Moina, herself a medium. Mathers and Westcottcracked the cipher—it was one devised by Paracelsus’s teacher, JohannesTrithemius—and recognized that it contained magical rituals and material on theTarot, as well as a letter from a Fräulein Anna Sprengel in Nuremberg. Theletter gave her address and also said that if more information about the cipherwas needed, to contact her. Westcott wrote Fräulein Sprengel, who told him thatshe was the head of a magical order, Die Goldene Dämmerung (The Golden Dawn).She also gave him a charter to start a branch in London, which Westcott,Mathers, and a colleague, William Woodman, did in 1887.When Westcott wrote to Fräulein Sprengel again, he received a reply saying thatshe had died, and that no further help would come from Germany. If he and hiscolleagues wanted more information, they would have to contact the SecretChiefs, the true heads of the order, themselves. Yeats, we’ve seen, thought thatthese Secret Chiefs (or “Hidden Superiors”) went back to Rabbi Falk, but forMathers, they had a more supernatural status. By 1891, about the time Yeats methim, Mathers was in command of the Golden Dawn, and he likened his contacts withthe Secret Chiefs to the effect of a lightning flash coupled with the shortnessof breath that accompanies inhaling ether. Mathers claimed that he was in solecontact with these powerful beings, who were rather like Blavatsky’s Masters,and this, combined with his dictatorial style and the fact that he was leadingthe London group while living in Paris, led to fractures that would soon breakthe order apart.One factor certainly hastening the order’s collapse was the initiation in 1898of Aleister Crowley, the most famous—or infamous—magician of the twentiethcentury. A poet, mountaineer, chess master and, like Blavatsky, world traveler,Crowley combined a brilliant mind with an unfortunate adolescent need to shock,born of his upbringing in a prosperous Christian fundamentalist family. He alsohad a hefty inheritance and a taste for unconventional sex, and a variety ofdrugs that would, within a few years, make him a darling of the tabloids. Yeatsand most of the other members found Crowley unbearable, but Mathers consideredhim an ally. When he initiated Crowley into a higher grade that Yeats hadearlier refused, the subsequent squabble led to the order’s sundering intoopposed camps and eventual fracture.Crowley soon founded his own magical society, the A∴A∴ (the pyramid of dots is aMasonic device indicating that the society was secret), which is most commonlyunderstood to mean Argentium Astrum, or Silver Star, and which more or lesscarried on in the Golden Dawn tradition. Crowley would also later join andrevamp another society, the Ordo Templi Orientis, or O.T.O., a quasi-Masonicgroup dedicated to tantric “sex magic,” claiming descent from the KnightsTemplar and which still survives today. Crowley’s A∴A∴ combined magical workingsof an Egyptian-Kabbalistic blend, with experiments in altered states ofconsciousness, mostly using drugs—what Crowley called “Scientific Illuminism”—aswell as rituals aimed at discovering one’s “true will.” These were based onCrowley’s inspired work, The Book of the Law, which was dictated to Crowley by asupernatural being in Cairo in 1904. The Book of the Law prophesised a comingnew age, that of “the crowned and conquering child,” and the rise of thereligion of thelema, Greek for “will.” The essence of thelema was summed up inCrowley’s antinomian formula “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law,”which was later taken up as a catchphrase during the 1960s and has carried on totoday.12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber651]THE OLD NEW AGECrowley was part of the general occult boom of the fin-de-siècle, and he knewone of the period’s major movers and shakers.13[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber652] The literary critic and editor A. R. Orage wasa brilliant “desperado of genius”—according to the playwright George BernardShaw—whose journal The New Age was the premier sounding board for a remarkablearray of progressive ideas. In many ways it was a kind of Monte Verità in print,opening its pages to the occult, Theosophy, socialism, dress reform, psychicalresearch, feminism, and other radical notions. Orage himself was a walkingembodiment of the time, being simultaneously a Fabian socialist, Theosophist,psychical researcher (he was a secretary of the SPR), occultist, andNietzschean; his Friedrich Nietzsche, the Dionysian Spirit of the Age (1906) wasthe first systematic introduction to Nietzsche in English.Orage and a friend bought the moribund New Age in 1907 with money donated byShaw and a “Theosophically minded banker,” and quickly turned it into a vitalorgan of progressive thought.14 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber653] Along withmore obscure writers, it published Shaw, H. G. Wells, and G. K. Chesterton, andits sole editorial policy was that what it printed had to excite argument anddebate. Before moving to London and acquiring The New Age, Orage had been ateacher in Leeds, where his interest in Plato and the boredom of the classroomled him to Theosophy. He was also a keen student of eastern religion; likeGandhi, the Bhagavad Gita was an important work for him, and as an editor, hetook the Mahabharata as the benchmark of literary style and excellence.In 1904, Orage gave a lecture to the Leeds and Manchester branch of theTheosophical Society on “Consciousness: Animal, Human, and Superman.” Like R. M.Bucke, Orage believed that mankind was on the brink of a new stage in itsevolution, what he called “superman consciousness,” compared to which oureveryday human consciousness is “inferior . . . just as an embryo in an egg isinferior to the bird flying in the air.”15 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber654] ForOrage, “superman consciousness” is an intensification of our normalself-consciousness, in which the self that we take for granted would become anobject of study and analysis by something higher. Orage believed that “theactivity of the inner senses is beginning to slowly predominate over the outersenses,” the basic mechanism of esoteric consciousness. And Orage makes clearthat this process proceeds through imagination. For him, “evolution isaltogether an imaginative process. You become what you have been led to imagineyourself to be.”16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber655] This amounts to joining theRosicrucians by becoming one.Orage’s Nietzschean sensibilities soon distanced him from most rank-and-fileTheosophists, just as his Platonic dialectic made him an opponent of much murkymysticism. In an article for the Theosophical Review, Orage contrasted what hecalled the “occult arts” with the “occult faculties.” While the former canobsess and devour people, often turning them into “cranks”—some people cannotmake a decision without consulting the Tarot—“occult faculties” free the mindand enable it to soar. The faculties in question—intuition, insight, andimagination—Orage called “winged thought,” “winged judgment,” and “wingedsympathy.” The difference between the two is that while arts can be lost orforgotten, faculties, once acquired, remain.17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber656]ANNIE BESANTAnother Fabian socialist who also found herself in the Theosophical fold was, aswe have seen, Annie Besant. But while Orage’s politics were for the most parttheoretical and Platonic, Besant’s had a more practical slant. Secularism,woman’s rights, workers’ rights, and education were only some of the causes sheadvanced. Born in London in 1847, she gained notoriety in 1877 when she wasarrested with the secularist Charles Bradlaugh for publishing a book on birthcontrol by the American family-planner Charles Knowlton. Her championing ofequal rights between the sexes cost her her marriage and the custody of herchildren. A natural public speaker, she came to national attention in 1887 fordemonstrating against unemployment in the famous “Bloody Sunday” riots inTrafalgar Square. In 1888, she led a successful fight to improve the workingconditions for London’s “match girls,” then, while on the London school board,improved the lives of thousands of schoolchildren. She also helped dockworkers.Her private life was also eventful, having affairs with, among others, BernardShaw.After reviewing The Secret Doctrine for The Pall Mall Gazette—whose editor, W.T. Stead, was a spiritualist and later one of the fatalities of theTitanic—Besant visited Madame Blavatsky. At the end of their meeting, Blavatskyasked Besant to “come among us.” She did. It was a decision that changed herlife. She became a regular visitor, and not long after, in August 1890,Blavatsky moved into Besant’s home in London’s affluent St. John’s Wood. Aseasoned campaigner, Besant quickly moved up the Theosophical ranks, anascension not without its costs. Besant was obliged to publicly renounce herearlier views on birth control, and in 1891, she gave a farewell speech to theNational Secularist Society. There were, however, compensations. In 1890, shebecame co-editor of Blavatsky’s Theosophical journal, Lucifer (which laterbecame the Theosophical Review), and in the same year was made president of theBlavatsky Lodge, a development that left her rival, A. P. Sinnett, withleadership of the less prestigious London Lodge. With Blavatsky’s death, Besantbecame head of the Esoteric Section as well. Not everyone was happy with hersuccess. There would later be a “back to Blavatsky” protest, and schisms wouldsoon lead to the society separating into Indian, American, and English entities,distinct from each other yet united by a sometimes friendly but often bitterrivalry.Key were the Masters, and after HPB’s death, a race ensued to see who could makecontact with them. Olcott remained head of the society until his death in 1907,when Besant took over, but he was always a more administrative than esotericfigure, and his contacts with the Masters had always come through HPB. Sinnett’scommunication with them had dwindled, and he resorted to a series of psychics inorder to renew it, but with no luck. William Quan Judge, who had stayed inAmerica, claimed to have made contact and hence was HPB’s rightful heir, butOlcott dismissed this. Other, “renegade” Theosophists like Katherine Tingley andAlice Bailey made their own contact, but their influence was limited, and they,like Judge, started their own societies. If Besant was to capture the throne,she needed a secure hotline to the Mahatmas.C. W. LEADBEATER AND KRISHNAMURTI’S AURAThis came in the form of one of Theosophy’s most controversial characters,Bishop Charles W. Leadbeater, who joined the society in 1883. He too wanted tocommunicate with the Masters, and while in Adyar, India, with HPB, he did—muchto Blavatsky’s annoyance. Leadbeater claimed he was clairvoyant, and along withbeing able to communicate with the Masters, he was also able to journey on the“Akashic planes,” and to see auras, a kind of energy field around the humanbody, a development from Mesmer’s “animal magnetism” and Levi’s “astral light.”It was through this strange ability that Leadbeater made a momentous discovery.Leadbeater is best known as the man who discovered the teenage JidduKrishnamurti on a riverbank near the Theosophical compound in Adyar in 1909. Hisaura, Leadbeater said, was remarkable, and Leadbeater announced thatKrishnamurti was destined to become a “world teacher.” Besant was thrilled withthe idea and agreed, creating special orders within the society to promote her“World Teacher Project.”Krishnamurti played the part of a Theosophical saint for many years, but hisavatarship was not accepted by all Theosophists. One in particular, RudolfSteiner, rejected it vehemently and left Theosophy to start his own movement.Eventually Krishnamurti himself was not happy with his role, and in 1929, at theage of thirty-four, at a large Theosophical gathering, he renounced both his“god-manship” and Theosophy. “Truth,” he said, “was a pathless land,” one bestentered by clearing the mind and allowing the inner silence to be heard, adoctrine similar to the via negativa of Meister Eckhart and The Cloud ofUnknowing. Krishnamurti went on to become an influential itinerant nonteacher ofa nondoctrine, traveling around the world, put up by affluent hosts, andinspiring important figures such as Aldous Huxley, Igor Stravinsky, and thephysicist David Bohm.18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber657] He died in 1986.Leadbeater’s “discovery” seemed dubious to many because of his knownpredilection for young boys, and prior to Krishnamurti, he had already“discovered” two other candidates for the role of “world teacher”; what becameof them is unclear. He had also got into Theosophical hot water in 1906 when itcame out that he had taught some adolescent Theosophists the basics inmasturbation, an ironic echo of Besant’s own earlier advocacy of sex education.Yet it was his clairvoyant abilities that enabled Besant to outpace her rivals.They met in 1890, and after Blavatsky’s passing, Leadbeater became Besant’s“channel” to the Masters. They had by now become something more than remarkablemen, possessed of incredible powers but still flesh and blood, as they hadalways been for HPB. With Besant and Leadbeater, they were transformed intosomething more supernatural, and it is with them that the road to the “ascendedMasters,” by now traveled by many, begins. Besant had little clairvoyantability—Leadbeater tutored her in it—but the two began a kind of “open door”policy on the astral plane, making it very difficult to verify or disproveanyone’s claim to have spoken with a Master or traveled to Atlantis the nightbefore.Their efforts did garner some results, some of which we have already seen. Inanother joint work, Occult Chemistry (1908), Besant and Leadbeater clairvoyantlyinvestigated the structure of atoms. While this may seem doubtful, there is somepossibility that through Stan Gooch’s “direct perception,” they did achieve someknowledge “even of atomic and molecular structure.” In a book calledExtra-sensory Perception of Quarks, Stephen Phillips, a professor of particlephysics, suggests that in describing the structure of a hydrogen atomclairvoyantly, Besant and Leadbeater had hit on the existence of “quarks,”strange subatomic particles that were first proposed by the physicist MurrayGell-Mann in 1961. Phillips maintains that the picture of the hydrogen atomgiven in Occult Chemistry would have looked ridiculous to any scientist in 1908,well before the existence of quarks was even suspected, but that today it is notso strange and bears an eerie resemblance to Gell-Mann’s model.19[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber658]HOME RULEBesant and Leadbeater’s clairvoyant claims may be questioned, but what is not indoubt is the success Besant had with more verifiable achievements. Notsurprisingly, these came in the realm of politics. In 1893, Besant went toIndia, where she was met by Olcott, and her journeys around the subcontinentwere like a royal procession, with huge crowds turning out to see her. Blavatskywas critical of the British Raj and had always spoken out for Indianindependence; along with A. P. Sinnett, who promoted Theosophy during hiseditorship of the Allahabad Pioneer, one of her important Indian converts was A.O. Hume, a British Hinduphile who in 1885 had organized the first meeting of theIndian National Congress. Now a reforming firebrand Theosophist who had foughtfor the weak and oppressed had landed on India’s shores.For many, promoting Indian spirituality was tantamount to supporting Indianindependence, and the thousands who heard Besant’s speeches made this known.Like HPB before her, Besant “went native,” learning Sanskrit, wearing localdress, and starting a Central Hindu College; her aim was much like Plato’s withhis Academy millennia earlier: to secure new leadership for India’s future. Shejoined the Indian National Congress and designed its banner, and it would bethrough the Congress that Gandhi would eventually achieve an independent India.(In his book on Home Rule, Gandhi said that in the early days, all the topmembers of the Congress were Theosophists.)It was Besant who initiated Jawaharlal Nehru into the society. Besant campaignedfor Indian independence for the rest of her life, a cause that landed her inmuch trouble. At the outbreak of World War I, she risked charges of treason byborrowing a phrase from her Irish Home Rule campaign: “England’s need is India’sopportunity”; and as editor of New India, she fiercely criticized British rule.In 1916, she started the All India Home Rule League and led it in massivedemonstrations. Ordered to leave India in 1917, she refused and was arrested; inthe garden of her compound, she flew a red and green flag, India’s colors.Nationwide protests demanded her release, and Gandhi wrote letters to thegovernment calling for her freedom. The British were forced to back down, andamid assurances that an independent India was its ultimate aim, released Besant.Her freedom triggered a national celebration and she was made president of theNational Congress. Besant died in 1933 (Leadbeater followed the next year), andin 1947, her cause prevailed when India became an independent nation.OUSPENSKY’S FOURTH DIMENSIONThe Russian philosopher and writer P. D. Ouspensky came to Theosophy in 1907, inhis late twenties, and remained in the society until the outbreak of World WarI. Although early on he recognized Theosophy’s faults—that its initial creativesurge had hardened into dogma—Theosophical ideas remained with him throughouthis life. He was always proud of the fact that during his “search for themiraculous” he was treated as an esoteric V.I.P. when he visited the society’sheadquarters at Adyar. The compound’s three floors indicated a visitor’simportance. The ground floor was open to hangers-on, and the second to importantfinancial donors. But the top floor was reserved solely for visitors of thehighest Theosophical rank. Ouspensky was admitted to this group immediately onhis arrival. According to his contemporary, the Christian existentialistphilosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, a critic of Blavatsky and Steiner, Ouspensky was“the most independent and talented Theosophical writer we have.” Like Orage,Ouspensky brought a disciplined, critical mind to his esoteric studies, and hisbrilliance shines through in his writings.Ouspensky was interested in the “miraculous” from a young age, and one questionthat obsessed him throughout his life was the mystery of time. Like the writerJ. B. Priestley, who was influenced by his ideas, Ouspensky was a “time-hauntedman.” One expression of this was his fascination with Nietzsche’s idea of the“eternal recurrence,” the belief that our lives are repeated over and overwithout change throughout eternity. For Nietzsche, such cosmic reruns were atest of one’s ability to affirm life—only the superman, Nietzsche believed, wasstrong enough to do so—but Ouspensky thought more of how one could escape thewheel of repetition. His novel Strange Life of Ivan Osokin (1915), aninspiration for Harold Ramis’s film Groundhog Day, explored this theme, and inhis last days Ouspensky tried to fix the memories of his life in hisconsciousness so that next time he “recurred,” he would remember.Ouspensky was also fascinated with the idea of the “fourth dimension,” a latenineteenth-century philosophical puzzle that captured the attention of figureslike Albert Einstein and H. G. Wells, whose debut work, The Time Machine,popularized it. As chaos theory and fractals enjoyed wide attention in the1990s, the fourth dimension became a kind of craze during the fin-de-siècle. Thewriter Charles Hinton wrote several popular books on the subject—he coined theterm “tesseract,” meaning a “four-dimensional cube”—and developed what he calledthe “Hinton cube,” something like a multicolored Rubik’s cube made of smallermovable cubes, that would enable one to see things “four dimensionally.”Many settled for seeing the “fourth dimension” as time, but Ouspensky expandedon the idea, as well as the number of dimensions, and in his still exciting andwidely influential metaphysical, work, Tertium Organum, (The Third Organ ofThought, 1912), superseding Aristotle’s and Francis Bacon’s—he brought togetherHermetic, Theosophical, Neoplatonic, and philosophical ideas to argue his basicvision: the need to go beyond the positivistic logic that dominated thephilosophy of the time and reduced the world to the kind of dead mechanismassociated with an extreme left-brain perspective.Ouspensky’s inspiration for Tertium Organum came from many sources—Nietzsche,Kant, mathematics, Blavatsky, Plotinus, Kabbalah, Hermeticism, nature, sex, art,poetry, and literature—and with Isis Unveiled, the book is an attempt to achievea new Pansophic vision, uniting mysticism and science. One source of Ouspensky’sinspiration was the series of experiments with altered states of consciousnesshe conducted using nitrous oxide and hashish in his small apartment in St.Petersburg sometime around 1911, and which we touched on in Chapter Six.Ouspensky was familiar with William James’s account of his own nitrous oxideexperiment and with Bucke’s Cosmic Consciousness, and he discusses both atlength.He was also familiar with the work of his older contemporary, the now forgottenpoet and social reformer Edward Carpenter, an intimate of Walt Whitman, whomBucke considered a modern example of cosmic consciousness. Carpenter’s bookCivilization: Its Cause and Cure (1889), an early argument for “dropping out,”can be seen as an inspiration for social experiments like Monte Verità, and likeOrage he embodied a medley of the forms of the “new life” cropping up at thetime. An early gay activist among other things, Carpenter was also a Fabiansocialist, a vegetarian, and a leader of “dress reform”; we have him to thankfor the fashion of wearing sandals in the summer. More important, in his bookFrom Adam’s Peak to Elephanta, published in 1892, about his journey throughCeylon and India, Carpenter describes his mystical experiences of “consciousnesswithout thought.” It was these and his Whitmanesque poem Toward Democracy (1883)that Bucke saw as evidence of cosmic consciousness.Ouspensky’s own account of his consciousness experiments should be read byanyone interested in understanding the fundamental realities underpinning theesoteric view. His initial access to these inner worlds revealed to him that hehad entered a dimension of total unity in which there was “nothing separate,that is, nothing that can be named or described separately.” Ouspensky hadexperienced “the network of connections linking everything with everythingelse,” the fundamental relationality of consciousness. Among paranormal andmagical experiences—too many to describe here—Ouspensky was also struck by hisstrange ability to “enter into” things, to feel himself part of them, as Bergsonsaid was true of intuition and Schwaller de Lubicz said of the “intelligence ofthe heart.”Ouspensky belonged to the generation of “God Seekers” that characterizedRussia’s esoteric fin-de-siècle—Berdyaev and Vladimir Soloviev were amongthem—and his work influenced the Russian avant-garde. As Besant and Leadbeater’sThought Forms influenced Kandinsky, Ouspensky’s Tertium Organum inspired manyartists seeking new directions for their work. One of these was the painterKazimir Malevich, with Kandinsky and Mondrian one of the creators of abstractart, who attended some of Ouspensky’s lectures. In his translation of the firstmajor book about Cubism, Du Cubisme (1912) by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger,the artist Mikhail Matiushin includes passages from Tertium Organum, linkingOuspensky’s ideas to the new “aperspectival” art—in Jean Gebser’s term—emergingwith Picasso and Braque in Paris.Ouspensky understood the visionary function of art, and the ability of theimagination to open other worlds. “In art it is necessary to study ‘occultism,’”he wrote. “The artist must be clairvoyant; he must see that which others do notsee; he must be a magician.”20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber659] Ouspenskyhimself was a regular at the Stray Dog Café, a St. Petersburg bohemian wateringhole, where he hoisted glasses with the avant-garde elite such as the poetsVladimir Mayakovsky and Anna Akhmatova. Other regulars were the novelists AndreiBely, whose Petersburg (1916) is a hallucinatory modernist novel filled withoccult ideas—mostly taken from Rudolf Steiner; and Valery Bryusov, whose TheFiery Angel (1908) is a classic account of witchcraft, in which CorneliusAgrippa is a character.21 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber660] At one pointOuspensky even explained the fourth dimension to Leo Tolstoy, mapping out itscontours on a tablecloth, while Tolstoy spoke of how his experiences withFreemasonry informed War and Peace.DR. STEINER, I PRESUME?Another thinker to emerge from the Theosophical milieu who combined an interestin esotericism with an acute philosophical mind was Rudolf Steiner. Asmentioned, Steiner broke with Theosophy over Besant’s and Leadbeater’s promotionof Krishnamurti as the new world teacher. But even before this, he had his ownideas about how esotericism should be pursued. Where Blavatsky and Besant lookedtoward the East, Steiner was adamantly western, and the Anthroposophy hedeveloped after 1912 was a unique amalgam of Theosophy, German philosophy, andesoteric Christianity.Steiner was born in 1861 in Kraljevec, a small rural town in what was thenHungary but is now part of Croatia. From an early age he showed signs ofclairvoyance. His father worked on the railway, and one day sitting in thestation, Steiner saw a strange woman whom he didn’t know but who bore a strongresemblance to members of his family. She said, “Try to help me as much as youcan—now as well as in later life,” then vanished. Steiner kept this to himselfbut when he saw his father, he noticed he was sad and then learned that a femalerelative had committed suicide at the same time as the mysterious woman hadappeared to him. Like Swedenborg and William Blake, Steiner was a bornvisionary, and while other boys were busy playing games he was preoccupied withthe spirit world.Something else that preoccupied the young Steiner was geometry. It had the sameeffect on him as on Pythagoras and Plato, that of introducing him to anotherworld, that of ideas and logical relations, which, although intangible, was asreal, if not more so, as the physical world. Steiner was deeply introverted andit was relief for him when he discovered that “one can work out forms which areseen purely inwardly, independent of the outer world.” This came as aconsolation to the young boy, who felt isolated because no one he knew couldanswer the many questions that filled his mind. “To be able to grasp somethingpurely spiritual brought me an inner joy,” Steiner wrote in his Autobiography.“Through geometry,” Steiner said, “I first experienced happiness.”This combination of psychic ability and scientific precision characterizedSteiner’s approach to esoteric knowledge. For him, geometry and his psychicvisions occupied the same “spiritual space,” an interior universe that was the“setting for spiritual beings and events.” Thoughts for the young Steiner werenot “mere pictures we form of things”; they were instead “revelations of aspiritual world seen on the stage of the soul.” As many secret teachers did,Steiner recognized that our inner world is just as objective as the outer one.As he would later tell his students, the triangles that you or I visualize inour minds are not separate, different triangles, but the same one, just as theideas of truth, beauty, or goodness we reflect on are not separate ideas,“personal” to ourselves, but objective realities that we encounter, just as weencounter objective realities in the physical world.Steiner’s geometrical insights were soon informed by his wide reading in scienceand German Idealist philosophy, thinkers like Kant, Schelling, and Hegel, andhis psychic experiences found some guidance through meeting a curiousindividual. At eighteen, while on the train to Vienna, where he studied at theInstitute of Technology, Steiner met Felix Koguzki, a middle-age herb gathererand “simple man of the people.” Felix too saw spirits, not only of the dead, butof “living nature,” the sort of perception that Paracelsus and Boehme had of the“signature of things.” Steiner was relieved to find someone he could talk toabout his psychic experiences, and Koguzki shared his insights and understandingof the spirit world with the young visionary.Steiner believed their encounter was not by chance, and soon after meetingKoguzki, Steiner had another meeting. This was with someone he called “theMaster.” Who this was is unknown; all we know about him is that he told Steinerthat he would find much significance in some passages of the philosopher Fichte,a follower of Kant and friend of Novalis. Fichte wanted to understand the activenature of the mind, an insight that would inform the philosopher Husserl’sreflections on the “intentionality” of consciousness, touched on in Chapter Ten.The Master also told Steiner that in order to overcome the materialism of themodern world—a mission that, like Madame Blavatsky, Steiner embraced—he wouldhave to begin by understanding it. Steiner did, complementing his psychicexperiences and study of idealist philosophy with a solid grounding innineteenth-century science.FROM ACTIVE SEEING TO SUPERSENSIBLE PERCEPTIONThe most powerful influence on Steiner, however, was, as mentioned, Goethe, andSteiner first came to public attention as the editor of Goethe’s scientificwriting. Steiner saw a link between Goethe’s “active seeing” and his ownrecognition of the objective reality of ideas, thoughts, and spirits. It wasthrough a combination of these that he developed his notion of “supersensibleperception,” the ability to perceive realities of the spirit through a processof thought, a cognition that went beyond the senses. Unlike trance states andmediumship, Steiner’s “supersensible perception” was a wholly consciousactivity, one that could be pursued through a series of conscious mentalexercises, much as Plotinus believed that realization of the One could beachieved through conscious reflection alone. In his book Knowledge of the HigherWorlds and Its Attainment (1905), Steiner outlined a process through which onecould learn how to achieve “supersensible perception” by developing the powersof intuition, inspiration, and imagination. Steiner was a remarkably versatileindividual, and the results of his “supersensible perception” would enjoy a wideapplication, informing architecture, farming, dance, art, theater, education,and medicine.Steiner spelled out his ideas about the irreducible reality of the “I,” theactive nature of thinking, and the fundamental fact of spiritual freedom in hismajor philosophical work, The Philosophy of Freedom, published in 1894. Thescientific thinking he was at pains to understand denied the reality of the “I,”and reduced its apparent free will to an illusion, as much of contemporaryphilosophy of mind still does. But Steiner insisted that it is only as a“spiritually free being” that we can engage in thinking at all. Steiner hadrediscovered the essential insight, first voiced by the French philosopher Mainede Biran in the early nineteenth century, that when I make an effort, I have adirect, unmediated experience of my free will. By definition, no effort can bemechanical. No machine can pull itself together, grit its teeth, and “tryharder.” Only a being with free will can do that. Yet it was not as aphilosopher that Steiner made his mark. Steiner sent a copy of his book toEduard von Hartmann, author of the once immensely popular The Philosophy of theUnconscious (1869), eager to hear his response. Hartmann had a thoroughlypessimistic view of human consciousness—it was, he believed, merely a lightilluminating a meaningless world—and thought Steiner had simply muddled thequestion.STEINER AND THEOSOPHYAfter unsuccessful attempts to launch himself in the literary worlds of Viennaand Berlin, Steiner became a kind of freelance intellectual, lecturing towhoever would have him. Like the Pansophists of old, Steiner was a polymath, andhe spoke on a variety of topics, from Marxism to mathematics. In 1900, Steinerwas asked to speak to the Berlin branch of the Theosophical Society on thephilosophy of Nietzsche. Soon after, he was asked to return to lecture onGoethe’s Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily. Steiner was asuccess, and for the first time, he felt he could speak about his spiritualinsights in public. More lectures followed. It was clear that Steiner spoke fromexperience, and also that his vision was focused more on the western spiritualtradition than that of the East. Steiner spoke of Christ’s incarnation as theculmination of the ancient Mystery tradition that included Plato, Pythagoras,and the pre-Socratics. Later, Steiner’s “supersensible” reading of the Akashicrecord would reveal mankind’s participation in a vast cosmic evolutionaryprocess, stretching back to our pre-physical origins in the spiritual planes.Steiner’s different spiritual “epochs” parallel the Gnostic, Hermetic, andNeoplatonic emanationist “ladder of being” mentioned throughout this book. Inbooks like An Outline of Occult Science (1910) and Cosmic Memory (1937)—acollection of essays originally published in Steiner’s magazineLucifer-Gnosis—Steiner shared his vision of the “evolution of consciousness,”which is simultaneously an evolution of the cosmos. This began in an unmanifestsource Steiner called “Old Saturn,” and gradually solidified through stages hecalls “Old Sun” and “Old Moon” into our present physical cosmos, subject to thesenses. This incarnation, however, was necessary for the development of ourindependent egos, and it triggers the ascent back to the spirit realms, throughour coming “Jupiter” stage, then through “Venus” and “Vulcan.” The similaritywith the Hermetic journey through the planets seems clear. The midpoint of thisprocess for Steiner was Christ’s incarnation and crucifixion—“the Mystery ofGolgotha”—which he considered the single most important event in humanhistory.22 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber661]In 1902, Steiner was asked to become the head of the Theosophical Society’sGerman branch. Within a few years his importance in the society rivaled AnnieBesant’s, and the two would have more than one difference of opinion. Steinercrisscrossed Europe, lecturing almost nonstop—he gave some six thousand talks inhis lifetime—informing his audiences about reincarnation, the etheric body, theAkashic record, Atlantis, Lemuria, as well as health, diet, art, and much more.His central idea, which we can appreciate whether or not we accept Theosophy orAnthroposophy, is a form of the participatory consciousness we have explored inthis book. In his early work, Goethe’s Conception of the World, published in1897, Steiner wrote, “Man is not there [in existence] in order to form forhimself a picture of the finished world; nay, he himself cooperates in bringingthe world into existence.” It is through our consciousness, our ideas, that theworld, for Steiner, becomes “complete.” Without our imaginative contribution,all that remains are empty, physical forms.As had Blavatsky, Steiner believed that mankind was involved in a tremendousstruggle against the forces of materialism, which Steiner embodied in the formof the spiritual being Ahriman, the destructive spirit of Zoroastrianism. Alongwith his counterpart, Lucifer (the fallen angel and spirit of hubris who temptsman with the illusion of pride), Ahriman seeks to deflect humanity from its trueevolution by inculcating the belief in a dead, mechanical world, subject to therequirements of technology. As mentioned in the Introduction, it was thecreative mediation between these two forces, which left on their own are highlydestructive, that Steiner saw as the task of mankind.THE END OF OLD EUROPEOn June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife, the Duchessof Hohenberg, were shot dead in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Their assassin was GavriloPrincip, a Bosnian Serb, Yugoslavian nationalist, and member of the Black Handsecret society. A month later, Europe erupted into World War I. Although thetwentieth century was midway into its second decade, the hostilities that hadthe armies of Great Britain, France, and Russia on one side, and of Germany andAustria-Hungary on the other killing each other—and which soon drew in Italy,Japan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, the United States, and other countries—can beseen as the true end of the nineteenth century.The peace and prosperity of La Belle Époque were over, and chaos and barbarityhad descended on the world. The positive thrust of the fin-de-siècle was cutshort and the optimism that had energized the age had vanished. After an initialspurt of mobilization and hopes for an early decisive victory, the Germanadvance on Paris stalled, and the deadly tedium of trench warfare began. A greatgouge known as the Western Front sliced through Belgium, France, and Germanyfrom the North Sea to Switzerland, on opposite sides of which the Allies and theCentral Powers maintained a murderous stalemate, with many lives lost for noappreciable gain. In the end, four years later, after a costly Allied victory,some sixteen million people, combatants and civilians combined, had died andmuch of the Continent was devastated. “Old western culture,” as C. S. Lewiscalled it, was no more. A sense of the impact of the “Great War”—which, untilits outbreak seemed unthinkable—can be seen in the title of the Viennesesatirist Karl Kraus’s play about it, The Last Days of Mankind.Along with its own carnage, the war brought famine, disease, economic collapse,revolution, and the end of empire. When the smoke from the “guns of August”cleared, the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires had ceased to exist. Russiahad exploded in a violent Marxist revolution and subsequent civil war; withGermany, where there was fighting in the streets, apparently about to do thesame. It was supposed to be the “war to end all wars,” a phrase associated withthe American president Woodrow Wilson, but which originated with H. G. Wells.23[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber662]Sadly, Wells, an otherwise very accurate prophet, missed the mark on this one,and twenty years after the armistice on November 11, 1918, Europe and the restof the world was poised to do it again. A new age had indeed emerged, but with afew possible exceptions—Aleister Crowley had, it is true, envisaged a coming eraof “force and fire”—it was not one most visionaries had expected. A few yearsinto the brooding decades entre-deux-guerres, the poet T. S. Eliot—himself nomean student of esoteric philosophy—captured the defeated spirit of the time inhis poem The Waste Land, which appeared in 1922 and marked the fractured,broken, alienated mood that would dominate henceforth. With its references tothe Tarot, Madame Blavatsky, Hermann Hesse, the Grail legends, The Golden Bough,and the Upanishads, Eliot’s modernist manifesto remains an example of howesoteric ideas continued to inform the western mind, even as the shadow ofmeaninglessness crept over its consciousness.The war would bring different challenges to the new era’s secret teachers and itwould introduce some new names to their roster. It would also usher in whatseems a kind of “golden age” of modern western esotericism, a period when someof the most important and influential figures were working at the same time andin relatively the same place. This “golden age” would eventually lead to our owntime, when the teachers were no longer so secret and what they taught becamemore readily available.But before this, one rather secretive secret teacher made a somewhat startlingdebut.MEETING A REMARKABLE MANThe beginning of the war found P. D. Ouspensky returning to Russia after his“search for the miraculous” had left him empty-handed. He had gone to Egypt,India, Ceylon, and other places in order to discover “the unknown” and to find“schools” and “teachers” who could show him the way to it. His search had beenunsuccessful and the war now seemed to throw his efforts into chaos. He saw itstoically as “one of those generally catastrophic conditions of life in themidst of which we have to live and work and seek answers to our questions anddoubts.”24 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber663] Ouspensky did not find what he wasseeking amid the pyramids of Egypt or the ashrams of India, but in early 1915,in a small, rather seedy backstreet café in Moscow, the miraculous, it seemed,found him.It appeared in the form of a “Caucasian Greek,” a “certain G,” whose followershad entreated Ouspensky, a well-known journalist and writer, to meet, and whohad been charged with the task of “ensnaring” Ouspensky into such a meeting.25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber664] Just as Madame Blavatsky had gone out of herway to meet and seduce Colonel Olcott—their relationship was Platonic, but thisis the correct word—the disciples of this “certain G” had been given the task ofreading Ouspensky’s works and ensuring that he would agree to meet their masterwho, it appears, had plans for him. After a fruitless, months’-long search for“teachers” and “schools,” Ouspensky was not in the market for a guru, but aftermeeting this “certain G,” he had indisputably found one. The result can be foundin Ouspensky’s posthumously published masterpiece In Search of the Miraculous(1949), an account of his years as this “certain G’s” student, and still thebest introduction to his ideas.Ouspensky’s “G” was Georges Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, an enigmaticGreek-Armenian-Russian esoteric teacher whose name has turned up several timesthroughout this book. Like Madame Blavatsky’s, Gurdjieff’s early years arewrapped in mystery, an ambiguity that, also like Madame Blavatsky, Gurdjieffwent out of his way to perpetuate. Even the year of his birth is uncertain,given variously as 1866, 1872, 1874, and 1877, depending on which biography youread. More certain is his place of birth, which, depending on the year waseither under Turkish rule and called Gümrü or under Russian rule and calledAlexandropol. At any rate, it and the town Gurdjieff’s family moved to when hewas a boy, Kars, are now part of Armenia. Gurdjieff grew up in a racial,national, linguistic, and cultural melting pot, a turbulent, unsettled, andshifting world that demanded one think on one’s feet, a talent Gurdjieff laboredhard to pass on to his students.From the moment he met Gurdjieff, Ouspensky was impressed. He was, it seemed, aman who knew. Gurdjieff knew of Ouspensky’s travels and he spoke to him ofplaces he knew well and of which Ouspensky had only heard. They spoke of yoga,India, esotericism, “schools,” and the use of drugs to induce unusual states ofconsciousness. But what struck Ouspensky most was Gurdjieff’s insistence on whatat first seemed to him an absurd idea but which soon became a central tenet ofhis own philosophy.Human beings, Gurdjieff told Ouspensky, are asleep. They are machines whobelieve they are awake and possess free will. But they are really only machineswhose every action, every thought, is mechanical. “All the people you see, allthe people you know,” Gurdjieff told Ouspensky, “all the people you may get toknow, are machines, actual machines working solely under the power of externalinfluences.”26 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber665] Ouspensky was at first put offby this sweeping indictment of humanity’s unconsciousness. It was, in essence,identical to ideas about human psychology promoted by the reductionist scienceOuspensky had opposed in Tertium Organum. But with a world exploding into war,with each side blaming the other, he had ample evidence to judge its accuracy.REMEMBER YOUR SELFOuspensky was struck by Gurdjieff’s knowledge, which combined a psychologicalacuity equal to Freud’s or Nietzsche’s with a cosmology that, at first sight,seems frankly outlandish. Many of Gurdjieff’s insights into human weaknessOuspensky had come to on his own, but one psychological oddity Gurdjieff spokeof seemed a revelation. This was the notion of “self-remembering,” theobservation that human beings do not “remember” themselves.Absorbed in the demands of life, we forget our own existence; we take it forgranted, and suffer, as Gurdjieff’s younger contemporary, Martin Heidegger putit, a “forgetfulness of being.”27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber666] For most ofour life, “we” do not exist—that is, we do not possess a vivid, vital awarenessof our own being. It is only in moments of crisis, or when we find ourselves insome strange, new environment—say, finding ourselves alone in a city we havenever visited—that an awareness of our own existence comes over us and we havethe slightly uncanny feeling of “What? Me, here?” With this often comes a vividrecognition that much of our life is lived in a dream. Ouspensky’s own deepponderings on time, eternal recurrence, and the disorienting feeling of déjà vu,the sense that he had been here before, made the importance of “rememberinghimself” that much more urgent.I would suggest that the “forgetfulness of being” that Gurdjieff and Heideggerrecognized in human consciousness stems from our overly dominant left brain,which reduces the richness of experience to easily managed “symbols,” dehydratedsurfaces of life through which we can easily maneuver. This allows us to copewith an increasingly complex and demanding environment, but at the expense ofliving a kind of “half-life,” which is doubly dangerous because we mistakenlyaccept it as the “real thing.” It is only in moments of crisis or deeprelaxation that, in Yeats’s phrase, we complete our “partial mind”—allow inright-brain vividness—and, to paraphrase the poet, for an instant stand at ease,laugh aloud, our hearts at peace—feel, that is, fully alive and are amazed atit, something that occurs to anyone who has ever shaken off their “forgetfulnessof being.”28 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber667]FOOD FOR THE MOONBut these moments of self-remembering, at least according to Gurdjieff, are fewand far between. Everything around us, Gurdjieff told Ouspensky, encourages our“self-forgetting,” this “forgetfulness of being,” and it is only throughdetermined and continued efforts at “wakefulness” that we can escape it. This“work,” as Gurdjieff’s teaching came to be called, is, as the ancient alchemistsknew of their work, “against nature.” For nature’s purposes, it is well that we“sleep,” as, contrary to our high opinion of ourselves, we play a rather humblerole in the great scheme of things. If we knew the true “terror of thesituation,” it would, Gurdjieff believed, drive us mad.The truth about our place in the cosmos is that we are what Gurdjieff called“food for the moon.” This requires some explanation.Gurdjieff’s system—often known as the “Fourth Way,” to distinguish it from the“way” of the fakir (body), monk (emotions), or yogi (mind)—speaks of what hecalls “the Ray of Creation,” a variant of the Neoplatonic “Great Chain ofBeing.” For Gurdjieff, this begins with the “Absolute” then passes through “AllWorlds”—all the galaxies in the universe—then to “All Suns”—the stars in ourgalaxy—then our sun, the planets in our solar system, and the Earth, to end inthe moon, which for Gurdjieff was the lowest step on his ladder of being.29[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber668]Unlike the Great Chain of Being, which has a static, timeless character,Gurdjieff’s “Ray” is active, is still growing, and the moon is its point ofgrowth. The entire universe, Gurdjieff believed, is alive, an idea he sharedwith Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead, as well as with the lateNaturphilosopher Gustav Fechner, who first suggested that our Earth was a singleorganism, much in advance of James Lovelock’s “Gaia” hypothesis, proposed in1974.30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber669] The moon is growing into a planet,Gurdjieff suggested, and Jupiter, the biggest planet in our solar system, isgrowing into a sun. Whatever we may think of this, the upshot is that the moon“grows” by feeding on organic life on Earth. “Everything living on the earth,people, animals, plants, is food for the moon.”31[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber670] The moon is fed by the life energy thatorganisms give off at death. In the case of humans, this is the soul.It is not a good thing to find yourself feeding the moon. The moon, forGurdjieff, is subject to many “laws”—ninety-six, to be exact—and the soulstrapped there live a kind of mineral existence and cannot escape. But we canavoid this fate by making “efforts,” by “working on ourselves,” by trying towake up, by defeating our mechanicalness—the left brain, remember, works bestwith machines—by struggling to achieve a state of “self-remembering.” By doingthis, we not only avoid feeding the moon, we free ourselves of the “laws” we aresubject to here on Earth. We can then move up the Ray of Creation, against thestream, as it were, and journey back to the Absolute, which is the source ofconsciousness, will, and freedom. The similarity to the Hermetic journey throughthe planets seems apparent, as does the Gnostic theme of “escape.” The Earth,Gurdjieff told Ouspensky, was in a very bad place in the universe, and helikened our position to that of inmates in a prison, or sheep awaitingslaughter.Gurdjieff told Ouspensky of other cosmic “laws,” such as the “law of octaves,”also known as the “law of seven,” and the “law of three.” Gurdjieff’soctave—again an echo of Pythagoras and the seven ancient planets—explains howsomething that begins one way invariably turns into its opposite, a theory ofenantiodromia that accounts for how Christianity began as a religion of love andturned into intolerance and persecution, or how the liberté, égalité, andfraternité of the French Revolution became the guillotine.32[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber671] The “law of three,” “a fundamental law”responsible for all phenomena in the universe, declares that everything is “theresult of the combination or the meeting of three different opposing forces.”33[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber672] As mentioned, Gurdjieff’s “law of three” hasPythagorean roots—as does his belief that the universe consists ofvibrations—and is in the company of Hinduism’s “three gunas”; alchemy’s sulfur,mercury, and salt; Boehme’s worlds of love and wrath; and Jung’s “transcendentfunction.”SEEKERS OF TRUTHWhere did Gurdjieff learn these laws? Gurdjieff told Ouspensky that in his earlydays, he belonged to a group of like-minded individuals, “specialists” that, inMeetings with Remarkable Men (1963), an account of his early years, he calledthe “Seekers of Truth.” Like many of our secret teachers, as a young manGurdjieff was fascinated by the mysterious side of life and had a passionatecuriosity about the occult, the mystical, and the supernatural. In hisadolescence and teens, he encountered precognition, faith healing, spiritualism,even vampirism. A powerful sense of the living reality of the past, oftradition, came to him when he recognized that the poem his father, a bard,recited came from the epic Gilgamesh, fragments of which had only recently beendiscovered. His search led through religion, philosophy, science, but neitherpriests nor doctors nor scientists could answer his questions. His need to knowand to understand his experience led him to join with others with a similarpassion—as had Madame Blavatsky—and they banded together to explore ancientsites, to study ancient texts, and to find those then alive who knew.This search, Gurdjieff tells us, led him through Egypt, the Holy Lands, andCentral Asia; and on one adventure he found his way to a hidden monastery of anancient secret society known as the “Sarmoung Brotherhood.” The brotherhoodflourished in ancient times—2500 B.C., to be exact—but remnants of it stillexisted. In Meetings with Remarkable Men, Gurdjieff speaks of being blindfoldedand taken to a secret location somewhere in Turkestan, where he learned, amongother things, the “laws” of three and seven. These were taught in the form of“sacred dances” and through the use of a strange apparatus, a kind of tripodwith seven arms, each of which was subdivided into seven segments. These couldbe arranged in different ways and read as a kind of “cosmic alphabet.”Some, like J. G. Bennett, believed in the reality of the Sarmoung Brotherhoodand linked it to a Sufi brotherhood known as the Naq’shbandis.34[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber673] Others, however, will consider Gurdjieff’sbrotherhood something more along the lines of Madame Blavatsky’s secretmonastery in Tibet. As strict autobiography, Meetings with Remarkable Men shouldbe read with several helpings of salt; Gurdjieff’s penchant for leg-pulling iswell known, another trait he shared with Madame Blavatsky. Yet whatever thereality of Gurdjieff’s ancient brotherhood, the insights he says he gained amongthem are less questionable and have practical applications that soon convince oftheir value.A MIRACULOUS ESCAPEGurdjieff came to wide notice in 1921, when Ouspensky escaped a White Russianrefugee camp in Constantinople and was miraculously transported to London,courtesy of a wealthy reader of Tertium Organum.35[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber674] It had become a huge success a year earlier,after the American writer and architect Claude Bragdon, like Ouspensky a devoteeof “higher dimensions,” published it in an English translation. While Ouspenskytaught English to fellow Russian refugees in order to feed his family, TertiumOrganum was being hailed on both sides of the Atlantic, with important writerslike Hart Crane singing its praises. It was with much difficulty and through theefforts of Orage, who had met Ouspensky and had published him in The New Age,that Ouspensky learned of this, received much-needed royalties, and obtained histicket to freedom. Ouspensky had found himself washed to Europe’s edges by theRussian Revolution, which had exploded while he and several others were underGurdjieff’s tutelage. The account of their journeys across a country collapsinginto chaos makes In Search of the Miraculous not only a central work of modernesotericism, but a thrilling and inspiring spiritual adventure story.On his arrival in England, Ouspensky’s savior, Lady Rothermere, wife of apowerful newspaper baron, arranged for him to lecture to the cream of London’sintelligentsia. Some of the names in Ouspensky’s audience included T. S. Eliot,Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, Algernon Blackwood, and Orage.36[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber675] Ouspensky would also lecture to G. R. S.Mead’s Quest Society, which Mead had started in reaction to Annie Besant’s“neo-theosophy.”All of these writers and thinkers would be influenced by Ouspensky’sideas—Eliot’s Four Quartets, for example, are filled with Ouspenskianreflections on time—but what startled many that evening was Ouspensky’srejection of Tertium Organum and his advocacy of Gurdjieff’s grim doctrine. Andwhen Gurdjieff arrived a year later and opened his Institute for the HarmoniousDevelopment of Man in the forest of Fontainebleau, just outside of Paris, manywho had heard Ouspensky’s stark teaching journeyed across the English Channel tolearn from the master himself.One of these was Orage, who went on to become one of Gurdjieff’s most importantdisciples. Another was Maurice Nicoll, a successful psychologist who, with Orageand a few like-minded individuals, had started a “Psychosynthesis Group” tocompensate for the fragmenting effect they felt that Freud’s psychoanalysis washaving. When Nicoll heard Ouspensky, he felt the teacher he had prayed for hadarrived. When he headed to Fontainebleau, he knew that if anyone couldsynthesize his psyche, it was Gurdjieff.Nicoll was quite a catch. He had been handpicked by Freud’s crown prince andlater rival to represent his own variant of psychoanalysis, “analyticalpsychology,” in Great Britain. The mentor Nicoll had thrown over to joinGurdjieff’s work was C. G. Jung.THE MADNESS OF C. G. JUNGJust before the outset of World War I, the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jungfeared for his sanity. A falling-out with his friend and mentor, Sigmund Freud,the Viennese founder of psychoanalysis who looked to Jung as his successor, hadprecipitated a nervous breakdown which Jung’s keen professional expertiserecognized was developing into a full-blown psychosis. At any rate, it wascertainly a textbook example of what Henri Ellenberger called a “creativeillness.”In October 1913, a short time after the publication of his first book, Symbolsof Transformation, announced his rejection of Freud’s sexual theory ofneurosis—and made his first tentative approach toward the “collectiveunconscious”—Jung found himself on a train. The journey from Zurich toSchaffhausen was not long, but it took Jung to another world. In a vision, hesaw a great flood washing over Europe. Debris and bodies floated on the waves,which soon turned to blood. The vision lasted some time and was like a dreamthat had invaded Jung’s consciousness. Other dreams did too, all with the sameapocalyptic message. Having treated many patients with similar complaints duringhis years at Zurich’s Burghölzli Mental Clinic, Jung had cause to be concerned.It is ironic, then, that in July 1914, Jung greeted the announcement of war withsome relief. He was not, it appeared, going mad. He had simply seen the future.Such an experience would have frightened Freud, who while privately acceptingthe paranormal, publicly rejected it. Yet while Jung’s visions had beendisturbing, the fact that they were evidence of psychic activity rather thanmadness comforted him. Throughout most of his career, Jung kept his deep,personal interest in the occult, the supernatural, and the “night side ofnature” relatively discreet, but the truth was that these pursuits were in hisDNA. His grandfather, mother, and other relatives were psychic, and Jung grew upin an atmosphere of spirits, séances, poltergeists, and premonitions.His desire to maintain a respectable scientific reputation led Jung to mute hisinterest in occult phenomena until a near-death experience in 1944 convinced himit was time to come out of the paranormal closet.37[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber676] Jung did, and although he still prevaricated,prefacing his revelations with “scientific” disclaimers, he got the messageacross. In the last years of his life—he died in 1961—Jung became the mostwidely known and publicly respected figure to take the occult, esoteric,Hermetic, and magical tradition seriously. He was never accepted by themainstream intelligentsia, but at a grassroots level, Jung’s ideas spread, andhe is certainly one of the forefathers of our own New Age movement. In manyways, as Madame Blavatsky had opened the door to the Hermetic currents in thelate nineteenth century, Jung did the same for the twentieth.DESCENT INTO THE UNCONSCIOUSJung later declared that all the essentials of his psychology emerged during theturbulent years of his “creative illness.” After months of fending offmadness—and alarming his family in the process—Jung decided to try anothertactic. Sitting at his desk, Jung decided to stop holding back the sense ofoppression and let go. He allowed the fantasies pressing on his consciousness totake over. Almost immediately he found himself in the interior terrain HenryCorbin later called the Imaginal. Jung felt himself drop, and after landing inutter darkness on a soft mass, he discerned the entrance to a cave. He saw adwarf, and after wading through icy water, came upon a huge, glowing redcrystal. Beneath this was the corpse of a blond youth. Floating past, Jung saw agigantic black scarab, then a brilliant sun.In his later terminology, Jung had entered the world of the archetypes, theprimal psychic blueprints that he argued constituted what he came to call the“collective unconscious,” a kind of reservoir of images that our individualminds are connected to and that we share with one another. The collectiveunconscious is a part of our psyche that is more fundamental than our personalunconscious, the collection of memories and dreams concerning our own individuallives. It is a kind of universal psychic substratum of forms—different from butlikened unto Plato’s—that rests below our individual awareness, which, as itwere, floats upon it like ships on the sea. Jung himself linked the collectiveunconscious to the Neoplatonic Anima mundi and to accounts of creation in theCorpus Hermeticum. It was, he believed, the source of myths and religions, andits presence could be discerned in our dreams.The most startling discovery, however, was that this interior world wasinhabited. During another inner descent, Jung found himself in a lunarlikelandscape, where he encountered two individuals whom he took to be Elijah andSalome from the Bible. Jung also saw a huge black snake. Later, other figuresappeared, the most important of whom Jung called “Philemon,” who became a kindof “inner guru” for Jung. Philemon told Jung some extraordinary things. Heinformed him that he was mistaken to believe that everything in his mindbelonged to him. On the contrary, the inner world he had entered was just asobjective as the outer one, with its own flora and fauna. What he discoveredhere no more belonged to him than did the clouds and the birds outside hiswindow. Through Philemon, Jung recognized that “there are things in the psychewhich I do not produce, but which produced themselves and have their ownlife.”38 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber677] In other words, there were things inJung’s mind—and our own—that had nothing to do with him personally. Jung wasjust another inhabitant of this interior world, which he later called the“objective psyche.” Like other inner voyagers we have met—Suhrawardi,Swedenborg, Blake—Jung had found his way to a new world, one, as Aldous Huxleyhad remarked, with its own “unmapped Borneos and Amazonian basins.”Jung did not speak openly of his experience until his last years. His record ofhis “creative illness,” his remarkable Red Book, was kept secret during hislifetime, and was published only in 2009, half a century after his death. Jung’sreticence is perhaps understandable. After Freud’s death in 1939—and AlfredAdler’s in 1937—Jung became the most famous living psychologist, and he wouldremain so until the end of his life. To speak of the visitations of the dead,poltergeists, ghosts, and other “spooky” phenomena that accompanied Jung’s“creative illness”—and continued after it—would jeopardize his hard-wonprofessional reputation. (In my book on Jung, I recount his many psychicexperiences and his equivocalness about them.)But throughout his career, Jung was a rather circumspect secret teacher, andthose who were allowed into his inner circle—like the initiates of old—wereaware of his entrée into the “other world.” Like Swedenborg and Steiner, Jungdeveloped a method of inducing these excursions into the interior. Like them,Jung had a knack for hypnagogia, a natural capacity for “dreaming while awake”that proved very useful. But Jung played his cards close to his chest and heonly dropped hints of his method here and there; he never came out and spokeabout it clearly and openly, at least not in any of his major works.This method Jung called “active imagination,” which I have mentioned earlier. Itis a way of entering into a dialogue with the unconscious, of bringing theconscious and unconscious minds—or left and right brains—into creativecollaboration. This triggers the transcendent function, a reorientation of thelimited ego toward the larger and more inclusive Self, the wider personalitythat encompasses both cerebral hemispheres. Active imagination is in allessentials identical in aim to the methods of inner journeying we have comeacross in this book. But where Suhrawardi spoke openly about Hūrqalyā,Swedenborg of heaven and hell, and Steiner of the “Akashic record,” Jungdemurred—again, perhaps understandably—and spoke only of his empirical findingsabout the character of the psyche. This scientific caution informed most ofJung’s dealings with the occult.JUNG THE GNOSTICFor Stephan Hoeller, a contemporary Gnostic thinker, Jung embodies “one of themost important branches of what has sometimes been called the PansophicTradition, or the wisdom heritage which descended from Gnostic, Hermetic, andNeo-Platonic sources.”39 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber678] Hoeller’s book, TheGnostic Jung and the Seven Sermons to the Dead, from which I have quoted, is ananalysis of Jung’s curious Gnostic text, The Seven Sermons to the Dead, which heproduced in 1916 during his “descent into the unconscious.” Like Crowley’s Bookof the Law and Yeats’s less well-known but no less fascinating A Vision (1925),The Seven Sermons to the Dead is a work of “spiritual dictation.” It came toJung after a peculiarly tense period of psychic disturbance, involving himselfand his family; had Catherine Crowe known of it, it would have found a place inThe Night-Side of Nature. The Seven Sermons were related to Jung by strange,disembodied voices that claimed to have come from Jerusalem. At the end of theirdictation, Jung ascribed the work to “Basilides in Alexandria, the City wherethe East toucheth the West.” Basilides was the Gnostic teacher who especiallyoffended the Christian Justin Martyr (Chapter Four); Abraxas, a Gnostic deityBasilides wrote about, turns up in Jung’s Seven Sermons too.The Seven Sermons is a curious work, and Jung himself was of two minds about it.He mostly kept it to himself, but gave copies to selected readers, who wereasked to keep it secret. It sometimes reaches poetic power, but more often itsbombastic, quasi-biblical style reads like a pastiche of Nietzsche’s Thus SpakeZarathustra, something that is true of the Red Book too. Jung excused theexcesses of the work, saying its highfalutin language was that of thearchetypes. Crowley’s Book of the Law exhibits the same excess, so perhaps Jungis right, although the fact that both Crowley and Jung—they were exactcontemporaries, born in the same year—came from very religious families may havehad something to do with it.The Seven Sermons’s central message is the need to differentiate from the mass,to achieve one’s individuality, to emerge as a separate being from theundifferentiated Pleroma. “The natural striving of the creature goeth towardsdistinctiveness, fighteth against primal, perilous sameness.” “Ye all becomeequal and thus is your nature maimed.”40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber679] It isa doctrine to be found in Nietzsche and William Blake, and would be shared byYeats, Schwaller de Lubicz, and others concerned about the “leveling” aspect ofmodern mass egalitarianism. Abraxas plays an important role, as the mediator andreconciler of opposites. He would do the same in Hermann Hesse’s Gnostic novelDemian, which appeared in 1919, after Hesse himself underwent Jungian analysis.Hesse may have been inspired by Jung’s Seven Sermons; he was one of its fewrecipients.Jung achieved his own “individuation”—or at least discovered a means ofachieving it—in the last days of the war. While serving as commandant at anEnglish prisoner of war camp—although neutral, Switzerland interned anycombatants that crossed its borders—each day Jung sketched a mandala, theTibetan “magic circle.” He came to see the mandala as both an image or symbol ofthe Self—the completed partial mind—and also as a means of stimulating theunification of the opposites out of which the Self emerges.Jung was an effective artist—the watercolors filling the Red Book show that—andhis mandalas were elaborate. His first, which he called “The System of AllWorlds,” is like a work of “hyperphysical cartography,” mentioned in ChapterNine. It is also like the Hermetic representations of the universe Jung wouldsoon study during his investigations into alchemy.Jung studied the Gnostics seriously throughout the 1920s, although his interestin them began in 1912; he even wrote to Freud saying that he believed the wisdomof the Gnostic Sophia may return through the efforts of psychoanalysis. Junglearned much about the Gnostics from G. R. S. Mead, whom he knew and oncevisited in London; Mead’s Fragments of a Faith Forgotten (1900) is a classic ofGnostic scholarship. Yet in a search for a historical antecedent to his idea ofindividuation, Jung abandoned the Gnostics in favor of the alchemists who, aswe’ve seen, he believed practiced active imagination without knowing it.Jung was aware of a connection between psychology and alchemy. He had read hiscolleague Herbert Silberer’s little-known but fascinating book, HiddenSymbolisms of Alchemy and the Occult Arts (1917), which predated Jung’s own workby decades. Silberer, like Jung, was a good hypnagogist, and Jung’s activeimagination and transcendent function may have been informed by Silberer’swritings on hypnagogia.41 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber680]SCHOOLS OF WISDOMJung’s inspiration for his alchemical studies came from his friend, thesinologist Richard Wilhelm, whose translation of the I Ching (the Chinese Bookof Changes), a work of divination and Taoist wisdom, Jung introduced to westernreaders in the 1950s. It would become a Bible of the sixties’ occult revival.Jung’s interest in the I Ching stemmed from his fascination with “meaningfulcoincidences,” what he termed synchronicity. He had been interested in this fordecades, but like most of Jung’s occult interests, he did not speak about itopenly until the last decades of his life. It was Jung’s interest insynchronicty that convinced him to study alchemy. Wilhelm had sent him a copy ofa Taoist alchemical text, The Secret of the Golden Flower, and asked him towrite a commentary on it. Jung had just painted a mandala featuring a goldencastle that struck him as Chinese, something he hadn’t intended. The coincidenceconfirmed Jung’s ideas about mandalas and the Self. His commentary to The Secretof the Golden Flower—which, like western Mystery teachings, is about creating an“inner body” able to survive physical death—contains some of his most directremarks about active imagination and the transcendent function.Jung had met Wilhelm in 1922 at the School of Wisdom established by CountHermann Keyserling in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1920. A friend of Keyserling’s hadattended one of Jung’s seminars and suggested that Jung lecture at Keyserling’sschool. Jung did and he became a familiar figure there. Keyserling came from anaristocratic Baltic Russian family, but had lost his fortune in the BolshevikRevolution. Before this he had traveled around the globe, and his book about hisadventures, The Travel Diary of a Philosopher published in 1919, was a hugesuccess.Keyserling used the royalties from his book to establish his School of Wisdom.Keyserling promoted an eclectic philosophy, gathered from spiritual traditionsfrom around the world; he had a “planetary” outlook well in advance of our own“global” sentiments. Although forgotten today, Keyserling was considered animportant enough thinker that after his death in 1946, his brain was put ondisplay in a museum in Berne, Switzerland; Einstein’s was later added to thecollection.42 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber681]Keyserling’s School of Wisdom aimed to synthesize the vision of the East and theWest, and along with Jung and Wilhelm, other important speakers there includedHermann Hesse and the Indian Nobel Prize–winning poet Rabindranath Tagore. Itwas at the School of Wisdom that Jung met Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn, mentioned earlier,and suggested to her that she use her auditorium at Casa Gabriella for a similarpurpose. It was out of this that the Eranos Conferences began.Count Keyerseling’s was not the only school of wisdom operating at this time.Understandably, the chaos of World War I turned many people’s minds toward thequestion of renewal and of ways to prevent another such catastrophe fromhappening. The massive fatalities also prompted a renewed interest inspiritualism and questions about the meaning and purpose of life. Rudolf Steinerhad spent the war in Dornach, Switzerland, building a remarkable work of“Anthroposophical architecture,” the Goetheanum, an impressive structure offlowing, organic forms erected by Anthroposophists from all the warring nations.Sadly, this fantastic work of Expressionist architecture—one of its giganticwooden domes was bigger than that of St. Peter’s in Rome—burned to the ground onNew Year’s Eve, 1922.43 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber682] Arson by proto-Naziswas suspected, and Steiner immediately began work on its successor, an equallyfantastic temple—now of concrete—built on its predecessor’s ruins, and whichstands today.Steiner had come to international prominence with his book The ThreefoldCommonwealth (1919), which proposed a spiritual reconstruction of Europe basedon a “threefold” vision of the body politic similar to Plato’s Republic. Thebook was a huge success, and for a time Steiner’s political ideas made their wayonto the ballots. His lectures on the subject were jammed, and on one occasionin Berlin, the lines reaching out of the auditorium were large enough to stoptraffic; a lecture in Vienna was attended by some two thousand people. By thistime, however, a wide anti-Steiner sentiment had risen and he came under attackby Catholics, Communists, proto-Nazis, and other occultists. An assassinationattempt on him in Munich—Hitler’s city—by proto-Nazis was foiled when Steiner’sfollowers formed a ring around him and escorted him to safety.One element of Steiner’s “threefold” system that materialized was the WaldorfSchools, which began in 1919 and which have since become a very successfulworldwide source of alternative education; the name “Waldorf” comes from theWaldorf-Astoria cigarette company in Stuttgart, whose owner, an Anthroposophist,financed the project. In the last years of Steiner’s life, his epistemologicalconcerns—stemming from Goethe—took a backseat to more practical developments,and along with Waldorf education, his “bio-dynamic” farming, Anthroposophicalmedicine—its roots in Paracelsian remedies—and architectural ideas have becomefamiliar parts of the alternative landscape.Steiner’s own remarkable vitality began to flag in the early 1920s, and afteryears of lecturing and private teaching—Steiner never refused helping others andthis infinite solicitousness took its toll—his health declined. He died in 1925,aged sixty-four, of a still undisclosed illness. At the end, he was concernedabout the rise of technology, which he saw as Ahrimanic, and his last remarkscalled on his followers to create within themselves “the inner strength not togo under.”Aleister Crowley, who would become one of the icons of the sixties’ occultrevival, spent the war years somewhat ignominiously, writing pro-Germanpropaganda while sitting out the hostilities in New York. Readers can decide forthemselves the credibility of Crowley’s claims that by doing so he was reallysupporting the British war effort. When he returned to England at the end of1919, Crowley’s health—bronchitis and asthma—led to a prescription for heroin,then legal, and his subsequent addiction led to him founding his own school ofwisdom, the Abbey of Thelema, based on The Book of the Law, in Cefalù, Sicily,in 1920. Over the years, Crowley had developed a variety of techniques—mostlyinvolving sex and drugs—for “discovering” one’s “true will,” and as hisreputation in England was abysmal—he was, as Lady Caroline Lamb said of the poetLord Byron, “mad, bad and dangerous to know”—he sought to put down stakeselsewhere.Crowley believed that drugs like heroin and cocaine could be taken freely,without fear of addiction, provided the user knew his or her true will.Crowley’s still-readable novel The Diary of a Drug Fiend (1922)—written underthe influence of heroin and cocaine—is a romanticized and idealized portrait ofhis abbey and of Crowley himself.44 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber683] One reasonfor heading to Sicily is that Crowley wanted to find a warm climate in which tokick his habit.Crowley had a vague intuition that we are cut off from our source of innerpower—which we can see as the right brain—and for all their dubiousness, hisDionysian tactics for reconnecting with it at times worked. Some visitors to hisabbey did find their “true will.” Most, however, found the squalor, lack ofsanitation, frequent sexual rituals involving sodomy and bestiality, andhabitual drug use less to their tastes and left. After the controversial deathof his disciple Raoul Loveday and a series of tabloid exposés, Crowley wasdeported from Italy by its new ruler, Benito Mussolini, in 1923. In the sameyear, Yeats, his magical and poetical rival, won the Nobel Prize for literature.Crowley spent the rest of his life addicted to drugs, perpetually insolvent,exiled from more than one country, and burning as many bridges and ruining asmany lives as his true will required. He also wrote some of the most importantworks on “magick”—as he spelled it—in the twentieth century, such as Magick inTheory and Practice (1929) and The Book of Thoth (1944), one of the mostinfluential books on the Tarot ever written. Crowley spent his last years in aneccentric boarding house in Hastings, near the English Channel, and died in 1947at seventy-two. In a remarkable enantiodromia, the “Wickedest Man in the World”and the “Man We’d Like to Hang”—as the tabloids called Crowley—now has hisportrait hanging in London’s National Portrait Gallery, a place dedicated toBritain’s “best and brightest.”45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber684]While Crowley was trying to kick his heroin habit and remember his true will,Gurdjieff was establishing himself in Fontainebleau, France. There is apersistent if questionable story that Crowley once went to Gurdjieff’s Prieuréin order to free himself of heroin; Gurdjieff at times made a living usinghypnosis to cure addicts of their addiction. Gurdjieff, too, occasionally hitthe tabloids, and the death of the New Zealand writer Katherine Mansfield, oneof Orage’s discoveries, at Gurdjieff’s Prieuré in 1923 from tuberculosis cast ashadow over the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man. Gossip thatGurdjieff slept with many of his students also fueled the scandal sheets.In 1924, mounting debts led Gurdjieff to bring a troupe of his students toAmerica—New York and Chicago—to give performances of his “sacred dances.” Theseare the basis of what are known as the Gurdjieff “movements,” difficult,complicated positions and steps Gurdjieff developed in order to push hisstudents past their mechanicalness. These performances were a success andGurdjieff’s reputation profited by it. It was at this time that Orage becameGurdjieff’s American lieutenant, remaining in New York and carrying on asGurdjieff’s spokesman until breaking with him a decade later over Orage’smarriage to Jessie Dwight. Orage returned to London and died in 1934 aftergiving a talk on Social Credit—a return to the New Age days—for the BBC. He wassixty-one.In July 1924, Gurdjieff, an appalling driver, crashed his Citroën into a treesomewhere between Paris and Fontainebleau. He was found covered in blood,unconscious—he would remain so for five days—his head resting on a cushion, notfar from the crash. How he came to be in this position remains a mystery, as dothe circumstances surrounding the accident: there is reason to believe Gurdjieffarranged it on purpose. The immediate result was his decision to liquidate hisinstitute, and turn his attention to waking up his fellow men through writing.From 1925 to 1935, Gurdjieff labored at getting his ideas onto paper. One resultwas Beelzebub’s Tales to His Grandson (1950), a work whose difficulties makeJacob Boehme seem a model of clarity and concision. A more congenial work,Meetings With Remarkable Men, also emerged from this time, as did the abortedLife Is Real Only Then, When “I Am” which appeared in fragmentary form in 1974.An earlier work, The Herald of the Coming Good (1933), was considered sostrange, megalomaniacal, and bombastic that some readers—Ouspenskyincluded—believed it was a work of someone approaching madness. It was soonrecalled.Ouspensky had by this time been long separated from his erstwhile teacher.During the 1920s, he laid low in London, giving talks, acquiring students—mostnotably Maurice Nicoll, J. G. Bennett, and the physician and writer KennethWalker—and working on the account of his time with Gurdjieff that would becomeIn Search of the Miraculous.46 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber685] He also workedon A New Model of the Universe, a remarkable collection of ideas he had exploredbefore meeting Gurdjieff—such as eternal recurrence and cosmicconsciousness—reworked to include what he had learned from his former master.When A New Model appeared in 1931, it sold well, reestablishing Ouspensky’sreputation as a philosopher of the esoteric and introducing him to new readers.One of these, as mentioned, was the novelist and playwright J. B. Priestley, whoused Ouspensky’s ideas about eternal recurrence in his hit West End play I HaveBeen Here Before (1937). By this time, Ouspensky had established his own school,first in London, then in a huge estate in Lyne Place, his version of Gurdjieff’sPrieuré. Visitors to Ouspensky’s school included Aldous Huxley and Gerald Heard.Important students from this time included Robert S. De Ropp, whose books Drugsand the Mind (1957) and The Master Game (1968) became countercultural favoritesin the 1960s; and Rodney Collin, who later went on to form groups in Mexico andwhose major work, The Theory of Celestial Influence (1954) I mentioned inChapter Five.In 1940, during the Blitz, Ouspensky followed Huxley and Heard by leavingEngland for the United States. He set up another school, this time in Mendham,New Jersey. But the uprooting, and the loss first of Russia, thenEurope—Ouspensky loved Paris, now occupied by the Nazis—his lack of contact withthe “inner circle of humanity,” and, most painfully, his broken relationshipwith Gurdjieff—who had, Ouspensky believed, “gone off the rails”—led, sadly, todepression and heavy drinking.In January 1947, a very ill Ouspensky returned to a bombed-out and heavilyrationed London and gave his old English students a wake-up call like no other.From February to June, in a series of startling lectures, Ouspensky rejected the“system” he had spent more than twenty-five years teaching and told his studentsthat they had to start from the beginning and think for themselves.47[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber686] Not long after this, Ouspensky made strangejourneys around England, during which he tried to “fix” in his mind his memoriesso that, as mentioned, during his next recurrence he would “remember.” He diedon October 2, 1947. He was sixty-nine.From the 1930s on, Gurdjieff taught in Paris and New York. Like MadameBlavatsky—and also Crowley—he put on weight, and the huge lunches and dinners hewould prepare—part of his teaching technique—and fondness for Armagnac, vodka,café noir, and cigarettes, did not help his health. (Again it should be notedthat practically all of the “big names” in modern western esotericism—Blavatsky,Crowley, Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, with the exception of Steiner—weren’t concernedwith health and well-being.)In Paris, Gurdjieff waited out the Occupation in his small flat on the Rue desColonels Renard, near the Arc de Triomphe. Here he jammed as many of hisstudents into his rooms as possible and took them on madcap automobileadventures, driving into the Paris countryside until his Citröen ran out of gas,forcing them to make “super efforts.” Exactly how he survived during theOccupation is unclear, but then Gurdjieff was nothing if not a survivor.48[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber687] Among his students at this time was thesurrealist poet René Daumal, author of the spiritual adventure novel MountAnalogue (1952).Ouspensky had warned his students to stay away from Gurdjieff—his accident, hebelieved, was a sign something had gone wrong—but after Ouspensky’s death, manyof them went to Paris to become part of Gurdjieff’s groups. Most notable amongthese was J. G. Bennett, who carried on Gurdjieff’s and Ouspensky’s work, aswell as his own, in England until his death in 1974.Gurdjieff died in 1949. His age at death is anyone’s guess. One account has itthat his physician remarked that the state of his internal organs suggested heshould have been dead years earlier. It seems he kept himself going throughsheer will. His passing was mourned by many. Gurdjieff usually had harsh wordsabout his ex-student Ouspensky, but when shown the manuscript of In Search ofthe Miraculous, he agreed it was an excellent account of his ideas and said heloved Ouspensky for it. He did want Beelzebub’s Tales to be published first, butOuspensky, who asked for his masterpiece to remain unpublished, finally trumpedhis master.Not long after this, in 1954, an at best dubious account of Gurdjieff’s ideasappeared, Monsieur Gurdjieff, by a French journalist, Louis Pauwels. It was fullof inaccuracies and unsubstantiated claims, but it piqued the public’s interestin the occult, and a book Pauwels and a colleague would produce a few yearslater sparked a full-scale occult revival that is still with us today.Postwar Europe had fallen under a dark night of rationing and painfulreconstruction. But there were positive signs that a new morning was about todawn."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVETHE NEXT STEP BEYOND[../image/153618.jpg]On June 24, 1947, the American businessman Kenneth Arnold was flying histwo-seater monoplane in the vicinity of Mount Rainier, Washington, when out ofhis window he saw something strange. Nine shining “unusual objects” flying athigh speeds moved in erratic patterns across the sky. Arnold, an experiencedpilot, had never seen anything like them, and he described their appearance aslike a “pie pan,” a disc, or a “saucer.” Arnold’s account caught the public’simagination and the press soon dubbed Arnold’s “unusual objects” “flyingsaucers.” As with the spiritualist craze of the nineteenth century, othersightings were soon reported—Arnold himself contributed more—and within a shorttime the public was aware of the possibility that the Earth was being visitedfrom outer space. Newspapers, magazines, radio, and the new medium of televisionspread the word. The age of modern UFOs had arrived.Exactly why the UFO craze caught on—and has never let go—remains unclear. Yet bythe 1950s, the idea that visitors from other planets were among us was widelydiscussed and, among many people, generally accepted. Hollywood soon got thehint and presented us with spacemen of superior intellect and moral purpose, asin The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), or interplanetary invaders intent onworld domination, as in Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956). Good or bad, itseemed the collective imagination was hungry for something new, alien, andother.After the dark days of Hitler, World War II, and the shadow of the mushroomcloud, the mid-twentieth-century mind seemed to be reaching out for theotherworldly and unearthly. This, of course, could have been nothing more thanescapism, a desire to obscure a dreary and dangerous reality with dreams andfantasies, and no doubt many, perhaps most, of the UFO sightings were alongthese lines. But there seems to have been something in the postwar appetite forthe unusual that suggests something more.Immanuel Velikovsky’s Worlds in Collision, published in 1950, argued that around1500 B.C. a comet sprung from Jupiter—Velikovsky says it became the planetVenus—nearly hit the Earth, causing global havoc and “proving” some of themiracles in the Bible, like the parting of the Red Sea. It was an immediate hitand topped The New York Times best-seller list for eleven weeks. In 1956, TheThird Eye, an account of life in Tibet by T. Lobsang Rampa, sold millions ofcopies. The fact that Rampa was the pen name of Cyril Henry Hoskins, anEnglishman from Devon who had never seen the Himalayas, was a mere detail. Thebook was based, Hoskins said, on his previous incarnation as a lama and he wenton to write many more, all of which sold well. World War II had put a damper onmuch esoteric work, and most of the secret teachers of earlier years were dead.But the taste for something else remained.A reader might ask, “Yes, this is true, but what do flying saucers have to dowith the occult or esoteric? Aren’t they more in line with science and thefuture?” A fair question, even if bookshops generally put material on UFOs inthe Occult section. Yet one secret teacher who would have an enormous impact onthe twentieth century took them very seriously.In Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky (1958), C. G. Jungargued that the many UFO sightings from around the world were a kind of global“active imagination.” He was equivocal about their physical reality, but oftheir psychic reality he had no doubt. “Flying saucers,” Jung believed, were“projections” of the collective unconscious, images of inner unity born ofmodern man’s need for meaning, a mass yearning for “wholeness.” They were, inother words, mandalas from outer space, their round shape serving the samepurpose as that of the Tibetan “magic circle”: an expression of the unifiedSelf. The Cold War was about to thaw in a nuclear confrontation, and the tensionbetween the U.S. and U.S.S.R. produced a planetary schizophrenia. The flyingdiscs were a sign that a profound psychic tension was at work, but they werealso a way of circumventing disaster. We know that Jung believed that meditatingon the mandala could help trigger the transcendent function, the psyche’sability to grow beyond a seemingly insoluble problem. If the western world wasapproaching a nervous breakdown, it seemed its unconscious was taking steps tomitigate the collapse.Jung also believed that just as the mandala signals a new development in theindividual, it also did so for the collective. The idea that some great changewas on its way had been with Jung for some time, but he only spoke openly aboutthis in the last decade of his life. Jung had been a student of astrology foryears, and even used it in his therapeutic work. As early as 1940, Jung hadmentioned the “age of Aquarius” in a letter to his translator H. G. Baynes,speaking of “the premonitory earthquake of the New Age.”1[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber688]Others had spoken of a coming new astrological age, a result of the “precessionof the equinoxes” mentioned in Chapter One; Edward Carpenter, whom we met in theprevious chapter, wrote about it, as did others before him.2[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber689] But Jung was certainly the most high-profilename to do so. He believed he had to keep his speculations secret, but in 1951he presented them in his strange work Aion, whose title is the name of a Gnosticdeity. In Aion, Jung presented the idea that the archetypes evolve, and that wewere currently caught in the shift from one “psychic dominant” to another—ratheras Jean Gebser believed that we are moving from one “consciousness structure” toanother. The new age, for Jung, would be one that would “constellate the problemof the union of opposites” and this would come about through the “individualhuman being, via his experience of the living spirit.”3[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber690]Jung presented the same message in his book on flying saucers, but with a bitmore gravitas. “My conscience as a psychiatrist,” he wrote, “bids me fulfil myduty and prepare those few who will hear me for coming events which are inaccord with the end of an era.” He goes on: “As we know from ancient Egyptianhistory, they are the symptoms of psychic changes that always appear at the endof one Platonic month and at the beginning of another. They are . . . changes inthe constellation of the psychic dominants, of the archetypes or ‘Gods’ as theyused to be called . . . This transformation started . . . in the transition ofthe Age of Taurus to that of Aries, and then from Aries to Pisces, whosebeginnings coincide with the rise of Christianity. We are now entering thatgreat change . . . when the spring-point enters Aquarius.”4[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber691]By the mid-1960s, Jung’s ideas about the coming age of Aquarius would filterdown to the burgeoning “counterculture” and would be popularized through GavinArthur’s astrology column in the underground newspaper the San FranciscanOracle. As a young man, Arthur—in his sixties during the “summer of love”— hadknown Edward Carpenter and may have heard about the idea from him.5[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber692] By 1969, millions of people knew all about thedawning age through the hit song “Aquarius,” by the Fifth Dimension—a pointedlyoccult name—from the hippie musical Hair.MAGICAL MORNINGS AND MUSHROOMSJung’s pronouncements seemed accurate, as least insofar as they related to theshift in popular consciousness toward the strange and mysterious that gatheredmomentum at the end of the 1950s. If there are any doubts about this, a bookthat appeared at the start of the new decade should clinch it. In 1960, anunusual title turned up in Parisian bookshops. It was Le Matin des Magiciens(The Morning of the Magicians). Its authors were Louis Pauwels—whose highlyinaccurate Monsieur Gurdjieff I mentioned at the end of the last chapter—andJacques Bergier, a physicist and practicing alchemist who, among other claims,said that he had met Fulcanelli (Chapter Five) in 1937.Pauwels and Bergier shared a dissatisfaction with the narrowness of modernscience, but they also believed that much of contemporary science had parallelswith ancient beliefs, such as alchemy. But this was only one theme of the book,which rambled on at a brisk pace through a dizzying assortment of occult andesoteric ideas, everything from Gurdjieff, Madame Blavatsky, and the GoldenDawn, to “occult Nazis”—they more or less invented the genre—the philosopher’sstone, ancient spacemen, Atlantis, mutants, higher consciousness, ESP, and muchmore. Much of what Pauwels and Bergier had to say was inaccurate, but in onesense this hardly matters. Their central aim was to show that the universe was amuch more mysterious place than we take it to be, and if nothing else, they weresuccessful at that.Le Matin des Magiciens caused a sensation. In the black-and-white capital ofexistentialism, nihilism, and La Nausée, it was as if a UFO had landed onBoulevard Saint-Michel and sprayed the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and AlbertCamus with technicolor. Nothing like it had appeared since the prewar occultrevival, and people were ready for it. The book was a best seller and didequally well in its English and American editions. The occult revival of the1960s had begun, and by the middle of the decade it would inform practically allaspects of popular culture, influencing literature, film, television, comicbooks, and, above all, music.One factor helping the occult’s rise to dominance in popular culture was thegrowing “psychedelic movement.” Experimenting with peyote and othermind-altering drugs had been part of the “new age” fin-de-siècle. Crowley,Yeats, and the pre-Freud sexologist Havelock Ellis had done so, as had Thomas DeQuincey and Baudelaire with opium before them. But it was Aldous Huxley’sexperiment with peyote’s derivative, mescaline, that made its mind-alteringeffects widely known.In 1943, the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered the powerful hallucinogenicdrug lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD-25; his account of accidentally dosinghimself with it remains a classic of drug literature, and as we’ve seen, Hofmannbelieved the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries used some form of psychedelic.6[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber693] But it was Huxley’s account of his mescalineexperience in The Doors of Perception (1954) that popularized what would soon becalled “altered states of consciousness.”7 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber694] In1957, R. Gordon Wasson, a vice president of the J. P. Morgan Bank and amateurethnomycologist, published an article in Life magazine, “Seeking the MagicMushroom,” about his experiences with mind-altering psilocybin mushrooms duringreligious rituals with the curandera, or shaman, Maria Sabina in Mexico. In1958, Huxley published an article, “Drugs That Shape Men’s Minds” in theSaturday Evening Post. By this time, LSD had become a populartherapeutic/recreational drug among the Hollywood set, and celebrities like theactor Cary Grant sang its praises.The most well-known advocate of LSD was Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvardpsychiatrist turned drug guru who hoped to “turn on” the world and head thecounterculture in a “psychedelic revolution.” While Hofmann and Huxley indifferent ways called for the judicious use of LSD as an aid inself-exploration—in effect, echoing the ancient system of initiation—Leary hadbigger ideas and advocated widespread use of the powerful substance. His aim wasto create a twentieth-century Mystery religion.Leary first experienced “magic mushrooms” in Mexico in 1960, and soon after, atHarvard, he ran a number of psilocybin sessions with some of the “BeatGeneration”: Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs. The Beatswere writers and poets who rejected the buttoned-down, conservative character of1950s America and, like the early participants in the occult revival, sought newexperiences and ways of living. This included unconventional sex and drug use,but also an interest in eastern forms of spirituality, like Zen Buddhism. Theman most responsible for importing this to the Beat scene was Alan Watts, astudent of the Theosophist and Buddhist scholar Christmas Humphreys.Psilocybin was powerful, but it was a candle compared to LSD’s solar flare.Leary was introduced to Hofmann’s discovery by a British confidence tricksternamed Michael Hollingshead; he had obtained an introduction to Leary by trickingAldous Huxley into providing it.8 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber695] Leary triedthe stuff and it went, literally, to his head. He soon became a vociferoustub-thumper for the psychedelic revelation, and his evangelizing cost him hisposition at Harvard. It also led, in 1966, to making LSD illegal, a developmentthat put research into the therapeutic use of the drug back by decades. Learystarted his own secret society—the International Federation of InternalFreedom—and began publishing the Psychedelic Review. It featured classics likeWilliam James and R. M. Bucke, whose Cosmic Consciousness became a psychedelic“must read,” and provided hippies with the catch word “cosmic.” Leary publishedPlato too, and he also included work by Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, René Daumal, andother esoteric thinkers.One of the important texts for Leary was the Tibetan Book of the Dead, in theEnglish translation edited by the Theosophist W. Y. Evans-Wentz and introducedby Jung. It was here that he discovered a phrase that would become a centraltenet of the psychedelic counterculture: “Turn off your mind, relax and floatdownstream.” Leary included this in his influential book, The PsychedelicExperience, coauthored with Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert—who would soonbecome the guru Ram Dass—and published in 1964. The book uses the Tibetan Bookof the Dead as a guide to “tripping,” and one of its readers was the Beatle JohnLennon.In March 1966, Lennon and Paul McCartney—two of the most famous people in theworld—went to the Indica Bookshop in London—named after a species of marijuana,by then widely popular—looking for something to read. Lennon settled into ThePsychedelic Experience. Lennon had already had two bad trips, but Leary’smessage was persuasive and he took the guru’s advice about turning off his mindvery seriously. One result was that for the next three years, Lennon dosedhimself on LSD almost daily. Another was the Beatles’ first psychedelic tune,“Tomorrow Never Knows,” from their album Revolver (1966). The song’s lyricsstart with a reprise of Leary’s Tibetan advice: “Turn off your mind, relax andfloat downstream.” The age of pop psychedelicism and pop esotericism had begun.THE RETURN OF THE BEASTBy 1967, it was clear that the growing youth culture, psychedelic movement, andoccult revival were quickly coalescing into a powerful social force. Theindubitable sign of this was the inclusion of C. G. Jung, Aldous Huxley, and theIndia sages Sri Yukteswar Giri, Sri Mahavatar Babaji, and Sri ParamahansaYogananda on the cover of the Beatles’ trendsetting album Sgt. Pepper’s LonelyHearts Club Band, part of the soundtrack to that year’s “summer of love.” Alsoincluded on the crowded cover was Aleister Crowley, otherwise known as “theGreat Beast.”After his death twenty years earlier, Crowley had faded from consciousness, butin 1951 two books about him appeared. Charles Richard Cammell’s AleisterCrowley: The Man, the Mage, the Poet turned a friendly eye on the dark magician,but it was John Symonds’s critical—and often very funny—The Great Beast thatreally put Crowley back in the spotlight. Books on witchcraft and black magicwere mildly successful in the 1950s, works like Gerald Gardner’s WitchcraftToday (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959). Gardner, who knew Crowley, ismore or less responsible for popularizing Wicca, a modern version of the ancientcraft. And the Hollywood Hills “acid set” was the milieu in which theCrowley-inspired avant-garde filmmaker Kenneth Anger would produce his thelemicmasterpiece, the lush and magical Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954). Itscast included Marjorie Cameron, widow of the rocket scientist and CrowleyiteJack Parsons, and the writer Anaïs Nin, whose claims to have met Crowley in1930s Paris must be taken with some salt.9 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber696] In1958, Symonds followed up The Great Beast with The Magic of Aleister Crowley,and by 1960, the Beast was included in the potpourri of occult disclosuresmaking up The Morning of the Magicians.According to Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney, Sgt. Pepper’s cover was made up of“people we like” and “all our heroes,” and in an interview shortly before hisdeath, Lennon remarked that the “whole Beatle thing was to do what youwant . . . do what thou whilst, as long as it doesn’t hurt somebody.”10[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber697] Lennon misquoted Crowley, and his cautionescaped the Beast, but after Sgt. Pepper’s, Crowley too was a member of thecounterculture.In fact he became a positive exemplar of it. In the International Times forOctober 1967—an underground newspaper edited by the Beatles’ friend BarryMiles—a full-page article on Crowley presents him as a proto-hippie, hissex-and-drug-filled life ample evidence for the claim. That year The Black Artsby Richard Cavendish appeared, among whose readers was Mick Jagger, lead singerof the Rolling Stones. Cavendish would later edit the influential 1970s magazineseries Man, Myth and Magic, which included Mircea Eliade on its board.The Stones became friends with Kenneth Anger and they produced a somewhat darkerversion of the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s, Their Satanic Majesties Request. TheStones’ take on the occult revival was more threatening, as their song “Sympathyfor the Devil” suggests. With them we can say that a genre of pop music,“rockult and roll,” begins and which would include later groups like LedZeppelin—whose guitarist Jimmy Page was a dedicated Crowleyan—and otherpurveyors of heavy metal. By this time Timothy Leary had turned his attentionaway from Tibetan Buddhism and Gurdjieff, and was seeing himself as areincarnation of Crowley, a timely discovery. In his autobiography Confessionsof a Hope Fiend (1973)—a title taken from Crowley’s Confessions of AleisterCrowley and Diary of a Drug Fiend—Leary writes about the “eerie synchronicities”between his life and Crowley’s, and in a post-sixties interview for the PBSprogram Late Night America, Leary said he was a great admirer of Crowley andthat the sixties themselves were a collective attempt to “do what thou wilt.”11[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber698]THE NEW NEW AGEAs we’ve seen, the idea of a “new age” is very old and recurs repeatedlythroughout western history. By the end of the 1960s, expectations of somemillennarian shift were high. The Aquarian Age would arrive, Atlantis wouldrise—predicted for 1969 by the “sleeping prophet” Edgar Cayce and made into thehit song “Atlantis” that year by Donovan—and we would, according to theorganizers of the huge music festival Woodstock, “get back to the garden.” Manyif not all of the interests that informed the “positive fin-de-siècle” and sentearly twentieth-century dropouts to Monte Verità and other alternative spotswere the height of fashion, and like other antinomian movements—such as theBrethren of the Free Spirit and the Moravians—the participants believed theywere “beyond good and evil.”As in the Renaissance and other periods, nothing was as new as the old. It was astrange time, with technology’s most glorious achievement—putting a man on themoon—coinciding with a return to primitive, tribal life, as in Woodstock and anynumber of communes. And as an example of Gurdjieff’s “law of seven” and Jung’senantiodromia, the expectations that “peace would guide the planets and lovewould steer the stars” collapsed when the dark side of the age of Aquarius beganto emerge.This first became clear in the revelation that the brutal slaying of the actressSharon Tate and her friends in the Hollywood Hills in August 1969 had been thework of a sadistic, homicidal hippie guru named Charles Manson. Then came theRolling Stones’ disastrous concert at Altamont, California, in December, whenthe antinomian Hells Angels killed one person and terrorized hundreds more. TheTate murders and another, of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, had taken place just afew days before Woodstock. That Manson and his “Family” were responsiblewouldn’t become clear until the end of the year, but the juxtaposition isnonetheless striking.By 1970, the mood had changed from expectations of love to something lesswholesome, a shift seen in the increase in violence exhibited by a variety ofradical political groups eager to bring on “the revolution.” During the massiveanti-Viet Nam War march on Washington in October 1967, Kenneth Anger and AllenGinsberg were content to try to exorcize and levitate the Pentagonsimultaneously.12 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber699] By 1971, the Weathermen, aradical leftist group who had organized Timothy Leary’s prison escape the yearbefore, had bombed the Capitol. In 1972, they would bomb the Pentagon. (They hadearlier christened Manson a “revolutionary hero.”) In a letter sent to theBerkeley Barb, an underground newspaper, after his escape—he had been arrestedon drug charges—Leary himself wrote that to “shoot a genocidal robot policemanin defense of life is a sacred act . . . Shoot to live. Blow the mechanical mindwith Holy Acid. Dose them.”13 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber700]As happened with the plummeting hopes of Romantics following the FrenchRevolution’s descent into the Reign of Terror and the rise of the guillotine,disappointed expectations of social change shifted into inner concerns. Manyelements of the occult revival made their way into mainstream society. Withideas of a coming revolution fading, the occult, once threatening, now becamedomesticated. Practices like the Transcendental Meditation of the Beatles’ guru,Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, were seen to have beneficial results and, with yoga andother forms of eastern spirituality, it made its way into the corporate world.EST, or the Erhard Seminars Training of Werner Erhard, also made corporateinroads, as did the other motivational and transformational techniques at theroot of today’s “self-help” literature—a reprise, in many ways, of thefin-de-siècle’s “positive thinking.” Yoga centers, health food stores, andoriental medicine shops began to appear on Main Street America. Belief in Tarot,astrology, synchronicity, telepathy, and other occult practices becamecommonplace. In 1970, the best-selling novelist Kurt Vonnegut wrote an articleabout the new popular occultism for McCall’s magazine, in which he called MadameBlavatsky “the Founding Mother of the Occult in America.”14[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber701]An occult publishing boom flooded the market with cheap reprints of esotericclassics, works by Crowley, Mathers, A. E. Waite, Levi, Regardie, and others.New works like Francis King’s Ritual Magic in Modern England (1970) and ColinWilson’s The Occult (1971)—which looked at the magical and esoteric through thelens of existential philosophy—brought the subject up-to-date. Works by StanGooch—another British writer—on Neanderthal man and his links to the paranormalappeared.The View Over Atlantis (1969) by the Platonist and friend of the Rolling StonesJohn Michell—whose first book, The Flying Saucer Vision, appeared in 1967—arguedthat England and the rest of the world were covered in “ley lines,” hiddenstreams of a mysterious occult force. It ushered in the fascination with “Earthmysteries” that would continue on to today’s crop circles and constituted a kindof esoteric environmentalism. In works like The Roots of Coincidence (1972),respected writers like Arthur Koestler—famous for attacks on reductionistscience in The Act of Creation (1964) and The Ghost in the Machine (1968)—tooktelepathy, precognition, and synchronicity seriously, and many universitiesestablished departments in parapsychology, following in the footsteps of J. B.Rhine, who, at Duke University in the 1930s, had set up one of the firstresearch units in the paranormal.THE NEW HUMANISMThis interest in the hidden powers of the mind paralleled what was called the“human potential movement,” a late twentieth-century version of Pico dellaMirandola’s “superhumanism.” It emerged from the humanist psychology of peoplelike Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow. Rogers argued against the reductionistpsychologies of Freud as well as the behaviorism of J. B. Watson, whose 1960srepresentative, B. F. Skinner, denied the reality or desirability of free willin his influential book Beyond Freedom and Dignity (1971).Like Gurdjieff, behaviorism saw human beings as machines, motivated solely bystimulus and response; unlike Gurdjieff, it believed there was nothing we coulddo about this. Skinner’s book argued that in order to create a safe and fairsociety, we should abandon notions of free will and allow ourselves to be“conditioned” to be good. Against this mechanical view of human psychology,Rogers emphasized the reality of the self, the person, as a real agent ofchange. His “person-centered” psychology also rejected the Freudian notion thatwe are helpless slaves to unconscious desires.Abraham Maslow also rejected Freud and behaviorism and broke new psychologicalground by studying healthy people, rather than sick ones. Maslow discovered thathuman psychology was informed by a “hierarchy of needs,” at the top of which wasthe need to “self-actualize,” Maslow’s version of Jung’s “individuation.” Maslowsaw that self-actualizers, those who work to fulfil their potential, enter the“farther reaches of human nature,” and that our higher spiritual and creativeneeds are just as much a part of our makeup—our biology—as our lower physicalones. Against the mechanical view of human nature and the nihilism ofexistentialism—which saw human beings trapped in a meaningless universe (much asthe Gnostics did)—Maslow argued that healthy, purposeful people regularlyexperience what he called “peak experiences,” sudden, unexpected moments of joyand happiness, in which the meaningfulness of their life and the world isself-evident—moments, perhaps, when the warring sides of our brains reach asurprise accord.One place in which the ideas of humanistic psychology were put into practice wasthe Esalen Institute, an alternative educational establishment founded onCalifornia’s beautiful Big Sur coastline in 1962 by Michael Murphy and RichardPrice. Murphy and Price had been students of Alan Watts, and their aim inopening their institute was to explore what Aldous Huxley had called the “humanpotentialities.” Esalen was a success, and a list of the important figures whotaught there reads like a who’s who of alternative thinking: Joseph Campbell,Fritjof Capra, Stanislav Grof, Buckminster Fuller, Michael Harner, and R. D.Laing are only some of the names.Esalen was a sort of West Coast Eranos, but unlike Eranos, it was open to thepublic, offered workshops and group therapy sessions, and its approach was lessscholarly and more “hands on.” With the Gestalt encounter groups led by thepsychologist Fritz Perls, it was even “touchy feely,” an aspect of Esalen aboutwhich Maslow, a frequent contributor, had serious reservations.15[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber702] Maslow believed that Esalen’s emphasis on“spontaneity” and “experience” could lead to a counterproductiveanti-intellectualism, in which the sensual hot tub replaced the cerebral thinktank.16 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber703]A misunderstanding of Maslow’s self-actualization—a process requiring bothintellect and feeling, and hence both sides of our brain—fed the shallowexpression of “human potential” that informed the “Me Generation” of the 1970s.This “culture of narcissism,” in the historian Christopher Lasch’s phrase,emphasized the “self” component of self-actualization, and its devotees seemedoverly fixated on producing bigger and better versions of themselves. Thisskewed view of human potential was compensated for by the rise of “transpersonalpsychology,” a view of the human psyche that incorporated elements of thesacred, spiritual, and nonhuman. Maslow’s own work was informed by this, andlike Jung, he considered spirituality a central part of human nature.Transpersonal psychology took Maslow’s lead and developed a complete vision ofthe human psyche based on it.TRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOLOGYTranspersonal psychology has its roots in the work of Roberto Assagioli, athinker whose important ideas are not well known and deserve more attention. Inthis sense, Assagioli remains a secret secret teacher. Assagioli was an earlyFreudian and colleague of Jung; like Jung, he studied under Eugen Bleuler at theBurghölzli clinic in Zurich. He came into Freud’s orbit in 1909, but broke awayfrom him earlier than Jung, in 1910, apparently without a “creative illness.”Like Jung, he rejected Freud’s narrow, reductive view of human psychology andhis emphasis on the sexual root of neurosis. Also like Jung, Assagioli wasinterested in the spiritual aspects of human psychology, those parts of ourbeing that transcend the personal. Hence his psychology was “transpersonal.”Like Jung, Assagioli wanted to counter the fragmenting effect of Freud’spsychoanalysis, and against this he developed his system of psychosynthesis.(Jung also spoke of “psychosynthesis” before he hit on “analytical psychology,”and he may have got the idea from Assagioli.) Unlike Jung, Assagioli did nothesitate to say that the spiritual was an actual, objective reality. Jung, morecircumspect, spoke only of his “empirical”—i.e., scientific—observations aboutthe psyche. This should not be surprising: Assagioli was a long-time student ofthe esoteric tradition, and in his early years was a close associate of theTheosophist Alice Bailey.Alice Bailey was born in England in 1880 and, like Madame Blavatsky, claimedthat she had been in contact with a “master” since her teens. By 1915, in herthirties, she had moved to the United States, where she joined the TheosophicalSociety. After a clash with Annie Besant, she left in 1920. She had by this timestarted receiving channeled messages from one of Blavatsky’s minor Masters,Djwal Khul, “the Tibetan,” who told her that she was in service to a spiritualhierarchy and that she was given a secret mission to work for the benefit ofmankind in its spiritual evolution. In 1923, Bailey founded the Arcane School,and her messages from Djwal Kuhl began to mount up. Her enormous output centersaround a vision of mankind’s spiritual development culminating in a globalfederation embodying a universal brotherhood. Bailey too spoke of a coming ageof Aquarius and believed that its messiah, the Buddha Maitreya, was about toreturn.SPIRITUAL SUMMER SCHOOLSAssagioli was born in Venice in 1888 into a cultured family and became involvedin Theosophy through his mother. Jewish, he was also deeply influenced by theesoteric elements of his religion.17 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber704] He had agenius for language, and by his teens was fluent in German, French, English,Russian, Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit. Art, music, poetry, and the higher pursuitsinfluenced him deeply. Assagioli’s interest in culture, idealism, andspirituality led to his break with Freud, and by the late 1920s, he had becomeBailey’s representative in Italy.18 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber705]They met in 1930 in Ascona (Chapter Eleven) while lecturing at the SpiritualSummer School held in the socialite Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn’s Casa Gabriella.Fröbe-Kapteyn had deep spiritual interests, and in 1927, after the death of herfather, she received a large inheritance, part of which was Casa Gabriella onthe shores of Lago Maggiore.19 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber706] She used herinheritance to pursue her spiritual path, traveling in search of wisdom and inorder to make contact with like-minded people. She was a visitor to MonteVerità, but did not care for its bohemian ambience. She had an interest in theoccult and eastern religion, but had no idea what to do with her life. Beforebecoming hostess to the Eranos Conferences, she had spent seven years inisolation, speaking to no one but her servants.At the end of this seclusion, suffering a neurosis, she sought out Jung’s help;he advised her to find other people like herself, deeply committed to thespiritual life. It was at this point that on a sudden impulse, she had anauditorium built. When it was finished, she had no idea what to do with it. Itwas Jung who, in 1928, supposedly suggested that she use it as a center, likeHermann Keyserling’s in Darmstadt, for bringing together the East and theWest.20 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber707]Fröbe-Kapteyn had by this time become a follower of Alice Bailey, and sheoffered her auditorium for Bailey’s use. The result was the Spiritual SummerSchool held there in 1930. Among the teachers were Bailey; Alexandra David-Neel,author of the remarkable Magic and Mystery in Tibet (1929) and the firstEuropean woman to enter the Forbidden City of Lhasa; and Assagioli.21[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber708] More summer schools took place, but by 1932,Bailey grew disenchanted with the project and, as mentioned, told Fröbe-Kapteynthat in ancient times the area was associated with black magic.A more immediate reason for her change of heart was the nearby presence ofbohemian Ascona, whose residents she found objectionable and a continuoustemptation to her daughters.22 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber709] Bailey alsosaid that she had recently received an “epoch-making” communication from hermaster, and she had to devote her attention to starting her “New Groups of WorldServers,” who would usher in the expected new age.23[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber710] Bailey left Lago Maggiore, and Fröbe-Kapteynhad an empty auditorium on her hands. Fröbe-Kapteyn remembered Jung’s suggestionand the idea of Eranos—Greek for “banquet” although “pot luck” might be moreapt—took hold.In 1933, the first Eranos Conference was held, its opening segueing nicely withthe closure of Keyserling’s School of Wisdom as the Nazis swept into power.Fröbe-Kapteyn had asked Jung to speak at the opening conference, but he declinedbecause of her association with Bailey—he found Theosophists particularlyannoying—and Assagioli. This was odd, as the two were thought to be friendly.Jung had earlier turned down taking part in the Spiritual Summer Schools for thesame reason. But when he saw that the Hindu scholar Heinrich Zimmer and othernoted savants would be opening the Eranos Conference, Jung changed his mind.24[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber711]PSYCHOSYNTHESISAssagioli had worked as a director of the Theosophical journal Ultra, one ofwhose contributors was the controversial Italian esotericist Julius Evola.25[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber712] In the late 1920s, Evola’s UR Group, based inRome, conducted magical and hermetic research, and produced the importantesoteric journals, Ur and Krur. Evola wrote extensively on alchemy, tantra,Buddhism, and other esoteric subjects, from the point of view of a highlyrace-oriented Traditionalism, whose far-right political associations maintainEvola’s status as, in Hermann Hesse’s words, a “dangerous author.”26[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber713]Assagioli’s views were more tolerant and less belligerent than Evola’s, and hewould in fact suffer from the new racial laws Mussolini introduced in 1938,which were influenced by Evola’s Three Aspects of the Jewish Problem (1936),whose diatribes against the “Jewish soul” owe much to the troubled Austrianphilosopher Otto Weininger.27 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber714] Assagioli openedhis Institute for Psychosynthesis in 1926 in Florence, but in 1938, Mussolini’sFascists forced him to close it and he himself was arrested and imprisoned for amonth in solitary confinement. During this time, he developed many importantideas and was able to transform the imprisonment into a spiritual retreat bypracticing exercises developing his will and imagination, two central elementsof psychosynthesis. Assagioli’s staunch internationalism also got him intotrouble: during World War II, Assagioli and his family had to go underground.Assagioli’s central idea is the irreducible reality of the Self, a belief heshares with Jung, Maslow, and Rudolf Steiner; and his psychology is aimed atstimulating an experience of that reality through the use of imagination and thewill, two necessary ingredients, we remember, for the practicing magician. Oneof Assagioli’s most important ideas—and one that distinguishes his work fromJung’s—is his belief in what he calls the “higher unconscious,” or, perhaps moreapt, the “superconscious.”In his foreword to F. W. H. Myers’s Human Personality and Its Survival of BodilyDeath, Aldous Huxley asked whether the “house of the soul” was a “mere bungalowwith a cellar,” as Freud’s view would have it, or if it had also a “rooflessattic . . . open to the sky.”28 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber715] Assagiolibelieved it did, and his “superconsciouness” is the soul’s open-topped attic.Through the discovery and development of the will, Assagioli believed we couldharmonize the dark elements of the “lower unconscious” (Freud’s basement filledwith the “vermin” and “garbage” of our repressed complexes, in Huxley’s words)with the “middle unconscious,” a subconscious “labor-saving” device that takesover skills we have learned with the conscious mind, freeing it for newactivities. (When I first learned to type, it was a painful, laborious effortthat I had to consciously go through step by step. Now, my “middle unconscious”does it much more smoothly for me, allowing me to think about what I want towrite.) Harmonizing these parts of our psyche constitutes our “personalpsychosynthesis.” It is by bringing in the “superconsciousness,” or upper floorsof the mind, that we engage in “transpersonal psychosynthesis,” the unifying ofour own personal egos with the spiritual realities that lie beyond it, rather asJung’s active imagination can introduce us to the “objective psyche.” Assagiolieven speaks of creating a kind of inner “elevator” that will allow us access toall the levels of our personality.29 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber716]Much of Assagioli’s work involved visualization and other exercises tostrengthen the imagination, and it should be no surprise that he often draws onDante, an important influence on his work. In one of his meditations, we areasked to use our imagination to visualize Dante’s descent into Hell and then hisascent through Purgatory to Paradise. Through intensifying our imagination withour will, we can experience Dante’s inner journey as if we ourselves areparticipating in it. In other words, through our active imagination we can, likeSuhrawardi and others, embark on an inner voyage and enter the world of theImaginal, the insights and meanings of which come to us through thesuperconscious.AQUARIAN CONSPIRACIESAssagioli’s ideas were part of the repertoire of self-transformationaldisciplines that informed places like Esalen; Michael Murphy made a trip toFlorence especially to meet Assagioli, who died in 1974, and said he was the“truest sage” he ever met. By the late seventies, “human potential,”transpersonal psychology, eastern forms of spirituality, parapsychology, the“new physics”—quantum mechanics having done away with Newton’s old clockworkuniverse—ideas of higher consciousness and other alternative pursuits seemed tobe sending out shoots around the globe and the sense that something washappening was palpable. On his “search for the miraculous,” Ouspensky had metpeople “who were interested in the same ideas that interested me, that spoke thesame language as I spoke, people between whom and myself there was instantly setup an entirely distinctive understanding,” and Ouspensky believed this was thebeginning of a “secret society” of people “closely connected by a community ofideas and of language.”30 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber717] By 1980, the samefeeling was prevalent and a book that came out that year confirmed it.The Aquarian Conspiracy by Marilyn Ferguson argued that something likeOuspensky’s “secret society” was happening, and provided plenty of evidence toprove it. Ferguson, a freelance journalist, was deeply involved in humanisticpsychology, as well as in developments in the “new physics” and neurosciencethat rejected the dominant reductionist approach. She also edited theinfluential Brain/Mind Bulletin, a newsletter spreading the word about thelatest research in these fields. Like Samuel Hartlib, Ferguson was an“intelligencer,” and in the years before the Internet, the Brain/Mind Bullentin,a kind of 1970s version of Orage’s New Age, was the means through which manypeople in disparate but related fields kept up-to-date on what was happening onthe “cutting edge.”One of the most exciting topics was the work in “split-brain theory,” andFerguson’s bulletin was crucial in communicating new ideas about consciousnessto a wide and diverse readership, from philosophers and psychologists toschoolteachers and shopkeepers. Readers of the Brain/Mind Bulletin included,among others, the physicists Fritjof Capra and David Bohm, the neuroscientistKarl Pribram, and the parapsychologist Jean Houston.Ferguson began to see something like a “movement without a name” emerging fromall this, rather like Ouspensky’s “secret society” and the “invisible church” ofKarl von Eckartshausen. It was formed by a variety of people from differentwalks of life who all shared a desire to effect some lasting positive change insociety and themselves, much like the desire to effect a “universal reformation”that informed the Rosicrucians. Maslow’s ideas were prevalent, as were Jung’s.Central to Ferguson’s vision was the work of the French Catholic philosopher andpaleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, whose influential book, ThePhenomenon of Man (1959), argued that evolution was not a mindless, mechanicalprocess but, as Henri Bergson had said, was informed and guided by an“evolutionary drive” aiming at greater complexity and freedom. Evolution,Teilhard de Chardin believed, was working through human beings to create what hecalled the “noosphere,” a new dimension of reality produced by the human mind(“noosphere” comes from the Greek nous, “mind,” and is a “mental sphere” as theatmosphere is one of air).Teilhard de Chardin’s ideas agreed with a remark of H. G. Wells, that as birdsare creatures of the air and fish creatures of the sea, we—mankind—are creaturesof the mind, an insight with which Plato, Plotinus, and other secret teacherswould readily agree. Through the Brain/Mind Bulletin and other means, these“creatures of the mind” were linking up, exchanging ideas, making connections,and trying to become conscious agents of evolution’s purpose.It was in fact from Wells—a central figure of the positive fin-de-siècle—thatFerguson borrowed the idea of an “open conspiracy,” a “leaderless movement”whose members were recognized by their desire to build a vision of mankind andthe world that went beyond the still dominant reductionist paradigm.In The Open Conspiracy (1928), Wells had written that “The world is undergoingimmense changes. Never before have the conditions of life changed so swiftly andenormously as they have for mankind in the last fifty years,” a remark that istruer today than when Wells wrote it.31 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber718]Wells’s “open conspiracy” called for men and women of intelligence, will, andcreativity to embrace these developments, take charge of their lives, andliberate themselves from the muddle of old, worn-out traditions, much as theprogressive thinkers of the positive fin-de-siècle sought out new, experimentalways of living. Wells’s “open conspirators” would help awaken mankind “from aninfantile nightmare, of the struggle for existence and the inevitability ofwar.”32 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber719] Ferguson’s “Aquarian conspirators” hada similar goal: to liberate mankind from the trammels of a reductionist,mechanistic vision and promote one that encouraged creativity, spirituality,humanistic values, altruism, and the cooperative labor of making a better world.Although not occult, Ferguson borrowed the idea of a coming age of Aquariusbecause of its popularity and positive message. She told her readers that theywere moving out of a dark time into one of light and that this was happeningthrough their own efforts and those of people like them. Many agreed with her.The Aquarian Conspiracy became a best seller, was translated into manylanguages, and received plaudits from The New York Times, Time magazine, andother mainstream periodicals. Ferguson lectured about her ideas around theworld. One of her readers was Al Gore, who during his vice presidency invitedFerguson to the White House.CHANNELS, CRYSTALS, AND OTHER ACCESSORIESIt was inevitable that when the interest in the variety of alternative ideasthat Ferguson wrote about became widespread and self-conscious, the “movementwithout a name” would begin to call itself something. Or at least some membersof it would. Absolute beginnings are the bête noir of historians, and exactlywhen our contemporary usage of “New Age” began is debatable, but at some pointin the early 1980s, elements of Ferguson’s Aquarian conspiracy became moremystical. “Channeling,” a late twentieth-century version of gaslightspiritualism, came to the fore, with a variety of spiritual beings—not the deadthis time—communicating important messages and metaphysical teachings formankind through selected individuals.Mankind had been receiving similar messages for at least the last century, butthe new round of revelations caught on. “Seth,” “Ramtha,” “Orin,” and othersimilar entities had important things to tell us, and as with UFO sightings,suddenly many people began to discover that they were involved in somethingextraordinary. Like the messages of their nineteenth-century counterpoints, thequality of these occult communiqués varied, with most expressing hopeful,positive, but frustratingly vague injunctions about our spiritual development.(As with Jung’s and Crowley’s inspired texts, the style of these communicationstended to be heavy on rhetoric.)Along with these portentous announcements, the sanction of some celebritiesspread the word to a yet wider sphere, beyond the members of the Aquarianconspiracy and its antecedents. If the Beatles clinched the occult’s entrée intothe counterculture, it was the actress Shirley MacLaine’s 1987 televisionminiseries Out on a Limb, based on her earlier book about her spiritualadventures, that did it for the New Age.Millions of television viewers who learned of MacLaine’s past lives and of herquest for spiritual fulfilment identified with her and, quite rightly, wanted toexplore these questions for themselves. A fresh, large, and affluent market ofmiddle-class consumers rose up and was able to afford the flood of self-helpseminars and mystical accessories inspired by MacLaine’s account. Othercelebrities got into the act, and spirituality became something famous peopleliked to exhibit. Crystals, pendulums, incense, Tarot cards, body oils, guidedmeditations, angels, totem animals, archetypes, assorted therapies, “visionquests,” Tibetan bells, singing bowls, spiritual retreats, goddess worship,sweat lodges, and many other items deemed necessary to explore one’s inner worldand follow one’s “higher self” found an eager audience, inaugurating a kind of“spiritual consumerism” that continues today.Echoes of the Me Generation sounded when the idea that we all house hiddenpotentials we seldom realize was transmuted into the belief that we are allentitled to instant actualization, and the search for wisdom often became thehunt for a spiritual practice that fit into our busy schedules. Parallel to thiswas the notion, advanced by many therapies, that, as we are—that is, without theneed for any discipline or struggle—we are already spiritual, creative, magicalbeings and should be honored as such, a psychological egalitarianism and“feel-good factor” that led many to celebrate themselves in often ostentatiousways.To mention this is not to say that all of it was bad. Much good came andcontinues to come from this popular movement, and the wide dissemination ofideas invariably leads to their dilution.33 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber720]But soon even some of the spiritual teachers involved in this marketablemetaphysics saw the danger of losing the essence of the thing in theparaphernalia that speedily accreted around it. The hunger for personalexperience and knowledge of spiritual reality that drives the spiritualmarketplace is in most cases authentic, and remains a genuine appetite in humanbeings. How that hunger is fed is another thing. Physical hunger can be met byjunk food or a decent meal. Spiritual hunger is no different.I should mention that some channeling led to solid, concrete results in the morescholarly aspect of the New Age. David Spangler, one of the earliest channelers,was involved with the Findhorn community of Scotland, famous for its remarkableresults with farming, its fruits and vegetables known to grow to extraordinarysizes. In 1972, with the cultural historian William Irwin Thompson—one of themore respected and rigorous intellectuals associated with the New Age—Spanglerhelped found the Lindisfarne Association, named after the holy island of CelticChristianity. The Lindisfarne Association was a kind of New Age Eranos—it endedin 2012—that promoted, as did Count Keyserling, a “planetary culture.” Includedamong its members were many serious scholars, poets, writers, musicians,economists, and spiritual leaders, such as Gregory Bateson, James Lovelock,Elaine Pagels, E. F. Schumacher, Paul Winter, Wendell Berry, and Kathleen Raine.In 1990, Raine herself started the Temenos Academy in London, an alternativeeducational program that looks at philosophy and the arts through the lens ofthe perennial philosophy. Temenos is a Greek word meaning “sanctuary” or “holyground,” and the academy was an outgrowth of the Temenos journal started byRaine in 1980.ON THE WAY TO 2012As in the late sixties, the feeling that some event was needed to mark the felt“planetary shift” arose again, and 1987 also saw the rise of what was known asthe “Harmonic Convergence.” This was an occult watershed the significance ofwhich was supposed to become clear twenty-five years later, in 2012, when theprocess then started would culminate in a radical change in the conditions oflife—or so its proponents argued. To help the process along, thousands of peoplearound the world gathered at sacred sites and “power spots”—Mount Shasta inCalifornia; Sedona, Arizona; Stonehenge in England—to achieve a unified, globalmeditation needed to ensure that the transition to the “new time” would gosmoothly. If what we can call “esotourism,” “sacred travel,” and the“metaphysical holiday industry” didn’t start then—after all, we’ve seen howtravel in search of knowledge is a mainstay of the esoteric tradition—theycertainly got a major boost at the time and have remained central parts ofpostmodern spirituality, as the many spiritual seminars, shamanic weekends, andvision quests available today show.The idea of the Harmonic Convergence was the brainchild of the art historian andNew Age philosopher José Argüelles and the psychedelic guru Terence McKenna. Viadifferent routes, both had arrived at the idea that 2012 would mark a kind ofontological breakthrough and that the process leading up to it would start in1987, on the weekend of August 16–17 to be exact. (Oddly enough, nearly twentyyears earlier the Woodstock Festival took place over the same weekend.)Argüelles got there through a reading—some would say misreading—of the ancientMayan calendar, a journey he communicated in his best-selling book The MayanFactor (1987). McKenna, who had inherited the mantle of drug guru from TimothyLeary, was a guiding figure of the “rave generation”—a reprise of sixtiespsychedelia—and had cottoned on to the importance of 2012 via a study of the IChing and a liberal use of magic mushrooms. One result of this suggestivecombination was McKenna’s book The Invisible Landscape (1975). Argüelles’s graspof the meaning of the Mayan calendar and its supposed predictions of globaldisruption for the year 2012 have been subject to much criticism, and DennisMcKenna, Terence’s brother and colleague in psilocybin research, has gone onrecord saying that Terence got it wrong.34 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber721]Both Argüelles and McKenna argued that a “singularity” would take place in 2012,an event of such fundamental significance that existence itself would radicallyalter. As the term should suggest, “singularities” don’t occur that often.Physicists use the term to refer to the conditions prior to the supposed BigBang and to the anomalous properties of black holes. Yet many agreed with theprophets and some looked forward to 2012 as a time when the ancient godQuetzalcoatl would return. Prior to that portentous year, books, seminars,workshops, DVDs, lectures, and other essential items fed a hungry market, eagerto help the new epoch along. Many also believed that, as actually happened, 2012would be a year like most others.35 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber722]MY PART IN ALL THISI was not among those meditating on Mount Shasta or promoting good vibes inSedona, but during the Harmonic Convergence I was, it seems, in one of the mostauspicious places on the planet, at least according to the true believers whotold me so. At the time I was working in a well-known metaphysical bookshop inLos Angeles and I saw at first hand the rise of the New Age from a concern of amodest group on the cutting edge or lunatic fringe—the difference between thetwo is often hard to distinguish—to a cultural trend of wide and at times almostmanic popularity. The bookshop was a favorite with Aquarian conspirators, butafter Shirley MacLaine, it opened its doors to a much larger clientele.I had got there by a circuitous route, which started some twelve years earlier.My introduction to the occult, the esoteric, and the Hermetic happened in 1975,when I was living on New York’s Bowery and playing in a rock-and-roll band.36[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber723] Remnants from the sixties generation werestill visible amid what would soon be called “punk,” and a book I read at thetime changed my life. It was Colin Wilson’s The Occult. Soon after reading it, Ideveloped an enthusiasm for its subject matter that has lasted ever since.In the years that followed, I studied and practiced magic (Crowley’s variety),was for some years involved in the Gurdjieff work, and went on a mini “searchfor the miraculous” that had me in Chartres Cathedral, Stonehenge, and at thesite of Gurdjieff’s institute in Fontainebleau, as well as other places. (Lateradventures had me visiting Monte Verità and Casa Gabriella, site of the EranosConferences.) I also read a great deal. While working at the bookshop—andearning a degree in philosophy—I started writing book reviews and articles formagazines like Gnosis, Quest, ReVision, and others, all in some way dedicated tothe western inner tradition. By 1996, I had left the bookshop and, after anaborted career in academia, had moved to London, where I became a full-timewriter. My first book, Turn Off Your Mind, a “revisionist” look at the occultrevival of the 1960s, came out in 2001, and I have been writing books eversince.Along the way, I met and spoke with several people mentioned in this book. I saythis not to blow my own horn, but to show that what began as a naïve enthusiasmsome forty years ago developed—slowly, and with many detours—into what I hope isa serious study of our “rejected knowledge” and an engagement with some of thepeople pursuing it today. My point in mentioning this is to provide mycredentials for some of the remarks that follow.ESOTERIC INTERNETThroughout most of our history, the urgent desire for personal knowledge andexperience of the spiritual, the esoteric, the occult, or the inner was for themost part limited to a small number of people. A variety of factors made thisso. One was simply that throughout most of our history, only a small number ofpeople were interested enough in these matters to seek them out and submit tothe rigors necessary to understand them. Another was the availability of thematerial itself. For ages, most teaching was done orally, and even when writtenmaterial existed, it was available only to the few who could read and could gainaccess to it. It seems obvious, but we should pause to consider what a miraclethe invention of the printing press was—all concern for its deleterious effects,as Leonard Shlain has pointed out, notwithstanding. Suddenly what had been inthe hands of only the few could now be dispersed to the many.A similar growth in the power of dissemination occurred with the rise of thepopular press, radio, and television. And now these, along with the print media,have been superseded by the Internet, which has made possible the kind of“planetary culture” and “global village” visionaries like Count Keyserling andMarshall McLuhan dreamed of. Today, more times than not, we can communicate withsomeone on the other side of the planet more easily than we can with ourneighbors, and we have practically instantaneous access to a bewildering amountof information coming from a dizzying number of sources.Yet celebrations of the “information highway” have become somewhat muted inrecent times. This is due in part to use and familiarity. My children take theInternet absolutely for granted and can’t conceive of a time when computers,cell phones, and other electronic devices were not standard issue. Many of uswho bridge the generation gap between pre- and post-Internet feel much the same.But we have also learned that not everything on the information highway isworthy of attention. The first flush of excitement has passed and we recognizethat, as in all things, discrimination is key. Early television viewers wereamazed to see anything on what was soon dubbed “the idiot box,” just as thefirst cinemagoers were startled by what they saw on the screen. By now, the“wow” factor of the Internet has dwindled and it is not unusual to hearcomplaints about the amount of “noise” one has to wade through—blogs, Web sites,chat lines, misinformation, advertising—before reaching a “signal.”Similar grumbles were heard in the early twentieth century, when the rise ofmass literacy led to the growth of a popular literature whose quality wasquestionable but which fed the voracious appetite for entertaining readingmaterial. In the nineteenth century, humanists like Matthew Arnold believed thatthrough mass education, the cultural level of the average person would be raisedso that they could learn to appreciate great works of art and literature,previously available only to the wealthy and privileged, thereby enriching theirlives. Arnold, I think, would be dismayed to see that what actually happened isthat the taste of the masses won out, and that the great works of literature,though readily available, still remain the concern of the few. This is true evenin the universities, once the bastions of “high culture.” There the idea of a“great work” is discredited and the ascendancy of popular culture, if notcomplete, is surely on its way to being so.37 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber724]What does this mean in terms of the western esoteric tradition? It suggests tome that, in a very real sense, it is no longer esoteric, or at least not so muchas it used to be. Which is to say it is no longer secret. This does not mean, ofcourse, that the content of the esoteric tradition has changed. Hermeticism isstill Hermetic and Gnosticism still gnostic, and the challenges facing someonetrying to understand them and other elements of the esoteric tradition remain.But these teachings are no longer “hidden” in the way they once were.When I first became interested in these ideas forty years ago, one still had tomake a considerable effort to find them, although the wide distribution ofesoteric, spiritual, and occult literature that would soon explode in the NewAge had begun. I can’t complain about this. After my first exposure to theoccult, I was happy to find cheap reprints of occult classics in the remainderbins of many bookshops, and my own introduction to this tradition came through apaperback, not the emissary of a secret society. Still, places like Weiser’sBookshop and Magickal Childe in New York, and Gilbert’s and the Bodhi Tree(where I worked) in Los Angeles were special, and their clientele went out oftheir way to get to them. Of course, a certain amount of nostalgia informs myview of them, but I don’t think I am romanticizing too much. More was availablein the 1970s than was around in, say, the 1940s or 1950s. But it was nothinglike the tidal wave of material available now at little more than the click of amouse.In pointing this out I am not saying things were better back then. From thepoint of view of a writer researching material, the fact that I can find muchliterature online that earlier I would have had to hunt down in alibrary—assuming it had it—is in many ways a blessing. What I am trying toconvey is that the often instant availability of much esoteric material todayhas, whether we like it or not, changed its character. This is true not only ofoccult or esoteric literature. People interested in yoga, meditation, Tarot,alchemy, or any number of other hitherto arcane pursuits can now, more timesthan not, find access to these things and more easily. This was not always thecase and it can only be a good thing that these and other once “mysterious”interests are fairly common. But as mentioned earlier when talking about the NewAge, a certain amount of watering down is inevitable, a certain amount ofleveling off, of dilution, is unavoidable.Another factor impacting the esoteric today is its association with politicaland sociological concerns centering around what has come to be known as“identity politics.” This focuses, more or less, on the demands of certain“subcultures” to be recognized as of equal value and importance within anincreasingly diverse and multicultural society. So people who considerthemselves “pagans” or Wiccans, or some other formerly unrecognized groupdevoted to an occult or spiritual practice now want to receive the samerecognition and representation traditionally reserved for more mainstreambeliefs.Likewise, the New Age focus on “saving the planet” has led to an at timestangled, not to say confused, association of spiritual, esoteric, andenvironmental concerns. (Gnostics, for example, are not concerned with savingthe planet, while many nature-oriented people deny that we are anything morethan clever animals.) While these interests are in many ways valid and worthy ofattention, they can obscure the more inward necessities of “pure” esotericism.This is something Rudolf Steiner discovered when in his last years he expressedconcern that the more practical application of his ideas in education,agriculture, medicine, and other fields was shifting attention away from the“supersensible perception” that was his central aim. Although an enormous task,saving the planet can often seem easier than confronting difficultepistemological questions.Earlier I mentioned the idea that before the outbreak of spiritualism in thenineteenth century, a conference of esoteric masters convened to discuss thequestion whether occult knowledge, hitherto held secret, should be released, inorder to circumvent the complete triumph of scientific materialism. The decisionthen was to release the knowledge, but as later esotericists like MadameBlavatsky and Rudolf Steiner believed, the attempt was a failure. I am notsuggesting that a similar conference argued about the pros and cons of the NewAge and its global dissemination through the Internet. I am pointing out thatthe problem is a perennial one: whether it is better to err on the side of theconservative view, and retain a teaching’s purity by restricting itsavailability—hence leaving it less effective in the wider world—or on the sideof the liberal view, gaining wide distribution at the expense of quality.It would seem that whether we like it or not, technology has forced the issue,and the liberal view has won out. The secret is no longer secret and theesoteric cat is out of the bag. As Joscelyn Godwin writes: “The secrets onceimparted only to initiates are there on the bookshelves.”38[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber725] Or as Antoine Faivre said to me many yearsago, “When I first starting reading this sort of literature [in the 1950s] nameslike Crowley, the Golden Dawn, and Gurdjieff sounded mysterious. Now they’re nolonger mysterious. They ceased to be so as early as the 1970s.”39[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber726]MEDITATIONS ON THE TAROTYet is it really true that esoteric work no longer goes on? Perhaps not. One ofthe most esoteric works of modern times did not appear in an English translationuntil 1985, and then anonymously, making it truly the work of a secret teacher.I am referring to the remarkable Meditations on the Tarot, which is now known tohave been written in the late 1960s by the Estonian-Russian polyglot andChristian esotericist Valentin Tomberg. Tomberg was then living in England andit is not clear whether he was aware of the occult revival taking place at thetime. He stipulated that his magnum opus—the Meditations number some 600-plusdensely packed pages—would not be published until after his death, and then onlyanonymously. Tomberg died of a stroke in Majorca in 1973, but it would be morethan a decade before a full edition of his masterpiece was made available to thepublic.Tomberg was born in 1900 in St. Petersburg, and in his late teens he becameinterested in Theosophy and the spiritual philosophy of Vladimir Soloviev andthe Russian Orthodox Church. He left the Theosophical Society soon after joiningit and turned his attention to Steiner’s Anthroposophy: in the early 1900s,Steiner had made a powerful impact on the generation of Russia’s “God Seekers.”Tomberg’s family was devastated by the revolution—he lost both parents and abrother—and in 1920, he left Russia and went to Tallinn, Estonia. He later triedto make contact with Steiner, hoping to become his student, but his letters wentunanswered. It is unclear if Steiner ever received them; in the last months ofhis life, he was too ill to keep up correspondence and may simply have beenunable to reply.Tomberg joined the Estonian branch of the Anthroposophical Society in 1925,eventually becoming its secretary general. But his independent mind soon led tofriction with the Anthroposophical establishment. Throughout the 1930s, Tombergwrote many articles for Anthroposophical journals on a variety of esotericsubjects, many having to do with the esoteric interpretation of the Bible, the“return of Christ in the etheric,” and the “mission” of different nationalities.These articles were informed by a mystical experience Tomberg had in 1931, inwhich he said he had been put in contact with the “angelic world.” Increasinglyhis ideas seemed counter to Anthroposophical doctrine, and by the end of thedecade, he was asked to leave the society. Tomberg had already sought to find aplace for himself at Steiner’s Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, but wasrefused by Steiner’s widow.In 1938, Tomberg moved to Holland, where he became involved in the DutchResistance following the Nazi invasion in 1940. He had become involved in theAnthroposophical Society there too, but soon the same frictions occurred and hewas again asked to leave. (The essence of these frictions seemed to have beenthat Tomberg’s esotericism was even more Christ-centered than Steiner’s.) Afterthe war, he went to Cologne, where he earned a degree in jurisprudence andbecame deeply involved in Roman Catholicism, leaving the Russian Orthodox Churchbecause its leadership had seemed sympathetic to the Nazis. It is unclear ifTomberg actually converted—accounts differ on this point—but the church clearlybecame central to his spiritual life.In 1948, Tomberg moved to England, where friends helped him find work with theBBC as a translator; like Roberto Assagioli, he had a talent for languages (theMeditations were originally written in French). Part of his work involvedmonitoring Soviet broadcasts. He retired in 1960 and devoted the rest of hislife to study and to writing. Aside from his early Anthroposophical articles,the majority of his work appeared only after his death.The Meditations on the Tarot were written, Tomberg said, from the point of viewof a voice reaching readers from “beyond the grave,” and their aim is to immersethe reader in the current of “thought, effort, and revelation” that constitutesthe “millennium-old” Hermetic tradition.40 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber727] Thebook’s subtitle, A Journey into Christian Hermeticism, may give contemporaryreaders some pause, but Tomberg is writing in the French Hermetic traditionwhich, from Eliphas Levi on, has always been at least a fellow traveler with thechurch. Tomberg himself says that the book’s roots lie in the “pre-ChristianChristianity” of ancient Egypt, by which he means the teachings of HermesTrismegistus. Some readers may be put off by this, but they would be mistaken.The Christian elements in the work are in essence esoteric, and the claims madefor the Roman Catholic Church as an insuperable repository of Hermetic wisdomcan be taken with the necessary grains of salt. What comes through is thatTomberg has thought hard and deeply and that his wide reading in philosophy,psychology, literature, as well as esotericism—Jung, Gurdjieff, Steiner,Teilhard de Chardin, and Bergson are among his many references—informs his vitalintuitive grasp of the Tarot’s symbolism.The Meditations are written in the form of letters to an “unknown friend”—thereader—and are essentially allusive, discursive essays on the twenty-two Tarottrumps. Space does not allow me to do more than touch on Tomberg’s aim inwriting them. Although in the context of Christian teaching, Tomberg’s basic aimis to get the reader to think Hermetically, to let the rich symbolism of thetrumps reach into our imagination and trigger our faculty for seeingconnections, analogies, the subtle correspondences linking everything witheverything else—for, that is, a right-brain form of thought.The trumps are, he says, arcana which, in true esoteric fashion, “conceal andreveal their sense at one and the same time according to the depth ofmeditation.”41 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber728] They are not allegories orsecrets—or tools for fortune-telling—but a kind of “enzyme” that is essential inorder “to be fruitful in a given spiritual domain.” These “enzymes” “ferment”the knowledge necessary for spiritual experience, and each trump presents a“spiritual exercise” necessary in order to render us capable of “making newdiscoveries” and “engendering new ideas.” They in a sense help us to livecreatively. Such creative living can lead us to what Tomberg calls the“mysteries,” spiritual events that alter our consciousness. The Hermeticistengaged in this work is, Tomberg tells his unknown friends, “at one and the sametime a mystic, gnostic, magician and philosopher” who brings together andsynthesizes “the diverse planes of the macrocosm and the microcosm” and “aspiresto conscious participation with the constructive forces of the world.”42[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber729]GEBSER’S BREAKDOWNIt would seem, then, that even as late as the 1960s, work of a truly esotericcharacter was still being produced. Yet the dense, erudite, and challengingpages of Meditations on the Tarot seem something of an exception amid the more“reader friendly” texts informing the high-profile popular spirituality of ourtime.Where, then, are we today?Throughout this book I have mentioned the philosopher Jean Gebser’s idea thatsince Petrarch made his perilous ascent of Mount Ventoux, the western mind hasbeen involved in what Gebser calls the “deficient mode of the mental-rationalconsciousness structure.” By the “deficient mode,” Gebser means a time when aparticular consciousness structure has exhausted its possibilities, hasactualized its capacities, and has reached the end of its development. At thispoint it can go no further, and like an overripe fruit, it starts to go bad. Itsadvantages become liabilities and, in a way reminiscent of Gurdjieff’s “law ofseven” or Jung’s enantiodromia, it starts to turn against itself.I have suggested that with the all-out attack on the Hermetic tradition launchedby Merin Mersenne in 1623, the deficient mode of the mental-rationalconsciousness structure entered a particularly heightened state—if we can speakmeaningfully of a “heightened deficiency.” Like the Gnostic demiurge and IainMcGilchrist’s overconfident left brain, it believed it was self-sufficient andignored any idea that its perspective was only partial, and that, no matter howmuch it denied it, it was inextricably linked to another perspective, radicallyother than its own but equally necessary. By the nineteenth century and thetriumph of scientific materialism, this deficient mode could lay claim to moreor less dominance, with the church ceding more and more ground and with Romanticpoets noisily but ineffectively sounding warnings about its debilitating effecton the soul.It was at this point that spiritualism appeared on the scene. If its appearancewas, as some have suggested, aimed at retarding the advance of materialism, wemay agree with Madame Blavatsky and Rudolf Steiner that it failed in itsmission. Yet that may be too critical a judgment. Blavatsky and Steiner hadharsh words about spiritualism. Steiner even said that the spiritualists werethe worst materialists of all; with their attempts to “prove” the existence ofthe spiritual world by photographing spirits or using other scientific means ofestablishing their reality, they were in effect denying the essence of thespiritual, i.e., that it is not physical. We can understand Steiner’s pointwhile at the same time appreciating the work of Frederic Myers, William James,and others. If spiritualism did not stop the spread of materialism, it didintroduce many people to the reality of something beyond the physical world, andas we’ve seen, during the positive fin-de-siècle, it led many of the best mindsof the time to a recognition that materialist science, adequate and triumphantin its own realm, was insufficient as a complete vision of the universe.This was something that science itself would soon recognize. By the latenineteenth century, the mechanical view of the universe was so well establishedand so confident in its ability to explain everything that scientists believedthat if they knew the position and speed of all the particles in the universe,they could accurately predict the future behavior of these particles. In otherwords, they believed that the future was absolutely determined by the state ofthings in the present, which was itself determined by the past. Nothing, theybelieved, fell outside this web of total determinism. This meant that free willwas an illusion, given that we ourselves are nothing more than collections ofparticles, subject to the same inescapable mechanical laws as the rest of theuniverse.This view gave man a remarkable predictive power, but it also reduced him tobeing a cogwheel in an invariable cosmic clockwork. Man had risen to a masteryof the physical world, but at the expense of accepting his slavery to it, and ofrecognizing himself as only an infinitesimal speck trapped in a universeoblivious to his existence. That such a vision undermined the very vital drivethat led to it—that it reduced man’s questing spirit and will to truth to fairytales, since neither spirit nor will were real—was an unfortunate butunavoidable consequence of the facts. These were unpleasant facts, to be sure,but facts nonetheless, and had to be faced stoically. Yet not all were happywith this state of things, and the mindless mechanical existence it affirmed ledsome sensitive souls to some rather extreme expressions of their disapproval.The Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky summed up many people’s feeling ofrejection when he wrote in Notes from Underground (1864) that if everything canbe reduced to mathematical formulae, then “man will go insane on purpose” inorder to prove that “he is a man and not a cog-wheel.” With many others,Dostoyevsky recognized that what we crave most is our sense of freedom, and thatin a universe in which everything is explained, everything accounted for in anunbreakable chain of cause and effect, that sense withers and dies. Men likeDostoyevsky would rather bring such a universe crashing down and embrace chaosand madness than accept the consequences of a world without freedom.A WORLD GONE MAD?The universe may have heard Dostoyevsky. What seemed to have happened in theearly twentieth century is that the universe itself—at least its particles—beganto act rather strangely, at least from the perspective of mechanicaldeterminism. It would not be too exaggerated to say that it seemed to have gonepositively crazy. The quantum mechanics that arose in the early twentiethcentury with Max Planck presented a universe rather different from thenineteenth-century mechanical one. At the macro level—the level of airplanes,planets, and baseballs—the predictive power of the mechanical view still worked.But at the micro level, that of the particles making up baseballs and everythingelse, it was running into some problems.The essence of this shift from a stable, predictable universe to one thatsuddenly seemed much stranger can be expressed in the “uncertainty principle” ofWerner Heisenberg, mentioned earlier. According to this, we cannot predict whatthe particles making up the universe will be doing in the future, because wecan’t determine with any accuracy what they are doing now. We can, according toHeisenberg, know their position or their speed, but not both simultaneously.Without knowing both, our predictions become guesses. The particles themselvesare now no longer really particles but are thought of as “wave functions” whichgive the probability, higher or lower, that the particle associated with themwill be located in one patch of space or another. We can’t say for sure in theway that the nineteenth-century model thought it could.Further developments led to even more unusual discoveries, and by now readers ofpopular books on the “new” physics are familiar with a whole host of newelementary particles that the nineteenth-century mechanistic view could not evenimagine existed. Some particles are thought to move backward in time. Some canact as a particle, or as a wave, or both. Some come in and out of existence.Particles making up an atom change position without traversing space, the famous“quantum leap,” rather as if you got out of bed and found yourself in youroffice, without having traveled across town to get there. Particles act“nonlocally,” reacting to each other’s movements without any medium carryinginformation between them. And every particle in the universe seems in somestrange way to be connected to every other particle so that, in some way wecan’t yet understand, what happens to one affects all the others. In “The LoveSong of J. Alfred Prufrock,” T. S. Eliot asked the existential question: “Do Idare disturb the universe?” According to quantum physics, we are doing it allthe time.The nineteenth-century model saw particles as billiard balls, bumping into eachother, their predictable impact moving the clockwork universe along. Now we haveto think of billiard balls that disappear and reappear, that suddenly turn intowaves of energy flowing across the billiard table, that move before being hit bythe cue ball, or that pop out of the table’s pockets.The crazy behavior associated with quantum physics troubled Einstein—whose ownideas about “curved space” fundamentally altered our ideas about space andtime—and led him to assert that “God does not play dice with the universe.”Later physicists like David Bohm agreed with Einstein and tried to locate the“hidden variables” that Einstein believed could account for the crazy behaviorof the quantum world. Yet further developments have not borne Einstein out, andfor good or bad, God seems to be, in Stephen Hawking’s words, “an inveterategambler, who throws the dice on every possible occasion.”43[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber730] Later developments such as “chaos theory”suggest that even at the macro level, events are not as predictable as we wouldlike, with innocuous butterflies in China causing tornadoes in the Midwest—notto mention wreaking havoc with our weather reports.A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVEIn The Ever-Present Origin, Gebser charted these developments, as well asparallel ones in philosophy, literature, psychology, history, and many otherdisciplines, in order to show that, as a consequence of the breakdown of themental-rational structure of consciousness, the once unassailable mechanicalview of existence was falling apart. The “perspective” that arose from Petrarchgazing out from atop Mount Ventoux, and that established ourselves as detachedbeings confronting a world separate from ourselves, was being dismantled,evidence for which Gebser saw in the “aperspectival” paintings produced byPicasso, Braque, and other members of the Cubist school.A similar disruption of the linearity associated with perspective and the cleanlines of rational thought was emerging in literature too: the great novels ofJoyce, Proust, Mann, Musil, and others all take liberties with our usual senseof linear time and stable place. Arnold Schoenberg’s difficult “twelve tone”system of music broke up traditional notions of musical form and introduced astrange, alien-sounding “atonal” world. In philosophy, Martin Heidegger’s beliefthat we took a wrong turn at Plato led to his attempt at a “deconstruction” ofwestern philosophy, which he hoped would enable us to once again encounter themystery of being, free of the constraints placed upon it by our drive to“explain” reality rationally.In more recent times, Heidegger’s insight has been taken up by a host ofpostmodern thinkers, busily “deconstructing” the western mind’s view of reality,rather like the ancient image of the ouroboros snake eating its own tail. Inthis process, widely diverging views can meet in some unlikely encounters. In anunexpected union, both postmodern and New Age thinking, otherwise ratheropposed, suggest, in different ways, that reality is more or less up for grabs,that it is ultimately, as Keats said of beauty, “in the eye of thebeholder”—i.e., subjective—and both present a somewhat cavalier attitude in theface of this. And so the idea of some hard, objective reality “out there,” whichis the heart of the old materialist view, is, it seems, really passé.The upshot of these and other developments—here I have only touched the surfaceof Gebser’s monumental analysis—is that the once-stable worldview of westernconsciousness has for some time now been loosening at the seams. In one sensethis isn’t news. We’ve already seen that “degeneration” was a popular theme inthe fin-de-siècle—popular enough for Max Nordau to write a best-selling bookabout it. Another best seller on a similar theme, Oswald Spengler’s The Declineof the West, appeared in Europe after World War I. Spengler argued that, likeliving organisms, civilizations are born, grow to maturity, and die, and hebelieved ours was on its way out.Since then dozens—hundreds—of books have appeared that, in one way or another,support Gebser’s thesis. In recent times we have been treated to the “end” ofquite a few things. In The Order of Things (1966), the philosopher MichelFoucault spoke of the “end of man,” meaning the end of the Enlightenmenthumanism rooted in the philosophy of Kant. The political scientist FrancisFukuyama wrote The End of History and the Last Man (1992), which argued that theglobal spread of liberal democracy and the free market marked the triumph andculmination of western civilization. John Horgan’s The End of Science (1996) wassubtitled Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age.In Grammars of Creation (2001), George Steiner, one of the last Europeancultural mandarins, laments that “We have no more beginnings” and concludes thatthere is “in the climate of spirit at the end of the twentieth century, a coretiredness.” “We are, or feel ourselves to be, latecomers.”44[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber731] And in From Dawn to Decadence (2001), anaccount of the last five hundred years, the historian Jacques Barzun—who died in2012 at the age of 104—presents a picture of early twenty-first-century manundergoing what he calls the “Great Undoing,” the West’s self-immolation at thehands of chat shows, gangsta rap, and fashionable deconstructionism. The greatthemes that fueled the West from the Renaissance to today, Barzun argues, havebecome knotted up in a tangled skein of competing and contradictory “goods” thatwe have no hope of unraveling. (For example, in order to secure “individualrights and freedom,” governments have to introduce more and more laws, thuscreating more restrictions and less freedom.)We live today in a state of what the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman calls “liquidmodernity,” a flux of rapid change and instability, a sort of socialshape-shifting that produces unease and insecurity, yet without providing aclear focus of their source. As the philosopher Leszek Kolakowski remarked, “Itseems as though we live with the feeling of an all-encompassing crisis withoutbeing able to identify its causes clearly.”45 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber732]A LAST STANDAnd at the same time as the worldview of the mental-rational structure ofconsciousness seems to be petering out, in many ways it also seems that it isexpressing itself in more and more radical and dogmatic ways, as if in its deaththroes it is making one last bid to secure its dominance. So the physicistSteven Weinberg tells us that the more we understand the universe, the morepointless it appears; rabid atheists like Richard Dawkins employ transportadvertising to convince us that God doesn’t exist; neuroscientists andphilosophers of mind like Nicholas Humphrey and Daniel Dennett go to greatlengths to “explain” consciousness as an effect of purely physical causes; andadvocates of the new “genetic behaviorism” assure us that free will is anillusion and we are really helpless captives of our genes, determined by them atevery step.46 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber733]The list could go on. If all Gebser did was to add his voice to the manyspeaking darkly of these developments, he would only have presented a remarkablyeloquent and richly researched jeremiad about the last days—no small feat,indeed, but not unique. But for Gebser, the breakdown of one consciousnessstructure is necessary in order to clear ground for the emergence of a new one.Gebser argues that the unraveling of the western rational mind-set that has beentaking place throughout the last century and into our own is the prelude andnecessary precondition for the appearance of what, as mentioned, Gebser calledthe “integral structure of consciousness.” This is a structure that integratesand transcends the previous structures, a mutation as shattering as the onesthat came before. The shift from one consciousness structure to another is nopicnic; in a very real sense, whole worlds change in the process. Alfred NorthWhitehead once remarked that “the major advances in civilization are processeswhich all but wreck the societies in which they occur.”47[21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber734] Gebser would agree and would add that out ofthat wreckage something new and necessary can—must—emerge.THE NEW CONSCIOUSNESSI am suggesting that the widespread popular spirituality and interest in theoccult that we conveniently speak of as the New Age is another symptom andindication of the breakdown of the mental-rational consciousness structure. Itis a grassroots recognition that the explanations and answers the departingconsciousness structure provides are no longer completely adequate for ourneeds, if indeed they ever were. The negative side of this is the “flight fromreason” that much of this embodies, the unthinking rejection of the mind,intellect, and critical reasoning that informs a great deal of New Agephilosophy. In a way, we can see this as a kind of right-brain guerrilla tactic,a running commando raid on the left-brain’s supply lines. It is not enough toinflict serious damage, but it is a persistent annoyance. Yet history’s pendulumswings are never precise, and while the plunge into the occult that began in the1960s can be seen as a necessary compensation for the increasing“scientification” of the modern world, it too presents problems of its own, andI have spelled some of them out in Turn Off Your Mind.We have already seen that Maslow, one of the founders of the human potentialmovement and an astute critic of reductionist science—as his classic ThePsychology of Science (1966) makes clear—was wary of the anti-intellectualismpopular at places like Esalen. The danger here is to throw the rational baby outwith the hyperrational bathwater. The kind of “turn off your mind” and “go withthe flow” sensibility informing this anti-intellectualism can too easily succumbto a dangerous irrationalism, to the kind of forced spontaneity and unreflectiveaction that characterized much of the 1960s counterculture and also itsequivalent in Europe in the years leading up to World War II. As in the positivefin-de-siècle, many of the interests and pursuits we associate with our ownoccult revival were popular then too, and more than one historian has made thesobering observation that the embrace of myth, intuition, “the soul,” and theunconscious springs of life and vitality that informed the rejection ofdry-as-dust intellect in the 1920s and ’30s also provided the soil in whichdangerous developments like Nazism and Fascism—both of which rejected thecritical mind in favor of myth—grew. This is not to say, as some critics have,that a concern with myth and the soul at the expense of the critical intellectnecessarily leads to some form of fascism, but that the potential for it doingso is real.The positive side of our current spiritual revival is that it may contain withinit signs of the new consciousness structure Gebser saw on the rise. Again, thisis not to say that the New Age is evidence or proof of the new, integralstructure of consciousness; merely that within it, mixed in with much that ismerely fashionable and downright silly, there may be indications of the kind ofshift Gebser had in mind. Gebser was aware of the rising popular interest in newforms of consciousness. In a preface to a new edition of The Ever-PresentOrigin, written just a few months before his death in 1973, Gebser wrote that“The principle subject of the book, proceeding from man’s altered relationshipto time, is the new consciousness, and to this those of the younger generationare keenly attuned.”48 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber735]Yet Gebser was also aware of the dangers of a too precipitous plunge into thedeep waters of the “magical structure of consciousness,” whose characteristicform of “group consciousness”—which played a central role in the sixtiespsychedelic counterculture and continues to do so in the New Age—Gebser hadfirsthand acquaintance with, witnessing the Nazi rallies in Munich in the1920s.49 [21_Notes.xhtml#EndnoteNumber736] As with so many things, a finebalance is required here, that “just right” of the “Goldilocks moment,” when twoextremes come together into a new development, transcending both. That such acritical fine-tuning is required now is the central idea of this book. Thependulum swings from one side to the other really get us nowhere.Gebser’s first hint that a new form of consciousness seemed to be awakening inwestern man came to him in 1932, through a study of the poetry of Rilke. LikeOwen Barfield, Gebser saw that language reflected changes in consciousness, andin studying Rilke’s poetry, Gebser experienced a “lightning-like inspiration”that he spent the rest of his life unpacking: the intuition that westernconsciousness was mutating into some new form, one, as we’ve seen, that hebelieved was essentially characterized by a marked change in our appreciation oftime. We have seen some of the developments Gebser believed offered proof ofthis: the breakdown of linear, step-by-step sequential thinking in favor of thesimultaneity in the paintings of Picasso; the novels of Joyce, Proust, andothers; and the alterations to our understanding of space and time provided byEinstein’s relativity theory and quantum physics.My own belief is that if Gebser was around to witness it, he would have seenconfirmation of his ideas in the rise of the Internet and the triumph over timeand space offered by popular technological developments like TiVo and podcasts,which allow us to watch or listen to a television or radio program when andwhere we want, without having to be at a particular place at a particular time.These offer rather banal evidence for Gebser’s insight, to be sure, and I am notsuggesting that they themselves are some important evolutionary advance. Buttheir sheer triviality seems to suggest a stronger support than some more“mystical” proof. The “irruption of time” that Gebser saw on its way would notnecessarily emerge in exciting, romantic ways, as the idea of a radical“singularity” might suggest. When our small, commonplace ways of life areaffected, it is clear that some change has occurred.THE INTEGRAL BRAINGebser’s descriptions of the new, integral structure of consciousness offer someof the most difficult passages in The Ever-Present Origin. This should not besurprising. From Plato on, throughout this book we have encountered thedifficulties of trying to speak of the unsayable. Yet if we are not to restcontent with the silence of the via negativa, an attempt must be made. And wehave seen that, although never completely successful—the meanings we are tryingto capture always exceed explicit statement—such attempts are worth the effort.As Owen Barfield, Gebser, Ouspensky, and many others knew, with each new word orexpression, some new side of reality is grasped, its precincts are extended bythat much, and our own consciousness is likewise enlarged. Language is one ofour greatest tools in exploring consciousness, perhaps the most important one.It is our way of mapping reality. Yet it is a strange kind of map: its useincreases the area it covers, as if the more you understand the map, the moremap there is to understand.In the case of the integral structure of consciousness, we have to admit, wehave a difficult map. Gebser faces the challenge of using the language of oneconsciousness structure to speak of a very different consciousness structure,one that transcends the basis of the language used to describe it. This is whyGebser’s lexicon contains many words beginning with the prefix “a”:“aperspectival,” “atemporal,” “acausality,” “amensionality,” and others. As withDionysius the Areopagite and other followers of the via negativa, Gebser mustresort to saying what the integral structure of consciousness is not like, inorder to convey some sense of it. And what it is not like is our mental-rationalstructure, which sees things in terms of perspective, time, causality, thedimensions of space, sequence, and the necessities of Aristotelian logic.Gebser’s more positive coinages—“concretion,” “waring,” “verition,”“diaphaneity”—offer their own difficulties. “Concretion” refers to the“concretizing of the spiritual” that accompanies the integral structure;“waring” reveals the “itself” of ourselves and others; with “verition,” theworld becomes “pure statement,” its being and presence “self-evident”; and“diaphaneity” is the “shining-through” of “Origin,” which will become “present”in the new consciousness structure. These are not easy sayings, and to grasp theinsight of only one of them requires considerable effort and in effect bringsabout a change in consciousness itself. In a sense we can say that we can onlyunderstand the integral structure of consciousness by experiencing it, and wecan experience it by trying to understand it.Yet in many ways, Gebser’s descriptions of the integral structure ofconsciousness are very similar to the kind of consciousness that throughout thisbook we have associated with a thinking more informed by a right-brainperspective. This too should not be surprising; as we have seen, Gebser’s“mental-rational” consciousness structure is practically identical to the viewIain McGilchrist has associated with a left-brain-dominant consciousness. Thissuggests that a consciousness that goes beyond the mental-rational structurewould be similar to one that went beyond a left-brain dominant view. Such aconsciousness would be one that emerged from bringing the two sides of the braintogether, from, that is, integrating them, and, via the transcendent function,producing something new. That Gebser calls the new structure of consciousness“integral” suggests something similar. We seem to speaking of an “integralbrain,” one whose hemispheric fusion “completes the partial mind” and providesaccess to a more complete reality.Gebser speaks of such a consciousness as being “ego-free,” which he insists doesnot mean “ego-less.” Gebser is not speaking of a return to the whole, a blendingof our consciousness with that of the All, as some mystical paths suggest. In“ego-freedom,” as I understand it, we are aware of the whole and our relation toit, while retaining our clear awareness of our independent self. We are“ego-free” insofar as we transcend the limited perspective of the ego, the smallself, aware of little more than its appetites and complaints, and gain a“bird’s-eye view” of the larger world beyond ourselves. It is a more objectiveview, an embrace of the impersonal. We “step back” from the ego, our usual senseof ourselves associated with the left brain, and perceive a larger reality,seeing things “aperspectivally,” not from only one “point of view,” but many.Such is the case when, as McGilchrist tells us, the left brain relaxes itsdominance and allows the right to make its contribution. We are not thenego-less—we still feel ourselves to be an “I,” in fact, a much larger one—but weare free of the limited perspective of the left brain, and through the rightbrain are aware of the “network of connections linking everything to everythingelse.”COMPLETING THE PARTIAL MINDAs we’ve seen, Jung believed that the coming shift in the “psychic dominants”would “constellate the problem of the union of opposites.” The opposites here inquestion are the two sides of our brain, and the two modes of consciousnessassociated with them. (And I point out once again, that even if it turns outthat everything said about the left and right brain is wrong, our two modes ofconsciousness remain and are the important thing, wherever they are located.)McGilchrist argues that throughout history, there have been brief butsignificant moments when these two rivals worked together, and the results weretransformative: Greek philosophy, Renaissance genius, and Romantic vision weresome of them. If, as I have argued, the dismissal of the esoteric, Hermetic,occult tradition and its relegation to the status of “rejected knowledge” fourhundred years ago was the result of a coup d’état on the part of the left brainagainst the right, it seems reasonable to ask what the resurgence of this“rejected knowledge” in the last half century or so means? It can of course meannothing at all, or merely that what seemed mystic eccentricities in the 1970shave been absorbed into our culture, much like other once-exotic practices have.In many ways, I would not argue with this. While it is good and pleasant to haveyoga centers, spiritual seminars, and New Age best sellers, they in themselvesdo not guarantee a change in consciousness. A more generous assessment, however,would, I think, wonder if the prevalence of these and similar developments doesnot suggest that we may be approaching one of those junctures in history whenthe two rivals inside our heads may join forces again, or at least findthemselves in a good position to do so.The need for such a partnership seems clear. Gebser believed that if we did notparticipate in the transition from the old consciousness structure to the newone freely—that is, by undergoing it purposefully in our own consciousness—wewould most likely go smash and experience the transition as a catastrophe, if weare not doing so already. McGilchrist suggests that the crisis produced bydominance of the left brain, which has led to our disenchanted, soulless,mechanized world, would trigger the return of the right.My own feeling is that at least some of the conditions that seemed to beassociated with past creative partnerships between our two modes ofconsciousness are present today. One obvious one is the juxtaposition of the oldand the new, the past and the future. The historian Arnold Toynbee said thatwhen a civilization goes through what he called its “time of troubles,” it seemsto react in one of two ways: what he called the “archaist” and the “futurist.”It can seek to overcome its present difficulties by returning to the past, bytrying to revive some ancient golden age. Or it can try to overcome itschallenges by leaping into some bright, dazzling future. Both options seem opento us today. Proponents of an “archaic revival” see our salvation in embracingthe wisdom of indigenous, nonwestern people, at home in nature and untouched bymodernity’s ills, while advocates of “transhumanism” see our hope in aman-machine merger that would have our minds digitized and downloaded ontocomputers. It is not too difficult to see the archaist choice as more rightbrain and the futurist one as more left.In this scenario, both extremes move away from each other, yet what we arelooking for is their closer proximity. It was, we remember, the fusion of oldand new that characterized the Renaissance, and we seek a similar “Goldilocksmoment,” when the balance between the two will be “just right.” And while I amnot suggesting that we are definitely on the cusp of a similarly creative time—Imake no prophecy of yet another new age—there is no reason to believe such anoutcome is impossible. Making it possible is up to us. Any lasting change mustfirst take place in the individual. Future historians will have to determine theoutcome and what, if anything, we today have learned from the secret teachers ofthe western world."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS[../image/153618.jpg]Many people helped to make this book possible.

An interestingexperiment would be to try to remember what kinds of images are in our mindswhen we experience this, as the right brain communicates through them. Irecently tried to remember the name of a musician but for the life of me couldnot. While I was racking my left brain for clues, an image of a bird came to meand I had a strong sense that this had something to do with the name. A fewminutes later it came to me: it was Gil Scott-Heron. A related phenomenon wasrecognized by the psychologist Anthony Storr in his book Music and the Mind(London: HarperCollins, 1992). Storr writes about how, in some situations, wefind that a tune is running through our head. We may think that it is random,but it is not; Storr discovered that it often has a clear association with thesituation we find ourselves in, that it is, in fact, a commentary on it. As theright brain is associated with our appreciation of music, we may see in this away in which it makes a nonverbal contribution to our experience. A relatedphenomena would be the “self-symbolic” character of hypnagogic imagery.

This divisionof labor can be seen in nonhuman species as well, McGilchrist argues, and heevidences birds. In order to eat, they need to be able to detect bits of foodamid inedible items, and this requires left-brain accuracy. But they also needto be aware of their overall surroundings so that they don’t become foodthemselves, and here right-brain wide awareness comes in. This double duty,McGilchrist argues, is linked to an asymmetry in avian brains, which blossomsmore fully in our own cerebral hemispheres.10 [07_INTRODUCTION_REJECTED_KNOWLEDGE.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber9].

Both Gebserand Julian Jaynes provide examples of a similar “clash of consciousness.” InJaynes’s case, it was between “bicameral” and “unicameral” man, exemplified bythe fateful encounter between the Incas and the Spanish; for Gebser it was themeeting of a “magical-mythical” consciousness and a “mental-rational” one, whenthe Aztecs fell prey to their European conquerors.

The evaporatingpower of seeking an explicit definition of an implicit meaning is a commonexperience with many of our most fundamental ideas. When asked the meaning of“time,” St. Augustine famously remarked that “if you do not ask the question, Iknow the answer.” This is true of practically all our basic concepts. As LeonardShlain writes, “The things one loves, lives, and dies for cannot easily beexpressed in words” (Shlain 1999, p. 19). This, of course, does not mean thatthey do not exist. Socrates, whom we may see as a “founding father” ofleft-brain rationality, exasperated his interlocutors by insisting that theydefine for him certain ideas the meaning of which they felt sure theyunderstood. See the early dialogue Euthyphro in W. K. C. Guthrie, trans., Plato:Collected Dialogues (Princeton, N.J.: Bollingen Series, 1961). This is not toput esotericism on an equal par with love, art, philosophy, or being; but itdoes share with these a resistance to exact definition.9 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber51]. Throughout thisbook I will use a “loose” meaning of the “esoteric” that will include relatedbut different ideas such as “the occult,” and “Hermetic,” and also “mystery” and“inner tradition.”10 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber52].

I.Gurdjieff, Meetings with Remarkable Men (London: Penguin Classics, 2015). Thisnew edition includes an Introduction by me.17 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber59]. In A SecretHistory of Consciousness, I write about hypnagogia, the strange state ofconsciousness in between sleeping and waking. This is characterized by vividhallucinations and symbolic “half-dreams.” I discuss the work of AndreasMavromatis, whose book Hypnagogia is an exhaustive account of the subject. Oneof Mavromatis’s arguments is that hypnagogia—which I relate to Rudolf Steiner’sideas about the evolution of consciousness—is linked to the older, subcorticalparts of the brain, such as the hippocampus, medulla oblongata, and thalamus.Mavromatis suggests that hypnagogia, which is associated with a kind of“pre-logical thought” involving images, symbols, and analogy, as opposed to theclear, logical thinking associated with the younger cerebral cortex, can be seenas an “older” form of consciousness, much as McGilchrist argues is the case withthe right brain.18 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber60].

Arthur Koestlerprovides some support for Steiner’s ideas about a “picture thinking.” In The Actof Creation (New York: Macmillan, 1964), p. 173, Koestler writes that “asvehicles of thought, pictorial and other nonverbal representations are indeedearlier, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically older forms of ideation, thanverbal thinking” (italics in original).22 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber64].

In MeetingsWith Remarkable Men Gurdjieff mentions coming across a map of “pre-sand Egypt”traced on an ancient parchment. He fails to go into further detail about it, butin A New Model of the Universe (New York: Knopf, 1969), p. 320, Ouspenskyremarks that “the Sphinx is older than historical Egypt” and is the work of an“ancient culture, which was possessed of knowledge far greater than our own.”Ouspensky does not tell us how he knows this, but in In Search of the Miraculous(New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1949), p. 27, Ouspensky tells us that Gurdjieff saidthe Sphinx was a work of “objective art,” that is, it is designed to have aspecific effect on its audience. One suspects Ouspensky’s ideas about the age ofthe Sphinx were based on information given to him by Gurdjieff.25 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber67]. The “precessionof the equinoxes” is an astronomical phenomena caused by a wobble in the Earth’saxis. It is responsible for the apparent backward movement of the sun throughthe signs of the zodiac. A complete cycle takes approximately twenty-sixthousand years, and by acting as a backdrop to sunrise at the vernal equinox,each sign gives its name to an “age”—also known as a “Platonic month”—whichlasts roughly 2,150 years. We are supposed to be on the verge of entering theage of Aquarius, and exiting the age of Pisces. Before Pisces, it was the age ofAries, then the age of Taurus, and so on. As many have pointed out, fishsymbolism surrounds Christ because Christ was the central symbol of the age ofPisces, the astrological sign of the fish. Ram and bull symbolism were prevalentin the previous ages. Much occult and esoteric significance is attached to theseages, which are real phenomena. Needless to say, official science recognizes thephenomena, but not the significance.26 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber68]. In the 1970s, aJapanese firm hired by Nissan tried to construct a replica of the Great Pyramid,but on a smaller scale.

Much has beenwritten in recent years about the Maya (300 B.C.–900 A.D.) and their supposedprediction of a cataclysmic event in the year 2012. Whatever we may think ofthis prediction, the Maya do seem to have possessed a remarkable astronomicaland mathematical knowledge, and they also seem to have been obsessed with time,calculating no less than four calendars: one for the sun, one for the moon, asacred calendar used for ritual purposes, and also what they called the “LongCount,” dealing with very longs periods of time. They were aware of theexistence of Uranus and Neptune, although these were not discovered by Europeansuntil the mid-nineteenth century, and they also calculated a yearly cycleaccording to the orbits of Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn. Whatever we may think ofthe supposed cataclysm of 2012, NASA scientists have informed us that in July2012, the Earth just missed being hit with a “catastrophic” solar storm. TheMaya were especially interested in sun-spot activity, and the dire eventspredicted for 2012 had to do with this;http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/23jul_superstorm/. TheMaya, however, did not develop this knowledge on their own. For all theirastronomical awareness, they did not discover the wheel, so it is likely theyreceived their knowledge of the heavens from elsewhere and merely maintained atradition that was taught to them.41 [08_CHAPTER_ONE_AN_ANCIENT_WISDOM.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber83].

Other sources date Zoroasteranywhere from the eighteenth to sixth centuries B.C. Jaspers places him in hisaxial age, and for the purposes of this book, I have followed him.10 [09_CHAPTER_TWO_OUT_OF_THE_MYSTERIES.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber118].

Here I will use “Gnostic” when speaking of the actual sects ofthe early Christian period, and “gnostic” in a more general sense whenindicating either the pursuit of spiritual knowledge or the attitude that isskeptical of dogma or the conventionally accepted view of reality. “Knowthyself” is a gnostic injunction, but not necessarily a Gnostic one.22 [10_CHAPTER_THREE_THE_SECRET_GNOSIS.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber184].

The creationversus emanation debate runs throughout western consciousness. Both sides haveadvantages and drawbacks. Just as the sun cannot help emanating light andheat—it does not choose to do so but must because of its own nature—in theemanationist view, God does not choose to create the cosmos; he or she can’thelp it, as it is part of God’s nature. This puts limits on God—he or she can’tavoid emanating—but it lets creation share in God’s fullness, rather than be akind of metaphysical afterthought. To some extent in the emanationist view, Godand creation are “one.” The Creationist view sees it differently. For it, Godwas under no constraint regarding creation. There was no necessity for God tocreate the world. It is something apart from him and he could have not createdit, if he so chose. This view maintains a God that is beyond any necessity, anycompulsion, an absolutely “free” God, not limited by anything, not even his ownnature. While this view secures God’s freedom, it does suggest an at best“second-class” status for creation. It does not share in God’s nature, just as acraftsman’s work does not share in his nature. It is something separate fromhim.28 [10_CHAPTER_THREE_THE_SECRET_GNOSIS.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber190].

We can seeparallels with Dionysius’s hierarchy in the seven ancient planets and eighth andninth “spheres” of the Hermetic system, as well as in the sephiroth of Kabbalah.Later parallels can be found in Rudolf Steiner’s system of cosmic evolution andGurdjieff’s “Ray of Creation.”4 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber243].

This contrastbetween the via negativa and the via positiva can be compared with that betweenTheravada and Mahayana Buddhism, but also between Protestantism, with itsrejection of imagery, ritual, and any intermediaries between the worshiper andGod, and Catholicism, with its use of imagery, ritual, and pantheon of saints,as well as ecclesiastical hierarchy. Both approaches are deeply rooted in whatseem to be two contradictory but also complementary needs of the human psyche:the idea of a God or divine that exceeds the “merely human”—the austere “whollyother” God of the theologian Rudolf Otto—and the need for a God that can beapproached through prayer, ritual, imagery, a God that is more than but notentirely beyond the human. We seem to want a God that is both transcendent andimmanent.10 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber249].

Perhaps the best known is ACanticle for Leibowitz (1960) by Walter Miller, in which a future monastic orderpreserves the knowledge of the past following a nuclear holocaust. Strangely,the inspiration for the book came from the author’s participation in the Alliedbombing of Monte Cassino during World War II.16 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber255].

Quoted inHenry Corbin, The Voyage and the Messenger: Iran and Philosophy (Berkeley,Calif.: North Atlantic Books, 1998), p. xlvii.29 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber268]. WhenJustinian closed the Platonic Academy in 529, one of Damascius’s students,Simplicius, accepted the hospitality of King Chosroes of Persia, known as “thephilosopher king” because of his love of learning and culture. Simplicius spentthree years in the Persian court before being allowed to return to Athens. Itmay be that during his Persian exile, Simplicius and the Neoplatonists whoaccompanied him transplanted the Platonic ideas that would later reemerge inSuhrawardi.30 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber269].

Think of awork of art. There is the idea of it, what the artist wants to express. Andthere is the finished product, the painting or statue. In between, there is theartist’s image of it, his “picture” of it in his mind. This picture is somethingmore than the concept, as it has taken on a form. Yet it is not a physical form,but a mental or spiritual one. Or think of a book. There is the idea that theauthor wants to express and there is the physical book in which he expresses it,the paper and ink. But the true “reality” of the book is your inner experienceof it while reading it, and this takes place in your imagination, just as theauthor’s experience of writing it takes place in his. The author and readershare this imaginal realm.35 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber274]. Corbin 1976,p. 9.36 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber275]. Huxley 1987,pp. 69–70. Our outer world may no longer have a “darkest Africa” or “unmappedBorneos and Amazonian basins,” but that such places still exist in our innerworld remains true. I should point out that the titles of Huxley’s essays comefrom William Blake and Swedenborg, two well-seasoned inner travelers.37 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber276]. Suhrawardihad an older western contemporary in the Christian mystic, philosopher,composer, and polymath Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1180). She was subject tovisions from childhood, but it was not until 1142, when she was forty-three,that Hildegard first recorded her visionary experiences. Scivias (1142–1151),the first of three volumes of “visionary theology,” is an extraordinary work.Also known as “Know the Ways of the Lord,” Scivias is an illustrated textdescribing twenty-six visions concerning the Creation, the Fall, salvation, thesacraments, and the coming Kingdom of God. Unlike the negative theology ofMeister Eckhart and the Rhineland mystics, Hildegard’s path was the viapositiva. Hildegard began the work after receiving a message from God tellingher to do so, much as the later religious visionary Emanuel Swedenborg beganrecording his own visionary experiences after a visitation from Christ.38 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber277].

Corbin started his career as a philosopher in the phenomenologicaltradition of Husserl and Heidegger. Readers familiar with this tradition willnote a similarity between his description of what takes place “beyond the NinthSphere” and what Husserl called “bracketing the natural standpoint,” theunquestioned acceptance of the “world” as I “normally” experience it, that is,as outside my consciousness. A similar state was also described by P. D.Ouspensky in his essay “Experimental Mysticism,” where he writes that in thealtered state of consciousness he was exploring, “the objective and subjectivecould change places. The one could become the other”; Ouspensky 1969, p. 279.42 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber281].

There arevariations on the names of the sephiroth, but these seem the most common.48 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber287]. In TheCaretakers of the Cosmos, I look at the ideas of Isaac Luria, thesixteenth-century Kabbalist of Safed, who is considered the “father ofcontemporary Kabbalah.” Luria introduced certain revisions into Kabbalistictheory, one of which is the notion of tikkun, or “repair”; see Lachman 2013, pp.29–34.49 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber288]. To passbeyond the Abyss is a dangerous objective, although some intrepid souls havemade the attempt; see Lachman, 2014, pp. 131–36.50 [12_CHAPTER_FIVE_GREAT_PAN_IS_DEAD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber289].

In 1983,during a mini “search for the miraculous,” I had the opportunity to spend a dayat Chartres, walking the labyrinth and resting in the peculiar light emanatingthrough the rose window.

WhoFulcanelli was, if he ever existed, has never been satisfactorily determined.Schwaller de Lubicz claimed to have met him in a Montparnasse café in 1918, andthat the two worked together on discovering the secret of “alchemical stainedglass.” But other accounts say that “Fulcanelli” was the code name of a group ofFrench alchemists.

MaryWollstonecraft, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792), predatedWordsworth and Coleridge by two years in extolling the aesthetic virtues ofnature. In Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, andDenmark (1796), Wollstonecraft speaks of the “spontaneous pleasure . . .dilating the emotions” as she contemplated the Scandinavian coastline, with“sunbeams that played upon the ocean” in contrast with the “huge dark rocks,that looked like the rude materials of creation.” Wollstonecraft spoke of thefeeling of the “sublime” that came to her while she gazed upon the rugged coast.Wollstonecraft (Harmondsworth, U.K.: Penguin, 1987), p. 68.

Thetrick with perspective painting is to render figures and landscape“realistically,” i.e., approximating to how we “really” see things. So a churchin the distance is smaller than figures in the foreground, because that is howwe would see it, not larger because of its place in the spiritual hierarchy.

He also brought the work of theGreek geographer Strabo (64 B.C.–A.D. 24), who until then had been unknown inwestern Europe. One who profited by Strabo’s appearance was ChristopherColumbus, who used Strabo’s work in his voyage to the New World.

Hanegraaff argues, this was most likely because he sawHermes as conscripted by Christianity; in Chapter Four, we saw that churchfathers like Lactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus was a precursor of Christ.Plethon advocated a pagan revival free of any Christian taint; hence the “thricegreat one” was guilty by association; see Hanegraaff, in Hanegraaff andPijnenburg 2009, p. 40.34 [14_CHAPTER_SEVEN_AN_ESOTERIC_RENAISSANCE.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber402].

This book makes clear that the standard historyof the battle between religion and science is slanted, as might be expected, inscience’s favor, and paints an often inaccurate picture. The church often wentto great lengths to accommodate the new discoveries that were literally“rocking” the world. What becomes clear is that the real struggle was notbetween dogma and reason, but between the strong-willed and often stubbornindividuals on either side of the debate.

Magicand science were early on associated through the fascination with “mechanicalmarvels” that was part of the Renaissance pagan revival. Many Renaissancegardens, like those at the Villa d’Este in Tivoli, contained statues or figuresthat were animated through the use of steam or water. To many, these seemed nodifferent than the demonically “animated” statues spoken of in the Asclepius;see Lachman 2011, pp. 160–62.62 [14_CHAPTER_SEVEN_AN_ESOTERIC_RENAISSANCE.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber430].Benjamin Wooley, The Queen’s Conjurer (London: HarperCollins, 2001), p. 12.63 [14_CHAPTER_SEVEN_AN_ESOTERIC_RENAISSANCE.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber431].

His utopia designs were set out in his City of theSun (1623). See Lachman 2011, pp. 170–73.2 [15_CHAPTER_EIGHT_ESOTERIC_UNDERWORLD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber440].

The largestand most well known of these is the Ancient Mystical Order of Rosae Crucis (orAMORC, as it is usually called), founded by H. Spencer Lewis in 1915. AMORCtraces its roots back to ancient Egypt, somewhat earlier than theseventeenth-century Rosicrucians who concern us here. The link between AMORC,the Rosicrucian Order of Max Heindel—onetime student of Rudolf Steiner, whocalled his own spiritual approach Rosicrucian—and other modern Rosicruciangroups such as Jan van Rijckenborgh’s Lectorium Rosicrucianum—an offshoot ofHeindel’s group—and the Rosicrucians of 1614 is unclear.5 [15_CHAPTER_EIGHT_ESOTERIC_UNDERWORLD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber443].

Sadlyspace does not allow me to do more than mention Ramon Lull (1232–1315), aMajorcan philosopher, Franciscan monk, and early troubadour, who developed whathas been seen as an early form of computation. “Lullian Art” is a supposeduniversal system of knowledge using geometrical figures, symbols, and letters,which Lull arranged in a system of revolving concentric circles. By turning thecircles, one could arrive at a combination of “dignities” that revealed truthsabout the universe. Lull is credited with writing many alchemical texts, but itis doubtful he is their true author. Basil Valentine is credited with manyalchemical works of the sixteenth century. Most scholars accept that the name isa pseudonym and there is debate whether it refers to one person or a group.21 [16_CHAPTER_NINE_THIS_IS_THE_MODERN_WORLD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber530].Marshall 2001, pp. 403–4.22 [16_CHAPTER_NINE_THIS_IS_THE_MODERN_WORLD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber531].Newton’s translation of the Emerald Tablet can be found athttp://www.sacred-texts.com/alc/emerald.htm.23 [16_CHAPTER_NINE_THIS_IS_THE_MODERN_WORLD.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber532].

Thedifference between Goethe and Blake can be seen in an anecdote about Goethe andBeethoven, another “thundering” Romantic, recorded by their mutual friendBettina von Arnim. Once, while together, Goethe and Beethoven encounteredroyalty walking toward them. Goethe was polite and, doffing his hat, gracefullymade way. Beethoven, who acknowledged no aristocracy but genius, refused and,hands in pockets, marched through the dukes and duchesses with a scowl.Beethoven’s esoteric interests, as well as those of other composers, can befound in my essay “Concerto for Magic and Mysticism: Esotericism and WesternMusic” at https://www.theosophical.org/publications/1289.22 [17_CHAPTER_TEN_THE_ROMANTIC_CENTURY.xhtml#SuperscriptNumber600].

Thequestion of who made the first “abstract painting,” and indeed what abstractpainting itself is, remains controversial. In recent years I have lectured onthe work of the little-known Swedish painter Hilma af Klint, a spiritualist andfollower of Theosophy and Rudolf Steiner, who died in 1944. Hilma af Klint’searly efforts in “automatic painting”—in which the artist acts as a medium forspiritual forces—were done in 1906 and are increasingly seen as predatingKandinsky’s abstract works of 1911.
