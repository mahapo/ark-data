It was expressedthen in some rather bad poetry—luckily this has not survived—and it was notuntil many years later that I actually produced anything worth reading, or atleast that an editor would accept for publication. “Perseverance furthers,” theI Ching tells us, and at least in this context it was right. Today, looking backto the time when I was first being published—the early 1990s, when I was aboutto enter my forties—I am amazed to realize that I have been writing now for morethan twenty years. I started out with book reviews and magazine articles andessays, taking any opportunities that presented themselves and, as mostbeginning writers do, eagerly building up a body of work in print, doing all Icould to make up for lost time. Today, in my late fifties, I am just as busy asI was then, even more so, suffering the full-time writer’s complaint of chronicworkaholism and insufficient earnings; even during the busiest days of my careeras a musician—by the mid-70s I had turned the poetry into songwriting and wassuccessful with it for a time—I was never as busy as I am now. But between firstseeing print and today, I have—if I may so immodestly inform the reader—added afew notches to my belt. Between 2001, when my first book, Turn Off Your Mind,appeared and the time of this writing (2014), I have produced sixteen books,with another due to be published this year, and I am about to start the researchfor another, practically as soon as I finish writing this introduction. I havealso produced scores of articles, essays, book reviews, interviews, andlectures, of which the pieces collected here are a small sample. It often feelsthat I do very little other than write—a complaint friends often make—and that Ihave become, as a less-busy fellow writer once called me, a “writing machine.”If that is the case, it is the one example of a man-machine merger that Icondone, and I trust that the gods of writings—such as Hermes, about whom Ihave, ironically, written a book—will keep me well oiled and in good workingorder for at least another twenty years.What often prevents an aspiring writer from really getting started is theproblem of finding his material, his theme—what, exactly, to write about.(Creative writing teachers tell us to “write about what you know,” but that onlyraises the question: what do you know?) The technical tricks of the trade, ofcourse, have to be mastered and a readable style developed. But what leads tomastery is the key element of having something to say, of finding the thingsthat you love and are obsessed with and that you want to introduce readers to,so as to stimulate an equal love and obsession in them. It is precisely thatlove and obsession that drives the writer to finding the best way to communicatehis passion.What the reader of this collection, and perhaps of my other books, will discoveris that I am in love and obsessed with ideas. I like to think. It is,admittedly, an occupation not as popular as in some earlier times and one thatrequires the increasingly elusive necessities of peace and quiet, along with themore accessible ingredients of a book, notebook, table, and pen, or, morefrequently today, laptop. You don’t need a Hadron collider or Hubble telescopeor Human Genome Project—just time, dedication, and an insatiable need to clarifyand focus your mind. I am no critic of intuition, feeling, or the more palpabledelights of sensation, but I do think that human beings are essentially thinkingbeings. That is to say, it is in the world of the mind that our humanity trulyresides; it is the element that, as far as we know, we do not share with othercreatures and which, for better or worse, it has been given to us to explore.This is why it is not as popular an activity as some others. Thinkers are ratherlike those people at the head of a jungle expedition, hacking into a thicktangle of roots and vines in order to make a path. It is demanding, unpleasantwork, but it needs to be done, and it must be admitted that the people furtherback on the trail have a relatively easier time of it. Is it any surprise thatmost of them leave the difficult work to those who have a taste for it?So I like to think. But what do I think about? As the reader of these essays,taken from different publications over the last two decades, will find, thereare a few themes that occur again and again. One is human consciousness and itsevolution, both in the individual and in the culture at large. Another is thatmysterious world that seems to strangely parallel our familiar, everyday one,the world of the occult, the magical, the esoteric. As you might suspect, thesetwo themes overlap and are intimately related. There are aspects of what we callthe occult that enter into states and forms of consciousness rather differentfrom what we usually experience, just as certain unfamiliar modes ofconsciousness have a strangely magical character to them. One reason I becameinterested in the occult nearly forty years ago was precisely because it seemedto offer some way to approach the kind of intensity of consciousness I wasinstinctively seeking out—often in dangerous ways—just as it was through aninterest in magic, the occult, and the esoteric that I found a way of mappingout the strange and unusual states I sometimes experienced, and which, it seemsto me, suggest some latent possibilities waiting to be developed. Later, when Istudied philosophy, I discovered that, while the kind of philosophy Iencountered in university for the most part either ignored those aspects ofreality in which I was most interested or dismissed them as nonsense, the“rejected” tradition of the occult, magic, and esotericism was more than open tothem. Indeed, in many ways, it is precisely that tradition that has offered ahome to these concerns, at least since the beginning of modern times. This iswhy, when I came to write, I wrote about ideas and people that generally fellinto these areas—or, more broadly speaking, into the world of what we can call“alternative thought.” (The fact that there were magazines and journals open topublishing my work also helped.)The rather vague and capacious umbrella term “alternative thought” covers a widerange of subjects and individuals, connected by the fact that they do not find aplace for themselves within the more narrow confines of modern, rationalist,scientistic thinking. This does not mean I am an enemy of science. Far from it;in fact for a time when I was first being published, I worked as a sciencewriter for a major university in California. But I am a critic of the belief—forthat is what it is—that the limited purview of materialistic science can explaineverything in existence, and that what it can’t explain is either unreal orunimportant. While it is an undoubted achievement to have secured a grasp on theHiggs boson, I object to the idea that in doing so we have “solved the mysteryof the universe,” as some of the news reports about the discovery announced. Theuniverse is just as mysterious today as it was before the Higgs boson turned up.We may, indeed, have a firmer idea of how it hangs together, but we are nonearer to understanding why it is here in the first place and, more important,what we are supposed to do now that we find ourselves in it. Philosophy in theold school—going back to Plato and ending, perhaps, in the early twentiethcentury—used to address these questions, but in more recent years it has giventhem up. My sympathies are with the old school; the questions of why we existand how we should live seem more important than what the next elementaryparticle in line to be discovered may be, certainly more important than thesemantic nitpicking that much academic philosophy has descended into. Most ofthe people I write about in these essays thought so, too, and that, more thananything else, is why I am attracted to them. They were looking for theinvisible, we could say, and so was I.But what I found when I started to write about these ideas was that the lives ofthe people who held them were just as fascinating as the ideas themselves, andthat a study of them provided a kind of counter-history to the one we areusually given. Almost half of my books are biographies. I’ve written studies ofEmanuel Swedenborg, C. G. Jung, P. D. Ouspensky, Rudolf Steiner, H. P.Blavatsky, and Aleister Crowley. For all my interest in the occult, the magical,and the esoteric, I am at heart an existentialist. Existentialism, of course,has nothing to do with the occult or, for that matter, with spirituality of anykind. As presented in thinkers like Sartre, Heidegger, and Camus, it is a grimaffair, stoically affirming human freedom, limited as it is, in a contingent,accidental universe. But aside from the explicit beliefs—or lack ofthem—associated with existentialism, its essence is a concern with the meaningof human existence, a question that religion also used to address but which itseems to have mislaid some time ago. And this meaning, existentialism argues,cannot be discovered by sitting in an armchair and contemplating life. It canonly be found by living—which, in any case, is unavoidable. What I found inwriting about the lives of many of the people in this collection is that, as thewriter Henry Miller once said, they “lived life to the hilt.” These“revolutionaries of the soul,” as my editor, Richard Smoley, calls them—hencethe title of this book—not only thought about and questioned reality, they alsothrew themselves into it, often headfirst. They sought more out of life thanwhat we usually settle for, and their revolutions embraced both the inner andouter worlds, broadening both in many ways. Madame Blavatsky hit therevolutionary barricades with Mazzini and Garibaldi. Ouspensky “rememberedhimself” during the chaos of World War I and the Bolshevik revolution. JeanGebser nearly lost his life escaping from Franco’s army in the Spanish CivilWar. Jung descended into his unconscious while wrestling with psychosis, astruggle he shared with the playwright August Strindberg and the religiousphilosopher Swedenborg. Owen Barfield, with whom I had the good fortune to meetand speak with one afternoon some eighteen years ago, when I had first moved toLondon, saw more of the twentieth century than anyone else in this book, livingthrough two world wars and ending his days contemplating the meaning of theinformation age. (He died not long after our meeting, at the age of ninety-nine,and I believe I conducted the last interview with him.) Rudolf Steiner avoidedassassination by early proto-Nazis. Some, like the occult historian James Webb,did not survive their encounter with chaos. Others, like the dark magicianAleister Crowley, swallowed enough experience for a dozen lives; while stillothers, like the occult scholar Manly P. Hall, succumbed, for all theirerudition, to spiritual con men. These were not bloodless rationalists, sizingup life from a comfortable distance, but men and women who found themselves inthe thick of it, as well as in dimensions of reality most of us rarelyencounter. That they lived life to the hilt and then some, Henry Miller, Ithink, would have agreed.Another aspect of this collection I’d like to point out is that many of theessays assume a broader, more literary-philosophical familiarity than what isusually the case in a book dealing with occultists and magicians. The article onOuspensky, for example, places him in the literary world of 1930s London, andthe one on the eccentric Polish explorer and ethnologist Jan Potocki centers onhis single and singularly strange masterpiece, The Manuscript Found inSaragossa. Many readers, I suspect, are not that familiar with Jean Gebser, whocombines a deep spirituality with the mandarin philosophical tradition ofCentral Europe. Much of Owen Barfield’s philosophy is based on his study ofpoetry—as is Gebser’s—and August Strindberg, of course, is one of the mostimportant figures in literary modernism. Colin Wilson’s examples for a newfaculty of human consciousness come from some of the great writers of the lastcentury. One of the problems with much of today’s literature on spirituality isthat it is too parochial, too limited in its context. It has become a genre, andit does not step over the borders of its niche too often. This is unfortunate.Market forces are probably to blame, with publishers and authors hesitant toconfuse their readers (“Is this book about spirituality, or literature, orwhat?”), and the readers themselves more than likely want something simple anddirect and not too challenging. This is a bad situation, and I for one make apoint of appealing to readers’ intelligence—smartening them up rather thandumbing them down—and of making them stretch their imagination, even if only alittle. The questions that obsessed the people in this book (and its author) arenot limited to one neatly squared-off patch of reality; and in any case,reality, as we know, is never neatly squared off. The question of the meaningand purpose of human existence is not the property of a few “experts” working intheir limited fields; it pervades every aspect of our lives, and as I argue inmy book A Dark Muse (2005) about the links between literature and the occult,some of the deepest spiritual questions in the last two centuries have beenaddressed as often by writers and poets as by more ostensibly “spiritual”figures—sometimes more often and more successfully, in fact. We need to returnthese questions to the broader fields of human endeavor instead of keeping themneatly tucked away in “mind, body, spirit” and other genres. If that meanschallenging ourselves, then let’s be challenged. It’s the only way the spiritgrows. In fact, the growing interest in “occulture”—the meeting ground betweenthe occult and culture—recognizes this fact, and in the past few years I haveparticipated in several conferences and seminars dedicated to this idea in theUnited States, Europe, and the United Kingdom.The essays are arranged in a rough chronological order—rough is the operativeword, as some pieces fall out of sequence—and although I have edited here andthere, neatening and correcting, I have kept them as much as possible in theiroriginal form. I have done so because this is not a book in the sense of havingone theme, worked out chapter by chapter, but a collection of writings done atdifferent times. There is some overlap and some minimal repetition, but thisseemed to lend itself to a natural and unplanned continuity; it was while goingover these essays and articles that I felt they were, in a way, reaching out toeach other to form a kind of lattice. The one anachronistic arrangement is withthe first essay, “Colin Wilson and Faculty X,” one of the earliest pieces in thebook, if not the earliest; it was first published twenty years ago. As readersof my work know, Wilson has been an enormous influence on me; it was through areading of his book The Occult (1971)—still fascinating and important more thanforty years later—that started me on my explorations into the occult and thehidden powers of consciousness. Sadly, Wilson, my mentor and friend whom I knewfor thirty years, passed away in December 2013, while I was putting thiscollection together; he was eighty-two. Putting him at the start of thiscollection is a small tribute to the importance and significance that I, likemany others, believe his work holds for the future of human evolution.The last essay, “The Strange Death of James Webb,” comes at the end for adifferent reason. Webb’s tragic plight, his inability to completely accept orreject the occult, seems indicative of the situation our culture as a wholefaces in regard to the occult. Our conscious, rational selves reject it as anoutmoded superstition and see interest in it as evidence of a weak mind. Yet, aspopular culture shows, the occult is still alive and well in our imaginations.We may reject it in the daylight, but in our dreams it comes to life.So here are some revolutionaries of the soul. I hope they stir things up foryou.Gary LachmanLondon, January 2014"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc3]Colin Wilson and Faculty X [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc3]There is a passage in Hermann Hesse’s Steppenwolf that never fails to move me.The Steppenwolf, Harry Haller, a lonely, middle-aged intellectual, has spent anevening as he has spent other evenings, walking aimlessly through town, avoidinghis room where awaits the product of his fruitless, listless days: the razor.Weary of avoiding his dismal fate, Harry enters a tavern for a brief respite andthere drinks a glass of wine. Slowly his mood shifts. The process is gradual,but as he sips his wine, the Steppenwolf’s thoughts expand, like a gas lighterthan air. “A refreshing laughter rose in me,” Harry tells us. “It soared aloftlike a soap bubble, reflecting the whole world in miniature on its rainbowsurface.” He sinks into the warmth. Perhaps his fate is not so terrible. Hemeditates further still and slowly, hesitantly, looks into his soul. “In mybrain,” he says, “were stored a thousand pictures.”Harry thinks of an ancient weathered wall; of old, forgotten illuminated texts;of poems long gone to oblivion; of a solitary cypress on a forlorn hill; of themovement of clouds at night above the Rhine. A thousand thousand pictures cometo him, more numerous than he can imagine, each one contributing its own secretimport, its own special significance to the seeming absurdity and chaos of hislife. Harry reflects on these and realizes that he is happy. “The golden trailwas blazed. I was reminded of the eternal, of Mozart, and the stars.” Harrywouldn’t keep his appointment with the razor that night.What exactly has happened? Has the Steppenwolf merely got drunk and forgottenhis burden? Has the wine obscured something from his vision, namely the factthat he is a miserable middle-aged man who will sooner or later slit his throat?Or does it reveal something that until then had been obscured? The same sort ofexperience happens again and again throughout the novel. Lying in bed with awoman after an evening of lovemaking, the ordinarily miserable Harry feels that“for moments together my heart stood still between delight and sorrow to findhow rich was the gallery of my life, and how thronged the soul of the wretchedSteppenwolf with high eternal stars and constellations.” Does this sound like aman who wants to kill himself? What has happened?Harry, the wretched Steppenwolf, has had an experience of what Colin Wilsoncalls “Faculty X.” Harry may have known about all these things before, but nowhe really knows about them. This “really knowing” is the basic idea behindWilson’s philosophy.Developed in his major studies on the paranormal—The Occult (1971), Mysteries(1978), and Beyond the Occult (1988)—and running through practically all hiswork, the central idea behind Wilson’s notion of Faculty X is that it is a senseof the reality of other times and places. As Wilson points out, probably themost famous example of Faculty X—so called because we have yet to recognize itclearly and give it its own name—in modern literature is the opening of MarcelProust’s Remembrance of Things Past (1913–1927). There the narrator, Prousthimself, tells of his curious experience eating his famous madeleine dipped intea. Suddenly, from some dark forgotten psychic recess, the memory of his youthin Combray wells up in him, and it is as if he is there once again. The effectis tremendous; as Wilson writes, Proust had “ceased now to feel mediocre,contingent, mortal.” Proust, too, suddenly realized the reality of his own life,and the rest of his eleven-hundred-page novel is an attempt to “recapture thepast.”Another example comes from T. S. Eliot’s “Ash Wednesday,” where the poet writesthat “the lost heart stiffens and rejoices for the lost sea air and the lost seavoices.” This is essentially the same experience as Hesse and Proust describe:the sudden realization that the past really happened and that, in some strangeway, it is just as real now as it was then. Which is another way of saying thatreality, however we want to define it, is not confined to the present moment.This is strange. As Wilson points out, we tend to believe that reality isconfined to the present moment. This is why the realization of the reality ofother times and places has such a profound effect on writers like Hesse, Proust,and Eliot. Clearly this suggests one thing: there is something wrong with ourideas about space and time.If you hold a chicken’s beak to the ground and draw a chalk line from its eyes,it will not move. When it comes to time, human beings are very much likeparalyzed chickens: we seem to be stuck to a particular chalk line we call“now.” The situation, Wilson argues, is absurd: human beings, he believes, arecapable of transcending the limitations of the present moment and of achieving,as he calls it, a “mastery over time, as if every moment of your life could berecalled as clearly as the last ten minutes.”We have seen three of the most important figures in modern literature bear thisspeculation out. There is also evidence from science. As Wilson points out, oneof the most fascinating discoveries about human memory came from the work of theneurologist Wilder Penfield. While operating on a patient, Penfield tested theeffect of electrical stimulation of the temporal cortex. The result wasastonishing. Penfield discovered that when the probe stimulated the patient’scortex, the patient would immediately be “sent back” to sometime in the past.(As neurosurgery is done without anesthetic—the brain feels no pain—patientswere able to report their experiences.)Penfield concluded that every moment of our lives is stored in some way in ourbrain and that if triggered by the proper stimulus—an electric probe or a pieceof cake—we can relive these moments in vivid detail. We might say that the brainhas a built-in virtual reality machine. We also remember the enduring beliefthat at the point of death people see their entire lives pass before them.Wilson has his own ideas about the part the brain plays in Faculty X, analtogether easier and less cumbersome means of grasping the reality of othertimes and places than having a near-death experience or undergoing brainsurgery. One of the most curious facts about human anatomy is that we have twobrains. In Frankenstein’s Castle (1980) Wilson discusses the split-brainresearch of Roger Sperry and Robert Ornstein. Its basic findings are well known:the left brain seems to control our logical functions, like language andmathematics, and the right our more intuitive powers. These have by now become acliché: we say the left brain is a scientist, the right an artist. What seemsless commonly known, Wilson suggests, is the strange fact that these two, thescientist and the artist, are literally two different people. You, reading thesewords, live in the left brain. In the right is a strange silent partner whom wecall “the unconscious.”Most of Frankenstein’s Castle deals with the interaction between the two sidesof the brain. Wilson believes that the right brain is responsible for paranormalphenomena like synchronicities and for mystical experiences and the curiousbursts of affirmation that the psychologist Abraham Maslow called “peakexperiences.” In a later book Wilson suggests the peculiar contribution thatbrain physiology may make to our question about the “reality” of other times andplaces. Relating how John Cowper Powys “appeared” one evening in the Manhattanapartment of his fellow novelist Theodore Dreiser while at the same time sittingin his cottage in upstate New York—a phenomenon the nineteenth-century psychicinvestigator Frederick Myers called “phantasms of the living”—Wilson writes:We take it for granted that we live in a “solid” world of space and time,advancing from moment to moment according to unchangeable laws, and that we arestuck in the place that we happen to be at the moment. We are, in a sense,“trapped.” We feel this particularly strongly when we are bored ormiserable—that we are helplessly at the mercy of this physical world into whichwe happen to have been born. Yet these odd experiences all seem to show thatthis is untrue. The “real you” is not trapped in space and time. With a certainkind of effort of will, it can rise above space and time and be “elsewhere.”Commenting on the fact that neuroscientists really have no idea why we shouldhave two brains, Wilson goes on to make a remarkable suggestion:My own belief is that we have two brains so we can be in two places at the sametime. Human beings are supposed to be capable of being in two places at the sametime. Yet we have not quite discovered the “trick.” When we do, we shall be acompletely different kind of creature—no longer the same kind of human being wholives out his life so incompetently on this long-suffering planet, but somethingfar more powerful and purposeful.This is why Wilson believes that man is on the point of an evolutionary leap.But although paranormal phenomena like “phantasms of the living” offer some ofthe more spectacular evidence for our ability to be in two places at the sametime, they are not the only support for Wilson’s theory. There is otherevidence. In a sense, you, as you read this essay, are in two places at once. Inthe first place, you are in whatever physical surroundings you happen to occupy.But in the second place, if I am doing my job correctly and have interested youin these ideas, you also occupy the world of thought and imagination, a worldvery much like the “elsewhere” Wilson speaks about.In a very real sense, we are not trapped by space and time. Consider whathappens when I take a book from my shelf, say a volume of history. I open it,flip through the pages, idly glance at a paragraph or two, not really readingbut just skimming the surface. Then something catches my eye, say a descriptionof ancient Athens or a remark about the Peloponnesian War. I focus more intentlyon the page and sink back in my chair with the intention to read through thesection. A minute passes, then two. I’m “interested.” I forget the solid worldI’ve just been contemplating and the ubiquitous moment I’ve just occupied.Suddenly, almost imperceptibly, the world has changed. The solid walls havedisappeared, and in their place I am hovering over vast stretches of time. Iread on. Now, if I am relaxed enough and can muster the concentration, somethingstrange may happen. A particularly well-written passage may trigger it, or I maynot be able to link it to any specific cause, but I will suddenly be aware thatthese events really happened. I don’t know another way to put it. I am suddenlycatapulted back in time, as Proust was to Combray, and am jolted by therecognition that whatever it is I am reading about—the trial of Socrates or thebattle of Thermopylae—actually took place. It isn’t just words, a collection offacts, bare details: it’s real.Faculty X is this strange capacity we have to feel the reality of times andplaces beyond that of the present moment, to literally be “in two places atonce.” And the obvious thing is that, except for certain moments, the physicalplace I occupy is altogether less important, less fascinating and interesting,than the mental “place.” This has been known for ages. The Tao Te Ching saysthat “without going out of my door, I can know all things on earth. Withoutlooking out of my window, I can know all things in heaven. The farther onetravels, the less one knows.”Now of course there are many instances in which physical location is extremelyimportant: one shouldn’t daydream too deeply while driving a car. And thephysical space of some unfortunate people is so miserable it is more importantto remedy that than it is to float off into dream worlds of the imagination. Butwe also know that once we are in a physical space that doesn’t demand ourattention, the first thing we do is find something to occupy ourselves besidesthe four walls.An animal is content with merely occupying a physical space. If no one playswith it and nothing else arouses its attention, a cat will stare into space andsooner or later fall asleep. Many of us find watching television an appallingpastime, but compared to a cat’s incapacity to be in two places at once, theviewers of the worst sitcom are virtually Prousts and Steppenwolves. As far aswe can tell, it seems that animals simply lack this ability. Even our slangrecognizes that the capacity to take imaginative voyages is a sign ofevolutionary advance. When someone sits at home and does very little—likewatching television—we say he or she is “vegetating,” clearly a recognition thatsuch a person has slipped below a truly human level.A well-known book of the early 1970s by Ram Dass admonished its readers to BeHere Now. While I can understand and sympathize with the good intentions andvaluable psychology behind this maxim, it is also true that in a very realsense, to “be here now” is something that imaginative human beings simply find abore.Why does having two brains allow us to be in two places at once? After all, Imay have two brains, but they are in one skull. Wilson suggests an answer. Whenboth brains are working properly, when the artist and the scientist collaborate,then the sense of reality, that feeling that some incident in my past—or in thatof the entire race, for that matter—really happened occurs. Why is this? Theanswer lies in the powers of the different cerebral hemispheres. Human beingsare the dominant species on the planet because of the left brain’s ability tofocus on the details of experience. Yet this dominance has come at a price. Inlearning to focus on details, we have to a great extent forgotten our ability toperceive overall patterns. We must imagine the scientist in the left brainpeering at the world through a microscope. This focus enables us to gain greatercontrol over nature than any other animal, but it has also landed us in auniverse that often seems utterly meaningless. This is because the right brain,which is responsible for pattern recognition, is also the seat of our sense ofmeaning.Think again of the act of reading. Were you to focus solely on the individualwords of this sentence, its meaning would escape you. To understand it, you needto stand back from it, to see it and the paragraph and page and article as awhole. Wilson uses the analogy of a newspaper photograph. If you look through amagnifying glass at a photograph in the New York Times, you wouldn’t see apicture at all, merely a series of dots. To recognize the figures in thephotograph you need to stand back from it. This is what happened to Harry Hallerwhen he drank his wine and was reminded of Mozart and the stars. Harry theintellectual looks at the world through a magnifying glass, seeing an enormousamount of detail, but lacking a sense of the overall pattern. This is why hefinds the world such a gruesome place.The left brain is oriented to “dealing” with the world; and although we are notall Harry Hallers, most of us confront experience with a habit of suspicion andcaution that keeps us in a state of hypertension. To draw on the reading analogyonce again, when we read something in a hurry, we generally comprehend littleand retain less. When Harry sits in the café and sips his wine, his left brainbegins to slow down. No longer in a hurry, it allows the right brain to do itswork of supplying an overall sense of pattern and meaning, with the result thatHarry suddenly remembers the reality of his life, not its mere facts, and isoverwhelmed with the feeling of a tremendous discovery.But, Wilson argues, we shouldn’t jump to the conclusion that the left brain is avillain and the right a hero, a mistake many Romantic writers and artists of thenineteenth and twentieth centuries made. It is true that the right brain is thesource of our sense of meaning. But as Wilson writes in Frankenstein’s Castleand Access to Inner Worlds (1983), the remarkable thing is that the right brainseems to take its cues from the left. Through a study of hypnotism and of thework of Max Freedom Long on the teachings of the Hawaiian shamans known askahunas, Wilson came to the conclusion that, contrary to Romantic ideas that seethe left-brain ego as a villain to be got rid of by any means possible—drink,drugs, sex, violence—it is actually the boss when it comes to consciousness. Theproblem is that it doesn’t know it’s the boss. The left-brain ego, Wilsonconcluded, isn’t too strong, as the Romantics argued; it’s too weak.It is true that the right brain is the source of power and capable of tremendousfeats, ranging from the ability of idiots savants to determine almost instantlywhether or not a six-digit number is prime, to the kinds of experience discussedearlier in this essay. Wilson contends that the unconscious looks to the ego forits direction. Without the left brain’s sense of purpose and motivation, theright can easily sink into mental lethargy.Many have sought to achieve higher consciousness through some means of deadeningthe left-brain ego, through psychedelic drugs, for example. Psychedelic drugscan “open the doors of perception,” as Aldous Huxley, quoting William Blake,well knew. But Huxley also realized that “if everyone took mescaline, therewould be no wars, but there would be no civilization either,” because we wouldlack the motivation to create it. Left-brain-dominant consciousness reveals aworld without meaning; right-brain-dominant consciousness reveals a worldoverflowing with meaning but inhibits our capacity to organize it. The answer,it seems, is to have both brains work together. This is Faculty X.When the right brain supplies the meaning, then the facts of our existence takeon a remarkable character. It is then that, like Proust, Hesse, and Eliot, wefeel we are remembering something that we already know, but now really know.Faculty X is not a nostalgia for “times past” but an unrecognized power we haveof knowing the world, almost like a sixth sense. And according to Wilson, it isa sense we can develop.Although Proust devoted his life to recapturing the past, he wasn’t confidentthat it could be done, at least not through conscious effort. “It is a labor invain to attempt to recapture it,” he wrote. “All the efforts of our intellectmust prove futile.” Everything depends, Proust believed, on some chanceencounter triggering the unconscious memory—a bit of cake dipped in tea, or,later in the book, a loose paving stone. Yet this seems a curious assertion whenwe recall that Proust also remarked, after unsuccessful attempts to againtrigger his memory through sips of tea, that “it is plain that the truth I amseeking lies not in the cup but in myself.” Proust seems not to have followedthis insight.Wilson is more optimistic. He is confident that consciousness can soar above thelimits of the present moment. In fact, Wilson believes it is a mistake to thinkof Faculty X as an unusual phenomenon. We have got into the habit of believingthat reality is limited to the present moment only because we have got into thehabit of taking a passive attitude toward our mental states. The truth is thatFaculty X is really consciousness doing its proper work, which is, Wilson tellsus, reaching out and grabbing reality.Developing the insights of the philosopher Edmund Husserl, Wilson argues thatthe key to Faculty X, and indeed to all mental states, is an effort of will,what Husserl called “intentionality.” It is true that Faculty X can come to usunexpectedly—practically all our experiences of it now happen in this way—butWilson believes that we can develop a greater capacity to experience Faculty Xby maintaining an attitude of optimism and purpose. In other words, by showingthe right brain we mean business. Usually we are so weak and vacillating thatthe right brain, which holds the purse strings on our power supply, ignores usand falls asleep. Only in moments of crisis does it wake up and supply the leftbrain with energy. This is why so many of the individuals Wilson calls“Outsiders” actually sought out crisis (it was Wilson’s first book, TheOutsider, that launched him on his career in 1956, at the age of twenty-four).They knew instinctively that threat or emergency snaps us to attention andcompels consciousness to work properly. “Living dangerously,” as Nietzsche putit, has its drawbacks, but the insight to be gleaned from it is invaluable. Ifthe right brain will respond to crisis, then it should be made to respondwithout crisis, if the left brain can convince the right that it is serious.But there is a problem. As mentioned earlier, the right brain looks to the leftfor clues to how it should respond to a situation. But what kind of messages dowe—the left brain—usually send it? Unless we are saints or perfected masters, wegenerally spend most of our time complaining about life, with the result thatthe right brain, which, Wilson says, tends to overreact to messages from theleft, curls up into a ball, or worse, floods the left with waves of despair.(Oddly, the right brain tends to be pessimistic and depressive, the leftoptimistic and manic.) When this goes on for too long, we end up like HarryHaller, cursing our dismal fate and doing our best to avoid the razor. The firststep in developing our capacity for Faculty X, then, is to create a sense ofoptimism—not about anything in particular, but a general sense that life meanswell by us, what Jean Gebser called “primal trust.”And this leads naturally to the next step, developing a sense of purpose. Afterwe stop sending our right brain messages of doom, the next step is to foster asense of interest. Mystics and poets tell us that we live in a fascinatinguniverse, a cosmos of such complexity that it seems unthinkable anyone could bebored in it. Yet this is exactly what happens. Our whole obsession with youth isbased on the idea that, after a certain age, life loses its appeal and we spendthe rest of our days doing “the same old thing.” But when we look at creativeindividuals, like the playwright Bernard Shaw, who continued working into hisnineties, and the poet W. B. Yeats, who threw off his youthful pessimism andgrew into a giant of world literature in his later years, we see that modernculture’s emphasis on the emptiness of life is an enormous mistake, based on acomplete misunderstanding about the nature of consciousness. The only way toprove this, of course, is to actually develop our capacity for Faculty X, whichreally means developing our power to grasp reality.If the past really continues to exist in the present, as Proust, Hesse, andEliot seem to show, then our belief that reality is only what occupies us at themoment is a bad habit we need to outgrow. We are simply not in touch with all ofreality when we forget about the vast objective world outside the present. Thisidea really shouldn’t seem strange; after all, we don’t believe that the rest ofthe spatial world ceases to exist when we shut the door to our room. If we thinkof Faculty X spatially, most of us are very short-sighted people whooccasionally have a brief but vivid glimpse of the Grand Canyon or the Alps. IfColin Wilson is correct, we may be able to improve our eyesight so that we cantake in these vistas at will."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc4]Discovering Swedenborg [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc4]One of the most remarkable figures in modern European history is the Swedishscientist, philosopher, and religious thinker Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). AnEnlightenment intellectual who combined a genius for invention with an incisivetheoretical mind; an inveterate traveler who combed Europe in search ofscientific and philosophical knowledge; a statesman who was also a student ofthe Kabbalistic arts and who wedded a fascination with mystical eroticism to themachinations of a secret agent—these characteristics alone would qualify him asa figure of great interest. Yet Swedenborg’s most remarkable claim to fame wasthe series of profound psychological and spiritual crises he experienced in hismid-fifties, which resulted in an encounter with Jesus Christ and the first ofmany journeys to heaven, hell, and the “spirit world,” described in his bookHeaven and Hell. Such claims usually lead to a stint in the madhouse, but themany creative men and women influenced by Swedenborg include Charles Baudelaire,August Strindberg, W. B. Yeats, Aldous Huxley, Helen Keller, Jorge Luis Borges,Czeslaw Milosz, Arnold Schoenberg, Honoré de Balzac, and C. G. Jung. For RalphWaldo Emerson, Swedenborg was a “mastodon of literature”; and the NobelPrize-winning scientist Svante Arrhenius recognized that his contributions toscience included, among other things, the nebula theory of planetary and solarformation.Yet most people, if they’re aware of Swedenborg, know vaguely that he was theinspiration for an eccentric form of Christianity that numbered among itsfollowers William Blake and that usually gets placed on the cultural map justbeyond Jehovah’s Witnesses. Or that he provided some of the most convincingexamples of precognition, telepathy, and communication with the dead, bravuradisplays of psychic phenomena recounted in practically every history of theparanormal. This was more or less my own take until I became more acquaintedwith Swedenborg’s life. While writing A Dark Muse (2005), a book about writersand the occult, I discovered that many of the occult ideas permeating modernWestern literature had their source in Swedenborg. This discovery struck me asimportant—important enough to accept a commission to write a book about thislittle-known genius. What I found out along the way was surprising. With anyluck, this brief account of the “other” Swedenborg will prompt some readers tomake some similar discoveries for themselves.Swedenborg was born Emanuel Swedberg to a prosperous Stockholm family on January29, 1688; the family later changed their name to Swedenborg when they wereennobled in 1719. Emanuel’s father, Jesper Swedberg, was a regimental chaplainwho would later be appointed a bishop. His mother, Sara Behm, a wealthy mineowner, was the daughter of an official in the Swedish Board of Mines. Swedenborghad a happy childhood, but he also had experiences he couldn’t share with hissiblings. As a child Swedenborg had visions. His unseen “playmates” spoke tohim, and when he repeated what they said, his parents were astounded. When askedwho had told him these things, Swedenborg answered that he had heard them fromthe boys he played with in the family’s garden house. His parents knew he hadbeen alone and decided that angels must be speaking through him, a presage ofthe extraordinary communications to come.The young Swedenborg developed a skill he would put to great use throughout hislife. During his morning and evening prayers, he learned how to control hisbreath so that it seemed he was hardly breathing. This later became an awarenessof the intimate relation between breath and concentration, or, in physiologicalterms, the lungs and the brain, one of his many intuitions about the functioningof the body that would later be established by medical science. Swedenborg’s“search for the soul,” the scientific pursuit that occupied the first half ofhis life, led through the brain, and through it he arrived at several insightsthat modern science has since discovered, one being the “coincidence of themotion of the brain with respiration.” It’s also more than coincidental thatregulated breathing, and the chemical changes in the brain accompanying it, hasfor centuries been a tested means of entering altered states of consciousness.When Swedenborg was fourteen, his father was made a bishop, and in 1703 thefamily moved to Brunsbo. Emanuel, however, didn’t go. He was enrolled at UppsalaUniversity, and it was decided he should stay and continue his studies. He movedin with his older sister Anna and her husband, Erik Benzelius. Benzelius, theuniversity librarian, was a brilliant man, and he became the boy’s mentor. Heintroduced Swedenborg to science, and it’s also possible that Swedenborg had hisfirst encounter with the occult tradition through his brother-in-law. Benzeliuswas an Hebraist, and he knew F. M. van Helmont, who had annotated ChristianKnorr von Rosenroth’s Kabbala denudata (The Kabbalah unveiled), a central occulttext. Hebrew was highly prized among Benzelius’s peers, not only because it wasthe language of the Old Testament, but also because it was the language in whichthe books of Kabbalah, the Jewish mystical tradition, communicated the secretsof the Divine. Benzelius had also met the philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm vonLeibniz, who, it is alleged, had become a member of a secret Rosicrucian societyin 1667; years later, Swedenborg would try unsuccessfully to meet Leibnizhimself. (Curiously, one of the most noted scientist-philosophers of the time,René Descartes, was suspected of being a Rosicrucian.) Benzelius was a strongsupporter of Descartes’s ideal of free inquiry. Jesper Swedberg, however,vehemently opposed it, and for much of his student years, Swedenborg was tornbetween his growing love of science and duty to his father’s beliefs.Benzelius advised Swedenborg to travel and study science abroad; England, inparticular, was the place to go. Swedenborg’s father, however, wouldn’t financethe trip. With his schooling finished, Emanuel had moved to his father’s house,but he found the place deadening. He was fascinated by the work of Sweden’s mostfamous scientist and inventor, Christopher Polhem, and believed that his destinylay in following his path. Benzelius agreed, and he convinced Polhem as well,who was willing to accept Swedenborg as an assistant. The only problem was thatSwedenborg was nowhere to be found. Soon they discovered he was in England.Aside from his first taste of travel and freedom, Swedenborg’s Englishadventure, the first of many journeys, provided an experience that left alasting impression. Just outside London, some Swedes boarded the ship andpersuaded Swedenborg to accompany them. But the plague had broken out in Sweden,and the English had commanded the passengers to remain in quarantine. Swedenborgbroke the quarantine, the penalty for which was hanging. He was caught and justbarely escaped the noose, but the virtue of a “bill of health”—an essential itemin those days—stayed with him and would return in the context of a verydifferent crisis many years ahead.London became an important place for Swedenborg. He lodged in the city on sixoccasions and spent his last days there. London was also the scene for hisinitial entry into the spirit worlds and for a peculiarly eerie vision in whichhe was advised by an angel “not to indulge the belly too much.” It’s possiblethat during his first visit, Swedenborg was initiated into a Jacobite Masoniclodge and became involved in a Franco-Swedish Masonic conspiracy to restore theStuarts to the English throne. It was also in London that Swedenborg may havecome under the influence of the rabbi Samuel Jacob Chayyim Falk, who numberedamong his other students the famous mage Alessandro Cagliostro. Falk is amysterious figure; it may be that he is one of the “unknown superiors” that W.B. Yeats, in his reminiscences of his time as a member of the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn, refers to when speaking of the order’s history. Falk was at thehub of occult life in London at the time Swedenborg made his later visits, aswell as during his last days there. Falk set up an alchemical laboratory onLondon Bridge and, from his house in the East End, ran an esoteric school. Anoccult community of Freemasons, Kabbalists, Rosicrucians, and alchemists, aswell as the followers of the eccentric Count Nikolaus von Zinzendorf, leader ofthe Moravian Brethren, gathered around Falk, and it is very possible thatSwedenborg moved in this circle.One aspect of the Moravians seems to have interested Swedenborg very much. Someof their doctrines were borrowed from Kabbalah, as well as from the followers ofSabbatai Zevi, the false Messiah. Part of the Sabbatian worship involved sex,and it’s possible that the several erotic entries in Swedenborg’s diariesreflect his participation in Count Zinzendorf’s Sabbatian-Kabbalistic rites.Although Swedenborg remained a bachelor, sex was always an important ingredientin his philosophy, and he had some very liberal ideas about it: he keptmistresses and advocated concubinage and pre- and extramarital relations. One ofhis last books, Conjugial [sic] Love, or Marriage Love, was written when he waseighty and depicts the delights of heavenly eroticism. In Swedenborg’s heaven,men and women find their true partners, who are not always the ones they knew onearth, and their sexual lives continue; in fact, they’re supposed to get evenbetter.Along with his Kabbalistic studies, Swedenborg devoted himself to mathematics,mechanics, and astronomy. In his travels he tended to take rooms with craftsmenso that he could learn their trades: watchmaking, cabinetry, brass working,marble inlay. In London he invested in many scientific instruments: prisms,microscopes, scales, quadrants, a camera obscura, an air pump. His letters toBenzelius were read by the Guild of the Curious, the first Swedish scientificsociety, who wrote back asking him to make contact with John Flamsteed, theAstronomer Royal. Later, Swedenborg’s letters would help him become the editorof the first Swedish scientific journal, Daedalus hyperboreus (The northernDaedalus). It was also in London that he began what would become an almostlifelong pursuit. Swedenborg had a burning desire for fame, and he wasdetermined to win the prize offered by Greenwich Observatory to devise a methodof establishing longitude at sea; he lost out when John Harrison produced thechronometer. After London he went to Oxford, where he met the astronomer EdmundHalley, discoverer of the comet.One of Swedenborg’s letters contained a list of proposed inventions, including asubmarine, an aqueduct, a machine gun, a do-it-yourself home entertainmentcenter, an automobile, and an airplane. The Europe Swedenborg was intent onconquering was awakening to a delight in mechanized marvels, such as Jacques deVaucason’s flute-playing android and mechanical excreting duck, and Wolfgang vonKempelen’s mechanical chess-playing Turk. Philip James de Loutherberg,Swedenborg’s friend and later the acquaintance of William Blake, would becomefamous for the lighting and sound effects he created for David Garrick’s theaterin Drury Lane. However, none of Swedenborg’s ideas got beyond his imagination:true to form, his father mislaid all of the drawings and calculations for hismachines.In January 1716 Swedenborg went to work with Polhem, staying with him for threeyears, putting his mechanical skill to great use. In 1717 the Swedish king KarlXII commissioned Polhem to build a dry dock at Karlskrona; Swedenborg met theking and, at Polhem’s request, Karl XII appointed Swedenborg a special assessoron Sweden’s Board of Mines. Other important projects Swedenborg tackled were thelocks on the Trollhättan Canal, linking Stockholm with the North Sea; Sweden’sfirst salt works; and a remarkable feat of engineering, in which Swedenborgmanaged to move the king’s navy some fifteen miles across land in order todefeat the Norwegians at Fredrikshald. In 1718 Karl XII died from a bullet tothe head during the siege—it’s unclear whether the shot came from a Norwegian ora Swedish gun—and with the king’s death, Swedenborg’s career as an engineer, andhis association with Polhem, ended.Swedenborg’s real passion, his “ruling love” as he would later call it, was forsomething larger than invention and applied science. He was obsessed with thebig questions: the meaning of life, the structure of the cosmos, where infinityended. His work as assessor of mines seems like something of a cover. Afterleaving Polhem, Swedenborg took up his responsibilities as a member of theSwedish Diet. In 1719 the new queen, Ulrika Eleonora, ennobled the families ofSweden’s bishops (this was when the Swedbergs became Swedenborgs) and Emanueltook his seat in the House of Nobles. He contributed important papers on anumber of issues, fulfilled his duties as a statesman, and was an exemplaryassessor, but his heart and mind lay elsewhere.In 1734, when he was forty-six, Swedenborg published his first major scientificwork, a three-volume opus entitled The Mineral Kingdom. Parts two and three weretechnical mineralogical treatises, dealing with the mining of iron and copper.Part one, The Principles of Natural Things, or The Principia, was devoted tomore metaphysical pursuits. Here Swedenborg offered a theory about the nature ofthe universe. He also explored the question of how the finite, physical worldcan originate in an infinite, immaterial source, that is, God. This was thebeginning of Swedenborg’s long quest to find a scientific proof of the soul.Swedenborg saw the limitations of the new science rising out of the work ofNewton and Descartes. Newtonian science was content to formulate laws out of theevidence offered to the senses, but Swedenborg was determined to get behindsensory phenomena in order to arrive at their causes. “The sign that we arewilling to be wise,” he wrote, “is the desire to know the causes of things, andto investigate the secret and unknown operations of nature.” For the next decadeSwedenborg did just that.Swedenborg was aided in this quest by a strange psychological quirk. In his nextmajor work, The Economy of the Animal Kingdom (also translated as The Dynamicsof the Soul’s Domain), Swedenborg speaks of a peculiar inner experience.Whenever he felt he was approaching some discovery, Swedenborg saw a “certaincheering light and joyful confirmatory brightness” that played around the sphereof his mind, “a kind of mysterious radiation that darts through some sacredtemple in the brain.” This “confirmatory brightness” returned to Swedenborgwhenever his meditations brought him closer to the truth, and he referred to itas “the sign.”Some of Swedenborg’s speculations seem well ahead of their time. In ThePrincipia, Swedenborg posited “dimensionless points” as the building blocks ofthe universe. Having no dimensions, they have no extension in space. Not limitedto one location, they are universally present, existing everywhere. Given this,every portion of our spatiotemporal world can serve as a starting point for aprocess of inference, which will then lead to the infinite. Within this, all ofthe apparently separate elements of our world exist in a kind of seamless unity.In recent times, a similar idea was developed by the physicist David Bohm, withhis notion of an “implicate order” formed of “unbroken wholeness.” Anothersimilar contemporary development is holograms. Like Swedenborg’s points, theimage in a hologram isn’t localized: it’s contained in every part of the whole.Swedenborg’s points are also reminiscent of fractals. Swedenborg saw his pointsas the connecting link to the infinite; as such, they had access to infiniteenergy, an intuition echoed by later insights into particle physics. Thisinfinite energy is constrained by the points, and the points themselves suffer afurther constraint by being compelled to move in definite directions. Themovement of Swedenborg’s points over time forms a particle, and its collectivemovements are seen as an atom. The atoms eventually form larger bodies.Swedenborg continues to repeat this pattern, eventually arriving at very largebodies like the sun, which he envisions as being made up of many smaller imagesof itself, much like a hologram or fractal. This reiterative element inSwedenborg’s system is an example of “like-partedness,” and we can just aseasily say that, for Swedenborg, the sun is made up of innumerable infinitesimalsuns as we can that, for him, the sun is really just an immense particle. Thisidea would repeat itself in Swedenborg’s later theological writings, when hespeaks of the universe as a Great Man, of which we are all parts. Similarly,Swedenborg’s heaven is made up of angels. This is an idea common to Hermeticthought, its basic formula being the alchemical maxim “as above, so below.”Swedenborg’s hypothesis produced other remarkable anticipations. He projectedthe spiraling of his dimensionless points out into the cosmos, and his pictureof the Milky Way as a great wheel of stars anticipated our modern concepts ofthe galaxy. The French mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace is usually giventhis honor, but there’s a good chance that Swedenborg should be credited withfirst positing the nebula theory of solar and planetary formation. His othersuggestions include the ideas that the earth and other planets have graduallyremoved themselves from the sun and received a lengthening time of revolution;that the earth’s rotation has been gradually increased; that the galaxiesthemselves are arranged in greater systems; that stars have axial rotation; thatplanets are formed by the ring of stellar material given off by novae; and thatsome stars, which we now call pulsars, emit pulses of radiation.In later years, Swedenborg spoke about life on other planets. This suggests onefurther contemporary cosmological anticipation, the “anthropic cosmologicalprinciple.” In its strong form, it argues that, in our universe, intelligentlife forms like ourselves must arise. Swedenborg takes this even further: theuniverse was created in order for beings like ourselves to exist. This is sobecause it is through beings like ourselves that heaven is populated. Theinhabitants of one planet alone wouldn’t suffice for this purpose, so the cosmosis littered with other planets harboring human life.In 1737 Swedenborg traveled to Paris and Italy to study anatomy and physiology.He also read widely in the anatomical literature of the time. This studyproduced his writings on the brain, posthumously published as The Cerebrum.Another product was The Economy of the Animal Kingdom. This work has nothing todo with animals in the wild: the “kingdom” is the human body and the “animal,”the animating energy, or soul. Here Swedenborg made his final assault onlocating the elusive “seat of the soul.” This was not an uncommon pursuit;Descartes himself had argued that the soul was lodged in the pineal gland. ButSwedenborg had his own ideas, and his work shows how ahead of his time he was.In The Cerebrum, Swedenborg made his most important contribution toneuroscience: the recognition that the gray matter of the cerebral cortex houseshigher psychic functions like consciousness and thought, something that wouldn’tbe “officially” recognized until more than a century later. Some of Swedenborg’sother insights include the existence of the cerebrospinal fluid, the circulationof the cerebrospinal fluid through interstices between the fibers and nerves ofthe body, and the existence of the central canal of the spinal cord. He alsoperceived that the central ganglia and spinal ganglia take over some of themovement initiations of the cerebrum (conditioned reflexes); that the opticlobes are connected with the sense of sight; that the function of the brain ispartly as a “chemical laboratory” distributing chemicals through the pituitarygland; that the blood is being continually broken down and replaced; that thequality of the blood depends upon the organ and the person; that the smallestorganic particles (what he called “fibers” and “cortical elements”) areindependent centers of forces endowed with individual life; and that each organand “fiber” selects its own requisite nutrients from the blood supplied by theheart’s pumping action—i.e., the blood plasma is not forced into the tissues butrather is drawn in selectively by the tissues themselves.We can add that Swedenborg was the first to recognize the existence andimportance of neurons and that early on he emphasized the significance of thefrontal lobes for the higher psychic functions. A further insight into the brainappeared in Swedenborg’s later career, when the doors of the spirit world wereopened to him and he observed that the geography of heaven corresponds to thatof the human body: Swedenborg anticipated the findings of split-brain research,delegating the “rational” to the left side of the brain and the “affections orthings of the will” to the right. Swedenborg also gave importance to thecerebellum, a kind of proto-cerebrum located in the back of the skull. It isthrough the cerebellum that the influx from the divine enters the soul. (That’swhy, in heaven, no one is allowed to stand behind an angel.) Swedenborg’ssuggestion that the cerebellum is a contact point between the human and thedivine was echoed centuries later by the psychologist Stan Gooch, who saw thecerebellum as the seat of paranormal and mystical experience. Gooch’s suggestionthat Neanderthal man possessed a larger cerebellum and was hence more “mystical”than we are parallels Swedenborg’s belief that, in an earlier time, humankindwas closer to the Divine and could perceive its presence directly. Goochsuggested that individuals with psychic powers would possess larger, more activecerebellums, and he came across one individual who “reported actual consciousexperience of the cerebellum during…paranormal activity.” (Emphasis here and inother quotes are in the original unless otherwise noted.) The individual wasSwedenborg.Yet for all his discoveries about the brain, Swedenborg’s search for a proof ofthe soul was coming up empty. The soul eluded all his efforts to locate it.Rather than accept this as proof that it didn’t exist, as most scientists would,Swedenborg recognized the inadequacy of one of science’s most cherished beliefs:the continuity of nature. Nature, this concept says, is of a piece, and the samelaws accommodating physical reality should be applied to anything else.Swedenborg jettisoned this dogma and instead developed what he called “TheDoctrine of Series and Degrees.” There were, he saw, “breaks” in nature,“jumps,” the kind of “explanatory gaps” that some contemporary philosophers seebetween the physical structure of the brain and the immaterial phenomena ofconsciousness. (No one has yet shown how we get from a neuron to a thought.) Theidea also has some resonance with the notion of “punctuated equilibrium,” whichsuggests that evolution doesn’t operate gradually, but in sudden “leaps.” ForSwedenborg this was a tremendous insight, and it initiated a period of much soulsearching of a different kind. For all his brilliance and questing intellect, hesaw that science would not lead him to the soul, and this led to a protractedstruggle between the heart and the head. This conflict between the religious andrational sides of his psyche, begun years before, reached a momentous climax onthe night of April 6–7, 1744. Swedenborg had already gone through a long periodof strange dreams and trance states in which he “heard speech that no humantongue can utter,” and felt agonies of “wretchedness as of final condemnation.”He experienced spells of swooning, fainting, and uncontrollable trembling anddays of “double thoughts,” when an idea was immediately countered by itsopposite. When Swedenborg went to bed that night, he heard a noise under hishead; then, suddenly, a violent shuddering and a sound like thunder shook him. Agreat rush of wind threw him to the floor, and he seems to have had anout-of-body experience. He asked Christ to make him worthy of his grace, then hefelt a hand grasp his, and he found himself in Christ’s bosom. Christ askedSwedenborg if he had a “bill of health”—an allusion to Swedenborg’s close shavewith a hangman’s noose on his first trip to London. Swedenborg answered thatChrist knew the answer to this better than he did, to which Christ answered,“Well, then do.” Later, this figure appeared again and told Swedenborg that hehad chosen him to reveal the true meaning of scripture. In his last years,Swedenborg described this encounter to a friend:That same night were opened to me so that I became thoroughly convinced of theirreality, the worlds of spirits, heaven, and hell, and I recognized there manyacquaintances of every condition in life. From that day I gave up the study ofall worldly science, and labored in spiritual things, according as the Lordcommanded me to write. Afterwards the Lord opened, daily very often, my bodilyeyes, so that, in the middle of the day I could see into the other world, and ina state of perfect wakefulness converse with angels and spirits.Whatever we make of this transformation—and the arguments for Swedenborg’smadness are no more eloquent than those for his spiritual genius—it is clearthat, even without his journeys to heaven and hell, Swedenborg remains a figureof fascination and well worthy of discovery. His life and work, it seems to me,are emblematic of the need today for science to push beyond its artificialboundaries, erected by a willful limitation of its criteria for “evidence.”Swedenborg was not the only scientist to recognize that science alone could notaccount for the mysteries of human existence. Alfred Wallace, codiscoverer withCharles Darwin of the theory of evolution through natural selection, believedthat random mutations and environmental pressures by themselves could notaccount for man’s moral urges and posited some “overruling intelligence” slowlyguiding human beings in their spiritual development. Like Swedenborg, WilliamJames, who practically invented the science of psychology, devoted years ofeffort and energy toward discovering some “proof” of the soul. And John Eccles,who won the Nobel Prize in 1963 for his work on the brain’s synapses, agreedwith Swedenborg that the mind could not be reduced to some epiphenomenon of graymatter and argued, along with the philosopher Karl Popper, in favor of theirreducible reality of the Self. All these men were rigorous scientists, yetthey all discovered that the most important things about humanexistence—consciousness, the mind, the self, free will—eluded even the mostmethodical investigation. Yet, unlike other scientists, they took this asevidence, not of their nonexistence, but of science’s own limitations.Swedenborg surely went further in his spiritual pursuits; and the moral andexistential value of his visionary ideas, which I have not even touched on here(I discuss them in my 2012 book Swedenborg: An Introduction to His Life andIdeas), may, for some, be what is truly important about him. We may take orleave them as we wish. For me, Swedenborg is worth discovering for the examplehe gives of a truly remarkable mind refusing to abandon its quest for thespiritual in man."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc5]Jan Potocki and the Saragossa Manuscript [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc5]Most English readers know the eccentric Count Jan Potocki as the author of oneof the strangest works of nineteenth-century European literature, The ManuscriptFound in Saragossa (1815). The Saragossa Manuscript, as it is often called, is aweird farrago of stories within stories, with an overall supernatural bent,modeled in many ways on The Arabian Nights. Over a period of sixty-six days, theyoung Walloon officer Alphonse van Worden recounts his adventures with gypsies,Kabbalists, demons, corpses, astrologers, the Wandering Jew, and secretsocieties. The work has rightly earned Potocki a place in the ranks of the greatwriters of supernatural fiction.Born in 1761 to one of Poland’s wealthiest aristocratic families, by the end ofhis life the famed traveler, ethnologist, linguist, and fantasist had becomesomething of a superman. In an insatiable quest for knowledge, Potocki combinedEnlightenment rationalism with a Romantic appetite for the strange and uncanny.Fantastic journeys, political intrigues, and arcane scholarship filled a careerthat can be best described as “Baron Munchausen meets Marco Polo.” Educated atGeneva and Lausanne, the young count received a solid grounding in classicalknowledge and soon revealed an astonishing capacity for languages, of which hespoke eight fluently, including Arabic. Then came training at the Vienna Academyof Military Engineering, followed by a stint of service to the Knights of Malta,which included a sea battle against the Barbary corsairs.Potocki traveled widely at this time, making his way across Western Europe aswell as journeying to Tunisia, Constantinople, Egypt, and Morocco. In Morocco hetried unsuccessfully to locate a manuscript of the original Arabian Nights,which enjoyed something of a craze in eighteenth-century Europe. While inConstantinople, he observed the traditional storytellers plying their trade.Their exotic accounts of adventure and mystery inspired him to turn his hand toa tale or two, which he included in his lively writings about his journeys. InConstantinople he also met Osman, his Turkish valet, who, from then on,accompanied the count everywhere for the rest of his life. Potocki also took towearing oriental dress at this time and was often seen in a fez or burnoose.Along with his travel writings, Potocki pursued historical, cultural, andlinguistic research wherever he found himself, thereby helping to found thediscipline of ethnology.In the mid-1780s, Potocki found himself in Paris, where he hobnobbed withEnlightenment figures in the salons and cafés of prerevolutionary France. It washere that he became involved in strange mystical intrigues, which someconspiracy theorists, like the splenetic Abbé Barruel, believed were responsiblefor the revolution itself. This was the Paris of Cagliostro, Swedenborg, andMesmer, of Adam Weishaupt and the Bavarian Illuminati, of Kabbalism, séances,and Freemasonry, where followers of Martinez de Pasqually and the Order of theElect Cohens mixed with the weird novelist Jacques Cazotte and the Hermeticphilosopher Louis Claude de Saint-Martin.In this atmosphere of magic, mysticism, and secret societies, the young Potockiwas intoxicated by the heady brew of esotericism and progress in a way thatwould later inform his single masterpiece. But it may have been more than theseeds of literature that captivated him at this time. In 1780, the infamous“black magician” Cagliostro opened a lodge of his Egyptian Rite Freemasonry inWarsaw. Although throughout his life Potocki advocated an inconsistent array ofpolitical beliefs, there’s strong reason to suspect that he became a Mason inWarsaw then, and that his period in Paris was filled with secret plots tooverthrow the monarchy and establish a “universal society” of brotherhood andtolerance. Indeed, scenes and motifs of initiation and secret knowledge runthrough the Saragossa Manuscript, and one of its central figures—the great Sheikof the Gomelez family—is the head of a gigantic scheme that resembles themachinations of the Bavarian Illuminati. Potocki’s decision to set his bizarrenovel against the wild beauty of the Spanish Sierra Morena may have beeninfluenced by more than the fact that he passed through the area on his way backfrom Morocco.In 1788, Potocki returned to Poland, setting up a printing press and publishingcompany and, a few years later, establishing the first free reading room inWarsaw. In 1790 he made an even greater impression on the Polish capital bybecoming one of the first men to ascend in a balloon, floating over the ancientcity in the company of the French aeronaut Blanchard, the ubiquitous Osman, andhis dog, Lulu. Unable to stay in one place for long, in the late 1790s Potockifound himself on a trek through the Caucasus. Here he learned the secretlanguage of Circassian noblemen and threw himself into the study of the ancientcultures and beliefs of the Slavic people. During this time the count wrotemassive volumes on the history, archaeology, and languages of the area withimposing titles like Principles of Chronology for the Ages Anterior to theOlympiads. Then, in 1805, in the service of the Russian tsar Alexander I, he wasthe scientific adviser on an expedition to Peking. At that time China was stillresistant to foreign influence and the emperor Yung-Ten turned Potocki back atUlan Bator in Mongolia.Unfazed, Potocki absorbed all he could about the customs and culture of theMongolian people. Given his interest in esoteric matters, one wonders if he cameacross mention of the fabled underground city of Agarttha, in later years thefocus of the eccentric French occultist and orientalist Alexandre Saint-Yvesd’Alveydre—as well as that of Potocki’s fellow Islamic enthusiast René Guénon.Little is known of Potocki’s doings in Mongolia, but it would be surprising ifhe didn’t seek out its more exotic tales and fables. Themes of subterraneanmysteries permeate the Saragossa Manuscript, with hidden strongholds, buriedtreasure, and initiatory caves, although these indeed are common tropes inaccounts of esotericism. In between ballooning over Warsaw and crossing the GobiDesert, Potocki found time to turn his hand to literature. One effort, a seriesof vignettes entitled Parade, is a classic of Polish theater. His other classicis, of course, the Saragossa Manuscript.The book has a history as unusual and varied as that of its author. It’sbelieved Potocki began it in 1797 as a series of stories designed to entertainhis first wife. It was completed in 1815, just before Potocki took his own life,blowing his brains out with a silver bullet. Legend has it that in his lastyears Potocki secluded himself in his castle at Uladowka on his Podolia estate.Here he turned melancholy and bored, his health diminished, and hisdisillusionment grew. The French Revolution had degenerated into a charnelhouse, and the great dreams of the Illuminati dissolved with the rise of thedictator Napoleon. A scandal surrounding Potocki’s divorce from his secondwife—in which there were rumors of incest—also took its toll.Alone, he gave way to morbid fantasies. The thought that he had become awerewolf obsessed him. Potocki is said to have taken the silver knob of a sugarbowl, formed in the shape of a strawberry, and filed this into a bullet, whichhe had blessed by the castle chaplain. Then, on November 20, 1815 (or, dependingon your source, December 2 or 11), he put the bullet in his pistol, stuck thebarrel in his mouth, and pulled the trigger, thus earning himself the sobriquetof being “the man who shot himself with a strawberry.” In any event, Potockipublished the first part of the Saragossa Manuscript—comprising the firstthirteen days of van Worden’s strange adventures—on his own printing press in1804–05 and distributed it to friends. These, and the following fifty-threedays, were written originally in French. Potocki is said to have earned some badpress from the literary establishment of his time for writing and speakingbetter French than Polish, and to this day there is some controversy overwhether the Saragossa Manuscript is a work of Polish or French literature.The second section of the book was published in Paris in 1813 under the titleAvadoro: histoire espagnole (Avadoro: Spanish history), being made up of talesof a gypsy chief who features in the novel. In 1814, these two separate bookswere combined into a three-volume edition that appeared in St. Petersburg. AfterPotocki’s death, a Polish translation of the original French appeared in 1847.The original French edition was then lost, and the edition that appeared inParis in 1989 is basically a translation of the Polish version back into French.A recent English edition is based on this French-Polish version. Althoughprinted editions were for the most part lost throughout the nineteenth century,Potocki’s masterpiece was nevertheless easy plunder for writers like WashingtonIrving and another eccentric litterateur, the mad poet Gérard de Nerval, who wasknown to stroll the streets of Paris with a lobster on a leash. Irving andNerval were not alone in stealing copiously from Potocki’s fantastic treasuretrove in order to meet the nineteenth-century demand for “oriental fictions.”This appetite for “Eastern” tales of mystery and magic was sparked in many waysby the work of yet another eccentric writer, William Beckford, builder of thebizarre Gothic folly Fonthill Abbey and author of the decadently exotic novelVathek (1786), which Potocki would certainly have known. Beckford was himself nostranger to the occult world of the Enlightenment, and Vathek shares with theSaragossa Manuscript a strikingly similar motif: a stairway of fifteen hundredsteps. In Beckford’s Arabian nightmare, the steps lead upward, to the top of theTower of the caliph Vathek; in Potocki’s they lead down to a cave and theunderworld. Beckford’s tale of oriental excess and demonic luxury is no morethan a rich genius’s fantasy of forbidden lust and its willful satisfaction. Butfor Potocki, the subterranean journey has the resonance of the initiatory ritesand magical practices linked to the secret societies he penetrated inprerevolutionary France.The Saragossa Manuscript purports to be a document discovered in 1809 by aFrench soldier out looting after the fall of the Spanish city of Saragossa tothe French and Polish armies. The manuscript recounts the strange adventures ofanother military officer, Alphonse van Worden, who, some forty years earlier,has come upon a weird crew of ghosts, magicians, dervishes, seductresses, andsheiks as he passes through the mountains of the Sierra Morena on his way torejoin his regiment in Madrid.Ignoring warnings of the danger of crossing the mountains alone, Alphonse findsthat his troubles begin when he spends the night in a haunted inn. There heencounters two Moorish sisters, Emina and Zubeida, who easily seduce the youngman. Enthralled by their charms, he nevertheless hesitates to accept their offerof marriage, since it would mean casting off his Christian beliefs and adoptingthe word of Islam; he also wonders if they are demons sent to turn him from thetrue path.Nevertheless, Alphonse is sufficiently taken with them to drink a potion from amagic cup that produces in him powerful, vivid dreams in which he and thesisters enjoy the delights of the flesh. He is rudely awakened the next morningto find himself, not in the capacious bed of the inn, but in broad daylight,beneath a gallows he had seen the day before, with two bandits hanged upon them.Today, however, the bandits are no longer on the gibbet; they are lying besidehim. With disgust, Alphonse realizes that he has spent the night in the embraceof corpses. Thus begins his sixty-six-day sojourn amidst weird and fantasticadventures.I can only mention some of the many esoteric motifs that appear throughout thetales, as well as the encyclopedic philosophical discourses that accompany them.The gallows suggest the Tarot trump of the Hanged Man, a symbol of spiritualdeath and initiation; initiation rites and challenges appear in many formsthroughout the book. The weird adventures and tales within tales, in whichAlphonse is often unsure if he is awake, dreaming, or under the influence ofhashish, are a reminder of the ambiguous nature of reality. They also occupy theliminal space between sleep and consciousness, the hypnagogic realm of magic andthe paranormal.Several well-known historical occult figures appear throughout the tales, suchas Apollonius of Tyana, Knorr von Rosenroth, and Simon Magus. Several“doublings” also appear, such as the Celestial Twins, suggesting alchemicalthemes of integration as well as the esoteric notion of the doppelgänger orastral body. Many of the doublings are of a sexual character, suggesting strangeerotic practices. The first of these—Alphonse’s encounter with Emina andZubeida, whom he first meets in a cellar—suggests the uncertain terrain thereader is about to enter. These delightful but dangerous twins are“subterraneans,” creatures of the underworld. They are also devotees of astrange, foreign faith.As the scholar Joscelyn Godwin points out in The Theosophical Enlightenment,“The initiatic journey to Islamic soil has been a repeated theme of Europeanesotericism, ever since the Templars settled in Jerusalem and ChristianRosenkreuz learnt his trade in Damascus.” What troubles the young Alphonse abouthis new girlfriends, aside from the fact that they may really be the ghosts oftwo bandits, is their enticements to abandon his Christian beliefs and adoptIslam, a horror that Potocki, with his obsession with all things Arabic,obviously didn’t share.For adventurous Europeans of the nineteenth century, the East represented allthat went beyond the staid morality of Christianity. Yet, if all Potocki wantedwas to add another oriental fiction to the proliferation of Eastern tales thatsprang up after Antoine Galland produced his French translation of The ArabianNights in 1717, why would he set his phantasmagoric novel in Spain, anexceedingly Catholic country? The answer, I think, lies in Potocki’s possibleinvolvement with the Bavarian Illuminati and the mystico-political intrigues ofprerevolutionary France.The secret society known as the Bavarian Illuminati began on May 1, 1776, thebrainchild of one Adam Weishaupt, a professor of canonical law at IngoldstatUniversity in Bavaria. Weishaupt, drunk with the elixir of rationalism, had avision of a free, egalitarian Europe, rid of the tyranny of the monarchies. Toachieve this end, he became a Freemason in order to use the lodges’ vast networkof contacts and hierarchies. Quickly his disciples infiltrated most otherlodges; even Cagliostro, it is said, was an early convert. Cagliostro, we know,opened a lodge of his Egyptian Rite Freemasonry in Warsaw in 1780. TheIlluminati’s aim was to gain members among the rich and powerful of society,targeting aristocrats and noblemen of reformist views. I have suggested thatPotocki may have been initiated into Masonry in Cagliostro’s Warsaw lodge. Ifso, and if Cagliostro was indeed a member of the Illuminati, then Potocki wouldbe exactly the kind of individual they would bring into their circle. The factthat Weishaupt claimed that Mohammed himself was an initiate of the societywould certainly have piqued the young count’s interest.The themes of esoteric and political intrigue running through the SaragossaManuscript have clear parallels with the aims of the Illuminati, but there areother links that strengthen the case for it being an Illuminist work. One isPotocki’s love of things Islamic. In the 1500s, in the mountains of Afghanistan,an earlier “Illuminati” rose up: the Roshaniya, or “Illuminated Ones.” With hispassion for orientalism and arcane knowledge, Potocki might possibly have knownof this cult. Led by “the sage of Illumination,” Bayezid Ansari, the IlluminatedOnes claimed to be descendants of the “helpers of Mohammed” after his flightfrom Mecca. According to some authorities, references exist that link this cultto a “House of Wisdom” in Cairo, which existed in the eleventh century. Mentionof a House of Wisdom links Roshaniya to another Islamic secret society, theAssassins, who also spoke of a “House of Science” located in Cairo. TheAssassins’ reign of terror also began in the last years of the eleventh century.Archetypal mystical-political intriguers, the Assassins set the tone for theconspiracy theories that gathered around the Freemasons in the nineteenthcentury. In his Geschichte der Assassinen (History of the Assassins, 1818),Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall wrote: “As in the West, revolutionary societiesarose from the bosom of the Freemasons, so in the East did the Assassins springfrom the Ismaili sect.” Bayezid Ansari was said to have been inspired to createthe Roshaniya by a meeting with an Ismaili missionary. Like the Assassins andIlluminati, the Roshaniya aimed at gaining political control by subverting thestatus quo; they also practiced a form of meditation known as khilwat, orsilence, an exercise said to stimulate supernatural abilities. Bayezid exercisedabsolute control over his followers, as did the Assassins’ Old Man of theMountain and Potocki’s Great Sheik of the Gomelez. Preaching a doctrine similarto that famously attributed to the leader of the Assassins, Hassan ibnSaba—“Nothing is true, everything is permitted”—Bayezid was able to achieveconsiderable political power, with disciples and followers willing to commit allmanner of crimes, including murder. As in Weishaupt’s Illuminati, women wereemployed by Bayezid as agents, their powers of seduction deemed to be often morepowerful means of persuasion than rational argument; The Saragossa Manuscriptechoes this idea in Alphonse’s initiation by the Moorish sisters. Eventually,Bayezid Ansari and Roshaniya were suppressed by the Moguls.Yet another pre-Weishaupt version of the Illuminati flourished in Spain. In 1512the sect of the Alumbrados, or “Illuminated Ones,” began in Guadalajara. It roseamong the circles of Franciscan friars responsible for some of the first greatworks of mysticism to be published in Spain. The cult’s basic belief was in an“illumination by the Holy Spirit,” a kind of gnosis that did away with the needfor priest or church. Soon detected by the Spanish Inquisition, the cult existedin different forms until it was finally suppressed in 1623. Oddly enough, thissame year saw strange notices announcing the arrival of yet another secretsociety, the Rosicrucians, in Paris. This may be more than a coincidence giventhe similarities among the practices of the Rosicrucians, the Alumbrados, andcertain Sufi sects; for example, the Alumbrados practiced a kind of intensemental concentration, similar to the khilwat of the Roshaniya, which they called“mental prayer.”Although a Christian cult, the Alumbrados shared some of the erotic practices ofthe Illuminati and Roshaniya, as well as the Moorish sisters. When the churchfinally crushed them, the Alumbrados were, like the Templars (also linked to theIlluminati), accused of sexual perversion. The cult was made up of priests andpriestesses and combined a form of free love with dramatic displays of mysticalintoxication. Members were encouraged to induce ecstasies and trances and, likethe Great Sheik of the Gomelez, leaders of the Alumbrados demanded absoluteobedience. In return they absolved their followers of all responsibility tosecular and spiritual authorities. During the Inquisition’s trials, it turnedout that many of the sect’s members were conversos, or New Christians,descendants of Jews converted to Christianity after the pogroms of 1391.Judaism, like Islam, attracted Potocki as an exotic alternative to theChristianity of his time, and the Spanish Jews were of course responsible forthe great system of mystical and magical thought known as Kabbalah, notions ofwhich run throughout the Saragossa Manuscript.Rosicrucian symbolism also abounds in Potocki’s masterpiece, most clearly in thescene in which Alphonse finds himself in a cave illuminated by many lamps. Therehe discovers a massive vein of gold and the tools necessary to extract theprecious metal. In the Fama fraternitatis (Rumor of the Brotherhood) of 1614—oneof the earliest Rosicrucian tracts—the authors promise anyone coming forth tojoin the society “more gold than both the Indies bring to the king of Spain.”Each day in the cave, Alphonse extracts a quantity of the metal equal to hisweight. In Rosicrucian legend, Christian Rosenkreuz, the mythical founder of thesociety, was buried in 1484, in a hidden tomb, after dying at the age of 106. In1604, this tomb was said to have been discovered and, inside, his uncorruptedbody lay in a seven-sided vault, lit by a powerful lamp. The Rosicrucians wereHermeticists, Kabbalists, and alchemists, but they shunned the vulgar idea ofalchemy as a means of making material gold. The gold they sought was spiritual;clearly the gold that Alphonse mines is of a similar nature.In setting his nineteenth-century “illuminated” tale in Spain, the European landthat for a time fell to the followers of the Prophet, Potocki, whose incredibleerudition may well have uncovered Weishaupt’s predecessors, forged his own bondswith the earlier Illuminists. In any event, A Manuscript Found in Saragossadisplays the best virtues of the mystical Enlightenment: tolerance, curiosity,and a lively interest in the beliefs and practices of cultures outside theChristocentric Europe of the time. If, in his last days, the man who shothimself with a strawberry succumbed to melancholy and despair, he neverthelessleft us a manuscript full of wonder and magic."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc6]Éliphas Lévi: The Professor of Transcendental Magic [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc6]According to most accounts, modern occultism was invented by Alphonse LouisConstant, who was born in Paris in 1810 and who wrote his books under thepseudonym Éliphas Lévi, supposedly the Hebrew equivalent of his birth name. Atthat time an atmosphere of the East clung to Jews, an exotic flavor of distantlands, strange practices, and magical lore, which appealed to Constant. Hiswriting is full of portentous references to the secret mysteries of the Talmud,the Zohar, and other Hebrew texts. He was also a passionate, if unreliable,devotee of Kabbalah. Having a Hebrew name was undoubtedly good for hiscredibility as a Kabbalistic savant.The son of a shoemaker, Constant grew up in humble surroundings near theBoulevard Saint Germain. Although he was dreamy and solitary, his quick mindimpressed the parish priest, who helped to get Alphonse sent to the “littleseminary” of Saint Nicolas du Chardonnet and from there to the seminary of SaintSulpice. Here he studied for the priesthood until, as the story goes, he waseventually relieved of the cloth for “preaching doctrines contrary to thechurch.”Exactly what those doctrines were is unclear, but it is very likely they had todo with sex. His doubt about the priesthood came in the form of a young girl hetutored for her first Holy Communion. The girl’s poor mother begged Constant toinstruct her, saying that a man of his kindness couldn’t refuse. In the girl’sbeautiful blue eyes he discovered the overwhelming need for human love—althoughhe assures us the inspiration was not carnal. Suddenly, the idea of a life ofcold renunciation repelled him, and he abandoned the priesthood just beforetaking his final vows.After leaving Saint Sulpice, Constant earned his crust acting with a touringtheatrical group. He was a talented artist and provided illustrations for amagazine called Beautiful Women of Paris and the Provinces. His drawings appearin his own books as well as others, including an edition of Alexandre Dumas’snovel The Count of Monte Cristo. He wrote several pamphlets of a radicalsocialist nature—more rhetorical than well argued—and supported himself as besthe could on the periphery of the Parisian literary world.In 1839, Constant met Alphonse Esquiros, author of a strange work of “highfantasy,” The Magician. It embodied, Lévi tells us, “all that the romanticism ofthe period conceived to be most bizarre.” This included a harem of dead ladies,a bronze automaton that preached chastity, and a hermaphrodite who was in lovewith the moon.Esquiros invited Constant to visit a visionary prophet, “The Mapah,” an old mancalled Simon Ganneau, who was involved in a strange royalist messianic intrigue.Ganneau had the peculiar habit of wearing a woman’s cloak while he spoke to hisdisciples of the creation of the universe, the fall of man, and other occultrevelations. Although he had originally gone to scoff, Lévi was impressed by theweird scene in the Mapah’s squalid attic.In his Histoire de la magie (History of magic, 1860) Lévi describes Ganneau as“a bearded man of majestic demeanor…surrounded by several men, bearded andecstatic like himself.” The woman’s cloak gave the prophet the “air of adestitute dervish,” and a white froth would gather on his lips when he warmed tohis subject. Ganneau’s wife—motionless, “like an entrancedsomnambulist”—believed herself to be the reincarnation of Marie Antoinette. Notto be outdone, Ganneau claimed to be Louis XVII. Esquiros and Constant forgottheir laughter and, taken with Ganneau’s message to give “the last word ofrevolution and to seal the abyss of anarchy,” they duly joined the converted.One of the Mapah’s disciples started the revolution of 1848, at least accordingto Lévi. This intense young man, named Sobrier, who “believed himselfpredestined to save the world by provoking the supreme crisis of universalrevolution,” began shouting on the streets of Paris. Accompanied by two “streetarabs”—one with a torch, the other beating time—he went through the streets withhalf of Paris behind him. The mob stopped before the Hôtel des Capucines; a shotwas fired and the riot broke out. If this story is true, esotericism in thenineteenth century had more of an effect on the exoteric world than is usuallysuspected.Constant himself was imprisoned for eight months for writing a socialist tractcalled The Gospel of Liberty (1839). His personal life had its disappointments,too. In Evreux, he had seduced an assistant headmistress, who bore him anillegitimate child. The one glaring misdeed in a life otherwise devoted tosocial utopianism and mystical absorption occurred when Constant abandoned theteacher and became infatuated with her student, Noémie Cadiot. In 1846, at theage of thirty-six, Constant married Noémie, then seventeen years old. They had adaughter who died in childhood, and soon after the death, Noémie left him. Léviwas devastated, but Noémie’s desertion proved the catalyst that transformed thesocialist dreamer into Éliphas Lévi, master of the mystic arts.In 1852, the year before Noémie’s desertion, Constant came under the influenceof one of the most curious figures of the nineteenth century, the eccentricPolish émigré Józef Maria Hoene-Wronski. A soldier in the Polish and Russianarmies, Hoene-Wronski studied at the observatory at Marseille between 1803 and1810. There he developed a fantastically complex theory of the origin andstructure of the universe. Communicating with the major astronomers andphysicists of the time, Hoene-Wronski’s happy years in Marseille ended when hepublished the results of his research. These were so controversial that thefaculty of the Institute of Marseille forced him to leave the observatory, andintellectual persecution dogged him for the rest of his life.Absolutely committed, in the face of scorn, ridicule, and abject poverty, to hisvision of universal and fundamental knowledge, Hoene-Wronski ignited the latentoccultist in Constant. Hoene-Wronski’s Pythagorean theories held numbers to bethe key to the mysteries of the universe. He was also preoccupied with aperpetual motion machine, “squaring the circle,” and an invention he called theprognomètre, a machine designed to make predictions.But it was Hoene-Wronski’s messianisme—the name he gave to his synthesis ofphilosophy, religion, science, and politics—that truly inspired Constant.Charged with a new mission, Constant plunged into writing his first magicaltreatise, Dogme de la haute magie (Dogma of high magic, 1854). This, along withits second part, Rituel de la haute magie (Ritual of high magic, 1856), wasponderously translated into English by the British occultist A. E. Waite asTranscendental Magic (1896).It was while writing this that Constant’s wife left him. Constant contributed toa leftist paper, the Revue progressive, owned by the Marquis de Montferrier;through this association, the Marquis became interested in the talented andbeautiful Noémie. At first he invited her to write for the paper as well—whichshe did under the name of Claude Vignon—but she soon became his mistress.Immersed in his Kabbalistic studies, Constant did not notice what was going onuntil it was too late.Devastated by his wife’s desertion, Constant lost himself in his studies. It waslike some terrible initiation. When the Dogme appeared on the bookstalls ofParis, it was a sign that Alphonse, the social theorist and ex-abbé, was nomore. The title page proclaimed his new identity, Éliphas Lévi. Thereafter hewas known to his students and across Europe as the Professor of TranscendentalMagic. The book’s opening was guaranteed to hook its readers. “Behind the veilof all hieratic and mystical allegories of ancient doctrines,” Lévi wrote,“behind the darkness and strange ordeals of all initiations, under the seal ofall sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the crumbling stonesof old temples and on the blackened visage of the Assyrian or Egyptian sphinx,in the monstrous or marvelous paintings which interpret to the faithful of Indiathe inspired pages of the Vedas, in the cryptic emblems of our old books onalchemy, in the ceremonies practiced at reception by all secret societies, thereare found indications of a doctrine which is everywhere the same and everywhereconcealed.”As Colin Wilson remarks in The Occult, for all its sonorous power, what Léviclaims here is untrue. There is no single “secret doctrine” behind the variousforms of occultism and mystical lore throughout history. Yet Lévi’s desire tosee one is in keeping with the early nineteenth-century fascination withdiscovering the “roots” of things, natural and social. Discovering the sourcesof the Nile, of mythology, and of language—not to mention the origin of thespecies—occupied the best minds of the century. Freud’s attempt to root neurosisand dreams in sexuality can be seen as the last major undertaking of this sort.But more important than Lévi’s erroneous belief in a primal ur-doctrine of magicis the expectation that this stirring if overly romantic passage creates. Itsuggests that behind the everyday world, behind the history written in textbooksand the “current events” found in newspapers, lies another world, one of deeperand more powerful meaning. This is one of the central themes that Lévibequeathed to the occultists who have followed him.Just decades later, the same motif can be seen in the writings of MadameBlavatsky and her tales of mystic Mahatmas who direct the evolution of mankindfrom secret places in the Himalayas; in G. I. Gurdjieff’s stories of hiddensanctuaries in Central Asia; and, later, in the tales of lost knowledge andvanished civilizations in the fictions of H. P. Lovecraft.In 1853, after his wife’s desertion, the born-again magician packed a bag andset out for London, staying at a hotel in Bloomsbury. He carried letters ofintroduction to some of the most influential English occultists; as his careeras a mage had scarcely begun, his reputation can hardly account for this. Morethan a century before the Internet, it seems, devotees of eccentric interestswere already networking across considerable distances. It also implies that aformidable international occult cabal was well established in nineteenth-centuryEurope.One of these contacts was Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton (later Lord Lytton).Bulwer-Lytton was one of England’s most successful novelists, having alreadypublished works like The Last Days of Pompeii. Several occult novels—Zanoni, AStrange Story, and Vril: The Power of the Coming Race—are notable for theirsuffusion of occult lore and esoteric wisdom. The two got on well, inauguratinga deep and mutually influential friendship.But by far the most important event of Lévi’s London visit was his famousinvocation of the ghost of Apollonius of Tyana, one of the greatest magicians ofantiquity. Lévi’s account reads like something out of a supernatural thriller.The ceremony, commissioned by a mysterious woman in black, took three weeks toprepare and is described in his Rituel de la haute magie (Ritual of high magic,1856). Apparently, the giant figure that appeared before the altar did not lookhow Lévi imagined Apollonius would. Lévi fainted, and his right arm, touched bythe phantom, was numb for days after.“Am I to conclude from this that I really evoked, saw, and touched the great ofApollonius of Tyana?” Lévi asks. Unwilling or unable to explain the “physicallaws” by which this could happen, Lévi nevertheless maintained that he did seeand did touch the apparition, “clearly and distinctly, apart from dreaming, andthat this is sufficient to establish the real efficacy of magical ceremonies.”Lévi’s reputation as a true mage flourished, and other volumes followed,including La clef des grands mystères (The key of the great mysteries, 1861).The “esotourists” and occult travelers that visited him in his Paris apartmentswere usually greeted by a rotund man of red complexion, medium height, small,piercing eyes, prodigious bald cranium, full black beard and moustache, wrappedin his ubiquitous monk’s robe. The rooms themselves were jammed with occultbric-a-brac. On an altar covered in sumptuous drapery and gilt vessels sat aHebrew roll of the Law. Above this hung a golden triangle with the ineffableTetragrammaton (YHVH, the Hebrew name of God) emblazoned on it. Talismans,skulls, and his magical apparatus jostled for space in his small chambers with alife-size painting of a woman representing Holy Kabbalah and withHoene-Wronski’s prognomètre. The atmosphere was at once priestly and theatrical.Lévi’s fame as a master of the occult mysteries brought him a clutch of eagerand supportive students. When the Englishman Kenneth Mackenzie—alleged adept andmember of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia—visited, Lévi greeted him wearinga felt hat which, Lévi said, he was compelled to wear owing to “an affliction ofthe head.” In the course of a conversation on the Tarot, Mackenzie noticed afigurine of the Egyptian goddess Isis. He remarked to Lévi that it was anespecially fine piece of work; Lévi replied that the item was quite ordinary inParis, being a very large tobacco jar.Lévi’s students included two Polish noblemen, Counts Alexander Braszynsky andGeorges de Mniszech, as well as another Pole, named Nowakowski, who worked as adoctor in Berlin, and who was drawn to the occult through a fascination with thedervishes. But Lévi’s closest disciple was an Italian nobleman, BaronNicolas-Joseph Spedalieri; Lévi’s letters to him fill nine volumes.France’s humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 brought Lévimisery. Not only had Lévi nourished high hopes for France as the savior ofcivilization, but the siege of Paris made his life very difficult. The Communethat followed was no better received by Lévi, who in his last years had lostmuch of his revolutionary fire.Toward the end, his days were painful; the headaches and dizzy spells increased;he suffered from dropsy and gangrenous feet, and he spent long, sleepless nightsin his armchair. Stoical, Lévi faced the approach of the Great Unknown withcourage, surrounded by friends and helpers.At two o’clock in the afternoon of May 3, 1875, Éliphas Lévi, once described as“the last of the magi,” passed from his armchair in the Rue de Sèvres into theAin Soph, the unmanifest Limitless Light of the Kabbalists. He left hismanuscripts, books, and scientific instruments, including his prognomètre, tohis disciple de Mniszech.The year of his death is worth noting, for it was one predicted for him. In aletter to Baron Spedalieri, dated 1865, Lévi told of a memorable visit by acurious character, one Juliano Capella. Although the two had never met, Capellatold Lévi: “I know your entire life, past, present, and future. It is regulatedby the inexorable law of numbers,” a claim that echoed the insights ofHoene-Wronski. “You are a man of the pentagram,” Lévi’s uninvited guestcontinued, “and the years marked by the number five are always fateful ones foryou.” Capella then announced that 1875 would mark “the natural end” of Lévi’slife.One wonders if the Professor of Transcendental Magic ever employed hisprognomètre to corroborate this unfortunately accurate prediction."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc7]The Alchemy of August Strindberg [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc7]In 1894, after years of painful struggle and almost universal rejection by hiscountrymen, the Swedish playwright August Strindberg suffered a spiritualcollapse, an emotional breakdown that left him incapable of creative work. ThatStrindberg had reached a dead end isn’t surprising. Vilified in his homeland fornaturalistic works like Miss Julie and The Father, he had already been throughtwo divorces—a third was yet to come—as well as many years of impoverishment andthe loss of his three children from his first marriage. His second marriage, tothe Austrian journalist Frida Uhl, had just ended bitterly. This meantestrangement from yet another child and the loss of Frida’s considerable dowry.At forty-five, penniless and alone, it’s unsurprising that Strindberg questionedthe point of going on. Yet he was a man who possessed demonic persistence, andthe route out of his impasse led through one of the strangest episodes in theturbulent life of a master of modern literature.After his failure in Sweden and a stint in Berlin, Strindberg looked to Parisfor a last assault on fame. Paris was the cultural capital of the nineteenthcentury, and by 1893, some of Strindberg’s works had already been performedthere. But it wasn’t just literary glory that attracted him. Like London, St.Petersburg, and other European capitals, the Paris of the fin de siècle had beenbitten by the occultism bug. Ever since 1856, when Éliphas Lévi invented modernoccultism with the publication of Dogme et rituel de la haute magie (Dogma andritual of high magic), Paris had been a haven for the esoterically inclined.Although a founder of naturalism, Strindberg had a deep interest in magic,mysticism, and other forms of the occult. He was also fascinated by science,considering himself equal to its professionals. In 1893 he published his firstwork of speculative natural history, Antibarbarus (Antibarbarian), a work thatpitted the man of genius against the academic plodders, arguing that the poet’seye saw more deeply that the professor’s methodical squint.When it came to the occult, Strindberg’s pet practice was alchemy. According toone account, by 1894 there were an estimated 50,000 alchemists in Paris. Whetherthis is an exaggeration or not, in the last years of the nineteenth century,Paris was undoubtedly a place where occultism mixed with the avant-garde. In1891, J.-K. Huysmans, onetime follower of Émile Zola and author of the decadentclassic À rebours (Against nature), had shocked the literary public with hisgraphic depiction of a Black Mass in his satanic novel Là-Bas (Down there).Huysmans’s involvement with the Parisian occult underground popularized what wasalready a well-tenanted demimonde; it also fueled a growing fad for returning tothe safe embrace of the church after a titillating walk on the dark side. Afterfinding himself in the middle of an occult feud between the notorious AbbéBoullan and the self-styled Rosicrucian Joséphin Sar Péladan, full of astralattacks and, as Huysmans called them, “fluidic fisticuffs,” the man who kickedoff the Yellow Decade ended his days at a Benedictine monastery.Such Rosicrucian roistering wasn’t unusual. A few years before, the decadentpoet Stanislas de Guaita, a devotee of Baudelaire, morphine addict (he would dieof an overdose in 1897), and onetime student of Sar Péladan fought an extendedbattle with his ex-master. Most of the fighting took place in print, but therecognition that magical warfare was not uncommon in fin de siècle Paris adds adepth to Strindberg’s uncanny adventures, one that commentators sometimes miss.Undoubtedly, between 1894 and 1896, Strindberg came close to, and probably didexperience, a schizoid episode. But it is just possible that the weirdexperiences he recounts in his obsessive record Inferno—based, in part, on hiseven more bizarre Occult Diary—did not solely originate in a great mind’spitiable crackup. Without doubt, the ingredients for a complete mental breakdownare there: intense stress, loneliness, poverty, and an uncertain future, abettedin no small part by Strindberg’s devotion to a popular magical elixir of theday, absinthe. But the strange events that make up Strindberg’s Inferno areprecisely the sort that fueled one of the burning questions of the age: the thinline between genius and madness. A line that, by all accounts, Strindberg passedover frequently.Throughout his career, Strindberg had periodic bouts of revulsion againstliterature. His artistic credo practically ensured this. “I regard it as mydreadful duty to be truthful,” he wrote, “and life is indescribably ugly.” Suchsentiments prompted his plunge into alchemy. It may seem strange that,considering himself a scientist, Strindberg chose alchemy as his path toimmortality. But his approach to science was anything but orthodox. His aim inAntibarbarus was to “explain” the nature of sulfur, the transmutation of carbonand other elements, and the composition of water and air. Claiming to be a“transformist” like Darwin and a monist like the German naturalist ErnstHaeckel, Strindberg declared: “I have committed myself to the assumption thatall elements and all forces are related. And if they derive from one source,then they sprang into existence by means of condensation and attenuation, ofcopulating and crossbreeding, of heredity and transformation…and whatever elseone cares to suggest.”This cavalier attitude didn’t win the critics’ approval. When the book appeared,Strindberg’s pretentions to science were dismissed as a sign of monomania, itsauthor lambasted for his lack of logic and incapacity for experiment. But forthe alchemist, transformation is the key, and Strindberg’s speculative approachis in the great magical tradition. Writing to his young botanist friend, BengtLindforss, Strindberg said: “I doubt all experiments…. I believe rather in thedepth of my conscious thought, or more correctly, my unconscious thought.” Hismethod was to put himself “into a state of unconsciousness, not with drink, butby distractions, games, cards, sleep, novels, without bothering about results oracceptability, and something emerges that I can believe in.”Weird as it seems, Strindberg’s “science” was right in line with the latestdevelopments in art. Before his descent on Paris, he had published an essay,“The New Arts, or the Role of Chance in Artistic Creation.” This, along withanother article on “Deranged Sense Impressions,” deals with the curious power ofthe mind to alter its perceptions—in a word, to “recreate” reality. Like manyother artists and poets, Strindberg rebelled against the neat, orderly,“objective” universe being revealed by an increasingly triumphant rationalistscience. In its place, he argued for a world open to strange forces, and theinfluence of consciousness itself, a position made commonplace decades laterwith the rise of quantum physics. In “The New Arts” he describes the“oscillations of his sense impressions” and recounts how, seen from a certainangle, a cow becomes two peasants embracing each other, then a tree trunk, andthen something else, and how the figures at a picnic are really a plowman’s coatand knapsack thrown over his cart. Strindberg would later describe his ownmethod of writing as something like a trance state. It begins, he said, “withfermentation or some sort of agreeable fever which passes into ecstasy orintoxication.” His considerable absinthe intake surely had a hand in this.Nevertheless, by the next century, with Dada and Surrealism, the notion thatreality is plastic, and that consciousness and chance affect what we experience,would become standard components of aesthetic theory.But Strindberg was interested in more than a new approach to art. He took hisalchemy seriously and, soon after his arrival in Paris, turned his back on theliterary world and got to work on the archetypal alchemical project: makinggold.His first step was to obtain experimental proof of his ideas abouttransformation. He set out to prove the presence of carbon in sulfur. “Back oncemore in my miserable student’s room,” he writes, “I delved into my trunk anddrew forth from their hiding place six crucibles of fine porcelain which Irobbed myself to buy. A pair of tongs and a packet of pure sulfur completed theapparatus of my laboratory. All that remained was to make a fire of furnace heatin the stove.”He did. The flame from his makeshift furnace was so great that he soon sufferedappalling burns, the skin on his hands “peeling off in scales.” After moreexperiments, the burns worsened, and his chapped, cracked hands, irritated bycoke dust, oozed blood. The pain was intolerable, yet, convinced of his success,Strindberg continued. The next step was to show the presence of hydrogen andoxygen. But his apparatus was inadequate and his funds were dwindling. Destituteand in agony, Strindberg had reached another dead end. When the veins in hisarms started to swell from blood poisoning, friends collected money and put himin the Hôpital de Saint-Louis.There Strindberg made friends with a pharmacist who took an interest in hispursuits and allowed him to work in his laboratory. Urged on, he sent theresults of his experiments to a firm of chemists to be analyzed. Their testsproved positive: the sulfur he submitted did indeed contain carbon. Moreencouragement followed. A summary of Strindberg’s scientific work appeared in Lepetit temps, followed by long articles on “Strindberg the scientist” in thehighly respected periodical La science française and the widely read Le Figaro.On the strength of these, Strindberg petitioned to conduct further experimentsusing the laboratory at the Sorbonne. Although the faculty thought little of hiswork, he was granted permission, and he carried out his tests. Further signs ofsuccess appeared. An engineer at a chemical factory in Rouen who read of hisexperiments wrote to him saying that they threw light on “hitherto unexplainedphenomena in the manufacture of sulfuric acid and sulfides.” At the same time, acorrespondence with the distinguished chemist Marcellin Berthelot suggested toStrindberg that he was on the right track.Soon Strindberg believed he had succeeded in extracting gold from iron. It wasaround this time that he came into contact with the Parisian alchemicalunderground. A young man named François Jollivet-Castelot, the author of La vieet l’âme de la matière (The life and soul of matter), which Strindberg had readwith enthusiasm, had heard of Strindberg’s work and approached him, convincedthe great playwright had actually succeeded in the alchemical dream.Jollivet-Castelot later became the editor of an alchemical journal,L’hyperchimie, and published Strindberg’s account of his alchemical work “TheSynthesis of Gold.” A rising star in the alchemical subculture, Strindberg’scelebrity was assured when Gérard Encausse, better known under his occultpseudonym Papus, published an account of his work in the periodicalL’initiation. “August Strindberg,” Papus wrote, “who combines vast knowledgewith his great talent as a writer, has just achieved a synthesis of gold fromiron.” His work, Papus continued, “confirms all the assertions of thealchemists.”This was high praise. The author of several influential works, as leader of theGroupe Indépendant d’Études Esoteriques and Grand Master of the Martinist order,Papus was a powerful figure in the Parisian occult underground. He was alsoindirectly involved in the magical feud between Huysmans, Sar Péladan, and deGuaita. When Papus elected Strindberg an honorary master of La SociétéAlchimique de France, it’s understandable the accolade went to his head. Afteryears of obscurity, rejection, and accusations of madness, to be accepted as agenius by men whose intelligence he respected must have given him somesatisfaction.Yet his alchemical adventure wasn’t purely benign. Nurtured by his occultobsessions, his “deranged sense impressions” began to get out of hand. At firsthe chalked his weird perceptual mutations up to chance and the vagaries of hisunconscious, but increasingly he recognized in them the hands of an occultintelligence he called “the Powers” and “the Unseen.” The world these occultforces led him through soon turned into a kind of waking dream—or nightmare.On a walk to the Luxembourg Gardens he spied his initials, A. S., painted on ashop window, rising out of a silver-white cloud, surmounted by a rainbow. Hetook this as a positive omen. At a stall on the Boulevard Saint Michel, “bychance” he picked up an old chemistry text by the Franco-Spanish toxicologistMateo Orfila. Opening it at random, he hit on a passage that confirmed hisalchemical intuition. “Sulfur has been included among the elements,” Orfilawrote, and certain experiments “seem to prove that it contains hydrogen andoxygen.” Later, during a walk in the Montparnasse Cemetery after his experimentsat the Sorbonne, “chance” drew Strindberg to Orfila’s grave, which he didn’tknow was there, and a later walk down the Rue d’Assas found him oddly drawn to amonastery-like building. It turned out to be the Hotel Orfila. Strindberg soonsettled in for a short stay in purgatory.Never easy on himself, Strindberg felt he was being tested. He talked to “thePowers,” thanked them, and asked them advice. He saw their work everywhere.Money appeared miraculously, allowing him to buy instruments. Observing theembryo of a walnut under a microscope, Strindberg was convinced that he couldsee two tiny hands, clasped in prayer, emerging from the seed. Another sign. Ona “chance” trip to the country, a stone was transformed into a statue of a Romanknight. Pleased with this effect, he looked in the direction in which the“statue” was pointing. On a wall he saw the initials F and S. He first thoughtof his second wife, Frida Strindberg. But then he realized that it was reallythe chemical symbols for iron and sulfur (Fe and S), the ingredients, hebelieved, for alchemical gold (but also for iron pyrites, or fool’s gold). Theweirdness continued. A crumpled pillow became a Michelangelo bust, then alikeness of the devil. A shadow in his room became a statue of Zeus. He hadprecognitive dreams. A dead friend appeared, offering a large American coin.When Strindberg reached for it, the friend disappeared. The next morning hereceived a letter from America. Arriving months late, it informed him of anoffer of twelve thousand francs to write something for the Chicago Exhibition.But the deadline had passed, and the money, a fortune for Strindberg, was lost.A host of strange simulacra followed. In a zinc bath that he used for makinggold by the “wet method,” he saw a remarkable “landscape.” There were “smallhills covered with conifers…plains, with orchards and cornfields…a river…theruins of a castle,” all formed by the evaporation of salts of iron. It was onlya month later, during a visit to his daughter, whom he hadn’t seen for twoyears, that he recognized his vision as the landscape around his mother-in-law’shouse. Making gold by the “dry method” produced its own terrors. Destitute onceagain, Strindberg felt he had to succeed. But “the Powers” had decreedotherwise. After melting borax in terrific heat, all he found was a skull withtwo glistening eyes. On another occasion a chunk of charred coal revealed abizarre formation: a body with a rooster’s head, a human trunk, and distortedlimbs. It looked, he remarked, “like one of the demons that used to perform inthe witches’ Sabbaths of the Middle Ages.” Later discoveries included two gnomesin billowing garments embracing each other, and a Madonna and Child, done up inByzantine style.A reading of Swedenborg convinced Strindberg that his alchemical experimentswere unholy and that for his “salvation,” “the Powers” had consigned him tohell. His torments took the form of various magical attacks. Strindberg wasundoubtedly highly strung and thin-skinned, and some of his “tortures”—such asfinding that his hotel room window opened on the toilets of the neighboringbuilding—smack more of inconvenience and discomfort than anything else. But someare more in line with the magical goings-on familiar to the time. Strindbergbegan to feel there was an occult conspiracy against him. Letters he discoveredin the Hotel Orfila convinced him someone was spying on his alchemicalactivities. The sound of pianos playing eerie, disturbing music followed himeverywhere. He was convinced that the Polish decadent writer StanislawPrzybyszewski had come from Berlin to kill him.Something like a persecution complex developed. His “supersensitive nerves”detected strange subterranean vibrations. The idea that he was the target ofevil emanations obsessed him. Baffling “coincidences” appeared everywhere.Mysterious noises from the rooms next door tormented him, and he was convincedthat someone was trying to kill him using an “electrical machine.” He walkedaround Paris in a state of tense expectancy, awaiting “an eruption, anearthquake, or thunderbolt.” Friends and acquaintances now became demons, sentby “the Powers” to show him the error of his ways, and each night he sufferedanxiety attacks in which he endured the recurrent onslaughts of his torturers.For some time, because he had rejected the teachings of Madame Blavatsky, he wasconvinced his assailants were a group of Theosophists. As with his numeroussimulacra, once the restraints of reason were lifted—“I no longer try to find amotive for my actions. I act extempore”—he saw signs of his persecutioneverywhere.Eventually, through Swedenborg’s philosophy, Strindberg passed through hisordeal, convinced that “the Powers” had put him through the mill in order to aidhis spiritual evolution. By 1897, his interest in alchemy abated, and the urgeto write had returned, one product of which was Inferno. In 1898 he began workon To Damascus, perhaps his greatest play. His belief in “the Powers” remainedfor the rest of his life.It’s possible that Strindberg’s taste for absinthe was the real reason for hisstrange experiences. As consumed in his day, absinthe contained oil of thuja, apowerful and addictive hallucinogen. Habitual use resulted in anxiety, fear,hallucinations, a sense of paralysis and paranoia—all symptoms clearlyexperienced by Strindberg. And yet his occult episodes included periods when heapparently went without drink. So what happened?Strindberg was an enormously creative individual, with incredible powers ofimagination, a terrific will, and an ability to withstand blows that woulddestroy most people. Like many other creative individuals, he at times gainedaccess to hitherto unknown potentials—hidden powers. Yet, for a variety ofreasons, he was also plagued by a paralyzing sense of guilt. My own belief isthat, dammed up as they were by his perpetual self-revulsion, Strindberg’screative energies emerged in other ways—some paranormal, some simply mad—and the“persecution” he endured was the work of his own unconscious, rebelling againstthe abandonment of his real task. As he himself wrote, “In the great crises oflife, when existence itself is threatened, the soul attains transcendentpowers.”This is not to say that Strindberg’s alchemical experiences were worthless butrather that they were a distraction from his real work. I’m inclined to thinkStrindberg himself knew this. Without the artist’s hand to guide them,Strindberg’s “deranged sense impressions” became eerie, oppressive fantasiesaided, if not actually created, by a powerful intoxicant. “The Powers,” however,knew better, and the “unseen hand”—Strindberg’s own—showed him the error of hisways."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc8]The Inimitable Madame B. [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc8]New York’s East Side isn’t somewhere that we’d usually associate with the startof a new spiritual movement, but on September 13, 1875, that’s exactly what itwas. In a room cluttered with oriental bric-a-brac above an often dangerousneighborhood, three people came together on that day to form an occult societythat would have a profound influence, not only on modern spirituality andesotericism, but on practically the whole of modern culture. Two of the threewere men with distinguished careers behind them. William Quan Judge, an Irishimmigrant, had worked his way up from poor beginnings to become a lawyer and hadonly a few years earlier passed the New York Bar exam at the age of twenty-one.The forty-two-year-old Colonel Henry Steel Olcott was an officer in the CivilWar, a journalist, and an agriculturalist, and had been a member of thecommission that investigated Abraham Lincoln’s assassination.But it was the third, female member of this triumvirate that was the real centerof attraction. Even before landing on US soil, which she did in 1873, she hadlived a life packed with enough adventures to last several incarnations.Revolutionary, spiritualist, music teacher, cousin to a future Russian primeminister, Sergei Witte (a friend of the “Holy Devil,” Gregory Rasputin), andgranddaughter of a princess—to name only a few of her many distinctions—in acentury noted for larger than life characters, Olcott and Judge’s partner wasperhaps the most supersized of them all, both literally and metaphorically. I’msurprised no one has yet made a film of her life, although in today’s world ofanorexic supermodels, finding an actress willing to play a 232-pound leadinglady might be difficult.Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, the other occupant of that room, has beencalled many things, both during her lifetime and after it. For some she was an“explosive madcap.” For others, like the psychical researcher Richard Hodgson,she was “one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interesting impostors inhistory.” For the founder of Anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner, she was a “cheekycreature,” an “electrically-charged Leyden jar” who exhibited a “lack ofconsistency in external behaviour.” For the poet W. B. Yeats, who knew her inher last days in London, she was like an Irish peasant woman. For her earlybiographer John Symonds, she was “one of the most remarkable women who everlived,” yet her later biographer, Peter Washington, called her a “badly wrappedparcel.” And for the novelist Kurt Vonnegut, writing in McCall’s magazine in1970, she was “the Founding Mother of the Occult in America.”As with many complex, vital, and fascinating characters, all of theseassessments are in some ways true, yet all fail to grasp the full essence ofthis enormous personality. HPB, as she became known to her followers, was ascapacious an individual as possible. If, as the writer Henry Miller once said,we should “live life to the hilt,” she had certainly done that, and more. But onthat September day she embraced a destiny that would transcend even her ownfantastic life and, quite frankly, affect the world. Because it was then thatshe, Olcott, and Judge decided to found the Theosophical Society, arguably themost important spiritual and esoteric organization the West has ever known. Itis no exaggeration to say that if it weren’t for these three people, much ofwhat we know as modern spirituality, consciousness exploration, and alternativethought—not to mention our inexhaustible fascination with the wisdom of theEast—might not have arrived, or at least might have taken much longer to than itdid. By the time of Blavatsky’s death in 1891, the Theosophical movement hadspread from New York to India, Europe, and beyond. And by the early years of thetwentieth century, it was a force, as the saying goes, to be reckoned with,informing major developments in politics, art, religion, and much more. The poetT. S. Eliot, the artist Wassily Kandinsky, the inventor Thomas Edison, thecreator of Oz, L. Frank Baum, and Mohandas Gandhi were only some of the peoplewho over the years sat—figuratively or otherwise—at the incomparable Madame’sfeet.Helena Petrovna Blavatsky was born Helena von Hahn in 1831 in Ekaterinoslav, inwhat was then Russia and is now the Ukraine. Her mother, Helena Fadeyeva, was apopular novelist, writing under the pen name Zeneida Riva. Her father, Peter vonHahn, was a colonel and descended from a family of German nobility. Helena’ssister, Vera Zhelikhovksy, wrote children’s stories, as well as weird occultfiction, something HPB’s detractors say she did herself when pointing to hervast works of mystical philosophy, Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine. (Shedid, in fact, write some occult short stories.) When her mother died at the ageof twenty-eight, Helena was only eleven, and she was raised by her grandmotherin a cultured and spiritual milieu. This didn’t prevent her from becomingsomething of a tomboy, an irrepressible, mischievous spirit more at home in theforests and fields than with dolls, who nevertheless devoured the vast occultlibrary of her great-grandfather, the Freemason Prince Pavel Dolgorukov.Although it wasn’t until she had passed forty and had traveled around the worldthat HPB revealed the source of her wisdom, she claimed that from an early ageshe had had meetings with her “master,” Morya, a strange figure who appeared inher childhood dreams and whom she would later meet in the flesh in London’s HydePark and then again in Tibet. The master was one of a group of highly evolvedbeings who guided mankind in its development and whose emissary it was Helena’sdestiny to become. But that was sometime ahead, and before then she would takemore than one rollicking roller-coaster ride.When Helena was seventeen, she married a man more than twice her age, thevice-governor of Yerevan in Armenia, Nikifor Vladimirovich Blavatsky. Onemotivation seems to have been the belief that no one else would have her,although, until she gained weight in her later years, she was attractive,something that comes through in her portraits, and, in any case, her appearancewas always striking. The marriage was never consummated, and although they werenever divorced, Helena soon left Nikifor for the great unknown. It is thoughtBlavatsky remained celibate throughout her life—sex, she said, was “beastly”—andto counter later accusations of promiscuity (she was also rumored to be lesbianand a transvestite), she produced a doctor’s certificate establishing that afall from a horse during her time as a circus bareback rider had made itimpossible for her to have intercourse. The place, she said, was “filled up withsome crooked cucumber,” and she was frank enough to prove it. That flight fromher crestfallen husband was the start of her decade-long Wanderjahre, a journeyinto adventure that her contemporary Jules Verne would restrict to fiction. Foryoung Helena, it was everyday life.Between 1848, when she abandoned Nikifor, and 1858, when she briefly returned toRussia, HPB’s boot heels, as Bob Dylan sang, went wandering. Egypt, France,Canada, England, South America, Germany, Mexico, India, Greece, and Tibet weresome of the main stops on her journey. Her passport, if she had one, must havetaken a beating. Many of a mystical bent in the West have gone on prodigiousvoyages. In the sixteenth century, the travels of Paracelsus, the father ofWestern alternative medicine, were legendary, and in more recent times figureslike the enigmatic Greco-Armenian spiritual teacher G. I. Gurdjieff and the darkmagician Aleister Crowley trekked into more than one unusual place. ButBlavatsky was a woman, just out of her teens, and for a woman to travel alone atall in those days was unusual; for one to enter Tibet was unheard of. Even afterthe British expedition in 1903 led by Francis Younghusband, in which more than athousand Tibetans were slaughtered, for many years Tibet was off-limits to mostWesterners. HPB herself said she was turned away a few times before finallycrossing the threshold, an accomplishment echoed more than half a century laterin 1924 by another intrepid woman, the Belgian-French writer, explorer, andBuddhist Alexandra David-Néel.Blavatsky’s tenure in Tibet has always been contested; the controversy won’tstop here, but some of her other adventures suggest it was more than possible.In 1867 she was wounded while fighting with the Italian liberator GiuseppeGaribaldi against the papal army and the French at the battle of Mentana, asacrifice that led to a friendship with Giuseppe Mazzini, leader of therevolutionary movement Young Italy. And if that wasn’t enough to qualify as“living dangerously,” in 1871 she was one of the few survivors of the wreck ofthe Eumonia, a sea disaster as famous in its day as the Titanic. She washedashore in Cairo, and it’s believed she started her career as a spirit mediumthen, although she had exhibited psychic powers from the start. At any rate, itwas then that she started holding séances.From Cairo she went to France, and it was in Paris that the masters pointed herin the right direction. Go west, they said, so she sailed for New York. When shearrived in the summer of 1873 at the age of forty-two, she was penniless—she hadcrossed the Atlantic in steerage—and for a time lived in hostels and cheapboardinghouses, scratching out a living by sewing purses. But it wasn’t longbefore she showed her resourcefulness. Reading Colonel Olcott’s series ofarticles in the Daily Graphic about a haunting at a farm in Chittenden,Vermont—he had developed an interest in spiritualism while learning to farm inOhio—Blavatsky determined to meet him. Her decision to ensnare Olcott in manyways resembles Gurdjieff’s later decision to “entrap” his disciple Ouspensky,who was also a journalist; both “crazy gurus” seemed to need a respectable PRman devoted to the cause. When the robust Helena approached the cautious Olcottat the farm, it was a case of platonic love at first sight. The retiring,conventional colonel was smitten, as much by Helena’s fiery Garibaldi shirt (abright red blouse with military embroidery, a souvenir of the barricades) as byher chutzpah. (As one writer remarked, she was “capable of colourful andimaginative profanity,” another characteristic she shared with Gurdjieff.) Sheproceeded to dominate the séances, introducing her own crew ofspirits—appropriately Russian—and made it clear that a real contender hadarrived.Spiritualism had been a part of American culture since 1848, when the Foxsisters of Hydesville, New York, discovered they could communicate with thespirit of a dead man. By the time HPB appeared, it had even entered politics. In1872, Victoria Woodhull, another extraordinary nineteenth-century woman, had runfor president on a spiritualist-free love-feminist-socialist ticket; needless tosay, she didn’t win. But spiritualism was running out of steam, and whenBlavatsky and Olcott formed their occult alliance after Olcott received amessage from one of HPB’s masters advising him to leave his unsatisfactorymarriage and live with Helena, it was clear something new was wanted. Blavatskyherself had grown bored with table rapping and levitating tambourines. She couldeasily produce phenomena at will, and, unlike most psychics, was not a mere“medium” but had control of her “powers.” Nevertheless, her masters hadcounseled that she was being primed for something greater. She and the colonelagreed, and their first attempt was to found what they called the Miracle Club.When this didn’t produce the required miracle, they looked for something else.Part of that something else was Blavatsky’s massive tome, Isis Unveiled, afourteen-hundred-page epic of occult wisdom, which she started writing in 1875,with references nabbed from the astral plane. When it was published two yearslater, in 1877, it sold out its first printing overnight. Although some paperspanned the work—one reviewer called it “a dish of hash”—The New York Herald saidit was “one of the most remarkable productions of the century,” and The BostonEvening Transcript argued that its author had “read more, seen more, and thoughtmore than most wise men.” Its eager readers agreed. People today familiar withTheosophy’s better-known Eastern character may be surprised at the more Western,Egyptian esotericism that fills Isis Unveiled’s many pages. For a time in hercareer, Egypt, and not the Himalayas, was the focus of Blavatsky’s mysticyearnings, a popular spot, as the contemporaneous Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor,led by the mysterious Max Théon, showed. Blavatsky herself spoke of a mysterious“brotherhood of Luxor,” and Colonel Olcott received his mystic messages from acertain Tuitit Bey. These messages themselves were the first of a series of“precipitated” (i.e., materialized) letters for which HPB would soon becomefamous. Later epistles would fall from thin air and apprise HPB’s colleagues andskeptics of her masters’ wishes.It is impossible to summarize Isis Unveiled here, except to say it was one ofthe first works of occultism to argue that magic was not some mindlesssuperstition palmed off on the gullible, but a profound wisdom and science knownto the ancients, yet lost to modern materialism. It’s an idea still populartoday, as a look at the works of Graham Hancock and other authors that make muchthe same argument shows. For much of her theme, Blavatsky drew on the writingsof Éliphas Lévi and Edward Bulwer-Lytton, whose novel Zanoni weaves Rosicrucianand Hermetic motifs into a historical romance. She also quoted—or plagiarized,depending on your perspective—dozens of other authorities, from Plato and TheEgyptian Book of the Dead to Schopenhauer and Giordano Bruno. Whatever we maythink of Isis Unveiled, its historical importance is undeniable, as it containedthe first detailed critique of Darwin’s recently enshrined version of evolution.Samuel Butler—of Erewhon fame—published Life and Habit, the first of his severalvigorous attacks on Darwinian theory, in 1878, but Blavatsky beat him to it. Hercentral argument is that the transition from monkey to man is only part of themore significant evolution of men and women into gods, a transformation thatembraces the entire cosmos. As one writer remarked, instead of opposing religionto scientific fact, Blavatsky “subsumes those facts into a grand synthesis thatmakes religious wisdom not the enemy of scientific knowledge but its finalgoal.”At the same time as Blavatsky scoured the astral plane for quotable material, asuggestion at a lecture given at her apartment—nicknamed “the Lamasery” becauseof its exotic decor—triggered the second phase of that elusive “something else.”After hearing a talk about the “secret canon of proportions” the ancientEgyptians used to construct the pyramids (like spiritualism, pyramidology wasanother late nineteenth-century craze), Colonel Olcott had the brainstorm offorming a society that would study such things. HPB and the others presentagreed, and a week later she, Olcott, and Judge met again and the TheosophicalSociety was born. The name was not new. Theosophy, meaning the “wisdom of thegods,” had been used by Neoplatonic philosophers in the Alexandria of the thirdcentury AD, and also by the gnomic seventeenth-century Hermetic cobbler, JacobBoehme. With HPB and the colonel, however, it would take on a somewhat differentsense. The society’s mission statement set out its goals: to promote theuniversal brotherhood of humanity, regardless of race, creed, color, or sex; tostudy ancient and modern religions, philosophies, and sciences; and toinvestigate the unexplained phenomena of nature and the hidden powers in man.With its multifaith, multicultural emphasis, the Theosophical Societyanticipated our own pluralistic sensibility by more than a century. And, asmentioned, its belief in a lost, ancient wisdom is still going strong.Although the new society gathered some initial interest, later bolstered by thesuccess of Isis Unveiled and Olcott’s involvement in one of the earliestcremations in America, by the end of 1878, the “chums,” as Olcott and Blavatskycalled themselves, were running out of resources and seriously needed some newdirection. Perhaps the masters had tired of Luxor, or perhaps Egypt was by thistime old hat. Whatever it was, the needle on the Madame’s mystic compass beganto bypass the Sphinx and turn toward points east, and the chums shifted theirgaze toward India. Blavatsky had already introduced Eastern themes in the secondpart of Isis Unveiled, but a perhaps more encouraging motive was the invitationfrom Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, leader of a Hindu movement called Arya Samaj, tocome to India and unite their new society with his; an acquaintance of Olcott’shad told the swami about Theosophy, and he felt it was in tune with histeachings. Daniel Dunglas Home, the most successful medium of the age, had onlyrecently made some damaging remarks about the Madame, who, according to somereports, had been his assistant for a time, so perhaps a journey to the East wasin order. After selling most of their possessions to placate creditors, andfollowing the orders of the masters, who would soon be called Mahatmas, onDecember 17, 1878, the chums boarded ship for Bombay (today’s Mumbai).Blavatsky’s US citizenship had come through just a few months earlier, but shewould never see America again. Abner Doubleday, Civil War hero and purportedinventor of baseball, was left in charge of the New York branch, while Judgelater became head of the society in America.When the chums reached India in February 1879, the subcontinent was still inthrall to the British Raj, and the natives knew less about Hinduism and itsgreat works, like the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, than most New Age folk dotoday. Two cultured and famous Westerners who embraced the immortal wisdom ofthe East and rejected Christianity (which was busily being foisted on theHindus) were welcome, and soon HPB knew they had made the right choice. SwamiDayananda, however, grew to regret it, as Theosophy soon eclipsed the AryaSamaj, and the two went their separate ways. Blavatsky and Olcott’s magazine,The Theosophist, sold incredibly well, and many flocked to join the society.Even HPB’s powers seemed to have increased. Among other feats, she caused ashower of roses, made a lamp flame grow larger and smaller at will, materializedcups and saucers, and located a brooch lost years before by her hostess. Thesemiracles garnered much publicity, but Blavatsky herself thought themunimportant. She made a hefty social and political impact when she brought A. P.Sinnett, editor of the influential Allahabad Pioneer, into the fold. Sinnett’sbooks, The Occult World and Esoteric Buddhism, spread the teachings to a hugereadership, including a shy young Austrian scholar named Rudolf Steiner and anIrish poet named Yeats. Another catch was A. O. Home, a high-ranking civilservant who later organized the first Indian National Congress. Blavatsky’sHinduphilia and contempt for the British, who thought she was a Russian spy, setthe snowball rolling; and some years later, when her successor, the Fabiansuffragette Annie Besant, arrived on India’s shores, Theosophy was at the heartof the independence movement. Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru becameTheosophists and later praised the society for the immense good it did theirnation.For the first five years, India was an unqualified success for Theosophy. Olcottwas so successful in bringing Buddhism to Buddhists that in 1968, Sri Lanka—inOlcott’s day, Ceylon—issued a commemorative stamp in his honor, and the growingTheosophical ranks were a serious rival to imported Christianity.Yet it was Blavatsky’s own good nature that proved her undoing. Emma Coulombe, awoman she had befriended in Cairo, wrote to her from Ceylon, telling of hardtimes. Blavatsky invited her and her husband to keep house for her in Bombay.This proved disastrous. In 1884, Blavatsky left India to visit France andEngland. In London the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) suggested theyinvestigate her claims. Sensational reports of the “precipitated letters” fromher master—not Morya this time, but Koot Hoomi—had been in newspapers around theworld, and they were eager to verify their authenticity. But back in India EmmaCoulombe, peeved by some assumed slight, told the editor of a Christianmissionary magazine that the whole thing was faked. The Mahatma letters were“precipitated” by being slipped through cracks in the ceiling, and the figure ofKoot Hoomi—often seen by astounded visitors—was really Blavatsky, wearing amodel of the Mahatma on her shoulders. There was other chicanery as well, andremembering her scathing remarks about Christian missionaries, the ChristianCollege Magazine was only too happy to blow the whistle on the Madame.The scandal reached the SPR, and to this day it’s unclear if the evidence forfraud their investigator Richard Hodgson allegedly found was planted orauthentic. Either way, he issued a damning report, and HPB’s reputation sufferedbadly, although the SPR itself retracted his report a century later, saying itwas prejudiced and unreliable. Although she was not above hoodwinking whennecessary, it’s difficult to study Blavatsky’s life and not conclude she wasgenuine. She returned to India to defend her reputation, but to avoid beingdrawn into a legal battle that would inevitably turn into a show trial, she soonleft again, never to return.On the road again, Blavatsky found herself in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland.She finally roosted in England. She was by this time ill, suffering from kidneyfailure brought on by her weight and other stress. Contrary to much currentspiritual thought, HPB didn’t give a hoot for her health; her cholesterol levelswere scandalous and she chain-smoked incessantly. She may have known her dayswere numbered and so decided to write another monstrous tome, The SecretDoctrine, Theosophy’s bible. Even longer than Isis Unveiled, The Secret Doctrineexpounded a monumental synthesis of science, religion, and philosophy thatremains thrilling and controversial enough to fuel many a metaphysicaldiscussion, although, as one writer remarked, it is in many ways “a muddytorrent carrying all kinds of strange objects on its surface.” Blavatsky threwtogether a smorgasbord of occult and mystical teachings about humanity and thecosmos in a way that again precludes summary, speaking of the mysterious Book ofDzyan, written in the lost language of Senzar, and its profound revelationsabout human and cosmic evolution. The universe has been created and destroyedseveral times—an idea that science came to only much later—and we modern humansare only one of a series of races to inhabit the planet, our history going backto ancient Atlantis, Lemuria, and beyond. Reincarnation was a fundamental theme,and with it the eventual evolution of humanity into the divine.When the book appeared in 1888, it fed the ravenous hunger many Westerners feltfor some spiritual and religious meaning in a world increasingly seen to belittle more than an accident. Darwin had shown us to be merely “trousered apes”;and, in any case, the universe itself was rolling toward its “heat death,” aninescapable outcome of entropy, in which the innumerable galaxies would flattenout into a formless cosmic puddle like a lukewarm cup of coffee. Having given somuch ground to science that it had nothing to offer against these “facts,” thechurch had become little more than an empty shell. Blavatsky’s strange, exoticblend of hidden Mahatmas, supernatural powers, cosmic evolution, past lives,sunken continents, and prehistoric civilizations struck more than a chord in thefin de siècle mind; it offered a powerful counter-narrative to the doom andgloom that mainstream science served on tap. Many who rejected the church butrefused science’s cosmic inconsequence gravitated toward HPB and theTheosophical view. To this day both she and the Theosophical Society are yet toreceive the credit they are due for providing a vital alternative to the senseof purposelessness that characterized the last years of the nineteenth century.Blavatsky’s last days were spent in St. John’s Wood, London, where she waswheeled around in a kind of perambulator. She died on May 8, 1891, a daycelebrated in Theosophical communities as White Lotus Day. She was sixty and hadtaken the world by storm, and her last words are characteristically blunt:“Don’t let my last incarnation be a failure.” Chances are we will not see herlike again, but with her help, anyone today can remove the veil from Isis anddiscover where the secret wisdom can be found."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc9]Rudolf Steiner: The Dweller on the Threshold [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc9]The most enigmatic figure to emerge from the occult revival of the earlytwentieth century was also the most successful: the Austrian “spiritualscientist” Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925). Although many of his contemporaries wereoutwardly more eccentric—think of Madame Blavatsky, Gurdjieff, or AleisterCrowley—it’s precisely Steiner’s sobriety that is so striking, making him seemsomewhat out of place in the often flamboyant world of the esoteric.We generally associate ideas of the occult, higher consciousness, and spiritualworlds with exotic, extraordinary characters with something of the tricksterabout them; Blavatsky, Gurdjieff, and Crowley would certainly fall into thiscategory. Steiner was precisely the opposite. Standing at the lectern with hispince-nez in hand, he projected an image of irreproachable rectitude. Steinerwas earnestness incarnate, his one gesture of bohemian extravagance the flowingbow ties he was fond of wearing, a remnant of his early student days. WhereBlavatsky, Gurdjieff, and Crowley each took pains to present a formidableself-image, there was something simple and peasantlike about Steiner. Combinedwith this wholesomeness was an encyclopedic erudition. If we were to use anarchetype to describe Steiner, it would have to be that of “the Professor”—ormore precisely, “the Doctor,” as he was known by those around him. Commenting onher magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine, Madame Blavatsky once remarked that she“wrote, wrote, wrote” as the Wandering Jew “walks, walks, walks.” Steiner toowrote a great deal, but his main mode of disseminating his ideas was lecturing,and in the years between 1900 and 1925 he lectured, lectured, lectured,delivering more than six thousand talks across Europe.In a dry and often pedantic style, Steiner informed his audience of the resultsof his spiritual research, his “supersensible” readings of the occult history ofthe world made available to him through what is called the Akashic Record. Inmatter-of-fact terms, he introduced them to his teaching, Anthroposophy, tellingthem along the way about ancient Atlantis, life after death, astral and ethericbodies, the true meaning of Christianity, and much, much more. Yet this humble,self-effacing character became one of the most influential, and simultaneouslyvilified, forces in the spiritual and cultural life of early twentieth-centuryEurope, and his ideas are still relevant today. Steiner’s efforts to lead “theSpiritual in the human being to the Spiritual in the Universe” have producedremarkably concrete results. Since his death, more than a thousand schoolsaround the world work with Steiner’s pedagogical principles, not to mention themany special-needs schools working along lines developed by Steiner a centuryago. There are also the hundreds of biodynamic farms employing Steiner’sagricultural insights, developed decades in advance of our interest in ecologyand organic foods. The practical application of Steiner’s ideas had alsoinformed very successful avenues in holistic healing, the arts, architecture,economics, religion, and other areas.Given these achievements in the “real world,” which certainly exceed those ofother esoteric teachers, why isn’t Steiner better known? You would reasonablyexpect the average educated person to have some idea of who, say, Jung is, orKrishnamurti, or the Dalai Lama; possibly even Blavatsky, Gurdjieff, or Crowley.But Steiner? He remains something of a mystery, a name associated with a handfulof different disciplines and endeavors but not solidly linked to any one thing.He remains, as one of his most eloquent apologists, the British writer andthinker Owen Barfield, called him, “the best kept secret of the twentiethcentury.” It’s certainly time that he was better known.Rudolf Steiner was born on February 27, 1861, in the small rural town ofKraljevec in what was then Hungary but is today part of Croatia. His father wasa telegraph operator for the Southern Austrian Railway, and Steiner spent hisfirst years amidst magnificent scenery: mountain ranges and green plains werehis playgrounds. Steiner felt that it was significant that he grew up in a partof Europe where East meets West, as it was also significant that childhood hadan equal measure of natural beauty and modern technology—at the time, both therailways and the telegraph were relatively new innovations. In Knowledge of theHigher Worlds and Its Attainment (1905), Steiner relates that a crucialexperience on the path of higher consciousness is an encounter with the Guardianof the Threshold, a spiritual being embodying one’s unredeemed karma. Wellbefore his career as an esoteric teacher, Steiner was himself a dweller onseveral thresholds, having one foot in the mysteries of nature, the other in themethodology of science. It was this combination of mystic visionary anddisciplined thinker that gave Steiner’s later career its peculiar character.When Steiner was eight, his father was transferred to Neudörfl, near the borderwith lower Austria. An argument with the local teacher led his father to educatethe boy himself, and this meant that he spent a great deal of time on his own atthe railway station where his father worked. Young Steiner was deeplyintroverted; as he admits in his Autobiography (1925), he had great difficultyrelating to the outer world. He also had an inquisitive mind and was obsessedwith many questions the adults he knew seemed unable to answer. Thissubjectivity might have taken a morbid turn were it not for his discovery ofmathematics. When Steiner came upon a book of geometry, it was a revelation.“That one can work out forms which are seen purely inwardly, independent of theouter senses, gave me a feeling of deep contentment. I found consolation for theloneliness caused by the many unanswered questions. To be able to graspsomething purely spiritual brought me an inner joy. I know that through geometryI first experienced happiness.”Steiner’s joy upon discovering geometry may strike us as odd, yet the experiencewas essential in getting him through an early crisis. What impressed Steiner sogreatly about geometry was that it seemed to offer proof that within the mindthere existed a kind of “soul space,” an inner equivalent of the external spaceof the natural world. The soul space was “the setting for spiritual beings andevents.” Thoughts for the young Steiner were not “mere pictures we form ofthings”; they were rather the “revelations of a spiritual world seen on thestage of the soul.” Geometry, Steiner believed, although produced by the humanmind, had an objective reality independent of it, and for him this meant thatthe soul space in which it was revealed was also real. Rather precocious stuff,perhaps, but Steiner’s early years included an event that made him question theouter world’s monopoly on reality.One day at the railway station, he had a paranormal experience, an earlymanifestation of his psychic abilities. Sitting in the waiting room, he saw astrange woman enter; although he didn’t know her, he felt she resembled othermembers of his family. Standing in the middle of the room, the woman spoke tothe boy. “Try to help me as much as you can—now as well as in later life,” shesaid. Then she walked into the stove and disappeared. Steiner decided not totell his parents, afraid that they would scold him for lying. But he noticedthat his father was sad, and he later discovered that a female relative wholived in the neighboring town had committed suicide at the same time that he hadhad his vision. Although he doesn’t mention this episode in his Autobiography,in a lecture given in Berlin in 1913 Steiner spoke of the experience. Speakingin the third person, he told his audience: “From that time onward a soul-lifebegan to develop in the boy, which made him entirely conscious of worlds fromwhich not only external trees or mountain speak to the human soul, but also theBeings who live behind them.” This early experience marked for Steiner thebeginning of a lifelong involvement with the dead. Much of his later esotericteaching involves accounts of the soul’s experiences in the afterlife and of themachinery of karma and reincarnation, the balancing of the spiritual books thatcasts the departed back into the stream of life in order to complete theirtasks. While other boys of his age were fantasizing about the Austrianequivalent of cowboys and Indians, Steiner was preoccupied with the reality ofthe spirit worlds and the soul’s encounter with the beings that inhabit them.Later, as a young man, Steiner would on two occasions have unusual opportunitiesto verify some of his ideas about the meaning of death. Twice he would come intointimate contact with families in which the father was a recluse who would diesoon after Steiner made their acquaintance. Yet on both occasions, althoughnever actually meeting the man, Steiner formed a profound intuitive relationwith the deceased, so deep and insightful in fact that he was asked by bothfamilies to give the funeral orations. Later still, during his years as anesoteric teacher, Steiner informed his followers that one means of helping thedead in their spiritual journeys was to read to them from his writings.When Steiner was eighteen, his father was transferred once again, this time toInzersdorf. His new location had the advantage of being close to Vienna, and itwas decided that Steiner would study at the technical school there. Although hehad leanings toward literature and philosophy, he chose instead to work towardbecoming a science teacher. One day on the train to Vienna, he met a man whowould have a profound influence on his life. Felix Koguzki was an herb gathererwho traveled to Vienna regularly to sell his wares. It’s not known how they fellinto conversation, but the teenaged Steiner soon discovered that this simple,uneducated man had strange experiences like his own, and a deep, personalknowledge of the other worlds. Koguzki was the first person with whom he couldspeak about his spiritual visions, and their talks boosted Steiner’s confidence;more than likely, they also convinced him that he wasn’t crazy.Around the same time, Steiner had an encounter with another individual whosename has not come down to us. Steiner refers to him only as “the Master.” TheFrench writer Edouard Schuré, author of the bestselling Great Initiates (1889)and later a friend and follower of Steiner, remarked that the Master was “one ofthose potent personalities who are on Earth to fulfil a mission under the maskof some homely occupation.” Steiner had by this time read widely in philosophy,specifically the German Idealists, and had worked his way through Hegel,Schelling, and several others, absorbing Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason duringhis history class, which bored him. Steiner was obsessed, then and later, withrefuting scientific materialism, and this became the impulse that drove hisphilosophical studies. What little we know of the Master is that he pointed outsome passages in the work of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, one of Kant’s mostimportant followers, which helped Steiner in his quest. Fichte’s work focused onthe centrality of the human ego, the “I,” the locus of consciousness and theself that scientific materialism argued was mere illusion. Steiner’s spiritualexperiences convinced him that this was palpably false and the “I,” rather thanbeing an illusion, was a concrete, irreducible reality. For the next twentyyears, until Steiner’s reinvention as a spiritual leader, his work would focuson developing a methodical epistemology proving this fact.The single most important influence on his ideas, however, was the work ofJohann Wolfgang von Goethe. Goethe is best known for his drama Faust(1808–1832), which takes a cautionary tale about a pact with the Devil andtransforms it into an archetype of Western consciousness. Although he’s neverenjoyed the same reputation among English speakers, Goethe is one of theOlympians of Western literature, sharing the top shelf with Plato, Dante, andShakespeare (Jung too thought Goethe a key figure, even to the extent ofsometimes believing that he, Jung, was an illegitimate descendent of the greatman.) Often regarded as the last true Renaissance man, Goethe was not just agiant of literature but also a statesman, traveler, and, most important forSteiner, a scientist, making important contributions to botany, anatomy,mineralogy, and optics. Through his literature tutor Karl Schröer, who openedhis mind to Goethe’s importance, Steiner was offered what must have seemed thechance of a lifetime. At twenty-two, he was headhunted as the editor of Goethe’sscientific writings for a major edition of the polymath’s work.For an unknown rural scholar to be offered such a position might seem unusual,but the general consensus on Goethe’s scientific musings at this point was thatthey were useless as science and dreary as literature; in truth, no one elsewanted the job of editing them. Aside from his early success in proving that thehuman upper jaw contained the intermaxillary bone found in other mammals—Goethewas, in a different way, an evolutionist long before Darwin—most scientistsfound Goethe’s attempts to disprove Newton’s theory of color, or to demonstratethe existence of what he called the Urpflanze, the archetypal plant from whichothers emerged, muddleheaded if not insane. Yet for Steiner, Goethe science wasthe prototype for what would become his own phenomenology of the spirit worlds.Instead of the conventional scientist’s cold, dispassionate eye regarding theworld as mere matter, passive to his intrusions, Goethe called instead for“objective imagination,” an active participation in the reality under scrutiny.The subjectivity of the scientist—his state of consciousness—was vastly moreimportant than the increasingly hair-splitting exactitude provided by hisinstruments. This “objective imagination” became for Steiner the basis for hisown “supersensible cognition.”Steiner’s work on Goethe opened many doors. One led to Weimar, Goethe’s city,where he was asked to work on the Goethe Archive, another prestigious task.Although Steiner found few congenial colleagues, the work had othercompensations. He was introduced to the city’s literary and cultural life andmade many acquaintances. One in particular led to a momentous meeting. ElizabethForster Nietzsche, sister of the ill-fated philosopher, approached Steiner towork with her in establishing a Nietzsche archive. This led to Elizabethintroducing Steiner to her brother, who had been insane from syphilis forseveral years. Elizabeth had taken to dressing the defenseless Friedrich in atoga and positioning him by the window, where his blank stare and unkemptappearance provided the impression of a great prophet. Steiner, aware ofNietzsche’s madness, was nevertheless impressed—not with the figure before him,but with its spiritual aura. He saw Nietzsche’s soul “hovering over his head,infinitely beautiful in its spiritual sight.” It was a soul that “brought fromformer lives on Earth golden riches of great spirituality.”If mention of Nietzsche’s soul brimming with “golden riches of greatspirituality” suggests to readers familiar with the author of Beyond Good andEvil and The Antichrist that Steiner was as ignorant of Nietzsche’s philosophyas his sister Elizabeth notoriously was, they should have a look at Steiner’sbook Friedrich Nietzsche: Fighter for Freedom (1895), a remarkably perceptivestudy that at times even reads like Nietzsche. Throughout his career, Steinerhad an uncanny knack for entering into and defending the ideas of thinkers withwhom he had profound disagreements, like the staunch materialist Ernst Haeckel—acritical sympathy that often led to much misunderstanding.When his work at Weimar was ending, rather than embark on an academic career(Steiner had received his doctorate in philosophy during his stay and couldeasily have found a comfortable niche somewhere), he decided instead to move toBerlin, home of Germany’s nascent avantgarde. He had by this time published whatmany believe to be his most important book, The Philosophy of Freedom (1894), anexhilarating if often difficult work of epistemology that Steiner believedestablished beyond doubt the reality of the human “I.” Others, like theinfluential philosopher Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, author of the onceimmensely popular Philosophy of the Unconscious, were less convinced andsuggested he had muddled the question. Steiner, however, was undaunted andbelieved he had a mission to disseminate his ideas. He also needed to find work.Although his followers tend to see Steiner’s life as the undeviating unfoldingof a preordained destiny—and Steiner himself, we must admit, contributes to thisbelief—like the rest of us, he was looking for his place in the world and themeans to get on in it. He was also filled (rightly) with the conviction of hisown genius. The literary and cultural world of Berlin might offer opportunitiesnot available elsewhere.Steiner, however, made the thoroughly impractical decision of buying a moribundperiodical, The Magazine for Literature. His previous brief catastrophicexperience in Vienna as an editor of a political magazine seemingly forgotten,Steiner proceeded to run the already failing Magazine for Literature into theground, alienating its readers with his persistent exhortations regarding thespiritual life. In the age of Strindberg, Wilde, Ibsen, Wedekind, and Shaw,Steiner’s Idealism seemed a stale leftover from a forgotten time.Yet, although he bemoaned the burden destiny had placed on him, Steiner seems tohave enjoyed hobnobbing with bohemians: his acquaintances included poets,playwrights, novelists, and political activists. In fact, his reputation amongthe demimonde caused academics to cancel their subscriptions, and Steiner earnedthe unique distinction of being the one esoteric teacher (as far as I know) tohave a periodical banned in tsarist Russia because its editor was known tosocialize with anarchists. It was also in Berlin that Steiner married his firstwife, although one gets the impression that his relationship with Anna Eunickewas little more than platonic. Anna had been Steiner’s landlady in Weimar, andwhen he moved to Berlin she followed him. There he moved in with her again and,almost as an afterthought, married her in 1899 in a civil ceremony. (It was inthe Eunicke household in Weimar that Steiner had had one of his experiences withthe death of a reclusive father.) Anna, not particularly well-educated orcultured, was apparently very happy to have Herr Doctor Steiner under her roof;Steiner, for his part, thus avoided the “misery of living alone,” as well asthat of the cheap lodgings and bad food he had endured up till then. Anna wasten years older than Rudolf, and their relationship raises the question ofSteiner’s sexuality, of which there is no mention in the entire 406 pages of hisAutobiography. I do have it on the authority of one Steiner scholar, ChristopherBamford, that the Doctor was indeed celibate.But it was in Berlin that Steiner’s real career began. For a time he seemedwilling to speak to any group who would listen to him. He lectured on historyand other subjects at the Workingman’s College, surreptitiously slipping largedoses of Idealism to budding Marxist materialists. He also lectured to theGiordano Bruno Society and The Coming Day, a quasi-Nietzschean cultural group.He managed, however, to alienate all of these organizations (as well as AnnaEunicke, whom he soon left) when he accepted a request to lecture to the BerlinTheosophical Society. For years, Steiner had tried to express his insights intothe spiritual worlds under the cover of philosophy. Now, at the turn of thecentury and the age of forty, he decided to forgo the camouflage and speakdirectly of his experiences.Steiner quickly rose to prominence among the Theosophists and was soon made headof the society’s branch. One member of his audience was particularly struck.Marie von Sivers, who became Steiner’s second wife in 1914, was a Baltic Russianactress. She asked if it weren’t time for a new spiritual movement to arise inEurope. More to the point, didn’t Steiner think he should lead it? Steiner did,but he insisted that any such movement would be firmly based on Western esotericsources. Steiner had recently passed through a spiritual crisis, which convincedhim that the “Christ event” was the single most important incident in humanhistory. He had no time for Eastern wisdom or mystic Mahatmas. He then more orless adopted the cosmic evolutionary framework of Madame Blavatsky’s SecretDoctrine and informed it with large helpings of German Idealist philosophy andChristian mysticism, developing a peculiarly idiosyncratic neo-Rosicruciansystem of esoteric thought, aided by his own readings of the Akashic Record. Inlight of this, it’s difficult to ignore the occult historian James Webb’s remarkthat Steiner joined the Theosophical Society in order to take it over.His relationship to the society was rocky, and in 1913 he and its head, theex-Fabian Annie Besant, came to rhetorical blows over C. W. Leadbeater’sadvocacy of the Indian boy Jiddu Krishnamurti as the second coming of Christ.Steiner was disgusted at the idea, and even more so at Leadbeater’s knownpedophilic predilections. He demanded Besant’s resignation; she retaliated byexcommunicating him. Steiner left with much of his flock—by this time severalthousand—and started his own group, the Anthroposophical Society. As opposed toTheosophy, which spoke of the wisdom of the gods, Anthroposophy was concernedwith the wisdom of the human being.Practically the first thing Steiner did was to build a temple for his newmovement. Land was secured in Dornach, Switzerland, and during World War ISteiner gathered a community of followers from several different countries toconstruct the Goetheanum, a weirdly beautiful fusion of art nouveau andexpressionist architecture that Steiner himself designed. His lecturing wascurtailed by the fighting, but his greatest popularity came with the war’s end.Steiner’s plan to reconstruct Europe, The Threefold Commonwealth (1922), soldsome eighty thousand copies in its first edition, and audiences for his publicappearances were now in the thousands; on one occasion the crowds outside aBerlin auditorium were so great they stopped traffic. This period, however, alsosaw the start of the anti-Steiner campaign that would plague him henceforth.Practically everybody hated him: Catholics, Protestants, Marxists, andproto-Nazis, not to mention other esotericists. There were at least two attemptson his life, and the number of occult attacks fomented by the “blackbrotherhoods” is unknown. One clear victory from this time was the establishmentof the first Steiner school in Stuttgart in 1919—the first of what became knownas Waldorf schools. Based on pedagogical principles developed over decades oftutoring—in Vienna he had cured a retarded hydrocephalic boy to the extent thatthe child grew up to earn a medical degree—Steiner’s educational ideas earnedhim deserved renown and an international reputation among experts that continuestoday.Steiner endured vilification in the press and disruption at his lectures withequanimity, but one victim of the attacks was, many believe, the Goetheanum,which burned to the ground on New Year’s Eve 1922. Arson by right-wingproto-Nazis is the common assumption, although an electrical fault remains apossibility. In any case, a decade’s effort, not to mention an architecturalwonder, was lost overnight: the building was made of the same wood as that usedin making violins and burned fiercely. Steiner took the tragedy as a sign thatsome changes in the Anthroposophical Society were necessary. His original occultteachings, based on the idea of an evolution of consciousness and the ability toachieve “supersensible thinking,” were, he felt, obscured by the success ofsubsequent initiatives. Steiner education, the Christian Community (a religiousgroup using Steiner’s ideas), the Threefold Movement for social change,eurythmy—a form of what he called “visible speech”—and newer developments likebiodynamic farming and Anthroposophical medicine were taking center stage.Steiner had attracted many younger followers after the war eager to rebuildsociety, and these clashed with his older, more esoterically inclined devotees.Bickering within the Anthroposophical Society, whose numbers had swollen in thepostwar years, threatened to undo much that had been achieved. On the firstanniversary of the Goetheanum’s destruction, Steiner announced plans for asecond temple; it stands today in Dornach, defiantly made of concrete. He alsotold his followers that he was reconstructing the society as well. Although hehad not previously even been a member of the society, remaining only itsspiritual guide and adviser, he now declared himself president of the newlyformed General Anthroposophical Society, which, although most successful inGermany, today has branches around the world.Steiner’s last years were spent in sowing as many seeds as possible for futurework; they were also darkened by his belief in a coming world conflagration,when the archangel Michael, overseer of the current stage of humanconsciousness, would face off against the power of Ahriman, a spiritual beingwho seeks to prevent humanity’s development. Steiner spoke ominously of theincarnation of Ahriman, an Antichrist-like figure whose display of miraculouspowers would precede a catastrophic “war of all against all.” Steiner believedthis unavoidable destiny would take some time to unfold—Ahriman is scheduled toarrive in the 3000s—but many of his followers suspect that in recent years theprocess has been speeded up. Steiner himself had grave doubts about the growingpace of technological development, warning his followers that materialistscience gains its great power through unwittingly releasing Ahrimanic entities.In his last communications, Steiner called on his followers to develop theirconsciousness in order to rise above nature to the same extent that technologysank below it. He also gave a series of lectures about karma and its work inhuman history.Steiner died on March 30, 1925. He had been ill for at least a year with anundisclosed stomach ailment, although there is some speculation that he had beenpoisoned. He continued lecturing until it was physically impossible for him todo so, and his followers were astounded when, on the evening of his lastscheduled lecture, they found a note saying that it had to be canceled becauseof the Doctor’s health. Nothing like this had ever happened before. The Doctor,they believed, was invulnerable. The exact nature of Steiner’s illness remainsunknown, but it is clear that his inability to refuse help to those who came tohim was a key factor. Along with his public and private lectures and hispractical work as a teacher, architect, and agriculturalist, Steiner madehimself available to any who needed his counsel. For many years, he hadpractically no free time; and, wherever he went, his hotel room saw a constantstream of visitors including, on one occasion, Franz Kafka. Some asked abouttheir astral bodies, others their diet or their marriages; Kafka asked about hiswriting. Steiner advised them all, giving little bits of himself to thousands.He was, as the Russian novelist Andrei Biely, a follower, once remarked, “agiant of the power of kindness.” It is not hard to see how such solicitude wouldeventually wear anyone down.In the end, it’s difficult to give an exact assessment of a man whose workcombines cogent criticisms of Kant with accounts of life in Atlantis. But this“mild, gentle, good, kindly man,” whose achievement in “humanitarian terms isremarkable and enduring”—as the psychiatrist Anthony Storr wrote of Steiner inhis study of gurus, Feet of Clay—remains, for devotees and non-initiates alike,something of an enigma."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHT [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc10]Manly Palmer Hall: The Secret Teacher [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc10]You may not recognize the name, but Manly Palmer Hall (1901–1990) was one of thetwentieth century’s most prolific popularizers of all things mystical, esoteric,and occult. Along with writing more than fifty books on everything fromastrology to the afterlife, for more than half a century Hall was the leadinglight behind the Philosophical Research Society, a spiritual organizationdevoted to promoting “ancient philosophy,” whose fantastic Egyptian-Mayan styledheadquarters still stands on Los Feliz Boulevard at the foot of the HollywoodHills in Los Angeles. Here Hall lectured weekly to packed houses on dozens ofarcane topics and maintained a unique collection of mystical objets d’art, famedamong cognoscenti, and a library of rare alchemical and magical texts thatattracted luminaries like C. G. Jung and Aldous Huxley. With his suave,leading-man looks, cultured manner, and rhetorical flare, Hall was a persuasiveand inspiring speaker, and his influence and following spanned generations. Overthe years, Hall’s devotees included actors and actresses such as Bela Lugosi,Glenn Ford, Burl Ives, and Gloria Swanson; Hollywood bigwigs such as SidGrauman, Cecil B. DeMille, and Samuel Goldwyn; politicians such as Harry S.Truman; scientists such as Luther Burbank; and other notables such as ElvisPresley, Sirhan Sirhan (Robert F. Kennedy’s assassin), and the Apollo 14moonwalker Edgar Mitchell.Less known today than he was in the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s, Hall made his name in1928 with the publication of his encyclopedic Secret Teachings of All Ages, aremarkable compendium of Hermetic, Kabbalistic, Masonic, Rosicrucian, andgenerally obscure lore, which remains a treasure trove for researchers into allforms of arcana and still sells thousands of copies a year. The year 2008 markedthe eightieth anniversary of the publication of this important work, but it alsomarked the release of the first biography of Hall, Master of the Mysteries: TheLife of Manly Palmer Hall by Louis Sahagun. The coincidence—if that’s what itis—of Sahagun’s book appearing on the anniversary of Hall’s masterwork seemssignificant enough to prompt a look at the strange life and even stranger deathof one of California’s most long-lived gurus.Hall’s career as a mystic sage began in 1919, when he came to California to bereunited with his mother. Both parents had abandoned their son at an earlyage—Hall never knew his father—and although he was born in Canada, Hall’s earlymanhood has all the hallmarks of an archetypal American success story. He led aperipatetic childhood with his eccentric maternal grandmother, living in hotelrooms and train compartments, and was set for a career on Wall Street when hersudden death freed him from this path. Quitting his clerk’s job, theeighteen-year-old left New York City; days later he exited the train in LosAngeles and headed for his mother’s house in the sleepy Pacific coast communityof Santa Monica. According to his biographer, Hall seemed to have had few hardfeelings toward the mother who abandoned him, or at least he didn’t mentionthem. Throughout his life Hall avoided confrontation with those close to him,preferring to acquiesce to their demands rather than risk an argument.The California that Hall discovered was rife with “spirituality” and what wewould call “New Age consciousness.” In the early twentieth century,Theosophists, Freemasons, Vedantists, and Rosicrucians of varying authenticityprospered in the warm California sun. As one historian of new religiousmovements put it, “Hollywood is built on occult foundations.” The fact that SidGrauman, responsible for such Hollywood landmarks as Grauman’s Chinese Theatre,the El Capitan, and the very Hermetic Egyptian Theatre was, with Hall, a staunchFreemason, suggests this isn’t an exaggeration. Young Manly haunted theamusement arcades on Santa Monica’s beachfront, and one day was attracted by asign advertising phrenology, the discipline that reads human psychology throughthe shape and contours of the skull. Intrigued by the diagrams of the brain andthe anatomical charts he saw through the shop window, Hall went inside and askedthe proprietor, Sydney J. Brownson, a Civil War veteran in his seventies, if hewould like to “read his bumps.” Brownson explained that phrenologists “makecalculations by measuring the radial length of brain fibers from the pons of themedulla oblongata.” Impressed, Hall listened as Brownson explained aboutmagnetism, reincarnation, the aura, the wisdom of the ancients, the mysteries ofIndia and the East, and the secret teachings of the church. Brownson quicklybecame Hall’s guru, and his young student was entranced, eager to learneverything he could from the master.Hall proved an excellent pupil, with a photographic memory and a talent forspeaking, and a year later Brownson invited him to speak to a select audiencewho met weekly in a room above a bank. Hall was a success, his lecture onreincarnation dazzling the handful of elderly women who attended and rewardedthe two with an offering of sixty-five cents, which the men quickly spent onchocolate sundaes. Thus Hall, who was an impressive six feet, four inches tall,began two activities that would last his lifetime: getting paid for speaking andindulging in sweets. Throughout his career, Hall maintained a secret lifededicated to binge-eating doughnuts; in later years, as he shunned exercise, hisbody grew to gargantuan proportions. The core message of his life’s work, too,appeared at this time. For the next seventy years, in a variety of ways, Halltold his audiences that the universe was the creation of an invisible, livingintelligence, and that in the remote past this truth had been hidden in themyths, symbols, and rituals of ancient societies. It was our task in the modernworld to rediscover this secret and to benefit by it. It was a message that, indifferent ways, would be repeated by many others over the years.Hall was so impressive a speaker that he was invited to address an audience atthe Church of the People, one of Hollywood’s most popular progressive religiousforums. The lectures, held at the Blanchard Hall Building in downtown LA, werefollowed by lunch at Clifton’s Cafeteria, a site later famous as the wateringhole of the Los Angeles Fantasy and Science Fiction Society, whose membersincluded L. Ron Hubbard, Robert Heinlein, and the Crowleyite rocket scientist,Jack Parsons. Hall became the church’s main speaker, charging a dollaradmission, an extravagant fee at the time. He also became the church’s pastorand at nineteen was counseling men and women three times his age on thedifficulties of life, becoming a “one stop source of an astonishing range ofeclectic spiritual material.”But Hall wasn’t alone; in a Hollywood filled with savants and swamis, hecompeted with other mystic seers. There were, for example, Princess Zoraida,“The Greatest Living Egyptian”; Pneumandros, “the Spirit Man”; Edwin J. Dwingle,founder of “Mentalphysics”; and the pyramidologist, “Professor” J. W. Parker,who claimed that the Great Pyramid of Egypt was “the Bible in stone.” As today,when repackaged “secrets” of “mental science” top bestseller lists—witness theunsurprising success of The Secret—Hall’s contemporaries blended mystic hokumwith a get-rich-quick sensibility. But Hall wanted to be known as a philosopherand thinker, not merely a self-help huckster. He produced a series of pamphletsand newsletters like The All-Seeing Eye, spelling out his ideas on the spiritualand cultural future of America. His message reached important readers, some ofwhom made substantial financial contributions to his cause. One result was atrip around the world in order to study its sacred sites. Another was The SecretTeachings of All Ages, which Hall claimed was seven years in the making.Described by Sahagun as a “gorgeous, dreamlike book of mysterious symbols,concise essays and colorful renderings of mythical beasts…and angelic beings,”it appeared when Hall was just twenty-seven, and it made him nationally famous.It was an impressive tome. Weighing fourteen and a half pounds, between itsthirteen-by nineteen-inch covers the reader found fifty-four original full colorplates and two hundred black-and-white illustrations, and its double-columnedfine font pages contained articulate essays drawing on more than six hundredsources. Seductively browsable, it remains a thrilling if not always reliablesourcebook on practically every aspect of the Western esoteric tradition.Selling at a hundred dollars a copy, its first two editions of eleven hundredcopies sold out in advance, and further editions did equally well. For decadesit was available only in its unwieldy “biblical” format—at the PRS Librarytoday, a visitor’s copy sits on an impressive lectern, and it’s difficult toavoid thinking of the Ten Commandments. In recent years, however, areader-friendly paperback has introduced the work to a new generation ofseekers.Hall’s success made him a target for female Hollywood hopefuls wishing to sharehis mystic spotlight, if not his bed; for years Hall had promoted celibacy, andthe tacit assumption was that any liaison with him would be sexless. But hissudden celebrity changed his mind, and it became known that Hall was looking fora real wife. While he could have had his choice of society women, in 1930 Hallmarried his secretary, Fay B. Ravenne, an attractive brunette astrologer fromTexas. But the marriage soon proved difficult. Fay was subject to severalillnesses—their exact nature is unknown—and she resented her husband’s growingfame and success. In their decade together Hall’s public star rose. WarnerBrothers pumped him for film ideas, his library and art collection grew, and hetraveled widely, befriending important people like the explorer Sir FrancisYounghusband, the artist-mystic Nicholas Roerich, the mystical adventure writerTalbot Mundy, and the escape artist Harry Houdini. In 1934, he purchased a plotof land in Hollywood’s Los Feliz district, near Griffith Park; here he plannedto build the headquarters for his newly founded Philosophical Research Society,designing the “temple” in a fantastic “Atlantean” style. Troubled by fraudsterswho preyed on naïve seekers, the public-spirited Hall received death threatsafter exposing a quasi-fascist self-help organization called Mankind United. Yethis home life (in a house built by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright) wasdisastrous. Hall suffered from numerous ailments, his relentless overeating hisonly relief from the misery of married life. Fay retreated deeper intodepression; then, in 1941, she committed suicide, gassing herself in her car.Hall was devastated, but after a short period of mourning, he purged all recordof Fay from his files, never mentioned her again, and got on with his career.By 1944, America was at war, and Hall responded with patriotic fervor, his bookThe Secret Destiny of America promoting an esoteric version of Manifest Destinythat Bush-era theo-cons would have loved (one wonders if Hall was on theirreading lists). Hall argued that the “seeds of democracy” had been planted onAmerican soil millennia before the Christian era and that this “plan of theancients” had been preserved through the centuries by secret societies, “pledgedto condition America to its destiny for leadership in a free world.” True ornot, it was good propaganda in wartime, but one of Hall’s readers took his ideaand ran with it. In fact, she had already been running with it for some time.Marie Bauer, a petite German immigrant and mother of two, scoured Hall’swritings and haunted his library, searching for confirmation of her ownmystical-political insight. She was convinced that Sir Francis Bacon (who reallywas a Rosicrucian) had traveled to America, and while there had buried a vaultbeneath a church tower in Williamsburg, Virginia. In the vault were, Marieclaimed, a fortune in gold, several unknown works of Shakespeare that proved hewas really Bacon (Hall, too, accepted this idea), a plan to end war, and thelocation of similarly hidden vaults. God, Marie believed, had chosen her touncover the vault; if she didn’t, humanity was doomed. Her passion provedpowerful enough to convince the proper authorities, and in the fall of 1938,Marie and her crew dug deep beneath Williamsburg’s Bruton Parish EpiscopalChurch. Predictably, they found nothing; at least unbiased witnesses said theexcavation was a failure. Marie thought otherwise and carried on, writingseveral books about the “Bruton vault” and its part in the coming “UnitedBrotherhood of Earth.” She did, however, give thought to her family, who wereincreasingly troubled by her bizarre behavior and her obsession with Hall, whosework, she believed, was of immense importance to her life purpose. The only fairthing to do, she concluded, was to get a divorce and abandon her children. Afterthat, the next step was obvious. In December 1950, Hall and Marie were married.Her obsession with Bacon’s vaults continued for the rest of her life, and at onepoint she was investigated by the FBI after she doggedly pestered everygovernment agency she could think of to support her mission. This, along withher frequent hallucinations, fits of violence, and grandiose claims—at one pointshe bragged that she had mastered a means of controlling atomic energy—suggestthat Marie was at least occasionally psychotic. Hall, it seems, tended toattract disturbed women.By the 1950s, America’s destiny as the protector and promoter of world democracyseemed secure, and an affluent society began to focus on other issues. Frommystical insights into world politics, Hall’s concern, and that of his audience,passed to health. Hall’s own had always been shaky, and as other popularself-help programs like Dianetics promised miraculous results, Hall investigateda few eccentric approaches to alternative health. One was the work of theHungarian émigré Edmond Bordeaux Szekely, cofounder of the InternationalBiogenic Society, which was then operating out of Tecate, in Baja California.Szekely claimed to have a PhD from the University of Paris, to be fluent in tenlanguages, and to have developed a regime that promised “wholesome, meaningful,and spiritual fulfilment” through “nutrition, meditation, and self-analysis.”Szekely based his ideas on a book he claimed to have translated from an Aramaictext, discovered in a secret archive in the Vatican. In his Essene Gospel ofPeace (1936), Jesus apparently urges his followers to cleanse their “hinderparts” with an “angel of water,” a kind of first-century colonics tool made froma gourd. Other of Szekely’s works have an equal focus on the spiritual virtuesof enemas. He also marketed a “biogenic battery” made of bound leaves of grass,which was to be brushed over the genitals. Whether this too was endorsed byJesus is unclear.Needless to say, the Aramaic text kept hidden by the Vatican existed only inSzekely’s imagination, but the idea of being cleansed by an “angel of water”appealed to Hall, as did the regime of a strict fruit juice diet. In his lastdays, an updated “angel of water” was cleansing Hall twice daily, and itsministrations very likely contributed to his death in 1990, according to hisfamily physician. By this time, however, Hall had come under the influence of an“alternative health expert” who hoped to capitalize on Szekely’s dubious claims.The 1960s and early ’70s were a low point for Hall. Although the impressiveheadquarters, library, and lecture hall of the PRS was finally completed in1959, and Hall, keeping his nose to the wind, augmented his discourses onancient philosophy with insights into UFOs, by the mid-’60s it was clear thathis rather conservative values were out of step with the Swinging Decade. Hisdiatribes against the modern world, rock music, free love, hedonism, and drugsseemed the whining of a grumpy senior citizen, and indeed by this time Hallhimself was in his sixties. Yet even in the threatening world of rock ’n’ roll,Hall had followers. According to Larry Geller, Elvis’s spiritual advisor in the’60s, the King once sent Priscilla to one of Hall’s lectures so that she mightdevelop an interest in the esoteric. Geller also claims that in the early ’70she bought a new deluxe edition of the Secret Teachings for Elvis at the PRSbookshop. When Hall overheard whom the copy was for, he signed it. Elvisreportedly asked Geller to tell “Mr. Hall how much I appreciate this.”By the late ’70s, when I heard Hall speak at more than one of his Sunday morninglectures, the PRS had gained a new lease on life, rejuvenated by the burgeoningNew Age movement and the new speakers its excellent facilities attracted.Stephan Hoeller, another Hungarian émigré and bishop of the Ecclesia Gnostica, aGnostic church in Hollywood; Huston Smith, the MIT professor of religion andphilosophy; Stanley Krippner, professor of psychology at the Saybrook Institutein San Francisco; the psychologist Bruno Bettelheim; Edgar Mitchell; and WillisHarman, of the Institute of Noetic Sciences, all became familiar speakers andfellow travelers of Hall’s society. Others, like the “psychic archaeologist”Stephan Schwartz, also became closely involved with Hall.While the new interest in metaphysics, spirituality, and a more holistic sciencefound a welcome forum at the PRS, its own politics were in disarray. Itsfinances were a shambles, its files disorderly, maintenance minimal, securitypractically nonexistent. Hall’s copyrights had lapsed, his priceless librarywasn’t even insured, and the building itself needed extensive repairs. The agingHall had difficulty delegating authority and obliged assistants to facilitatehis binges on sweets. Marie fluctuated between dictatorialness and evidentdementia. And her imprudent boasts about the combined value of the PRS’s andHall’s considerable assets attracted precisely the kind of spiritual con men hehad battled in years gone by.One of these was “Dr.” Daniel Fritz, a 1980s adherent of Edmond Szekely’scolonic philosophy. Among other beliefs, “Dr.” Fritz—he had no real medicalqualifications—claimed that giving birth near dolphins would ensure a highlyevolved child. That many of the women taken in by this idea sued him afterattending his clinic in Hawaii suggests just how feasible this practice was.However, Fritz, like most con men, was undeterred by setbacks, and at a New Ageevent in Santa Monica he wheedled his way into Marie’s confidence. AlthoughManly was at first suspicious, for the less than savvy Marie, Fritz was a“godsend,” and he quickly made himself indispensable to the pair, enjoying adangerous intimacy with and access to both the Halls’ and their society’swealth. Aged, ill, and at times confused, Hall’s reluctance to confrontassociates gave Fritz almost carte blanche. An antique coin dealer who knew Hallgrew suspicious when the “Doctor” presented several valuable coins claiming hewas selling on Hall’s behalf; when the dealer mentioned this to Hall, he merelysaid to “let it go.” This was only one incident. Soon Fritz was helping himselfdaily to the several cookie jars left open by the increasingly senile Hall, andit wasn’t long before the “Doctor” had the run of both the society and Hall’slife.Fritz became as much a fixture at the PRS as Hall, and as the latter’s healthgrew increasingly fragile, the “Doctor” took charge of his treatment. For themost part this consisted of repeated doses of Szekely’s “angel of water”combined with a rigorous fruit juice diet. As Dr. Sterling Pollack, Hall’sfamily physician, later argued, this regime more than likely pushed Hall closerto his death, increasing his heart problems (brought on by his obesity) bydepleting his electrolytes. Although Pollack repeatedly warned Hall of thisdanger, the philosopher found it impossible to refuse Fritz’s treatments.By this time Fritz was in charge of both Hall and Marie, blocking any directaccess to them and vetting all contacts. Recognizing that Hall was more thanlikely heading for the afterlife, Fritz decided that he might as well make hiscontrol of both Hall’s and the PRS’s assets—valued then at around $5million—official. There was, however, that problem of the will Hall had drawn upsome years before, leaving everything to Marie and his stepchildren. Fritz’ssolution was to draw up a new will.On August 23, 1990, Fritz impressed on Hall that he needed his signature on adocument that would relieve him of any burdensome business regarding the manychanges needed at the PRS. Hall, who had no idea what he was signing, was tootired and ill to resist and took the pen. Perhaps the “Doctor” even helped himmove it across the page? In any case, it was done. Six days later, Fritz calledForest Lawn mortuary and Dr. Pollack to tell them that Hall had died peacefullyin his sleep. When Pollack and the undertakers arrived to retrieve the body,they were stunned. Hall’s pale, huge form lay on a creaseless bed, and out ofhis mouth, ears, and nose streamed thousands of ants. A cleaning crew was busyscrubbing out reddish-brown stains on the carpet, and Fritz and his son, who hadalso helped “care” for Hall, were carting his valuables out to their car. WhenPollack asked where the ants came from, Fritz replied, “I don’t know.”Understandably suspicious, Pollack immediately canceled the death certificate hehad written out. When asked what he was doing with Hall’s belongings, Fritzmentioned the new will. It was the first Pollack had heard of it, and when heinformed Marie, she finally twigged to what was going on.Hall, Marie, Fritz, and his son are all dead, and the case remains, as Sahagunwrites, “an open-ended unsolved Hollywood murder mystery” worthy of RaymondChandler. When she realized that Fritz had pulled a fast one, Marie waged atenacious legal battle against him, challenging the new will. She eventuallyregained control over most of Hall’s personal assets, most of which she had touse to cover legal fees. The PRS, however, remained in Fritz’s control, andcronies he had placed on its board of directors did all they could to keep thehoney pot open. Botched autopsies, recalcitrant coroners, lack of decisiveevidence, and standard bureaucracy impeded police attempts to nail Hall’s murderon Fritz. But they were sure he did it. The ants—an Argentine variety, it turnedout, after one was discovered stuck between Hall’s teeth—could not possibly havebeen in Hall’s home, an expert testified, and could only have entered Hall’sbody after death, and only outside in open country.A second autopsy revealed several bruises, smudges of soil, and evidence oftrauma on Hall’s body and argued that Hall had asphyxiated face down in the dirtand hadn’t died peacefully in bed. This could only have happened during thebizarre expeditions to Santa Barbara that Fritz insisted Manly and Marie make ina motor home owned by the PRS a week before. On two occasions the enginesupposedly overheated, although there was no evidence of this, and Marie wasadvised to join Fritz’s son, who was following them in a separate car, leavingHall alone with Fritz. The first time she refused; miraculously, the troubledisappeared, and the motor home returned to LA. The next day the same thinghappened. This time Fritz insisted Marie go on while he and Hall waited. Thistime she reluctantly agreed. She never saw her husband alive again. Policebelieve that while Marie went on to Santa Barbara, Fritz either left theseverely fragile Hall to die of exposure in the hot California sun or helped himalong. The ants, they believe, seeking water, would have been attracted toHall’s body fluids and entered him through various orifices while he was lyingon the ground. The carpet stains were traces of soil. Weakened by his “angels ofwater,” a severely ill Hall would not have lasted long in the SouthernCalifornia heat.Hall’s end, bizarre and macabre as it was, shouldn’t overshadow the significanceof his early masterwork. The Secret Teachings of All Ages remains anindisputable classic. The PRS, under new management, remains a vital center formetaphysical investigation and in recent years received academic accreditation.And though not sparing of warts or skeletons in closets, Sahagun’s grippingbiography is an insightful look at the life and times of one of the lastcentury’s most important mystical thinkers."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc11]Dion Fortune: Psychic Warrior [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc11]On Sunday mornings during the height of the Battle of Britain, several peoplecould be found huddled together in 3 Queensborough Terrace, Bayswater, engagedin an activity most Londoners wouldn’t have recognized as part of the wareffort. Imagining themselves part of the “group soul of the race,” theseotherwise respectable citizens visualized “angelic Presences, red-robed andarmed, patrolling the length and breadth of our land.” Further meditations hadthem patrolling mine fields off the coast of Norway and performing astralcommando raids on high-ranking Nazis. This magical effort against Hitler and Co.continued throughout the war, and although its effect on the dark forces ofNational Socialism may be doubted, the earnestness of those participating wasunquestionable. The fact that during the Blitz not one but two German bombs fellon the headquarters of the Fraternity of Light—the group behind this spiritualresistance movement—might suggest that the Führer recognized the threat andtried to eradicate it. The further fact that those engaged in these ethericexpeditions spoke of astral dogfights and mystical punch-ups might also suggestthat there was more behind them than just patriotic wishful thinking.The leader of this occult National Guard was at any rate very familiar withmagical battles. In fact, it was through one such row itself that she firstbecame involved in the occult. Having learned early on how to defend herselffrom psychic attack, and having devoted many years to mastering the mystic arts,by the time Hitler made a bid to annex Britain she undoubtedly felt capable ofdefending not only herself, but her nation. The name of this remarkablecharacter was Dion Fortune, and she was one of the most brilliant figures oftwentieth-century esotericism.This, however, was not her name at birth, or at least not at her first one. Theindividual who took the name “Dion Fortune” at her second, magical birth waschristened Violet Mary Firth and was born in Llandudno, North Wales, on December6, 1890. As is true of many esoteric figures, little is known of Violet’s earlyyears; as one writer remarks, she “obscured the details of her life and the truenature of her personality behind a cloak of glamour and illusion,” somethingthat could be said of other occult figures, like Madame Blavatsky and AleisterCrowley. Her father came from the prosperous steelmaking Firth family ofSheffield. Arthur Firth didn’t follow this line, becoming a solicitor, althoughby the time of Violet’s birth, he was running the Craigside HydropathicEstablishment in Llandudno, having already run a similar spa-hotel in Bath—anapt career, perhaps, for the father of someone for whom the sea would be acentral symbol of mystery, magic, and power.Violet’s mother, Sarah, was a Christian Scientist, and in her early yearsViolet, too, felt the impact of Mary Baker Eddy’s ideas. But there were other,stranger experiences that presaged Violet’s life to come. At the age of four,she began to have visions of a past life in Atlantis. She saw, she said,“pictures that formed themselves unbidden in the mind in that interval betweenthe putting out of the nursery light and the oncoming of sleep”—what we wouldcall hypnagogic hallucinations. She speaks of a “sandy foreshore” and a levelplain, with great mountains rising sharply in the distance, of a river andstrange trees that it wasn’t safe to go near, of dangerous beasts in the riverand equally dangerous people, of grassy vegetation, an indigo sky and acopper-colored sun. Were these images of an actual past life, or psychicpostcards from the Jungian collective unconscious? Or were they the kind offantasies an imaginative and lonely little girl might entertain herself with?Whatever the nature of these strange visions, they stayed with Violet throughouther life and led her to believe that her true home wasn’t in a sleepy seasideresort, but in some lost world that she could return to only through herimagination. In later years, although she claimed that she wasn’t “naturallypsychic,” Fortune would channel a remarkable work of occult metaphysics, TheCosmic Doctrine, which was “received” in 1923 but not published until 1949,after her death. This was her attempt at doing what Madame Blavatsky had done inThe Secret Doctrine: reveal the hidden structure of the cosmos. Although TheCosmic Doctrine remains a difficult work and is generally read by seriousdevotees only, it suggests that the visions of some other life that haunted theyoung Violet were not mere preschool make-believe, but an early expression ofher strange ability to enter and make herself at home in other worlds.But although the young Violet had visions of prehistoric Atlantis, and atfourteen was writing poems about the sea, her real introduction to the mysticpath came in her early twenties and in a drearily mundane context. When Violetturned twenty, her parents decided to enroll her in a residential college. TheStudley Horticultural and Agricultural College is said to have offered places to“young ladies with slight emotional problems.” From the little we know aboutViolet’s teens, we get the impression of an imaginative, withdrawn, somewhatsnobbish (“I have a constitutional repulsion for ‘crushes,’” she wrote, “andgive them scant politeness”), highly intelligent, and creative woman who, likemany others, had to find a place for herself in the world. Violet would find herpath at Studley, but not in the way she, or anyone else, might have imagined.The Warden of Studley College was a pioneering female doctor named Lilias AnnaHamilton. She had traveled in Afghanistan—where she had been court physician tothe emir—and India, where she had learned techniques of mental domination thatmade her a terror to the students. Violet had been at the school only a shorttime when the Warden asked her to give false evidence against an employee shehad illegally fired. Violet was reluctant, but Hamilton’s insistence and powersof persuasion overcame her scruples. Her method was to stare at Violet andsimply repeat her commands; after the interview, Violet felt dazed and exhaustedand slept for fifteen hours. Other incidents occurred, with Violet reluctantlycomplying, until the Warden turned her sights on an elderly woman, seekingcontrol over her finances. Violet informed the woman of the scheme and hastilygot her away and into the safekeeping of her relatives.When Violet realized the Warden knew of her part in this rescue, she decided toleave the school before she herself fell victim to her powers. A fellow studentwho had felt Hamilton’s wrath advised her to leave without seeing the Wardenagain. “You will not get away if you don’t. I have tried several times and Icannot,” she said. Violet was troubled by this advice but was determined to tellthe Warden what she thought of her. When she did, Hamilton agreed to herleaving, but then adopted her Svengali pose and insisted: “You are incompetentand you know it. You have no self-confidence and you have to admit it.” Sherepeated this mantra for the next four hours, with Violet transfixed and unableto break away. She knew that if she agreed with the Warden, her “nerve would bebroken” and she would be useless in life. “By the time one realizes it thatsomething abnormal” is going on, she wrote, one is more or less “glamoured” and“one cannot move or turn away.” Eventually Violet heard a voice suggesting shepretend to accept the Warden’s terms, otherwise she would end up like the girlwho had warned her. She did, even going down on her knees to ask forgiveness.This satisfied the Warden, who let her go. Violet had entered the room a “strongand healthy girl” and left it a “mental and physical wreck.” She stayed that wayfor three years.Determined to understand what had happened, Violet began to study psychology. Bythis time she had moved to London and was taking classes in psychoanalysis atthe University of London and had joined the Medico-Psychological Clinic inBrunswick Square; she may also have worked at the Tavistock Clinic. TheTheosophical Society had recently started a club near Brunswick Square, andViolet started visiting, not because of a real interest in Theosophy, butbecause they offered cheap meals. As a Freudian, she dismissed Theosophists ascranks, but when, for fun, she attended a meditation class, something oddhappened. She saw a distinct image of a garden with blue flowers right beforeher eyes, rather like the hypnagogic images of Atlantis she saw as a child. Whenthe instructor remarked that she had been trying to project the mental image ofdelphiniums, Violet realized that some kind of thought transference hadhappened. Earlier she had noticed that some of her patients seem to “drain” herof energy and that they even seemed to suck power out of electronic equipment.They acted, she thought, as some kind of vampire, something Freudian theorycouldn’t explain. She attended more lectures at the Theosophical Society andrealized that Freud’s ideas were too narrow. Something else was needed, and shesoon found it.Although Fortune’s later work drew on psychoanalysis, producing what some havecalled a psychologized occultism, she dropped out of the clinic and, as WorldWar I had begun, joined the Women’s Land Army. Her time at Studley served herwell, and she was put to work for the Food Production Department of the Ministryof Agriculture. Here she discovered a means of making milk from soybeans andeven wrote a book about it, The Soya Bean (1925), but failed to capitalize on adiscovery that could have made her rich. Her job for the Land Army required longhours of observing bacteria, and in the quiet stretches her vision turnedinward. Again, something strange happened: her “astral sight” had opened, andthe experience was disturbing. At the Theosophical Society she read AnnieBesant’s The Ancient Wisdom (1897). Much as Besant, a Fabian Socialist, had beenconverted after meeting Madame Blavatsky, Fortune was suddenly convinced of thereality of the Masters, superhuman beings who guided humanity in its evolution.For the next ten days, she entered a weird “astral” dimension, the experienceculminating in a visitation by Jesus. Other Masters appeared—Melchizedek, “Lordof Flame and Mind”; Thomas Erskine, a Lord Chancellor in Dr. Johnson’s time; SirThomas More—and in one vision they accepted her as a student.With the end of the war, Violet left the Land Army. It was around this time thatshe met the Irish Freemason and occultist Theodore William Moriarty, the modelfor her psychic detective in The Secrets of Dr. Taverner (1926), her collectionof occult short stories. Violet joined the group of students, mostly women, whobelonged to Moriarty’s Science, Arts, and Crafts Society, and in theintroduction to her Dr. Taverner stories, she writes that he was “the greatestmind I ever met” and that she owed “the greatest debt of my life” to him.“Without ‘Dr. Taverner,’” she writes, “there would have been no Dion Fortune.”Her Cosmic Doctrine is based on Moriarty’s rare book Aphorisms of Creation andCosmic Principles (1923). Moriarty himself died of angina pectoris undermysterious circumstances in a hotel in King’s Lynn in August 1923, and Fortunewas supposed to have received the messages from the inner planes that make upher book not long after his death. Some have suggested that Fortune simply tookMoriarty’s work and, after his death, “improved” on it. Whatever the truth, TheCosmic Doctrine remains a controversial work in several ways. The occulthistorian Francis King thought it had much value, while the occult artist andwriter Ithell Colquhoun thought it was rubbish.Strangely enough, The Cosmic Doctrine got Violet into trouble with her nextmagical group. While still studying with Moriarty, Violet renewed an oldfriendship with Maiya Curtis-Webb (later Maiya Tranchell-Hayes), a friend of thefamily. Maiya, like Moriarty, was an occultist, and she introduced Violet to theoccult novelist J. W. Brodie-Innes, who was a member of the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn’s Amen Ra Temple. The original Golden Dawn numbered W. B. Yeatsand Aleister Crowley among its members, but by this time it had split intocompeting groups. In 1919, Violet Firth was initiated into the Golden Dawn,taking “Deo, non fortuna” (“by God, not by luck”) as her magical motto; it was,as it happened, the Firth family motto as well. This soon morphed into DionFortune.Another Golden Dawn temple was run by Moina Mathers, widow of S. L. MacGregorMathers, one of the original group’s leaders. Although at first friendly toDion, even agreeing with her idea to start a more public occult group to attractmore members (what would become the Fraternity of the Inner Light), Moina soondeveloped a more critical attitude. What troubled her were the articles Dion hadpublished in the Occult Review, which later became her book Sane Occultism(1929). Arguing that an “immense mass of verbiage has gathered around the SacredScience since Madame Blavatsky drew back the curtain of the Sanctuary,” andasking why occultism had produced “such a crop of charlatans and few, if any,intellects of the first water,” Fortune’s articles didn’t win her many friends,and among those she angered was Moina Mathers. Mathers was also angry that inFortune’s early work The Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage (1924), a bookthat dealt, however mutely, with the question of sex and the occult, she hadrevealed certain magical secrets that she had no right to communicate. Fortunesidestepped this when she argued that as she had yet to be introduced to thesesecrets—she was not yet of that grade—she couldn’t very well reveal them. Butthe real reason behind the tension was that Fortune’s energy, drive, andsuperior attitude rubbed many people the wrong way, and Moina, an older woman,felt threatened by her. It also can’t have helped that Fortune had written thatthe Golden Dawn was being led by “widows and grey-bearded ancients.” When Moinasaw a rough draft of The Cosmic Doctrine, she declared that it was inconsistentwith Golden Dawn teachings and added the trenchant criticism that “certainsymbols had not appeared” in Fortune’s aura. Moina gave Fortune an ultimatum:either forget her revelations and get back in line, or leave. Fortune left.In Psychic Self-Defense (1930), Fortune describes an astral battle betweenherself and Moina Mathers. This time, however, she was no longer a “shy,vulnerable adolescent” but a “strong, magnetic leader.” After writing of the“abuses prevalent in occult fraternities,” Fortune received a letter warning herof the consequences if she continued her exposé. Believing her work was inspiredby the Masters, Dion stuck to her guns. The result was a prolonged attack thatonly ended with an astral catfight between her and Moina.Demon faces appeared, and Fortune and those around her suffered from a felineinfestation: the headquarters of her Fraternity of Light and its neighbors wereoverrun by mobs of black cats. The place was filled with “the horrible stench ofthe brutes,” and at their day-job offices, members of the group found “the samepenetrating reek of the tom-cat.” Astral cats appeared, too, and one morningafter breakfast Fortune was confronted by “a giant tabby…twice the size of atiger.” The invasion ended after Fortune performed an exorcism, but she was soongrappling with her enemy anew. During an essential astral journey, Fortuneencountered Moina, dressed in the robes of her grade. She refused Fortune rightof way, and a battle ensued. Moina won the first round, throwing Fortune backinto her body, which somersaulted over her followers, who had gathered in avigil. Remembering her lesson with the Warden, Fortune got back on the astralplane and this time won the tussle. But that night she discovered that her backwas covered with the scratch of a “gigantic cat.” Later, Fortune also believedthat Moina was responsible for the death of her friend Netta Fornario, an artistand occultist who was found dead on the Scottish isle of Iona. Her nude body wasalso found covered in scratches, lying in a ritual position on a cross cut intothe turf. Moina, however, had been dead herself for eighteen months by the timeFornario, who seems to have been a depressed personality, apparently committedsuicide. Fortune would no doubt have argued that committing murder from theafterlife would not have been beyond the powers or vindictiveness of herHermetic nemesis.The battle with Moina Mathers seemed to mark a new beginning for Fortune. Alongwith the house in Bayswater, she set up occult camp in Glastonbury, in a spotnear Chalice Well and the Tor, in a house that was later bought by the writerGeoffrey Ashe. She had already met and worked with Bligh Bond, who had excavatedthe ruins of Glastonbury Abbey, supposedly with the help of the spirit of one ofits deceased monks, and together they contacted inner entities she called “theWatchers of Avalon.” Glastonbury became a symbol of the “mystical nationalism”that fueled her later anti-Nazi activities and expressed her aim to resuscitatethe Western esoteric tradition, as opposed to Theosophy’s very popular Easternvariants; it’s no surprise that she left the Theosophical Society in 1927.Fortune thought much about race—too much for our tastes these days. She believedthat the Western soul was unsuited for Eastern esoteric disciplines, and shewanted to provide access to our own homegrown spiritual traditions. In thedecade that followed, she produced an impressive body of work, which included atleast two classics. One is The Mystical Qabalah (1935), to my mind the mostreadable and straightforward exposition of the West’s fundamental esotericphilosophy, in which she draws on the work of both MacGregor Mathers andCrowley. The other is perhaps her finest work in occult fiction, The SeaPriestess (1938), in which a humdrum estate agent’s life is transformed by anaffair with a modern-day priestess of Isis. At the time, Fortune had toself-publish it because witchcraft laws were still on the books in England, andthe novel was considered too controversial by mainstream publishers. Many havecome to an appreciation of the Western inner path through reading Fortune’sfiction, and in novels like The Demon Lover (1927), The Winged Bull (1935), TheGoat-Foot God (1936) and Moon Magic (1956)—her last book, whose final chapterswere alleged to have been channeled—Fortune communicates in clear and evocativeprose the essence of her spiritual vision.The time also marked a change in her personal life. In 1927 she married ThomasPenry Evans, a Welsh physician, who had his own mystical path; Fortune calledhim “Merl” after Merlin. Although they shared magical pursuits, the two did notseem well matched. Fortune was a large, mannish, “Viking-like woman,” and, likeso many occultists—Madame Blavatsky, Crowley, Gurdjieff, Manly P. Hall—she puton weight in her later years. Evans was a small, dark Celt. Sex was never amajor part of the union, nor even a minor one; again, like Madame Blavatsky,Fortune seemed to disdain it, although it runs as a magical current through hernovels, and the discerning reader can chart the fortunes of her marriage inthem. Fortune was the dominant and older partner, and accounts are that shebossed Evans constantly; the occultists Kenneth Grant and Israel Regardie bothreport that she henpecked him “unmercifully.” Fortune seems to haveovercompensated for her treatment at the Studley agricultural college; accordingto Grant, she grew “very partial to the idea of power” and “did not scruple totell her followers how they should arrange their private lives.” In 1939, Evansleft her for a younger woman. The divorce was amicable.In later years Fortune’s work increasingly focused on trance mediumship andcontacting the Masters on the inner planes. In the early 1930s, she leased ahouse near London’s Belgrave Square called the Belfry, where she performed therites of Isis that would find fictional expression in Moon Magic. Her followingin the Fraternity grew and would eventually include such later magicalauthorities as W. E. Butler, W. G. Gray, and Gareth Knight.When World War II broke out, Fortune turned her powers toward protecting theSceptered Isle, whose spiritual tradition she had spent decades promulgating;and from Bayswater, Glastonbury, and other points in besieged Britain, she hadher students radiate psychic energies, hoping to keep the dark forces at bay.Whether it was this effort or the work of a black magician in Hitler’s innercircle who, she believed, directed baleful energies at her, the war years sawher health decline. Many who knew her in her last years said she was a “burntout shell.” One of these was the late Kenneth Grant, who said that when he mether in 1945, she “was close to death and had lost much of her physical force andvigor.” Grant believed Fortune was “the magical Shakti of the New Age,” linkingher to Crowley’s vision of a “new aeon”; and he describes some late meetingsbetween Fortune and Crowley, a magician she had steered clear of in her earlyyears. Apparently they corresponded, and Grant recalled a “stack ofCrowley/Fortune letters” that allegedly met an unfortunate fate. After Crowley’sdeath in 1947, the letters were sent to Karl Germer, then head of Crowley’s OrdoTempli Orientis. Germer later moved to California and made the mistake of livingnear some of Charles Manson’s Family. Some of the Family burgled his home and,among other items, took Crowley’s letters. These were then lost in a firestarted at the Family home by a disgruntled junior member. Whatever the truth ofthis tale, my suspicion is that, if the letters existed, they were probably nogreat esoteric loss: Crowley’s letters are generally about himself, and hismissives to Fortune would probably be of the same stamp. For researchers andbiographers, of course, it’s a different matter.Toward the end, Fortune visited a Jungian analyst; she felt she was movingtoward some great crisis in her life and needed guidance. She was obese,unkempt, alone, and surrounded by students of a dubious quality—a common fatefor esoteric teachers. The analyst found much darkness in her dreams. Shecontracted blood poisoning from a badly extracted tooth, and it is unclear if itwas this, or the leukemia she was diagnosed with, that killed her. On January 8,1946, Dion Fortune passed through “the gates of death,” as one of herposthumously published books is entitled. She was fifty-five and one of the lastgreat occultists from the Golden Age of modern esotericism. Her influencecontinues today in various forms, inspiring Wicca, mystical feminism, and othermovements. Marion Zimmer Bradley’s bestseller The Mists of Avalon owes much, itis said, to Fortune. And her fraternity—now known as the Society of the InnerLight—carries on.If Fortune started out wondering why occultism had produced “few intellects ofthe first water,” a look at her career suggests that, in at least one instance,it had."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc12]Aleister Crowley: The Beast Himself [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc12]My first encounter with Aleister Crowley—self-styled Great Beast 666 and themost famous magician of the twentieth century—happened in 1975. I was nineteenand living in New York City, playing bass guitar in an underground rock band,and sharing a small one-bedroom flat in Little Italy with the lead singer andthe guitarist. The guitarist had a kitschy interest in the occult, whichmanifested mostly in the pentagrams, upside-down crosses, and other satanicbric-a-brac that competed for wall space in the flat with old Velvet Undergroundposters and photographs of the Ramones. Squashed into a bookcase bursting withcreased sci-fi and horror paperbacks were pummelled copies of Crowley’s novels,Moonchild (1929) and Diary of a Drug Fiend (1922). I had already seen a copy ofthis last work in the window of the old St. Mark’s Bookshop, and as drugs weresomething I, and practically everyone I knew at the time, was interested in, Ilooked forward to reading it.Like tattered copies of the I Ching, Timothy Leary’s High Priest, and TheTibetan Book of the Dead, Crowley’s books were part of the debris left behind bythe ’60s generation. The Summer of Love had long since passed, but relics fromthat time still turned up amidst the fading tinsel of glam and the surfacing ofwhat would in a year or so be christened punk. Certainly my attraction toCrowley at this stage wasn’t unique, and when Chris—the guitarist—saw me turningthe pages of the Diary he said something like, “Yeah, that book’s cool. He’sinto coke, opium, everything.” No doubt I said “cool” too, and went back toreading. This in itself tells us something about Crowley, which I suspect isstill true today. Although he remains the most famous magician of modern times,Crowley’s initial attraction for most people isn’t his idiosyncratic, eclecticreading of the Western esoteric tradition—as intriguing as it is—but hisextravagant, excessive lifestyle. Long before McDonald’s, Crowley led asupersized life, running through an enormous amount of drugs, sex, and what wecan call, for lack of a better word, “experience.”Crowley drank experience like champagne, and he never seemed to have enough ofit, as a reading of his Confessions of Aleister Crowley (1969) or John Symonds’The Great Beast (1973)—still the most readable book on Crowley—will tell. Hewalked across China and climbed a Himalaya or two, learned several languages,and could easily have been a chess champion among other things, having enoughadventures along the way to cover dozens of ordinary lives. Yet, after spendingsome years fascinated with the Great Beast—as he enjoyed being called—andreading practically everything he wrote (including the poetry), and practicingthe magical disciplines he devised in order to accomplish the Great Work of theKnowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, I came away wondering ifall the experience he absorbed actually did him any good. The virtue ofexperience is that it affects you in some way and changes who you are, whichpretty much is what the Great Work is all about. (You may prefer to call itspiritual transformation, but the essence is the same). But what struck me afterreading and rereading Crowley’s work and the reports of his life, either byhimself or by less biased hands, is that he never changed at all. For all theenormous helpings of life that he swallowed whole, and all the mysticaldisciplines he undoubtedly mastered, Crowley seemed the same self-centered,egotistical, and megalomaniacal person at the end of his life as when he startedout. The Tao Te Ching observes that “the farther one travels, the less oneknows.” Among his many accomplishments, Crowley rendered his own version of thisTaoist classic, yet he seems not to have grasped the wisdom of that insight.I should also point out that the context for my introduction to the Great Beastwas again not in any way esoteric. At the time I knew nothing about esotericism,magic, Kabbalah, or any mystical tradition. I was a rock ’n’ roller. If I hadheard about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, it was through the horrorwriter Arthur Machen by way of H. P. Lovecraft. Not many Manhattan proto-punkerswere talking about Rudolf Steiner or Gurdjieff or Madame Blavatsky then. Crowleyhad been picked up by the last generation of rockers as a counterculture iconbecause of the wild sex, copious drugs, and general “bad boy” reputation—it had,I think, very little to do with magic—and this street-cred carried over to us.The Goths, death rockers, and heavy-metalers who discover Crowley today, do so,I think, for similar reasons, and it’s a shame that many people get their firstlook at Western esotericism through his peculiar appropriation of it. Through myown experience, I know it takes an effort to shake that off. Crowley’sphilosophy of jettisoning all repression and inhibition and “going large” (hecalled it discovering your “True Will”) appeals to youth, perennially hemmed inby parental and societal constraints and as yet lacking the power ofdiscrimination and the virtue of self-discipline. But what is for most of us astage in life we pass through on the way to (with any luck) maturity was forCrowley the “word of the Aeon.” The age he saw inaugurated by his own hand wasthat of the “crowned and conquering child.” Is it surprising that teenagerswould be into it? Or that Crowley himself acted like a spoiled adolescent moretimes than not?But although my first taste of Crowleyanity (as Crowley first thought of callingthe religion he would unleash upon the world, before he opted for Thelema) wasthrough the attraction of a good read about drugs, the result was something Ihadn’t expected. Not long afterward, we moved into one floor of a huge, illegalloft space on the Bowery, and one of the other denizens was a wild, flamingartist who was a devotee of Crowley’s Thoth Tarot Deck, copies of which wererare at the time. He painted canvases based on the cards’ images, and often hewould do a reading for inspiration. By this time I had raced through Moonchild,Crowley’s venomous roman à clef about the other members of the Golden Dawn, andhad discovered Colin Wilson’s The Occult, which had a long chapter on Crowley.The artist had other books too, like Israel Regardie’s The Tree of Life. I readthis and several others on “magick,” as Crowley spelled it, and found that I washooked. There was a kind of revival of occult literature at the time, and manycheap editions of occult classics by A. E. Waite, S. L. MacGregor Mathers, andothers found their way to the remainder tables. The old Samuel Weiser occultbookshop was still around, and it had complete sets of reprints of Crowley’sfamous magical journal, The Equinox, going for practically nothing. I boughtthose and anything else that I could get my hands on having to do with magic(k),the occult, and specifically Crowley. I had read a great deal of Nietzsche bythen, and his ideas about the Übermensch (“superman”) seemed to chime with whatCrowley was saying about the True Will. But Nietzsche, although a more profoundthinker, had had a wretched life, got syphilis the one time he had sex, anddidn’t really talk about drugs. Crowley seemed a more promising role model. And,I had to admit, he looked pretty impressive in those photographs, with his blackrobe and hood, with the shining eye in the pyramid, performing the BanishingRitual of the Pentagram, or as a turbaned Arab, enjoying his pipe of rum-soakedperique tobacco.But my real plunge into the land of Do What Thou Wilt didn’t happen until Imoved to California. By the autumn of 1977 I had left the group and with mygirlfriend had moved to Los Angeles, where I started my own band. Along withother sites that catered to occult tastes, here I haunted Gilbert’s Bookshop onHollywood Boulevard—sadly, long gone—which had been a favorite of Jimmy Page andDavid Bowie. One day I noticed a sign advertising a Crowley group. I answered itand a few weeks later was initiated into two of Crowley’s magical societies. TheOrdo Templi Orientis (Order of the Eastern Temple, or OTO) had been around since1900, starting up in Germany in the early years of rising Aryan consciousness;Crowley became the head of an English branch in 1913. The Argenteum Astrum(Order of the Silver Star or A∴A∴) emerged in 1907 after Crowley had fallen outwith both the Golden Dawn and its head, MacGregor Mathers, and decided to starthis own secret society. Although both groups had a Masonic, Rosicrucian flavor,the real core of the teaching was Crowley’s inspired sacred text, The Book ofthe Law (1904), to which we owe his notorious call and response: “Do what thouwilt shall be the whole of the law. Love is the law, love under will.”Dictated to Crowley in 1904 in a Cairo hotel by the extrahuman intelligenceAiwass, The Book of the Law was, Crowley claimed, a sign that “the equinox ofthe gods had come, and that a new epoch in human history had begun.” Crowley wasconvinced that the Secret Chiefs had chosen him as the new Messiah, and,although he balked at first, he soon took to the job with relish.For several months I did what I wilt with zeal, upsetting my girlfriend byfollowing the rituals Crowley provided at the back of his impenetrable 1929work, Magick in Theory and Practice. (In New York Rocker: My Life in the BlankGeneration, a memoir of my years as a musician, I give a fuller account of thistime in my life.)Yet, as I made my way through the rest of Crowley’s oeuvre and became familiarwith other works on magic and the Western spiritual tradition, my appreciationof the Master Therion (as he also styled himself, therion being Greek for“beast”) began to shift. The people I had met through the Crowley group seemedto equate doing what they wilt with doing what they liked, which meant indulgingin whatever appetites they cared to, along with a general lack of considerationfor others. This led me, after a year or so, to drop out, although to this dayI’m not quite sure how my membership stands. Initially I admired Crowley’senormous self-obsession (which makes his Confessions his most readable book; heis a great raconteur, especially about himself). But eventually it began topall, and a kind of claustrophobia began to accompany reading his work. While hetalked about philosophy, literature, and other pursuits that interested me, thepunch line was always himself. This same inability to lose himself shows throughin “visionary” works like The Vision and the Voice (1910) that, for all itsangels and demons, still has Crowley’s ego smack at the center, and it alsocolors The Book of the Law, which, for all its inspiration, reads like acombination of Oscar Wilde, Nietzsche, and the Marquis de Sade, with someEgyptian motifs thrown in. Crowley famously equated himself with Shakespeare,and although he is capable of insight, generally his remarks about otherthinkers are made in order to justify his own colossal self-regard. Once, whendisappointed by W. B. Yeats’s lack of enthusiasm for his poetry, Crowleyexplained that Yeats simply couldn’t admit that he, Crowley, was the betterpoet. A brief comparison of the two argues against this. Although works like the“Hymn to Pan” do have a strong incantatory power, most of Crowley’s poetry ispretty insipid, even the pornographic works, which reveal a childish fascinationwith being “naughty,” as do his slightly sick paintings on similar themes.I also began to tire of Crowley’s inexorable self-justifications, whether it wasrationalizing his sadistic, slow murder of a cat when he was fourteen (in order,he said, to observe whether or not it really did have nine lives) or his (forany decent human being) inexcusable conduct during his ill-fated attempt toclimb Kangchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. Crowley fell out withthe other members of the expedition, and he refused to help when they met withan accident. His attitude was “serves them right,” and several men died. He thenwithdrew all of the expedition’s funds from the bank and justified himself in aspate of newspaper articles. Similar episodes crowd his turbulent and depressinglife. Interestingly, it was only while mountaineering that Crowley experiencedanything like a release from his ego and his constant itch to shock thebourgeoisie. He confessed that his “happiest moments were when I was alone onthe mountains” and that “the moment the pressure was relieved, every touch ofthe abnormal was shed off instantly.” He didn’t even feel the need to writepoetry, and the experience had nothing to do with magick.But Crowley never outgrew his petulant spitefulness, a product, no doubt, of hischildhood under fanatical Christian fundamentalist parents. But what was thepoint of discovering his True Will if it basically meant condoning these andother sociopathic acts? Did he really need the gods to OK his actingunforgivably? Crowley was incapable of recognizing that his actions affectedother people and that he was accountable for them; in a way this suggests a kindof autism. His philosophy was a nihilistic Buddhism. “Let there be no differencemade among you between any one thing & and any other thing,” The Book of the Lawdeclares. “The word of Sin is Restriction.” Crowley recognized no restrictions,and if, as The Book of the Law revealed, there was no difference between onething and another thing, what difference did it make if he did one thing oranother? Which meant, of course, that he might as well do whatever he liked, asthe universe condoned it anyway. A handy ethic, no doubt, but not one suited forany kind of spiritual growth. And in case any lingering sense of human sympathymanaged to intrude, The Book of the Law was always there. “These are dead, thesefellows; they feel not.” “We have nothing with the outcast and the unfit; letthem die in their misery.” “Compassion is the vice of kings: stamp down thewretched & the weak.” Much heavy weather has been made about Crowley’s possibleNazi sympathies, and most of it is probably rubbish, but it isn’t difficult tosee the similarities between this kind of sensibility and the one that wouldhave Europe in flames a few decades later.Crowley’s attitude to women is also notorious, but not surprising. When theywere Scarlet Women, available for his sex magick, they were useful. Otherwise hehad no time for them, and tragically, most of those who entered his life came toa bad end. Crowley abandoned Rose Kelly, his first wife, who helped him receiveThe Book of the Law, and their daughter, Lilith, in the middle of Asia; Lilithdied soon after, and Rose later spent time in a mental asylum. Leah Hirsig, hismost compatible Scarlet Woman, once allowed a goat to penetrate her during oneof Crowley’s rituals. The animal’s throat was cut at the same time, and she alsohad the Beast eat her shit. She became a drug addict with Crowley and aprostitute after he dumped her. At least two other Scarlet Women went insane andone other committed suicide. Possibly the only creature Crowley ever loved wasthe daughter he had with Leah; sadly, she too died at his infamous Abbey ofThelema in Mussolini’s Sicily.“Intellectually…they did not exist,” was Crowley’s assessment of women, and “itwas highly convenient that one’s sexual relations should be with an animal.”(Doubly convenient, then, for Leah and the goat.) Although such remarks, whileobjectionable, aren’t rare even today, Crowley’s lack of any real friendshipeven with his male followers again suggests a kind of autism. Once, when hismost intelligent disciple, Israel Regardie, complained about some criticismCrowley made of his work, Crowley circulated a letter in which he accusedRegardie of suffering from an inferiority complex, chronic constipation, andexcessive masturbation, which was only relieved when he caught gonorrhea from aprostitute. Regardie recognized “the nasty, petty, vicious louse” that Crowleywas on “the level of practical human relations,” but his admiration for Crowleyas a mystic enabled him to separate the man from the magus, an act of fissionthat Crowley apologists still perform today. But how to forgive the Beast forabandoning the mathematician and devout Thelemite Norman Mudd, who, shattered byCrowley’s betrayal, filled his pockets with stones and drowned himself off theIsle of Guernsey? Or for the death of Raoul Loveday, at Crowley’s Abbey, afterdrinking the blood of a sacrificed cat? Or for his sadistic treatment of thepoet Victor Neuberg, with whom Crowley carried out an evocation of the demonChoronzon in North Africa, which included himself being sodomized? Or for thedozens of friends he left holding the bag or picking up the bill when he wasfaced with some difficulty or had dined at the most expensive place in town?It’s tempting to say that all these individuals were weak, neuroticpersonalities to begin with and that it isn’t Crowley’s fault that they wereunsuccessful at life. But then why did he waste his time with them? Surely a manwho once announced he had “crossed the Abyss” and become a god—which Crowleyapparently did when he claimed he reached the magical grade of Ipsissimus in1921—would find better things to do? The answer is that Crowley liked havingneurotic people around him, because they were susceptible to his domineeringpersonality. The relationships were dysfunctional: he enjoyed impressing hiswill on other people, and they enjoyed basking in the glow of his dominance andin having someone provide a purpose for their life, however dubious. It’sinstructive that Crowley had regard only for people he couldn’t bully, like themountaineer Oscar Eckenstein and the Buddhist Allan Bennett. And on one occasionwhen he encountered a personality stronger than his own—during his alleged visitto Gurdjieff’s Fontainebleau Prieuré—the Beast apparently got a bit rattled.One also has to admit that Crowley’s last days, spent down-at-heel in a somberboardinghouse in Hastings, near the English Channel, were not encouraging. Bythe time he died at the age of seventy-two in 1947, Crowley was taking enoughheroin each day to kill a roomful of nonusers. He had spent the better part of alifetime doing what he willed, but his final years were full of boredom andregret and pitted with the pains of poverty and ill health.The drugs were understandable and, if excessive, were not unusual. The sex, too,was obsessive, and we all know people who take advantage of the weak-willed onoccasion. And I do owe Crowley a debt of gratitude for introducing me to a canonof literature—the Western esoteric tradition—the study of which has become forme a lifelong pursuit. I hasten to emphasize here that I haven’t once made acriticism of magic or the occult, but of Crowley the man. I almost want to say,“If only he had used his powers for good instead of evil.” But that would bewrong. Crowley wasn’t really evil, just insensitive, selfish, and oblivious toanything except his own raging ego, and getting over that strikes me as thefirst hurdle in any initiation. I think he was a serious student of magick andreally did have some insights into tapping the little-known powers of the will.But that’s no excuse, and I’ve no doubt that, more times than not, he really wasa beast."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc13]Julius Evola: Mussolini’s Mystic [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc13]In the late spring of 1980, Italians felt the return of a terrorist threat thatfor the previous decade had kept a low profile. Since the end of World War IIand the rise of the cold war, neofascism had been a fact of life in Italianpolitics, the right-wing ideals of “tradition” and “order” seeming the onlyalternative to American domination or the threat of communism. In December 1969,the destabilizing tactics employed by the neofascists reached a new height withthe Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan, a violent spark that ignited a wave offar-right terrorism. By the mid-1970s, however, the neofascist threat appearedto have faded, only to be replaced by its left-wing opposite when radical groupstook to shattering university professors’ kneecaps for teaching the doctrines of“the establishment.”Their counterparts, however, were merely lying low, and on May 28, 1980, it wasclear that they were back and ready for action. On that day, an Italianpoliceman, Franco Evangelista—nicknamed “Serpico” after the legendary New Yorkcop for his success in arresting drug dealers—was assassinated by right-wingterrorists in Rome. Then, in June, a judge who had led an investigation intoright-wing terrorist activities was murdered. But the major attack came last, onAugust 2, when a bomb in the Bologna railway station killed eighty-five peopleand wounded hundreds more. Many of the victims, including children, were maimedhorribly. Like the Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland and 9/11, the event puncheda hole in the nation’s psyche—which was precisely what its authors intended.Keeping to its “strategy of tension,” the group responsible for the blast keptits identity secret, yet the police had a good idea who to look for. Names werementioned: Paolo Signorelli, Franco Frela, Claudio Mutti, Stefano delle Chiaie,and others from the right-wing usual suspects list were questioned. And when theinvestigation began to close in, several members of the Nuclei ArmatiRivoluzionari, an influential far-right group, fled the country for Britain. Oneman, however, whose name was mentioned by all, had no need to fear the police,as he had been dead for the last six years. But if a single person could be heldaccountable for the Bologna bombing, the dead man was a good candidate. His namewas Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola, better known to his more recent English-speakingreaders as Baron Julius Evola, author of several books on magic, esotericism,and the occult as well as a withering attack of Western civilization, Revoltagainst the Modern World (1934).Born on May 19, 1898, to a noble Sicilian family, Julius Evola was a bright butself-willed child who rebelled early on against his strict Catholic upbringing.This resentment against Christianity remained with him throughout his life andfueled a Nietzschean disdain for the weak and ignorant masses. Although he leftuniversity before earning a degree, from his studies in industrial engineeringhe developed a sense of precision and objectivity, a cold clarity and logic. Butit was the new movements in modern literature that had the most influence onEvola’s early years. In later life he was to become a staunch defender oftradition, but in his teens Evola came under the spell of the literaryavant-garde, absorbing the work of writers like Giovanni Papini and GiuseppePrezzolini. Papini introduced him to new ideas in art and fashion, as well as tothe writings of Meister Eckhart and several oriental sages. But the mostinfluential discovery was the work of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, whose Futuristmovement would later find favor with Italy’s Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini,a position Evola himself would occupy in years to come. Marinetti, who sang thepraises of the modernity Evola would eventually come to despise, may seem anunlikely mentor for a philosopher whose polemics against the modern world wouldlater guide several violent attacks on it. Yet Marinetti’s own fascisticsensibility—a virulent rejection of nature, a celebration of regimen andmachinelike efficiency, and above all an embrace of speed and violence for theirown sake—are in keeping with Evola’s character.Marinetti’s Futurists scandalized the bourgeoisie with their penchant foravant-garde hooliganism and artistic thuggery, starting fights at art galleriesand shouting abuse at poetry readings, tactics that less cultured individualswould later employ against a variety of human targets. War, for Marinetti, wasan aesthetic affair, and his reports from the Turkish front in World War I spokeof the “joy” of hearing “the machine guns screaming a breathlessness under thestings slaps traak-traak whips pic-pac-pum-tum….” These and other brutalonomatopoeia informed Marinetti’s ideas of parole in libertà, “free words,”which later formed the basis of much of today’s rap and performance poetry.At nineteen, Evola had an opportunity to test Marinetti’s theory when he joinedthe Italian army in the last days of the war. Although serving as an artilleryofficer at the Austrian front, Evola saw no action, yet the discipline, order,and hierarchy of the military impressed him and left him unsuited for civilianlife, with its muddling chaos and growing egalitarianism. It was then that hebegan his search for transcendence, first through drugs, then through a study ofthe occult.These experiences seemed only to increase Evola’s sense of purposelessness, andthe idea of suicide came to dominate his consciousness, a morbid opinion madeattractive through his interest in the brilliant but disturbed Austrian writerOtto Weininger. The Jewish Weininger wrote an influential book, Sex andCharacter (1903), in which he argued that man alone is a spiritual creature,yearning for the celestial heights, while woman, a denizen of the earth, triesto trap him in her corrupting embrace: the archetype of the femme fatale. Healso argued that the Jews as a race displayed distinctly “feminine”characteristics, most importantly a hatred of all things of a “higher” nature:hence Marx and his reduction of religion to the “opium of the people.” Anunhappy individual, obsessed with sex and his own Jewishness, Weiningercommitted suicide at twenty-three, in a room in Vienna once occupied byBeethoven. His ideas about women and Jews, however, lived on in several minds,not the least of which was Evola’s.A Buddhist text saved Evola from suicide, and the discovery of a new avant-gardemovement gave him a sense of direction. Futurism, he came to believe, was vulgarand showy. But Dada, the new anti-art movement seeping across the border fromSwitzerland, struck him as more intellectual as well as more ambitious. Dadaseemed more than a mere art movement, something along the lines of a totalreconstruction of the world, the need for which Evola had come to believe inpassionately. It is also quite possible that in Dada’s leader, Tristan Tzara,Evola found a new role model: photographs of Evola displaying his elegant,smooth, shaved face, immaculate dress, and imperious gaze—complete withmonocle—are strikingly similar to those of Tzara. For the later advocate oftradition this is ironic, as Tzara, with his hunger for notoriety and scandal,would today more than likely be at home on talk shows and Twitter than in theworkshops of anti-art.Evola plunged into Dada, reading his poetry to the music of Schoenberg, Satie,and Bartok at the Cabaret Grotte dell’Augusteo, Rome’s version of Zürich’sinfamous Cabaret Voltaire. He also took up painting and exhibited his work inRome, Milan, Lausanne, and Berlin; today his Inner Landscape at 10:30 a.m. stillhangs in Rome’s National Gallery of Modern Art. Evola also wrote an influentialessay on abstract art, arguing that it is only in abstraction that the existenceof an “eternal self” could be expressed—an indication, again, of hisanti-natural, anti-earthly bias.Yet Dada was not enough. Disgusted with the increasing commercialization of theavant-garde, in 1922 Evola abandoned painting and poetry. He now gave himself tophilosophy, writing several books of an idealistic character in which he spelledout the metaphysics of the “absolute individual.” This boiled down to thedoctrine that such an individual enjoyed “the ability to be unconditionallywhatever he wants,” and that for him “the world is my representation.” For thenobly born Evola, this spiritual solipsism seems appropriate: it provided anontological underpinning for his nearly absolute lack of interest in otherpeople.This focus on the “unconditional” freedom of the self led to a still deeperstudy of occultism. Evola became involved with an Italian Theosophical group andwrote an introduction to a translation of the Tao Te Ching. A correspondencewith Sir John Woodroffe—writing as Arthur Avalon, author of several works onHindu philosophy—led to a fascination with Tantra, which surfaced in Evola’sbooks The Yoga of Power (1949) and The Metaphysics of Sex (1958): the latteralso shows the influence of Weininger. Evola soon lost interest in Theosophy,but not in the occult, and by the mid-1920s he had become involved in anesoteric society, the UR group, which looked at magic as “the science of theego.” Formed around the occultist Arturo Reghini, editor of two influentialoccult journals, Atanòr and Ignis, the UR group embarked on a variety ofesoteric investigations. Along with Tantra, Evola studied alchemy, Taoism, andBuddhism. The link between these studies was the idea of “initiation,” the sensethat through them Evola was participating in ancient initiatory practices,living manifestations of a lost primal tradition.Yet he soon felt the need for something more than study and ritual. Linking hisvision of Dada as an attempt to refashion the world to his new pursuits, Evolasaw in politics and society a means of expressing his occult beliefs. He wasimpressed with Nietzsche’s vision of a coming world nihilism, and latertranslated Oswald Spengler’s bestselling study of cultural decay, The Decline ofthe West (1918–1923), into Italian. Mussolini’s Fascism was, Evola believed, anattempt to introduce elements of a traditional culture into a corrupt modernworld. What it lacked was a spiritual basis. Evola saw himself as the means ofsupplying this. The UR group took to performing magical rituals with the intentof inspiring the new Fascist movement with the spirit of ancient Rome. On a moreconcrete level, Evola and his colleagues published a journal, La Torre, to whichhe contributed a series of political articles. Although he celebratedMussolini’s attempts to revive the ancient Roman Empire (at the expense of theEthiopians), Evola argued that Fascism was too involved with the church and tooready to pander to the masses. It needed, he said, to anchor itself in a“spiritual aristocracy,” an argument made clear in his book Pagan Imperialism(1928). Here Evola attacked Christianity and heaped scorn on both Americandemocracy and the Soviet regime.Mussolini was impressed with Evola’s thought and was interested enough to writean article about it for Reghini. In the world of realpolitik, however, Mussoliniknew that in Catholic Italy he had little chance of success without the church.It was his refusal to alienate the pope, as well as his shrewd manipulation ofthe masses, that eventually lost him Evola’s sympathies. Evola never joined theFascist party, a fact that years later served him in good stead, and althoughhis political beliefs are at best questionable, one must at least admire hisdetermination to stand by his own values. It would have been easy to secure acomfortable niche in the Fascist hierarchy. Yet Evola’s criticism of Mussoliniwas unequivocal: after being told that Il Duce disagreed with something he hadwritten, Evola replied, “Tanto peggio per Mussolini”—“Too bad for Mussolini.”Yet after ten issues, La Torre had to stop publishing, and for a time Evola saidhe had to employ bodyguards. Later Mussolini softened and embraced some ofEvola’s less politically intransigent ideas.A more powerful influence on Evola by this time was the French orientalist RenéGuénon, through whose forbidding books on metaphysics, esotericism, andtradition Evola found a formidable exponent of his own basic vision. Like Evola,Guénon had been brought up Catholic. Yet after studying philosophy he plungedinto the world of fin de siècle occultism, and for a time was attracted toTheosophy and Freemasonry. He soon abandoned these for Hindu philosophy, throughwhich he had discovered an insight into the ontological structure of theuniverse. This, he believed, had been intuited by the ancients, who had codifiedthis knowledge in the form of a “primordial tradition.” Although remnants ofthis primal truth could be found in the great religions, it was lost to the vastmass of humanity. The modern world was, in fact, caught in its own death throes,a product of the last stages of the Kali Yuga, the Dark Age that the West hasbeen subject to for the last six thousand years. Guénon marshaled his argumentin a short but incisive work, The Crisis of the Modern World (1927). Evolafollowed suit and brought out his own incendiary polemic seven years later.Revolt against the Modern World must stand as one of the fiercest attacks onWestern civilization ever written; I wouldn’t be surprised if it was among thebedside reading of today’s “traditionalist terrorists.” (For what it’s worth,although Evola remained partial to Hinduism, Guénon converted to Islam and spenthis last years in Cairo.) A massive work, its two parts are divided into anaccount of what the ancient traditional world was like and an unremittingassault of the evils of modernity. Like many out of sympathy with secularsociety, Evola found no redeeming value in liberalism, democracy, humanism, orscience. Toward the end of his life, when fledging neofascists sat at his feetseeking guidance and insight, Evola boiled the essence of his daunting tome downto a provocative and deadly epigram. “It is not a question of contesting andpolemicizing,” he told them, “but of blowing up everything.” In Bologna in 1980,at least some of his readers took him at his word.The argument of Revolt against the Modern World, if we can call it that, islengthy and complex, but there is really very little argument in anyphilosophical sense. For the most part, Evola engages in an imperiousdeclamation of his insights into tradition. His central insight is what he calls“the doctrine of the two natures.” The world of tradition, he tells us, is basedon the reality of an eternal truth, what he calls “being,” which lies outside oftime. The modern secular world, however, is one of “becoming,” the messy,inchoate, ever-changing stream of nature and history. The distinction is aclassic one, first posited by the Presocratic thinker Parmenides centuriesbefore Plato, and has occupied philosophers ever since. Yet how Evola arrives atan entire civilization based on it is unclear. He scorns historians who laborover facts and evidence. Such busywork is outside tradition and so “unreal.”Evola, on the contrary, achieves his insights through having attained a“superindividual and non-human perspective.” Having done so, he eschews“debating and ‘demonstration.’” “The truths that may reveal the world ofTradition,” he tells us, “are not those that can be ‘learned’ or ‘discussed’:either they are or they are not.” For Evola, evidently, they are, and he’smanaged to secure his knowledge by becoming “free of the obstacles representedby various human constructions,” such as specialized historical research andreasoned argument. “Human constructions,” he tells us, are to be avoided, as thetruth of tradition can only be divined from a nonhuman perspective. The point isdebatable, but whatever one may think of his “truths,” the present writer has nodifficulty finding some of them nonhuman.For someone looking at the book today, it’s difficult to think that the mostimportant people taken with it at the time, Mussolini’s Fascists and Hitler’sNazis (understandably, its mass appeal was nil), were less impressed by Evola’saristocratic disdain for argument—according to Evola, a distinctly Jewishpastime—than by his championing of a rigid social hierarchy, the belief in thesupremacy of the noble Aryan race, and the glorification of the ruthlesswarrior. The Nazis had already drawn on some homegrown savants in this regard,pulling Nietzsche’s remarks about a “good war that hallows any cause” and “theblond beast” out of context. (Unlike Evola, Nietzsche did see military action inthe Franco-Prussian War; the experience made him a lifelong anti-militarist, andwhen the Nazi hacks cottoned to this, they gently shunted him to the side. Thefact that he also vigorously rejected anti-Semitism didn’t help.) But Evolabuilt an entire sociology around the idea of the Kshatriya, the “holy warrior”of the ancient Hindu caste system, based on the Laws of Manu. Christianity,democracy, and humanitarianism were cancers eating away at the noble pagan soul,and the militaristic regimes of Mussolini and Hitler were a profound attempt torejuvenate the race. Or at least part of it. In Evola’s cosmic history, thenoble Aryan people originated in the bleak but bracing realms of the North Pole,in the legendary land of Hyperborea (“beyond the north wind”). These manlytypes, exemplars of what Evola calls “virile spirituality,” worshipped a solargod, “lived dangerously” in a static hierarchical system in which everyone knewhis place, and enjoyed the beauty and vigor of a Golden Age, before the rot setin. This started when a catastrophic shift in the earth’s axis led to a massmigration of the Hyperboreans, an exodus from their Arctic paradise into lessbracing climes. Adopting some of Madame Blavatsky’s ideas, Evola argued that hisArctic warriors migrated to North America and Siberia, then gradually down tothe now-lost continent of Atlantis. At this point some of these Atlanteans mixedwith an aboriginal southern race—possibly the Lemurians. These southern typeswere a different breed: nature-oriented, they worshipped an Earth Goddess, werepeaceful, and lived in collective communities characterized by egalitarianismand sharing. They were also responsible for all the character traits that Evolaand his friends found nauseating.Gradually, through the cyclical nature of history, the Hyperborean virtues wereeroded. As the world passed through its inevitable descent, the southern,feminine traits became predominant, housed specifically in various racial typeslike the Jew, until now, having passed through three previous yugas (ages),we’ve hit rock bottom with the decadent democracies of the West. (The clincher,apparently, was the Renaissance and the rise of humanism.) The fact that we arein the last phase of the Kali Yuga was, Evola believed, actually cause forcelebration, as it meant that it had nearly come full circle, with a new GoldenAge about to be born. All that was needed was a little help, and this,evidently, was where Benito and Adolf came in.Although Revolt against the Modern World was published to practically no publicnotice (the German nationalist writer Gottfried Benn was one of the few toreview it), the idea of a vast historical support for the supremacy of an Aryanwarrior type caught on with the right people. Evola was once again inMussolini’s good graces and wrote extensively for a number of Fascistnewspapers. He also wrote two influential books, Aspects of the Jewish Problem(1936) and Outline of a Racist Education (1941), and gave lectures on his racialideas to university students. Less crude than the Nazi racial doctrines, whichhe found altogether too materialistic and biological, Evola argued that race wasreally a spiritual question. This meant, in effect, that one might be Jewish bybirth but still harbor an Aryan soul; likewise, a “true-blooded” Aryan could bepossessed by a Semitic spirit. (This, to some extent, explained how a lazy,undisciplined people like the Italians—at least to the average NationalSocialist’s eye—could have descended from the Romans and could be able toparticipate in the glorious Aryan struggle.) Fastidious, cultured, and at bottominfluenced by his profound study of esotericism, Evola found the Nazi racialidea vulgar and tried to pass on to them some of his own insights, once againattempting to put into practice his beliefs about tradition. He lectured to SSstudy groups and at the University of Berlin, and he was courted by HeinrichHimmler, who treated him to a tour of SS castles. Several of his books weretranslated into German, and he addressed influential gatherings, like Berlin’selite Herrenklub. This cachet had great effect at home; in 1938, when Mussolinienacted his own race laws, he used Evola as his guide. Three years later, in1941, in an attempt to present himself as more than Hitler’s puppet, Il Ducetold the baron that his book The Synthesis of Racial Doctrine (1941) was the onethe Fascists needed.Evola’s supporters cite his subtle thinking on the race question as evidencethat he was never really anti-Semitic, but it’s difficult to square this claimwith his pronouncements that the Jews were “the anti-race par excellence,” norwith the fact that he argued for the authenticity of the notoriously spuriousProtocols of the Elders of Zion, with its ludicrous “evidence” of a Jewishconspiracy for world domination. He was also less than subtle in his response tothe murder of his friend Corneliu Codreanu, the leader of the fascistic RomanianIron Guard, who numbered the religious historian Mircea Eliade among itsmembers. When he heard the news, Evola spoke of the “Judaic horde” and hurledinvective against the “filthiest tyranny, the Talmudic, Israelite tyranny.” Atdifferent times his rhetoric also included denunciations of “inferior,non-European races,” “Negro syncopation,” and “sexual tormentresses” who had theaudacity to wiggle their hips in very tight pants.Evola’s attempt to influence Nazi doctrine was unsuccessful: the Nazis weren’tinterested in Aryan Jews or vice versa, and in any case the difficulties intelling which from which were probably insurmountable. And although he made manyGerman contacts, the pragmatic Himmler finally saw no use for him. Beingrejected by Himmler may be a mitigating factor, but it hardly exonerates Evolafor his ideas about race. It’s difficult to think that his “spiritual racism”could have saved many Jews but easy to imagine that some “spiritualundesirables” might have met a sorry end.Although he was the first person at Hitler’s Rastenburg HQ to greet Il Duceafter his daring rescue from prison in 1943, Evola’s contact with the Nazisconvinced him that Mussolini was second-rate. Evola briefly became involved withthe short-lived Fascist republic of Salò, but he soon left Italy for Austria.Here, in 1945, during the blistering Soviet siege of Vienna, he was wounded inan air raid and left with both legs paralyzed, a handicap the spiritual warriorhad to live with for the rest of his life. After the war, he returned to Italy,his hopes of a revival of tradition, courtesy of the Axis powers, profoundlydashed.Yet his belief in occult politics remained. During the 1950s, Evola wrote aboutthe “legionary spirit” and the “warrior ethic,” but the triumphant tone of hisearlier work had shifted. He called on l’uomo differenziato—“those who aredifferent”—to drag their feet against the pull of democracy and materialism. A1951 edition of Revolt against the Modern World no longer spoke of the heroicefforts of international Fascism and instead advised a philosophy of stoicresistance.However, Evola’s polemics aroused the authorities and he was summoned to court,accused of trying to revive Fascism. The fact that he had never joined theparty—oversight or shrewd calculation?—as well as his eloquent defense clearedhim of the charge, and in his book Men among the Ruins (1953) he outlined theneed for a counterrevolution. Yet age and the times were against him; in hislast work, Ride the Tiger (1961), a meditation on how the believers in traditioncould survive the final days of the Kali Yuga, Evola advocated “apolitia,” an“active nihilism.” There was little hope, he said, of salvaging anything ofvalue; all that was left to l’uomo differenziato was aristocratic disdain andthe more visceral expedients of violence.Ironically, it was the radical leftism of the 1960s that revived interest inEvola, and in the midst of the social, sexual, and psychedelic revolutions ofthat decade he was rediscovered by disaffected right-wing Italian youth who,strangely enough, linked his work to that of their other hero, J. R. R. Tolkien.Dubbed “our Marcuse” by his new devotees—a nod to the reigning doyen of leftistideology, Herbert Marcuse—by the early ’70s, half-paralyzed and grimlypessimistic, Evola held forth to wide-eyed young neofascists who absorbed hisinvectives against the intolerable modern world, along with reminiscences ofHitler, Himmler, and Il Duce.“Nothing in this system deserves to be saved,” he told them, and, by allaccounts, they seemed to have taken this to heart. Some of those who frequentedthe stuffy rooms in his palazzo on Corso Vittorio Emanuele in Rome later carriedon the baron’s struggle to make the world safe for “virile spirituality”—some bywriting far-right tirades themselves, others by courageously blowing up innocentpeople.After Evola’s death and his posthumous notoriety, his ideas reached theEnglish-speaking world via the members of the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari whofled Italy after the Bologna bombing. Reaching England, they made contact withthe right-wing National Front, whose younger members absorbed Evola’s excitingnew doctrines. By the late 1980s, his ideas had spread to wider audiences viathe New Right magazine The Scorpion. By the 1990s, his ideas on spirituality,anti-modernism, and tradition found a place in the New Age movement, and by 1998Inner Traditions, a major US esoteric publisher, had brought out Englishtranslations of many of his works. Perhaps the most ironic new advocates ofEvola’s ideas can be found in the darker side of hard rock. Starting in the late1980s, a collection of goth, heavy metal, “black metal,” and “industrial” groupsembraced much of Evola’s ethos, blending it with a heady cocktail of otherinfluences. Marilyn Manson, Blood Axis, Non, Throbbing Gristle, and other“transgressive” acts found inspiration in figures such as Charles Manson, thehigh priest of the Church of Satan Anton LaVey, the dark magician AleisterCrowley, and Aryan ideology and fascist aesthetics, among other things. MichaelMoynihan, coauthor of Lords of Chaos, a controversial account of far-right andneofascist Scandinavian black metal rock groups, is also a serious esotericscholar and has edited an English translation of Evola’s Men among the Ruins aswell as an anthology of writings from the UR Group, Introduction to Magic; bothare published by Inner Traditions. What’s ironic about this is not that thesegroups should be attracted to Evola’s ideas—they are, in their eyes, highlytransgressive, and as such perpetually attractive to youth—but that any societythat actually put them into practice would more than likely eliminate them andother advocates of “Reich and roll” as cultural undesirables.Ultimately, there is a real danger connected with Evola’s thinking: not hisobvious Fascism or racism, but the fact that his writings are not merely theravings of a lunatic. His prose is vigorous, intelligent, and often insightful,if uncongenial. Moreover, the modern world has thrown up some very realproblems, and the materialism and spiritual poverty of the West have given riseto some very unwelcome responses. It may be an understatement, but human beingsshould be motivated by something more than consumerism and the dubious cachet ofhaving “fuck” misspelled on your clothes. A hierarchical society based on racialsuperiority and a warrior breed is not, perhaps, the answer. But if historytells us anything, it’s that if moderate individuals don’t come up with a betteridea soon, the resulting ideological gap will be filled by the less moderateamong us. Current admirers of Julius Evola, I suspect, are banking on historyrepeating itself."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc14]Jung and the Occult [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc14]On February 11, 1944, Carl Gustav Jung—then sixty-eight and the world’s mostrenowned living psychologist—slipped on some ice and broke his fibula. Ten dayslater, in hospital, he suffered a myocardial infarction caused by embolisms fromhis immobilized leg. Treated with oxygen and camphor, Jung lost consciousnessand entered what seems a near-death and out-of-body experience—or, depending onyour perspective, delirium. Jung found himself floating a thousand miles abovethe earth. Seas and continents shimmered in blue light, and Jung could make outthe Arabian desert and snow-tipped Himalayas. Jung felt he was about to leaveorbit, but then, turning to the south, a huge black monolith came into view. Itwas a kind of temple, and at the entrance Jung saw a Hindu sitting in a lotusposition. Within, innumerable candles flickered, and Jung felt that the “wholephantasmagoria of earthly existence” was being stripped away. It wasn’tpleasant, and what remained was an “essential Jung,” a core of his experiences.Jung knew that inside the temple he would meet the people to whom he reallybelonged. The mystery of his existence, of his purpose in life, would beanswered. Jung was about to cross the threshold when, from below, rising up fromEurope, he saw the image of his doctor in the archetypal form of the king ofKos, the site of the temple of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. He toldJung that his departure was premature; many, most of them women, were demandinghis return—and he was there to ferry him back. When Jung heard this, he wasimmensely disappointed, and almost immediately the vision ended. Jungexperienced the reluctance to live that many who have been “brought back”encounter, but what troubled Jung most was seeing his doctor in his archetypalform. He knew this meant that the doctor had sacrificed his life to save Jung’s.Jung tried to explain, but his doctor no doubt thought he was still delirious.On April 4, 1944—a date numerologists can delight in—Jung sat up in bed for thefirst time since his heart attack. On the same day, Jung’s doctor came down withsepticemia and took to his bed. He never left it and died a few days later.Jung’s visions continued. He thought his Swiss nurse was an old Jewish woman andthat he was performing a Kabbalistic ritual, a mystic marriage of Tiphereth andMalkuth, sephiroth of the Tree of Life. Jung was convinced that he hadn’t simplyhallucinated, but that he had been granted a vision of reality. He had passedoutside time, and the experience had had a palpable effect on him. For onething, the depression and pessimism that had overcome him during World War IIvanished. But there was something more. For most of his long career, Jung hadimpressed upon his colleagues, friends, and reading public that he was, aboveall else, a scientist. He was not, he repeated almost like a mantra, a mystic,occultist, or visionary, terms of abuse his critics, who rejected his claims toscience, had used against him. Now, having returned from orbiting earth on thebrink of death, Jung seemed content to let the scientist in him take a back seatfor the remaining seventeen years of his life. (He died in 1961.)Although Jung had always believed in the reality of the “other” world, he hadtaken care not to speak too openly about this belief. Now, after his visions, heseemed less reticent. Jung had, it seems, a kind of conversion experience, andthe sort of interests the world-famous psychologist had until then kept tohimself now became common knowledge. Flying saucers, astrology, parapsychology,alchemy, even predictions of a coming new Age of Aquarius: pronouncements on allof these dubious subjects—at least from the point of view of modernscience—flowed from Jung’s pen, so many that one critic dubbed him a“journalists’ oracle.” If Jung had spent a career fighting off charges ofmysticism and occultism initially triggered by his break with Freud in 1912, bythe late 1940s he seems to have decided to stop. The “sage of Küsnacht” and“Hexenmeister of Zürich,” as Jung was known in the last decade of his life, hadarrived.Yet Jung’s involvement with the occult was with him from the start—literally, itwas in his DNA. Jung’s maternal grandfather, the Reverend Samuel Preiswerk, wholearned Hebrew because he believed it was spoken in heaven, accepted the realityof spirits and kept a chair in his study for the ghost of his deceased firstwife, who often came to visit him. Jung’s mother, Emilie, was employed by Samuelto shoo away the dead who distracted him while he was working on his sermons.She herself developed mediumistic powers in her late teens. At the age of twentyshe fell into a coma for thirty-six hours; when her forehead was touched with ared-hot poker she awoke, speaking in tongues and prophesizing. Emilie continuedto enter trance states throughout her life, when she would communicate with thedead. She also seems to have been a split personality. Jung occasionally heardher speaking to herself in a voice he soon recognized was not her own, at leastnot the voice she normally used. Emilie’s remarks then were profound andexpressed with an unexpected authority. This “other” voice had inklings of aworld far stranger than the one that young Carl knew.This “split” that Jung had seen in his mother would later appear in himself. Ataround the age of twelve, Jung literally became two people. There was hisordinary twelve-year-old self, and someone else. The “Other,” as Carl calledhim, was a figure from the eighteenth century, a masterful character who wore awhite wig and buckled shoes, drove an impressive carriage, and held young Carl,who was somewhat inept, in contempt. It’s difficult to escape the impressionthat in some ways Jung felt he was this character in a past life. Seeing anancient green carriage, Jung felt that it came from his time. Jung’s laternotion of the collective unconscious, that psychic reservoir of symbols andimages that he believed we inherit at birth, is in a sense a form ofreincarnation, and Jung himself believed in some form of an afterlife. Soonafter the death of his father in 1896, when Jung was twenty-one, he had twodreams in which his father appeared so vividly that he considered thepossibility of life after death. In another, later dream, Jung’s father askedhim for marital advice, as he wanted to prepare for his wife’s arrival. Jungtook this as a premonition, and his mother died soon after. And years later,when his sister Gertrude died—a decade before his own near-death experience—Jungwrote that “what happens after death is so unspeakably glorious that ourimagination and feelings do not suffice to form even an approximate conceptionof it.”Jung’s mother was involved in at least two well-known paranormal experiencesthat are recounted in practically every book on Jung. Sitting in his roomstudying, he suddenly heard a loud bang coming from the dining room. He rushedin and found his mother startled. The round walnut table had cracked from theedge past the center. The split didn’t follow any joint, but had passed throughsolid wood. Drying wood couldn’t account for it; the table was seventy yearsold, and it was a humid day. Jung thought, “There certainly are curiousaccidents.” As if she was reading his mind, Emilie replied in her “other” voice,“Yes, yes, that means something.” Two weeks later came a second incident.Returning home in the evening, Jung found an excited household. An hour earlierthere had been another loud crack, this time coming from a large sideboard. Noone had any idea what had produced it. Jung inspected the sideboard, then lookedinside. In a cupboard where they kept the bread, Jung found a loaf and the breadknife. The knife had shattered into several pieces, all neatly arranged in thebreadbasket. The knife had been used for tea, but no one had touched it oropened the cupboard since. When Jung took the knife to a cutler, he said thatthere was no fault in the steel and that someone must have broken it on purpose;it was the only way he could account for it. Jung kept the shattered knife forthe rest of his life, and years later he sent a photograph of it to thepsychical researcher J. B. Rhine.By this time Jung, like many others, was interested in spiritualism and readingthrough the literature—books by Zöllner, Crookes, Carl du Prel, Swedenborg, andJustinus Kerner’s classic, The Seeress of Prevorst. At the Zofingia debatingsociety at the University of Basel, he gave lectures on “The Value ofSpeculative Research” and “On the Limits of Exact Science,” in which hequestioned the dominant materialist paradigm that still reigns today. Jung ledfellow students in various occult experiments, yet when he spoke to them abouthis ideas, or lectured them about the need to take them seriously, he met withresistance. Apparently he had greater luck with his dachshund, which he feltunderstood him better and could feel supernatural presences himself.Another who seemed to feel supernatural presences was Jung’s cousin HelenePreiswerk. In a letter to J. B. Rhine about the shattered bread knife, Jungrefers to Helly—as she was known—as a “young woman with marked mediumisticfaculties” whom he had met around the time of the incident; and in hisposthumous autobiography, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1963), he remarks thathe became involved in a series of séances with his relatives after the incidentsof the bread knife and table. Yet the séances had been going on for some timebefore the two events, and their center of attention was Helly, whom Jungalready knew well and who, by all accounts, was in love with him. This is anearly sign of Jung’s somewhat ambiguous relationship with the occult.Helly came from Jung’s mother’s side of the family. She would enter a trance andfall to the floor, breathing deeply, and speaking in old Samuel Preiswerk’svoice, although she had never heard him speak. She told the others that theyshould pray for her elder sister Bertha, who, she said, had just given birth toa black child. Bertha, who was living in Brazil, had already had one child withher half-caste husband, and gave birth to another on the same day as the séance.Further séances proved equally startling. At one point Samuel Preiswerk and CarlJung, Sr.—Jung’s paternal grandfather—who had disliked each other while alive,reached a new accord in the afterlife. A warning came for another sister, whowas also expecting a child. She would lose it, the medium said, although hergrandfather tried to help her. In August the baby was born premature and dead.At other séances Helly reached more feverish states. Her sister worried for herhealth, so they stopped. One reason for stopping may have been that Helly wasusing the séances as a means of getting Jung’s attention. Helly began to uttermessages that were surprisingly similar to those in The Seeress of Prevorst,which Jung had given her for her birthday, and her reliability became shaky. Atlater séances—they started again because Jung’s mother felt the split table wasa “sign” from Samuel—Helly produced another array of voices, but the mostinteresting was a spirit named Ivenes, who called herself the real HelenePreiswerk. This character was much more mature, confident, and intelligent thanHelly, whom Jung described as absent-minded and not particularly intelligent,talented, or educated. It was as if buried beneath the unremarkable teenager wasa fuller, more commanding personality, like Jung’s “Other.” This was an insightinto the psyche that would inform Jung’s later theory of individuation, theprocess of “becoming who you are.” Helly did blossom later, becoming asuccessful dressmaker in France, although she died young, at only thirty.In Jung’s dissertation on the séances, On the Psychology and Pathology ofSo-Called Occult Phenomena (1903), he describes Helly unflatteringly as“exhibiting slightly rachitic skull formation” and “somewhat pale facial color,”and he fails to mention that she is his cousin. He also omits his ownparticipation in the séances and dates them from 1899 to 1900, when they hadstarted years before. Jung’s biographer Gerhard Wehr politely suggests that “thedoctoral candidate was obviously at pains to conceal his own role, andespecially his close kinship relationship, thus forestalling from the start anyfurther critical inquiry that might have thrown the scientific validity of theentire work into question.” In plain English, this means that Jung the scientistthought it a good career move to obscure Jung the occultist’s personalinvolvement in the business.In 1900 the twenty-five-year-old Jung joined the prestigious Burghölzli MentalClinic in Zürich. Here he did solid work in word-association tests, developedhis theory of “complexes,” and initiated a successful patient-friendly approachto working with psychotics and schizophrenics. It was during his tenure herethat he also became involved with Freud. From 1906, when they startedcorresponding, to 1912, when the friendship ruptured, Jung was a staunchsupporter of Freud’s work and promoted it unstintingly. There were, however,some rocky patches. One centered on the famous poltergeist in Freud’s bookcase.Visiting Freud in Vienna in 1909, Jung asked him about his attitude towardparapsychology. Freud was skeptical and dismissed the subject as nonsense. Jungdisagreed, and, sitting across from the master, he began to feel his diaphragmglow, as if it was becoming red-hot. Suddenly a loud bang came from a bookcase.Both jumped up, and Jung said to Freud, “There, that is an example of aso-called catalytic exteriorization phenomenon!” (Jung’s long-windedcircumlocution for a poltergeist, or “noisy spirit”). When Freud said “Bosh!”Jung predicted that another bang would immediately happen. It did. Jung saidthat from that moment on, Freud grew mistrustful of him, and that his look madehim feel he had done something against him.From Freud’s letter to Jung about the incident, one gets the feeling that hefelt Jung himself was responsible for it. This isn’t surprising; Jung didmanifest paranormal abilities. While in bed in a hotel room after giving alecture, he experienced the suicide of a patient who had a strong transferenceon him. The patient had relapsed into depression and shot himself in the head.Jung awoke in his hotel, feeling an odd pain in his forehead. He laterdiscovered that his patient had shot himself precisely where Jung felt the pain,at the same time Jung woke up. More to the point, a visitor to Jung’s home onceremarked about Jung’s “exteriorized libido,” how “when there was an importantidea that was not yet quite conscious, the furniture and woodwork all over thehouse creaked and snapped.”It was Jung’s break with Freud that led to his own “descent into theunconscious,” a disturbing trip down the psyche’s rabbit hole from which hegathered the insights about the collective unconscious that would form his ownschool of analytical psychology. He had entered a “creative illness” and wasunsure if he was going mad. In October 1913, not long after the split, Jung had,depending on your perspective, either a vision or a hallucination. On a train hesuddenly saw a flood covering Europe between the North Sea and the Alps. When itreached Switzerland, the mountains rose to protect his homeland, but in thewaves Jung saw floating debris and bodies. Then the water turned to blood. Thevision lasted an hour and seems to have been a dream that had invaded Jung’swaking consciousness. Having spent more than a decade treating mental patientswho suffered from precisely this kind of complaint, Jung had reason to beconcerned. He was ironically relieved the next summer when World War I broke outand he realized his vision had been a premonition of it. Yet the psychic tensioncontinued, and at one point Jung felt he would no longer fight off the sense ofmadness and decided to let go. When he did, he landed in an eerie, subterraneanworld where he met strange intelligences that lived in his mind. The experiencewas so upsetting that for a time Jung slept with a loaded pistol by his bed,ready to blow his brains out if the stress became too great.In his recently published Red Book (2009), Jung kept an account, in words andimages, of the objective, independent entities he encountered during his“creative illness”—entities that had nothing to do with Jung personally, but whoshared his interior world. There was Elijah and Salome, two figures from theBible who were accompanied by a snake. There was also a figure called Philemon,who became a kind of inner guru and whom Jung painted as a bald, white-beardedold man with bull’s horns and the wings of a kingfisher; as a friend pointed outto me, Philemon bears an odd resemblance to Freud. One morning, after paintingthe figure, while taking a walk Jung came upon a dead kingfisher. The birds wererare in Zürich, and Jung had never before come upon a dead one. This was one ofthe many synchronicities—“meaningful coincidences”—that happened at this time.There were others. In 1916, still in the grip of his crisis, Jung again feltthat something within wanted to get out. An eerie restlessness filled his home.Jung felt the presence of the dead, and his children did, too. One daughter sawa strange white figure; another had her blankets snatched from her at night. Hisson drew a picture of a fisherman he had seen in a dream: a flaming chimney rosefrom the fisherman’s head, and a devil flew through the air, cursing thefisherman for stealing his fish. Jung had yet to mention Philemon the kingfisherto anyone. Then, one afternoon, the doorbell rang loudly, but no one was there.Jung asked, “What in the world is this?” The voices of the dead answered, “Wehave come back from Jerusalem, where we found not what we sought,” the beginningof Jung’s strange Seven Sermons to the Dead, a work of “spiritualdictation”—also known as channeling—that he attributed to “Basilides inAlexandria, the City where the East toucheth the West.”By 1919 World War I was over and Jung’s crisis had passed, although he continuedto practice what he called “active imagination,” a kind of waking dreaming, theresults of which he recorded in The Red Book. But spirits of a more traditionalkind were not lacking. He was invited to London to lecture on “The PsychologicalFoundations of the Belief in Spirits” to the Society for Psychical Research.Jung told the SPR that ghosts and materializations were “unconsciousprojections.” “I have repeatedly observed,” Jung said, “the telepathic effectsof unconscious complexes, and also a number of parapsychic phenomena, but in allthis I see no proof whatever of the existence of real spirits, and until suchproof is forthcoming I must regard this whole territory as an appendix ofpsychology.”Scientific enough, no doubt, but a year later, again in England, Jungencountered a somewhat more real ghost. He spent some weekends in a cottage inAylesbury outside of London rented by Maurice Nicoll (later a student ofGurdjieff and P. D. Ouspensky), and while there was serenaded by eerie sounds asan unpleasant smell filled the bedroom. Locals said the place was haunted, andone particularly bad night, Jung discovered an old woman’s head on the pillownext to his; half of her face was missing. Jung leaped out of bed and waiteduntil morning in an armchair. The house was later torn down.One would think that having already encountered the dead on their return fromJerusalem, Jung wouldn’t be shaken by a fairly standard English ghost, but theexperience rattled him. Yet his account of it only appeared thirty years later,in 1949, in an obscure anthology of ghost stories. When his lecture for the SPRwas reprinted in the Collected Works in 1947, Jung added a footnote, explainingthat he no longer felt as certain as he did in 1919 that apparitions wereexplicable through psychology and that he doubted “whether an exclusivelypsychological approach can do justice to the phenomena.” In a later postscripthe again admitted that his earlier explanation was insufficient, but that hecouldn’t agree on the reality of spirits, because he had no experience of them,conveniently forgetting the haunting in Aylesbury. But in a letter of 1946 toFritz Kunkel, a psychotherapist, Jung admits that “metapsychic phenomena couldbe explained better by the hypothesis of spirits than by the qualities andpeculiarities of the unconscious.”A similar ambiguity surrounds Jung’s experience with the I Ching, the ancientChinese oracle, which he began to experiment with in the early 1920s and which,like horoscopes, became part of his therapeutic practice. Although Jungmentioned the I Ching here and there in his writing, it wasn’t until 1949, againnearly thirty years later, in his introduction to the classic Wilhelm-Baynestranslation, that he admitted outright to using it himself. And although hetried to explain the I Ching’s efficacy through what would become his paranormaldeus ex machina, synchronicity, Jung admits that the source of the oracle’sinsights are the “spiritual agencies” that form the “living soul of the book,” aremark at odds with his quasi-scientific explanation. Ironically, his major workon “meaningful coincidence,” Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle(1952), written with the physicist Wolfgang Pauli, provides only one unambiguousexample of the phenomenon, and readers like me, who accept the reality ofsynchronicity, come away slightly baffled by Jung’s attempt to account for it bymeans of archetypes, quantum physics, statistical analysis, mathematics, J. B.Rhine’s experiments with ESP, astrology, telepathy, precognition, and otherparanormal abilities, all of which read like a recrudescence of Jung’s “I am ascientist” reflex.In the 1920s, Jung plunged into a study of the Gnostics—whom he had encounteredas early as 1912—and alchemy, and it was he more than anyone else who salvagedthe ancient Hermetic pursuit from intellectual oblivion. Another Hermeticpractice he followed was astrology, which he began to study seriously around thetime of his break with Freud. Jung informed his inner circle that castinghoroscopes was part of his therapeutic practice, but it was during the dark daysof World War II that he recognized a wider application. In 1940, in a letter toH. G. Baynes, Jung speaks of a vision he had in 1918 in which he saw “firefalling like rain from heaven and consuming the cities of Germany.” Jung feltthat 1940 was the crucial year “when we approach the meridian of the first starin Aquarius.” It was, he said, “the premonitory earthquake of the New Age.” Jungwas familiar with the precession of the equinoxes, the apparent backwardmovement of the sun through the signs of the zodiac. By acting as a backdrop tosunrise at the vernal equinox, each sign gives its name to an “age”—called a“Platonic month”—which lasts roughly 2150 years. In his strange book Aion(1951), Jung argues that the individuation of Western civilization as a wholefollows the path of the Platonic months and presents a kind of “precession ofthe archetypes.” Fish symbolism surrounds Christ because Christ was the centralsymbol of the Age of Pisces, the astrological sign of the fish. Previous ages,of Taurus and Aries, produced bull and ram symbolism. The coming age is that ofAquarius, the water-bearer. In conversation with Margaret Ostrowski-Sachs, afriend of the writer Hermann Hesse, Jung admitted that he had kept this “secretknowledge” to himself for years and only finally made it public in Aion. Jungwasn’t sure he was “allowed” to, but during his illness he received“confirmation” that he should.Although the scholar of arcana Gerald Massey and the French esotericist Paul LeCour had earlier spoken of a coming Age of Aquarius, Jung was certainly the mostprestigious mainstream figure to do so, and it is through him that the ideabecame a mainstay of the counterculture of the 1960s and ’70s. This was mostlythrough his comments about it in his book Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth ofThings Seen in the Sky (1958), in which Jung argued that UFOs were basicallymandalas from outer space. During his crisis, Jung had come upon the image ofthe mandala, the Sanskrit “magic circle,” as a symbol of psychic wholeness, andhe suggested that flying saucers were mass archetypal projections formed by thepsychic tension produced by the Cold War that was heating up between Russia andAmerica. The Western world, he argued, was having a nervous breakdown, and UFOswere a way of relieving the stress.Jung wrote prophetically:My conscience as a psychiatrist bids me fulfil my duty and prepare those few whowill hear me for coming events which are in accord with the end of an era…. Aswe know from ancient Egyptian history, they are symptoms of psychic changes thatalways appear at the end of one Platonic month and at the beginning of another.They are, it seems, changes in the constellation of the psychic dominants, ofthe archetypes or “Gods” as they used to be called, which bringabout…long-lasting transformations of the collective psyche. This transformationstarted…in the transition of the Age of Taurus to that of Aries, and then fromAries to Pisces, whose beginning coincides with the rise of Christianity. We arenow nearing that great change…when the spring-point enters Aquarius.Ten years later the Fifth Dimension (whose name suggests the cosmic character ofthe Mystic Sixties) had a hit song from the hippie musical Hair echoing Jung’sideas, and millions of people all over the world believed it was “the dawning ofthe Age of Aquarius.”Jung died just on the cusp of the occult revival of the 1960s, a renaissance ofmagical thinking that he did much to bring about. He was also directlyresponsible for the “journey to the East” that many took then and continue totake today. Along with the I Ching, Jung gave his imprimatur to such arcaneitems as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Taoism, Zen, and other forms of thewisdom of the East, without which it is debatable if these Eastern imports wouldhave had the popularity they had. That Jung was in many ways a founding fatherof the Love Generation is seen by his inclusion on the cover of the Beatles’Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band album (1967), a work that more or lessushered in the age of pop psychedelia, although Jung himself would have thoughtflower power sadly naïve. Although for all his efforts Jung has never beenaccepted by mainstream intellectuals, his effect on popular culture has beenimmense, and our contemporary grass roots, inner-directed spirituality hasJung’s name written all over it. Jung himself may have been equivocal about hisrelationship with mysticism, magic, and the occult, but the millions of peopletoday who pay attention to their dreams, notice strange coincidences, andconsult the I Ching have the old sage of Küsnacht to thank for it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc15]Ouspensky in London [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc15]For Russian intellectuals not partial to the Bolshevik revolution, 1919 wasn’texactly a good year. The earthquakes of anarchy brought on by a world war andthen a civil war, and the prospect of an unknown and uncertain future, sentartists and thinkers suspicious of Lenin and the Bolsheviks running to Europe.Berlin, Paris, and London swelled with the influx of émigrés. And for esotericphilosophers, obsessed with questions of time, consciousness, and the“psychology of man’s possible evolution,” it may have seemed a particularlyinauspicious year.Such might have been the feeling of P. D. Ouspensky, philosopher of the eternalrecurrence, author of a work on translogical metaphysics, and, at the time, asomewhat beleaguered student of the enigmatic Greco-Armenian teacher, G. I.Gurdjieff.In chapter eighteen of his masterpiece, In Search of the Miraculous (1949), thestory of his time with Gurdjieff, Ouspensky tells of his escape from therevolution and of his journey across Russia, from St. Petersburg through theCaucasus, to Turkey, Constantinople, and the outskirts of Europe. The recordreads like an adventure story. Russia at that time had become a vast minefieldof war, famine, sickness, and crime, and Ouspensky’s report rivals the less thanverifiable accounts of Gurdjieff’s own spiritual journeys in Meetings withRemarkable Men (1963). As a journalist, Ouspensky covered the revolution in aseries of letters for the New Age, the London magazine of ideas edited by theman who would soon take Ouspensky’s place as Gurdjieff’s chief lieutenant, A. R.Orage.Ouspensky’s account of everyday life during the revolution, his analysis ofpolitical events, and his profound antipathy for the Bolsheviks come through inhis Letters from Russia: 1919. They flesh out the cool, distant, philosophicalvoice characteristic of In Search of the Miraculous. Times were difficult. Inone letter he writes: “I personally am still alive only because my boots andtrousers and other articles of clothing—all ‘old campaigners’—are still holdingtogether. When they end their existence, I shall evidently end mine.”While the workers of the world united, the author of books on the Tarot, thefourth dimension, and the superman, whose talks about India and his travels inthe East filled lecture halls in St. Petersburg and Moscow, carried luggage as ahouse porter to support his family.But in 1919 Ouspensky experienced more than a physical journey and revolution.As the charismatic “arch-disturber of sleep” Gurdjieff led his band of studentsacross an exploding Russia, Ouspensky faced his growing doubts about his teacherand decided to act. Since 1915, when they first met in a cheap Moscow café,Ouspensky had sat at Gurdjieff’s feet and absorbed his teaching. The irony ofmeeting the “magician” Gurdjieff in precisely the drab, gray, everyday worldthat Ouspensky had journeyed to the East in order to escape was not lost on hiscommentators—nor, I think, on Ouspensky himself.At the start of his inner and outer adventures with Gurdjieff, which wouldeventually lead him to London and independent work, Ouspensky said that he “hadcome to the conclusion a long time ago that there was no escape from thelabyrinth of contradictions in which we live except by an entirely new road,unlike anything hitherto known or used by us.” He knew then as “an undoubtedfact that beyond the thin film of false reality there existed another realityfrom which, for some reason, something separated us.”The “miraculous” that he searched for was a penetration into this new reality.That he should find it in an unfashionable back-street café, frequented by smalldealers and commission agents, and not in the ashrams of India or the bamboojungles of Ceylon, must have piqued his sense of the absurd. Subsequent eventscould only have added to it, not the least of them his uncertainty aboutGurdjieff as a transmitter of what Ouspensky later came to call the “system.”As any practitioner of Gurdjieff’s Fourth Way soon discovers, a mystery theateratmosphere surrounds the lives of its early advocates. Some see the splitbetween guru and chela as a vast historical symbol, a living hieroglyph ofesoteric wisdom, acted out by Gurdjieff and Ouspensky for some reason unknown totheir followers and perhaps unknowable except for some future students. Otherssee Ouspensky as a weak intellectual, unable to grasp the true import ofGurdjieff’s teachings; see, for example, James Moore’s less than unbiasedaccount in Gurdjieff: The Anatomy of a Myth (1991) and William PatrickPatterson’s Struggle of the Magicians (1997). Still others, like me, simplyrecognize that however remarkable a man Gurdjieff was, Ouspensky himself was nopushover. The mind capable of writing A New Model of the Universe (1931) wouldsooner or later leave Gurdjieff’s nest and set up on his own.And such, at the beginning of his perilous escape from the revolution, wereOuspensky’s own thoughts. During a six-week stay in Essentuki, in the Caucasus,Gurdjieff, according to Ouspensky, began to change. Suddenly, for no reason, heabandoned the “work on themselves” he had put his followers through for theprevious three years and said he was leaving for the Black Sea. Why had hestopped, especially after the great difficulties his group had faced in gettingthe “work” started there? Ouspensky “had to confess that my confidence in G.began to waver from this moment.” Thus began a separation that cost thephilosopher many a painful decision and a trial by fire that at times had thepotential of costing him his life.It is clear from his letters that Ouspensky loathed his time in Ekaterinodar, acity of squalor, bribery, and sickness. He came there by way of Essentuki, wherehe had arrived at his momentous decision to leave Gurdjieff. It was not a suddenrevelation, but the product of a slow, cumulative process. “For a whole year,”he writes, “something had been accumulating and I gradually began to see thatthere were many things I could not understand and that I had to go.”And so he tried. When conditions got worse—with Cossack raids on theBolshevik-occupied city—Ouspensky decided to leave. He would try to reachLondon, where he knew Orage and others from the New Age and where he could makea living with his pen. But he wouldn’t leave before Gurdjieff. Reluctant toabandon his teacher, Ouspensky stayed until the last moment, waiting untilGurdjieff left before making his own departure.But by then it was too late. Madness erupted, and Ouspensky was trapped. Allways out of Essentuki were cut off. For a man who had been taught that humanbeings are in prison, caged by the walls of “sleep,” the less metaphoricalrestraints of a bandit Bolshevik regime, complete with robberies, executions,requisitions, and famine were, one suspects, a gold mine of opportunities toremember himself. And indeed it was during this period that Ouspensky discovereda strange new self-confidence. Not ordinary self-confidence, but rather a“confidence in the unimportance and the insignificance of the self, that selfwhich we usually know.” If something big faced him, something that would strainhis every nerve, this new “I,” he believed, would be equal to it. And this,Ouspensky wrote, was the result of his work with Gurdjieff.By early January 1920, Ouspenky found himself in Constantinople, washed to theedge of Europe by the great wave of the revolution. Friends had died; he and hisfamily had suffered hardship, although they were, he tells us, more fortunatethan others. But in a city already brimming over with refugees, expositors ofesoteric psychologies were not in the best position to earn a living. Once againchallenged by necessity, Ouspensky supported his family by teachingEnglish—which he spoke poorly—to his fellow Russian émigrés.He managed to get other work as well. He set up lectures and started groups,discussing psychology and philosophy in relation to esotericism. Gurdjieff soonarrived, and the two worked together in what now seems like a last honeymoon offruitful activity before the categorical split. Although Ouspensky still had hisdoubts, he agreed to help Gurdjieff translate material for his ballet, TheStruggle of the Magicians, perhaps a more apt swan song for their collaborationthan either suspected at the time. They visited the Mevlevi dervishes in Pera,the European quarter of the city, where Gurdjieff had begun one of his manyInstitutes for the Harmonious Development of Man. They also walked through themaze of bazaars, where, more than likely, Gurdjieff wangled a deal or two on theside.And then the miracle happened. If Ouspensky had hoped to find the miraculousthrough Gurdjieff, what happened to him in June 1921 was an event almostspecifically designed to make him believe in the possibility of fairygodmothers. Unknown to Ouspensky, Claude Bragdon, an artist and publisher, hadput out a translation of Ouspensky’s first major work, Tertium Organum (1912),in America. To his amazement, Bragdon discovered he had a bestseller on hishands. A young Russia émigré, Nicholas Bessaraboff, had arrived at Bragdon’sdoor with a copy of Ouspenky’s metaphysical prose poem on time, eternity, andthe fourth dimension, demanding Bragdon publish it. Bragdon, who spoke Russian,read it and did publish it. Now, through the offices of the New Age, he hadmanaged to track its mysterious author down and sent him a substantial royaltycheck. Ouspensky must have had a peak experience when it arrived. He had madecontact with the outside world at last. It had come to him.Ouspensky asked Bragdon for help getting himself and his family to London.Difficulties arose. Then the second miracle occurred. Bragdon received atelegram from Viscountess Rothermere, wife of a powerful English newspaperbaron. Tertium Organum had stimulated her immensely, and she absolutely had tomeet its publisher. An afternoon visit to Bragdon’s office led to anothertelegram, this one to Ouspenky: “DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY YOUR BOOK TERTIUM ORGANUMWISH TO MEET YOU NEW YORK OR LONDON WILL PAY ALL EXPENSES.”And if that wasn’t miracle enough, a cable for one hundred pounds was included,a sizeable sum at the time. Visas were all that remained, difficult things tocome by for refugees. But again luck was on Ouspensky’s side. J. G. Bennett, whowould later become the third major interpreter of Gurdjieff’s work (afterOuspensky and Orage), was at that time an agent in the British Foreign Service,stationed in Constantinople. He had met Ouspensky and had helped him secure aplace for his meetings. Bennett arranged the paperwork, and Ouspensky was soonon his way to London.Previously a hungry philosopher, lifting suitcases for his daily crust, theforty-three-year-old Ouspensky arrived in London as the feted author of abestselling work on metaphysics, a romantic survivor of the collapse of Russia,the teacher of a system that was a revolution in its own right, and the darling,at least for a time, of a wealthy and beautiful woman eager to introduce him toLondon’s literary circles and wine and dine him at her expense. Surely Ouspenskyhad found the miraculous.His arrival in London was greeted with the kind of reception every authorfantasizes about at least once in his lifetime. Colin Wilson, no stranger to asudden eruption into fame, gives an idea of what Ouspensky found when he got offthe boat in August 1921. It was, he writes, a “fairy-tale reception” by the“beautiful Lady Rothermere”:Then a magnificent party…at which they ate with gold knives and forks from whatlooked like gold plates. The fairy-tale continued. When Ouspensky gave his firstlectures in Lady Rothermere’s studio in St. John’s Wood, they were attended bythe cream of London’s intelligentsia, including Orage, T. S. Eliot, AldousHuxley, Gerald Heard…. Ouspensky’s buildup had been impressive: a mysteriousforeign philosopher who had been forced to flee from the Bolsheviks, had enduredimmense hardships and…against all the odds, had made his way to London…hislectures turned out to be…startlingly new and strange. The conquest wascomplete. Ouspensky had become the intellectual flavor of the month.Ouspensky’s first stop was a hotel in Bloomsbury, that part of London associatedwith the British Museum, Virginia Woolf, and Lytton Strachey. Later he moved toa small studio flat in Gwendwr Road, near Baron’s Court, paid for by LadyRothermere. The building, now demolished, was described by Kenneth Walker as oneof Victorian style, “uniformly dismal in pattern.” During a meeting withOuspensky, Walker inspected the atmosphere of the philosopher’s “cell,”Ouspensky’s home for more than a decade. He found a small bed, two armchairs, agas fire, a low bookcase, and a low mahogany table. Books, papers, letters,pens, a typewriter, a camera, a galvanometer, and an “unknown scientificinstrument” wrestled for space. Reproductions of the old masters hung on thewalls. A hunk of bread and a half-eaten tin of sardines atop the mantelpiecesuggested “a nice disregard for the inconvenience of which life is chieflycomposed.”Soon Ouspensky began to hold meetings to expound Gurdjieff’s system, first inLady Rothermere’s studio, later in Warwick Gardens in Kensington. Eventually, asattendance at his lectures grew in the 1930s, Ouspensky acquired first a largehouse in Gadsden, Kent, then Lyne Place in Virginia Water, a suburb of London.In Lyne Place he set up an institute comparable in size, character, and ambitionto Gurdjieff’s own Prieuré in Fontainebleau, outside Paris.Although Ouspensky had doubts about his teacher and was resolved to scale theuncongenial heights of higher consciousness on his own, he neverthelesscontinued to have faith in the system. Gurdjieff himself may have gone off therails—readers can consult the evidence and conclude for themselves—but the“work” was Ouspensky’s bedrock. At least until his bizarre last meetings in1947, shortly before his death. In the end, after teaching the system for morethan twenty-five years, a sick, tired, and searingly honest Ouspensky shockedhis audience in Colet Gardens by announcing that there was no system and thatthey had to start again from the beginning and think for themselves.Before Gurdjieff, Ouspensky was an enthusiastic artist-philosopher, in love withnature, beauty, art, and the fairer sex and confident of our ability to push themind into the farther reaches of reality. And after Gurdjieff? What is evidentis that the years of fruitless search, his demanding work with Gurdjieff, andthe challenges of living in a war-torn and revolutionary Russia took their toll.J. G. Bennett tells the story that males in the Ouspensky clan alternatedbetween life-loving Peters and world-denying Demians. Ouspenksy was dealt anuncomfortably equal share of both characters. Few in London knew the Ouspenskywho had caroused with Russian Symbolist poets at the Stray Dog Café,headquarters of prerevolutionary St. Petersburg’s avant-garde. But if any had,they would have noticed a change. The Ouspensky who arrived in a London eagerfor spiritual renewal and soon to give forth a Waste Land offered a teachingthat would shock many, disgust a few, and exhilarate others. He was a veryserious man. Peter hadn’t disappeared entirely; Ouspensky was fond of good foodand frequented a Chinese restaurant on Oxford Street. But Demian had gained theupper hand.And the teaching? Man is “asleep.” We are robots driven by outside forces. Wethink we have will and consciousness and that we are free, but this belief isprecisely the prison that cages us and the soporific that keeps us asleep. Thefirst move in our “war against sleep” is to realize our absolute mechanicalnessand inability to do.Many were not taken with the message, or with the messenger. The occultist A. E.Waite, author of books on mysticism and Kabbalah, is said to have walked out ofone of Ouspensky’s lectures, saying, “Mr. Ouspensky, there is no love in yoursystem.” Dry, professorial, and brief, Ouspensky was unlike the effervescentlycharming Orage, who believed that in Ouspensky he had found “someone whoknows”—until, that is, he met Gurdjieff himself. Unflatteringly compared inappearance to Woodrow Wilson, the stout, solid, close-cropped, white-haired,pincenezed Ouspensky lacked Gurdjieff’s incomparable panache.The writer Rom Landau, author of the bestselling God Is My Adventure (1939) andlater a student of Ouspensky, tells of Ouspensky’s reserve, born of a“self-discipline not to indulge in superfluous little activities…. WhateverOuspensky had to say was said in the shortest possible way, and was followed bysilence.” Some described him as a man of “dominant, if not domineering type ofcharacter.” Others said he looked like “a dejected bird, huddled up in a rainstorm.”In many ways, Ouspensky was not really cut out for the role he began to play inEngland and later in the United States: that of the esoteric teacher. He was,first and foremost, a romantic philosopher and writer. The admirably hard-edgedlogic and unswerving precision he brought to the “work” was in many ways paidfor by the slow desiccation of his more gentle artistic side. This side becameknown to people who got close to him, like C. S. Nott, whose Journey throughThis World (1969) gives an account of meeting Ouspensky at Lyne Place in 1936.By then the recourse to drink that would eventually kill him had begun, as hadthe nostalgic evocations of older times in Russia.But before these sad developments, Ouspensky enjoyed an opportunity to influencea select audience of London’s literary lights that any thinker, esoteric orotherwise, would envy. One can imagine the exchange, verbal or perhaps moresubtle, between him and T. S. Eliot as they eyed each other at Lady Rothermere’ssoirée. Much of Eliot’s poetry deals with the themes of time, eternity, and ourinveterate tendency to avoid seeing the world as it really is, all themescentral to Ouspensky’s message. In Four Quartets Eliot wrote, “Time present andtime past / Are both perhaps present in time future / And time future containedin time past,” an Ouspenskian proposition if there ever was one.Ouspensky made some significant immediate conquests among the intelligent menand women who attended his lectures, dissatisfied with the spiritual lassitudeof England between the wars. Along with acquiring Kenneth Walker, a HarleyStreet physician and author of a spiritual autobiography, Ouspensky also stoleone of C. G. Jung’s early followers in England, in whom Jung had high hopes.Maurice Nicoll, later to be the author of Psychological Commentaries on theTeachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, returned from his first encounter withOuspensky so excited that he shook his pregnant wife awake to tell her of theexperience. Before meeting Ouspensky, during a dark night of the soul, Nicollhad prayed to the god Hermes for a message, a way out of confusion. Ouspensky,he believed, was his answer, and he later went on to teach the system in his ownheavily Christianized variant.This descent is familiar to students of the Fourth Way. What is less known isOuspensky’s influence on literary history. Like Tertium Organum’s effect on theRussian avant-garde, the presence of Ouspenskian ideas in English literaturebetween the wars is a topic rarely discussed in the academy. But along withEliot, ideas from the system appeared in the work of other major writers. Thecharacter of Mr. Proptor in Aldous Huxley’s After Many a Summer (1939) is saidto be modeled on Ouspensky. “All personality is a prison,” Huxley’s charactersays. “Potential good is anything that helps you get out of prison”—an aphorismthat wouldn’t be out of place in one of Ouspensky’s lectures. In The HarmoniousCircle: The Lives and Work of G. I. Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, and TheirFollowers (1980), James Webb suggests that Huxley researched the perennialphilosophy by attending Ouspensky’s meetings and points out that Huxley refersto “negative emotions,” a central “work” term, in his description of a bad tripin The Doors of Perception (1954). Charles Williams, the Dante scholar andmember of the latter-day Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, wrote a noveldealing with aspects of time and space familiar to Ouspensky. Many Dimensions(1931) posits a universe very much like Ouspensky’s new model. But not all werewell-disposed to Ouspensky’s theories. The vitriolic artist and writer WyndhamLewis, who characterized Gurdjieff as a “Levantine psychic shark,” lumpedOuspensky together with other “fancy time theorists” like Henri Bergson, MarcelProust, and Charlie Chaplin in his critique of modern culture, Time and WesternMan (1927).Yet it was as a philosopher of time, and not as an exponent of Gurdjieff’ssystem, that Ouspensky would have his most direct influence on English letters.September 22, 1937, was the first night of the famous playwright and novelist J.B. Priestley’s new play, I Have Been Here Before. Visitors to the Royal Theatrethat evening read in their programs that the strange theories of time andrecurrence of the character of Dr. Gortler were based on an “astonishing book,”A New Model of the Universe, by one P. D. Ouspensky. As Kenneth Walker’s accounttells us, Ouspensky, suffering a hangover from his uncertain days in Russia,conducted his teaching in an atmosphere of secrecy, shunning public attention.To have his name read each night by the audience of a West End theater whilewatching a hit play must have seemed quite a cosmic joke, although it certainlydidn’t hurt the sales of the book. Priestley, having been exposed to Ouspensky’sideas about eternal recurrence and six-dimensional time, dove deeply into them,but never managed to meet the man himself. His very celebrity made Ouspensky seehim as a potential “threat to security.” This didn’t stop Priestley, a“time-haunted man,” from spending the rest of his career in some ways pursuingthe questions raised by Ouspensky and later by Maurice Nicoll.The symbiosis between art and reality is rife with irony. The very atmosphere ofmystery that surrounded Ouspensky, made public through Priestley’s play, lenthim the dramatic air of the character of Dr. Gortler and, for a time, attractedmore attention to him. Foreign, enigmatic, preoccupied, impatient of thecivilities that make up our usual social conduct, Ouspensky appeared in theconsciousness of cultured London in the late 1930s much like Priestley’scharacter. A man from elsewhere and elsewhen, refugee or exile, who in somestrange way saw deeper into the ambiguous face of the world than the rest of us.A man for whom time, indeed, was of the essence. If Ouspensky’s later years werefilled with sadness and disappointment, his journey out of the chaos of hishomeland into a literary London eager to hear his message has the aura of myth.It is a timeless symbol of the eternal search that the Ouspensky of TertiumOrganum believed was the meaning of life."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc16]Jean Gebser: Leaping into the Unknown [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc16]The German-born cultural philosopher Jean Gebser (1905–1973) is one of the mostimportant thinkers of the twentieth century. Unfortunately, only some of hiswork has been translated into English. This is a loss. Gebser’s ideas about the“structures of consciousness” and his belief that we are experiencing the riseof a new form of consciousness, which he called the “integral,” offer some ofthe most fruitful insights into understanding the state of Western consciousnessin the first decade of the twenty-first century.Although writers and thinkers like Ken Wilber, William Irwin Thompson, GeorgFeuerstein, Colin Wilson, and Daniel Pinchbeck have discussed Gebser’s ideas indifferent ways (I write about him at length in A Secret History ofConsciousness), Gebser’s name rings few bells among average readers. This isn’tsurprising. Gebser comes out of the Central European intellectual tradition, thestream of Western thought that produced such important but difficultphilosophers as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Martin Heidegger, and JürgenHabermas—intensely stimulating thinkers all, but not noted for easy reading.Also, Gebser’s untimely death at the age of sixty-eight meant that for the mostpart his influence was limited to his immediate circle. If a few readers of thisessay are inspired by it to tackle Gebser for themselves, I’ll consider itspurpose fulfilled.Those inspired readers will certainly face a demanding challenge. Gebser’smagnum opus, The Ever-Present Origin (first published in Germany in 1949 but nottranslated into English until 1984) is an immense, six-hundred-page-longexploration into an insight—a “lightning-like inspiration,” as he called it—thatfirst came to Gebser in Spain in 1931. This insight, that a new kind ofconsciousness was beginning to appear in the West, came to Gebser through hisstudy of poetry, particularly that of the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Ashe unraveled his insight, Gebser soon saw that evidence for this newconsciousness could be found in developments in science, too. In fact, the morehe thought about it, the more Gebser discovered signs of this new consciousnessin practically all aspects of Western culture. For the next eighteen years,Gebser gathered and organized his thoughts on what he called an impending“mutation” in consciousness, the most immediate manifestation of which was whathe called the breakdown of the “mental-rational structure” of consciousness, thedominant scientistic, rationalististic, reductive paradigm that has held swayover the West for the last few centuries. In 1949, when the first part of TheEver-Present Origin appeared—to be followed by the second in 1952—Gebsermarshaled some of the most convincing arguments that a shift in Westernconsciousness was indeed taking place and that its consequences would be felt bypeople of his and the following generations. In other words, by us.Gebser was born in Posen, in what was then Prussia, in a particularly pivotalyear. In 1905 Albert Einstein formulated his special theory of relativity, andit was Einstein’s work, along with that of other thinkers and writers, thatprovided Gebser with powerful evidence for the peculiar shift in our “timesense” that characterizes the new structure of consciousness he saw unfolding. Afew years earlier, in 1900, Sigmund Freud had published his groundbreakingInterpretation of Dreams. Other seminal developments occurred around the sametime. The physicist Max Planck completed his theory of the quantum, which led tothe overthrow of classical physics, and the philosopher Edmund Husserlestablished the foundations of phenomenology, the rigorous investigation ofconsciousness that would lead to existentialism. For a thinker whose work wouldfocus on sudden shifts in the history of consciousness, Gebser certainly pickedan auspicious year in which to be born.By the time he was ten, all of Europe had exploded into the First World War, andGebser’s childhood was filled with chaos and disruption. Early on he had anexperience which helped him deal with a world thrown into confusion. While atpreparatory school, he jumped from a high dive into a deep pool. He felt thatthe leap into the pool was also a leap into the unknown, and it was then that helost his “fear in the face of uncertainty.” “A sense of confidence began tomature within me,” he wrote, “a confidence in the sources of our strength andbeing and in their immediate accessibility.” Gebser christened this confidenceUrvertrauen, “primal trust,” a change from the Urangst, or “primal fear,” thatcharacterizes much of our experience of life.Gebser’s “primal trust” helped him negotiate many future leaps into the unknown.One occurred when he abandoned an apprenticeship at a bank for an uncertaincareer in literature. In his early twenties, with a friend Gebser started aliterary journal and publishing company. Many of his first poems saw print then,and throughout his life Gebser continued to write poetry, finding in language away into the mysteries of consciousness; it was also around this time that hediscovered Rilke. The economic collapse of the Weimar Republic devastatedGebser’s family and provided yet another confrontation with uncertainty; theylost their savings and were brought to ruin, and Gebser himself felt the effectof the growing strength of Hitler’s National Socialism at first hand. It wasRilke’s vision of a state of being in which one could affirm everything—the“praise in spite of” embodied in the Angel of the Duino Elegies—that helpedGebser through this time, and he finally overcame the thoughts of suicide thatoppressed him. Yet by 1929, the campaign of political violence unleashed byHitler’s Brown Shirts convinced Gebser it was time to make another leap.For the next few years Gebser lived as a kind of European internal exile, movingabout from Italy, back to Germany, then to Paris, then southern France, finallysettling in Spain in 1931. It was here, as noted, that his original inspirationinto the structures of consciousness occurred, yet Spain too was only atemporary haven. These were the years when Generalissimo Francisco Franco’sfascists overthrew the legitimate socialist government, and in 1936, Gebserbarely missed being killed when he left Spain for France just hours before hisMadrid apartment was shelled. As it was, he was almost executed at the border.In Paris he moved among the artistic elite and became friends with many of them,including Pablo Picasso. But Paris was no home either. In August 1939 Gebsercrossed from France into Switzerland two hours before the borders were closed;not long after, the Nazis marched below the Arc de Triomphe.As it did for so many others, Switzerland proved a safe haven for Gebser, and itwas here that he settled down to his life’s work. For the next thirty-threeyears, Gebser devoted his life to unpacking his ideas about the changes takingplace in Western consciousness, lecturing, among other places, at the Instituteof Applied Psychology in Zürich. Here he met and befriended C. G. Jung, withwhose work his own has much in common; this led to Gebser lecturing at the C. G.Jung Institute and also to his becoming a familiar contributor to the annualEranos Lectures held in Ascona, Switzerland, where his name became associatedwith other thinkers like Mircea Eliade, Gershom Scholem, Erich Neumann, HenryCorbin, and Jung himself, who presided over the gatherings. After World War IIGebser traveled, visiting India, the Near East, and North and South America.Although his work is, for the most part, focused on the cultural and collectiveexpressions of the current “mutation” in consciousness, in Sarnath, India he hada mystical experience that moved him deeply. His “satori experience,” as hecalled it, was so profound that he was reluctant to speak of it; he kept it asecret until 1971, when he revealed it to his biographer and interpreter, GeorgFeuerstein. He wrote to Feuerstein that it was a “transfiguration andirradiation of the indescribable, unearthly, transparent ‘Light.’” It was, hesaid, a “spiritual clarity, a quiet jubilation, a knowledge of invulnerability,a primal trust,” linking this new affirmation of life with his first, youthfulleap into the unknown. After it, he felt “recast inwardly,” adding, “SinceSarnath, everything is in its proper place.”Like his early experience, the insight at Sarnath helped Gebser to deal with hisgrowing ill health, a demanding workload, and the recognition that the West hadmoved again into a dangerous time of uncertainty. The Cold War was heating up,and Gebser was convinced that “the crisis we are experiencing today…is not justa European crisis.” It was “a crisis of the world and mankind such as hasoccurred previously only during pivotal junctures.” In 1966 Gebser’s healthcollapsed; asthma, which had troubled him throughout his life, worsened, and hewas forced to curtail his travels and abandon new projects. Gebser never fullyrecovered, but he continued to write, and he was aware of the new interest inconsciousness and spirituality that had arisen in the Mystic Decade of the ’60sand early ‘70s. Speaking to a younger generation of readers eager to know moreabout different forms of consciousness and familiar with the work of SriAurobindo and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (two other thinkers concerned with theevolution of consciousness), in a preface to a new edition of The Ever-PresentOrigin, Gebser wrote that “the principal subject of the book, proceeding fromman’s altered relationship to time, is the new consciousness, and to this thoseof the younger generation are keenly attuned.” By the time Gebser wrote this, in1973, ideas of a new consciousness had spread throughout the counterculture, andthe attempt to launch a new paradigm—known variously as the Aquarian Age, theNew Age, the Aquarian Conspiracy, and other titles—had taken root. Gebser diedthe same year, convinced that a new kind of consciousness was being born. Itwould be a difficult labor, however, and there was no guarantee againstmiscarriage.What is the new consciousness Gebser saw on the rise? Here it is impossible togive more than a brief indication of what he spelled out in meticulous andfascinating detail in The Ever-Present Origin, and readers wanting a goodintroduction to his work should find a copy of Georg Feuerstein’s excellentStructures of Consciousness (Integral Publishing, 1987) or my own Secret Historyof Consciousness. Gebser believed that consciousness has gone through fourprevious “structures,” each achieving a further separation and distinction froman atemporal, immaterial, spiritual source that he called “origin.” This is nota simple, temporal beginning, but an eternal “presence,” an “ever-presentreality” that is by nature “divine and spiritual,” “before all time,” and “theentirety of the very beginning.” For readers who are already scratching theirheads, I should point out that one of the difficulties in reading Gebser is thathe unavoidably uses language based on our present consciousness structure tospeak about types of consciousness that precede or transcend it. With this inmind, a comparison of Gebser’s “origin” with the “implicate order” of thephysicist David Bohm may be helpful. Bohm’s implicate order is also an atemporalunity out of which our present universe of space-time emerges, and the processof this emergence is rather like those Japanese paper pellets that, when droppedinto water, unfold into various shapes. For Gebser the“pellet”—“origin”—contains within itself, in a form of “latency,” the furtherconsciousness structures that unfold over time. “Latency” is a central idea inGebser, embodying the “demonstrable presence of the future.”The first consciousness structure to unfold is the archaic. In essence, it isn’tappreciably different from origin. It is, Gebser says, “zero-dimensional,” beinglittle more than the first slight ripple of difference between origin and itslatent unfolding. Here consciousness is identical with the world; it’s a stateof “complete non-differentiation between man and the universe.” Out of this themagical structure unfolds. This doesn’t differ greatly from the archaic, but theseparation from origin has increased. Where in the archaic structure there isidentity between consciousness and the world, in the magical structure there isunity between them. At this stage, our ancestors lived in a kind of group ortribal consciousness, which was still strongly linked to nature. Gebser speaksof a “vegetative intertwining of all living things” during this stage, and heaptly links Jung’s notion of synchronicity—and the effects of “magic”—to thisstructure. Gebser makes it clear that all of the previous consciousnessstructures are still present in consciousness today, and that the magicalstructure is at work in all experiences of group consciousness. Sadly, forGebser, the most immediate expressions of group consciousness were the Nazirallies that drove him out of Germany. Today, many people who believe they areentering “higher” states of consciousness by receding back into a “tribal” modeare actually simply sinking into a uncritical acceptance of the magicalstructure.Out of the magical comes the mythic. Here consciousness achieves a furtherdifferentiation; it is characterized by polarity. Here for the first time appearyin and yang, earth and sky, male and female, space and time, and the otherbinary oppositions that constitute our experience. Here the “soul,” an interior,“inner space” in contrast to an external one, appears. Gebser associates thisstructure with the Greek myth of Narcissus, the youth who fell in love with hisown reflection. The soul first sees itself reflected in the outer world in thisstructure, and the dominant mode of experience here is feeling, which isexpressed through the ancient myths. Thought, as we understand it, had yet toappear.This happens in the mental-rational structure, the next to arrive. Undoubtedlyby now readers are wondering exactly when these different “structures” appeared.Admittedly, Gebser is less than clear about dates. For the mental-rationalstructure’s earliest appearance he suggests 1225 BC; the previous structures,the archaic and magical, reach far back, into our distant, pre-Homo sapiensbeginnings, and the mythic to around the time the earliest civilizations aroseafter the last Ice Age. While, as noted, all previous consciousness structuresremain active, if obscured, in our present consciousness, the mental-rationalstructure is the one we are the most familiar with, given it is our own. In thisstructure, thinking as we understand it begins. Here the separation anddifferentiation from origin is complete. Consciousness—the ego—is on its own,and this condition is expressed, among other ways, in an increase in violenceand a loss of community. Here, for the first time, the notion of time in alinear sense arrives. For the archaic and the magical, there is no time as weknow it but only a kind of intermittent “now,” with long stretches ofunconsciousness in between. For the mythic, there is the cyclical time weassociate with the eternal round of the seasons and the perpetual circling ofthe stars. With the mental-rational structure, “straight-line” time appears, andwith it a profound awareness of death. Needless to say, it is out of themental-rational structure, and its ability to narrow its attention and focus ondetails rather than participate in the whole—as the archaic, magical, and mythicstructures do to different degrees—that science, with all its achievements andproblems, arises.Gebser argues that prior to the emergence of a new structure, the previousstructure enters a “deficient” mode, characterized by its breakdown; what hadpreviously been a “credit” and an advantage now becomes a “deficit” and ahandicap. Gebser believed that the mental-rational structure entered its“deficient” mode in AD 1336 with the rise of perspective, the switch from the“two-dimensional,” “embedded” vision of the world common in the Middle Ages(think of tapestry) to the acute awareness of distance and space embodied in thepaintings of the early Renaissance (think of landscape paintings). Here, hebelieves, consciousness achieved its complete “liberation” from origin.The deficient mode of the mental-rational structure reached its most radicalform in the nineteenth century, with the triumph of the rationalist-reductiveparadigm mentioned earlier, and Gebser believed that throughout the twentiethcentury it was in the process of deconstructing itself. The clearest evidencefor this, Gebser argued—aside from all the global problems we have inherited—wasa profound change in our sense of time. As mentioned, he points to Einstein’srelativity as one example, but there are many more, taken from art, literature,philosophy, music, and other cultural forms. On a more mundane level, however, Ican offer one example, unknown to Gebser, in which time as we knew it has beenabolished. Anyone who uses Tivo or podcasts is no longer bound by the idea of acertain television program or radio broadcast being on at a “certain time.” Thewhole Internet experience, in fact, has altered our way of thinking about bothtime and space. There is the constant “flow” of information, and nowadays people“connect” over vast distances instantaneously; we have more “contact” withpeople on the other side of the planet than we do with our actual neighbors. Ona less innocuous note, the many crises affecting us today—ecological, social,economic, political—can all be traced to the effects of the mental-rationalstructure of consciousness entering its deficient mode.This breakdown, Gebser believed, was a kind of clearing away, a making space forthe new consciousness structure, the “integral,” to arrive. As its namesuggests, in this structure, the previous four structures are integrated. Theintegral structure is characterized by what Gebser calls an “aperspectival”awareness, a transcending of the “perspectival” in the same way that theperspectival was a transcending of the “pre-perspectival.” In the integralstructure, origin becomes perceivable, the spiritual “concretized,” and the“uncreated light” manifest. Gebser’s Sarnath insight, in which he experiencedsatori, is an example of what he means by the integral structure ofconsciousness. As with all shifts from one structure to another, the transitionis by no means guaranteed, and the experience, both individual and collective,is traumatic. Recent developments in the world economy, brought about by theshort-sighted greed for immediate gain associated with the deficientmental-rational mode, would have only convinced Gebser that he was right.This brief summary is light-years away from doing Gebser’s ideas justice, and Ican only hope that it motivates some readers to seek him out for themselves. Heis difficult, but then so is anything of value. To my mind, The Ever-PresentOrigin presents the most convincing evidence that, at the present time, theWest—the entire planet, in fact—is facing a perilous leap into the unknown. Italso suggests ways in which we can make that leap, as Gebser did, with primaltrust."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc17]Owen Barfield and the Evolution of Consciousness [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc17]Owen Barfield is not a name on everyone’s lips. Even in the relatively smallcommunity of scholars who should know him, mention of Barfield usually bringslooks of ignorance or, at best, dim recognition. “Oh yes. He’s that fellow whowas friends with C. S. Lewis, wasn’t he?” Given some familiarity with Barfield’swork, you might receive a more in-depth but not necessarily more enlightenedremark, as I did when mentioning him to a university academic in a London pub.“Barfield?” he said. “You mean that Coleridge loony?” With perceptions likethis, is it surprising that a writer of books about the origin of language andthe evolution of consciousness should be unknown to the general public? Hardly.But when that writer is one of the most interesting thinkers of the twentiethcentury, one can only comment, “More’s the pity.”Owen Barfield—scholar, philosopher, novelist, friend of C. S. Lewis, andinterpreter of Rudolf Steiner—was indeed one of the most remarkable men of thetwentieth century. Born in North London in 1898, Barfield fought in the FirstWorld War, lived through the Blitz, endured the tensions of the Cold War, and atthe end of his life was concerned with the increasing balkanization of theglobe. In terms of intellectual and cultural history, his career was achronology of twentieth-century thought. Early books, like History in EnglishWords (1926) and Poetic Diction (1927), were written in the suffocatingatmosphere of logical positivism, when philosophy as a “love of wisdom” wasabandoned for a sterile hairsplitting of syntax. Barfield’s belief in languageas an archaeological record of the evolution of consciousness, and as a means ofmetalogical insights, was as at odds with the reigning zeitgeist as you couldget.Both books were praised by the critics, but it wasn’t Barfield’s destiny to makea living as a writer. A contributor to The New Statesman, The London Mercury,and T. S. Eliot’s Criterion, Barfield was nevertheless forced by financialpressures to enter his family’s law firm and dropped out of the literary scenein the early ’30s, only occasionally publishing articles in philosophicaljournals. Nearly thirty years later he made an impressive comeback with Savingthe Appearances (1957), subtitled “A Study in Idolatry.” In this book Barfieldwondered how disciplines that took physics as their model could reject its mostrevolutionary insights—for instance, that the observer is inextricably linked tothe observed—as biology did when it claimed that consciousness emerged fromblind matter, and as behavioral psychology did when it went one further anddeclared there was no such thing as consciousness at all. Barfield, takingphysics at its word and drawing on the epistemological theories of Coleridge andGoethe—with a large helping of Rudolf Steiner—went in the opposite direction,toward a “participatory universe,” in which human consciousness, far from beinga ghost in the machine, is master of ceremonies.More books followed, as did stints in various American universities as visitinglecturer. Worlds Apart (1963), a heady Platonic dialogue, took the fragmentationof modern thought as its theme. In Unancestral Voice (1965), Barfield’sfictional alter ego, Burgeon, discovers a superintelligent entity, the Meggid,residing in his unconscious mind. Through a series of conversations, the Meggidintroduces Burgeon/Barfield to the system of thought with which Barfield, inthose circles in which he is known, is associated: Rudolf Steiner’sAnthroposophy. In these works, as in the books that followed—Speaker’s Meaning(1967); What Coleridge Thought (1972); The Rediscovery of Meaning (1977);History, Guilt, and Habit (1979); and also in his collection of Anthroposophicalessays, Romanticism Comes of Age (1944)—Barfield argues for the supremacy ofimagination as both a creative agent and a pathway to knowledge: an idea thatwould become his trademark.So when in 1996, shortly before his death, I had an opportunity to visitBarfield and talk with him about his life and work, I jumped at the chance. It’snot every day one gets to spend an afternoon with a walking history oftwentieth-century thought.As anyone who has read his books knows, the focal point of all of Barfield’swork was the evolution of consciousness. Not ashamed to admit that he was whatIsaiah Berlin would call a “hedgehog”—one of those who, unlike the fox, knowonly one big thing—Barfield admitted that all his books were about the samething. He said as much during my visit to the Walhatch, the residency estate inForest Row, East Sussex, where Barfield lived at the end of his life. Comparinghis work to that of his friend C. S. Lewis, Barfield remarked: “There’s an earlyLewis and a later Lewis; that’s why he’s interesting to scholars. They can markthe stages of his development. There’s none of that with me. I never developed.As an accurate but perhaps unkind critic remarked, I’ve been saying the samething for fifty years. The only difference now is that it’s seventy years, notfifty.”But repetition isn’t always a drawback—especially when what you say is asinteresting as what Barfield said. During the hour or so I spent with him, wetalked about his life and work, Rudolf Steiner, the challenges facing aspiritual life in the modern age, and what he saw coming at the end of thetwentieth century. Though supremely lucid, witty, and in good health, it wasn’tsurprising that Barfield tired easily; a casual chat seemed more appropriatethan a rigorous interview. Sitting in a massive armchair, white-haired, thin,and clutching a smoldering pipe, a sagacious, bespectacled Barfield seemed happyto receive a visitor, especially one eager to discuss ideas. What follows is abrief introduction to Barfield’s philosophy, sprinkled with some comments hemade during my visit.The basic idea behind the evolution of consciousness is, as Barfield briefly putit in Romanticism Comes of Age, “the concept of man’s self-consciousness as aprocess in time.” Compare this with the notion of the “history of ideas.” In thestandard history, an ancient Greek and a postmodern American have very differentideas about the world, but both perceive the world the same way—with theunderstanding that our ideas, informed by modern science, are closer to thetruth. There’s no difference between the consciousness of the ancient Greek andours, only between the concepts “inside” it. When we open our eyes, we see thatsame world. It’s just that we have better ideas about it.For Barfield this is totally wrong. Not only do their ideas about the worlddiffer, but the world the ancient Greek saw and the one we see are not the same.The kind of consciousness we enjoy—if that’s the right word for it—is verydifferent from that of an ancient Greek, a Greek of late antiquity, a personfrom the Middle Ages, or even one of the early modern age. Not only our ideasabout things, Barfield tells us, but our consciousness itself has evolved overtime. And if we are to take seriously the contention of philosophers likeImmanuel Kant—that the world we perceive is a product of our perceptualapparatus—then a world produced by a different consciousness at a different timewill be, well, different.One of the most fascinating conclusions Barfield draws from this is that allideas about the prehistoric world, from paleontological textbooks to populardepictions like Jurassic Park, are, at the least, questionable. “They project apicture of that world as it would be seen by a consciousness alive today. Wehave no way of knowing what that world looked like to a different consciousnessbecause we have no record from a consciousness of that time. We can onlyspeculate.” To the contention that we have the paleontological record, Barfieldreplies, “It’s nevertheless our consciousness that discovers fossils andorganizes them into the schemata of ancient life.”But if we can only speculate about the nature of reality before the rise ofconsciousness, there is another record, one we find not by digging throughancient earth, but by scrutinizing ancient texts. This is language, the study ofwhich, according to Barfield, is “a kind of archaeology of consciousness.” As hewrites in History in English Words: “In language…the past history of mankind isspread out in an imperishable map, just as the history of the mineral earth liesembedded in the layers of its outer crust. But there is this difference: whereasthe former can only give us a knowledge of outward, dead things…language haspreserved for us the inner, living history of man’s soul. It reveals theevolution of consciousness.”And whereas the orthodox view of evolution has a preexisting, external worldmuch like our own, made up of distinct, independent, impermeable objects, therecord left us by language, Barfield argues, suggests something different.“The standard understanding of the evolution of language,” Barfield told me, “isthat all words referring to something spiritual or abstract have their origin inliteral meaning.” So when we refer to a “spirit” enlivening the physical body,what we are talking about is something like breath. We find this is in theHebrew ruach and the Greek pneuma. Or, as he wrote in Poetic Diction: “It is acommonplace…that, whatever word we hit on, if we trace its meaning far enoughback, we find it apparently expressive of some tangible, or at all events,perceptible object or some physical activity…. Throughout the recorded historyof language the movement of meaning has been from the concrete to the abstract.”The result of this is the insight, voiced by thinkers like Emerson andNietzsche, that modern language, with its abstract terms and nuances of meaning,is, as Barfield writes, “apparently nothing…but an unconscionable tissue ofdead, or petrified, metaphors.” The further we dig into language, the moremetaphors we find.But there is something wrong with this, Barfield says. Etymologists, like thefamous oriental scholar Max Müller, believed that early humans began with verysimple, literal words and phrases for tangible, perceptible things. Then, withthe “dawn of reason” (itself a metaphor), our ancestors began to use thesephrases metaphorically, to describe inner and outer experience. If we take thistheory to its logical conclusion, Barfield argues, “the result should be thattoday, after millennia of metaphor building, we should all be spouting poetrywhenever we speak.” And likewise, we should, being so much more sophisticated,find poetry from earlier times rather less poetic. Neither of which, of course,is true. Homer still thrills like nothing else. Müller and his followers erred,Barfield believes, by adopting an unquestioned Darwinian approach to the historyof language. Just as simple organisms became more complex over time, so toolanguage evolved, they believed, from simple “root” words denoting tangible“things” into our highly abstract and metaphorical speech. “The only problemwith this is the evidence from language itself,” Barfield argues.What the history of language tells us, Barfield says, is that “our ancestorsdidn’t use language as Müller believed, because they did not see the same world.Müller projected the world as perceived by late-nineteenth-century European maninto the past. That’s why the only account of the history of language he couldgive was one that followed Darwinian ideas of progress.” The kind of world thatancient man saw—and that our ancestors continued to see until recent times—was,Barfield believes, one in which human consciousness “participated.” At thatstage of the evolution of consciousness, the distinction between “self” and “theworld” was not as rigid as it is today. What Müller misunderstood as metaphoricwas early man’s ability to see the “inside” of things, just as we now are awareof our “inside”—our minds. Accounts of nature spirits; folktales and myths aboutfairies, nymphs, and sylphs; legends of gods walking the earth are all rooted inthis “participatory consciousness.” This was the kind of world (andconsciousness) that poets like Blake, Coleridge, and Goethe believed in and attimes felt. It was also the kind of consciousness described by Rudolf Steiner.Barfield calls it “original participation.”“Original participation,” according to Barfield, is a “primal unity of mind andnature, with no separation between inner and outer worlds.” At that point,nature, he believes, was as subjective, as inward as we are. But what happenedis that gradually “unconscious nature” became localized in human consciousness.If we think of unconscious nature as a vast ocean, and the initial separation ofhuman consciousness as wavelets lifting themselves up from the surface, we’llhave an idea of what Barfield means. Gradually this process continues, with anincreasingly tenuous link between our new “self”-consciousness and its“unconscious” source, until we arrive at our present state: a completely other“outside world” with separate islands of inwardness housed within our individualskulls. At this point we are as far away from original participation as we canget.But although some bemoan our exodus from the garden, this estrangement from oursource was absolutely necessary, Barfield tells us. The path of evolution, hesays, isn’t a straight line; it is much more like a U. The left hand of the Utraces the path from original participation to our current estrangement fromnature. In the nineteenth century, with the rise of a completely materialisticexplanation of the world, including the most immaterial thing we know,consciousness, we reached the bottom of the U. Now we are just beginning to makeour ascent back up, this time on the right hand of the U. This is the essentialdifference. Because now we can begin to “participate” in the world notpassively—as we had as primitive humans and as animals do today—but actively, bybecoming conscious of the power of our imagination in creating “the world.” (Andif we need an example of the difference between active and passiveparticipation, we need merely recognize the difference between our dreams, overwhich we have little or no control, and the consciousness of an artist or poetfocused intently on his work.) We had to leave the security of originalparticipation in order for consciousness to take the next step in its evolution.Having hit bottom on the evolutionary curve, we are beginning our ascent to whathe calls “final participation,” a conscious participation in the cosmos.The idea of an evolution of consciousness, though unorthodox, is not as strangetoday as it may have seemed when Barfield first presented it. Since then it’sbeen argued by several thinkers, notably Jean Gebser in The Ever-Present Originand the Jungian theorist Erich Neumann in The Origin and History ofConsciousness. But Barfield’s take on it is peculiar, and perhaps his moststartling idea is a reversal of the standard materialist account of mind’semergence from matter. Rather than being a fluke product of evolution,consciousness itself, Barfield argues, is responsible for “the world.”That’s why there is no answer to questions about the origin of language whenasked from the conventional view. Asking about the origin of language, Barfieldsays, is like asking about the “origin of origin.” Language didn’t come about asa way to imitate, master, or explain nature, as it is usually assumed, because“nature” as we understand it didn’t exist until language did. According toBarfield, the polarities of mind/world and language/nature are the result ofsplitting up original participation. To understand language, Barfield tells us,we must imagine ourselves back to a stage at which human consciousness hadn’tyet separated from its unconscious background. At that point there was no“nature” and no “consciousness”—at least not as we understand it. “Nature,”Barfield tells us, didn’t exist until human consciousness came into its own. The“world” as we see it is the result of millions of years of work by the humanmind.The fact that we are unaware of our participation in the world accounts for ouralienation from nature, as well as our mastery of it. The “idols” of thesubtitle to Saving the Appearances are the “collective representations”—thephenomena of the physical world—as they are understood by modern science; thatis, as completely unrelated to the imagination. Modern science, developingduring consciousness’s “flight from nature,” in Steiner’s phrase, is “idolatry”because it’s forgotten the source of the phenomena it studies. Indeed, inbehavioral psychology, linguistic philosophy, and various other materialisticdisciplines, idolatry goes so far as to deny the very existence of that source.Having shaped a fascinating, complex, and seemingly infinite world,consciousness loses itself in it, a situation described in Hindu and Buddhistteachings as “falling into maya,” or illusion. But while Hindu and Buddhistthought advise an escape from maya, Barfield, working in the Romantic tradition,proposes a less austere strategy. If the phenomenal world is shaped by some partof the mind of which we are not conscious, then to avoid “idolatry” we need tobecome conscious of that power. As he writes in Saving the Appearances, “Ifappearances are correlative to human consciousness and if human consciousnessevolves, then the future of the appearances, that is, of nature herself, mustindeed depend on the direction which that evolution takes.”To slightly alter a hackneyed phrase, the fate of the world isn’t in our handsbut in our minds.When Barfield wrote Saving the Appearances, several developments threatened tosteer the evolution of consciousness in an undesirable direction. Logicalpositivism and linguistic philosophy had emptied language of meaning. Science,with its increasing fragmentation of nature and itself into smaller and smallerparts, could offer no vision of wholeness. Nearly half a century later, not muchhas changed. To think of our “postmodern condition” and to read Barfield ischilling. The “accelerating increase in that pigeon-holed knowledge of more andmore about less and less” which “can only lead mankind to a sort of idiocy…withthe result that there will in the end be no means of communication between oneintelligence and another” will sound ominously accurate to anyone familiar withtoday’s universities. But science and philosophy are not the only things thatbode ill for the future of nature. The arts too are implicated. “Imagination,”Barfield says, “is not simply synonymous with good.” Given the accelerated paceof evolution, he warns that without some moral guidance, unrestrainedimagination can let loose a riot of fantasy and obsession, not all of awholesome character. Given our ability to “morph” reality or to “virtually”create it, the wedding of imagination and technology can result in somethinglike Star Trek’s holodeck, which our hunger for raw sensation and aestheticshock will use to fashion environments like those in Naked Lunch. If that is thecase, then Barfield’s warning of our moving into a “fantastically hideous world”may prove uncomfortably timely.Talking of the Internet, Barfield remarked wearily that “something that issupposed to bring people together seems to be doing quite the opposite,”creating self-enclosed fantasy worlds where people “indulge in sexualeccentricities without ever meeting another human being.” At ninety-seven, youmight excuse him for not being quite with it, but little of import passesBarfield by. From hackney cabs to space shuttles, he’s seen it and had somethingto say about it. So I asked him the inevitable: what did he think was in storefor us as we approached the millennium? “Well,” he said, plunging a match intohis Holmesian pipe, “I’m an optimist in the long run, but a pessimist in theshort. The ecological situation is really quite bad. And society is morefragmented than ever; even with this ‘information age’ we never hear the end ofit. I’d like to think we’ll avoid a catastrophe, but I don’t know…. But I’mcertain we’re moving into a new stage of consciousness, as Steiner said. Peopleare beginning to feel a sense of unity. What we need is time for this to spread,for more people to become aware of it.”Sitting in Barfield’s living room, looking at the rows of books by hisfriends—Eliot, Charles Williams, Tolkien, and, of course Lewis—I was glad foronce to be in the presence of a flesh-and-blood wise old man and not only apsychic archetype. Meeting the person behind ideas you have been excited by foryears gives a sense of the living past that is the essence of tradition. It alsomakes one feel the importance of keeping that past alive. Having closed out acentury saturated in materialism and hooked on a culture of violence andnihilism, we need Owen Barfields more than ever before."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc18]The Strange Death of James Webb [06_Contents.xhtml#itoc18]On the afternoon of May 8, 1980, after two years of a deep, paralyzingdepression and at least one psychotic episode, the brilliant Scots historian ofthe occult James Webb put the barrel of his shotgun to his head and blew hisbrains out. He was thirty-four. In the 1970s Webb had made a name for him withhis fascinating if skeptical histories of occultism, The Occult Underground(1974) and The Occult Establishment (1976). In 1980, The Harmonious Circle,Webb’s study of G. I. Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, and their followers had justbeen published, and Webb’s career was looking good. He was a regular contributorto Encounter and also to the encyclopedia Man, Myth, and Magic, and hisperformance at Trinity College, Cambridge, had been so stellar that a biennialJames Webb Memorial Prize is awarded there in his honor.Webb’s books combine a painstaking research into the occult and an ironicdismissal of it, the kind of know-it-all rationalism we might expect from aCambridge graduate. But at the time of his suicide, Webb had changed his mindabout the kinds of experiences he had chalked up to delusion, fantasy, and apost-Enlightenment craving for the irrational. In his last days, Webb wasconvinced that the nervous breakdown that cast him into suicidal madness hadalso revealed dimensions of reality that could only be called supernatural. Hefound himself “catapulted into a larger universe” filled with altered states ofconsciousness and profound visions of “cyclical time.”The experience was not all revelation. Webb also showed the classic signs ofparanoid schizophrenia. His publisher, he claimed, was persecuting him. Worsestill, he was convinced that a certain group of French Freemasons had it in forhim. Such remarks suggest Webb’s change of heart about the supernatural wasnothing more than the pathetic result of his tragic breakdown. Yet thecircumstances surrounding his death were unusual and raise the suspicion thatthe dividing line between madness and occult revelation may not be as clear cutas we suppose.How and when Webb’s madness began are unclear; even as a schoolboy at Harrow hewas considered brilliant but perhaps a little unstable. After his death, hiswidow—even more skeptical of the supernatural than he—refused to discuss thematter, preferring, understandably, to forget the tragic business. By mostaccounts Mary Webb was a no-nonsense, practical woman who loved her husband buthad little insight into his brilliance and even less into his obsessions, and itis a fair guess that she may have felt that his interest in the occult wassomehow responsible for his madness. That Webb married a woman with little ofhis intellectual spirit and less sensitivity to his experiences is one of thestrange things about the affair. It does account, however, for his relationshipwith another woman, Joyce Collin-Smith. Many an unsympathetic wife has drivenher husband into other arms, but in Webb’s case the attraction of the otherwoman wasn’t sexual but psychic.Webb first encountered Joyce Collin-Smith in 1972. At the National Liberal Clubin London, she gave a lecture to the Astrological Association on the life andwork of her brother-in-law, Rodney Collin. Webb was interested in Rodney Collinbecause, as one of the main followers of Ouspensky, Collin would featureprominently in Webb’s book on Gurdjieff. Webb had come to the lecture intendingto ask Joyce for an interview about her brother-in-law.By the time she met Webb, Joyce Collin-Smith had run the gamut of spiritualteachers. In the 1950s she practiced the Gurdjieff “work” with Rodney Collin athis commune in the suburbs of Mexico City. Before this she had been involvedwith Dr. Frank Buchman, founder of Moral Rearmament. She was also a follower ofPak Subuh, the Indonesian mystic and founder of the Subud movement, whichincluded J. G. Bennett among fellow “work” members. And, in the early days ofthe 1960s, she had been chauffeur and girl Friday to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogibefore the Beatles discovered meditation and made the giggling guru a spiritualsuperstar. A former Fleet Street journalist, novelist, and officer in theWomen’s Auxiliary Air Force, Joyce was old enough to be Webb’s mother; at thevery least, she was an unusual candidate for spiritual adviser to a brainytwenty-six-year-old who found most of her pursuits pure hogwash.And yet, at the very first meeting, Joyce knew Webb would play a large role inher life. She also knew he was fated for some strange destiny. As she recalledin her autobiography, Call No Man Master (1988), the minute she saw the tall,red-haired young man enter the auditorium, her “heart leapt.” It was not love atfirst sight; on the contrary, in Webb she recognized a sinister, terrifyingfigure from a repeated nightmare of her childhood. In her dreams, a tall,red-haired young schoolmaster asked her to fetch something from a forbiddingtower. Frightened at entering the tower alone, she nevertheless obeyed. Halfwayup, in a desolate, empty room, the schoolmaster, raving mad, charged in andthrew himself at her. She woke up each night, sweating and terrified. Now, morethan forty years later, the mad schoolmaster had come to her lecture.Joyce watched as he took a seat in the last row. She then gave her lecture,speaking, she recalls, almost solely to him. At the end of her talk, as shespoke with some of the audience, Joyce half expected the “schoolmaster” to eruptinto maniacal laughter. But when the shy, diffident young man approached andexplained that he was writing a book on Gurdjieff and wanted to speak with herabout her brother-in-law, she was surprised at his gentle, almost apologeticmanner.They developed an immediate rapport. In Joyce’s house in Sussex, they talked forhours about philosophy, religion, history, and her experiences with the occult.Precognitive dreams, visions, strange states of consciousness while practicingTranscendental Meditation and self-remembering, even communication with thedead. Webb was impressed. A brilliant scholar, his encounters with the occulthad been strictly “armchair,” but it’s clear from Joyce’s account that he wasalso attracted to something else.Webb’s family was well-off. Had he lived, Webb would have inherited a largeestate at Blair Drummond, in Perthshire, Scotland. But relations with his familyhad soured over Mary. Class may have had something to do with it, but Webb’smother and stepfather were certain she wasn’t right for him; when the couple didmarry, it was against their wishes.Estranged from his parents, finding little in common with Mary, Webb took refugein his studies. His brilliance threw him far ahead of his contemporaries. Fewcould keep up with his discoveries; fewer still could speak intelligently aboutthem. And now he had met someone who seemed to know all about the occult fromthe inside, someone who also took an immediate liking to him and gave himencouragement and approval. Joyce quickly became a kind of surrogate mother forWebb. He welcomed the ease and naturalness in her household, so different fromthe tension around his real parents. Later Joyce would claim that they had knowneach other in previous incarnations; this time they had met as a sort of motherand son.Inevitably, Joyce compared their astrological charts; both were Capricorns withLeo rising. The points of contact among their stars suggested to Joyce thatJames could indeed have been her son—had she had one—and the association withthe mad schoolmaster faded from her consciousness. Their rapport deepened; heraffection for the young scholar grew. More and more, Joyce was reminded of herrelationship with Rodney Collin, who, as we shall see, also died in mysteriouscircumstances. As their philosophical conversations continued, they began toexperience a kind of telepathy; each knew the other’s thoughts before a word wasspoken. Their rapid exchange developed into a kind of verbal shorthand.Repeatedly, Joyce felt a curious sensation of déjà vu. At one point, during teaon a summer afternoon, Webb asked Joyce for “another piece of cherry cake.”Immediately Joyce was reminded of another childhood dream, this one involving aTibetan background, a fantasized “brother,” and cherries. Increasingly she feltthat they were indeed “two beings who had incarnated within reach of each othermany times in different roles.”Several months later Joyce’s husband’s ill health forced her to sell theirSussex house, and they moved to a cottage in the New Forest. Money was scarce;she had to take what work she could find, mostly lecturing and doing horoscopes.Not long after, she got a call from “Jamie,” as she called Webb. He wanted todouble-check some material for the Gurdjieff book. He and Mary had marriedrecently and had just returned from a honeymoon in the Orient. Joyce was glad tohear from him, but thought he sounded strange, “rather low and glum,” unlike hisusual cheerful self. Webb wanted to visit her, but Joyce put him off; herhusband’s health would make things difficult. But she promised to ring him soonabout lunching with him in London.Something in Webb’s call made Joyce check his chart again. She saw the familiarqualities, “fiery, vigorous, and tenacious,” so much like her own. But there wassomething else. Webb’s stars indicated a depressive tendency, an inclination towithdraw deeper into himself as he got older. She didn’t know it at the time,but Webb had just done that. He had amassed an incredible library and spent moreand more time alone, immersed in his research. Friends and literaryacquaintances saw less and less of him. His marriage, too, seemed shaky. Webbworked well into the night, often falling asleep at his desk, amidst volumes ofJacob Boehme, Raymond Lully, and other occult philosophers. What had been anadmirable dedication to work now seemed a full-fledged obsession. Joyce warnedJamie of the dangers but, like any good Faust, he ignored them.The next time they spoke, Joyce felt certain something had happened. It was thenthat Webb told her of being persecuted by his publishers and raved about theFrench Freemasons. He was ill with flu, and Joyce urged him to relax. But Webb’smental deterioration had begun. He didn’t ring again and, to her later regret,Joyce’s own affairs prevented her from telephoning him. The next time she heardfrom him, Webb had already plunged into madness.“My life has just emerged from a nightmare,” Webb wrote some time later. “I hada full-scale nervous breakdown, with hallucinations, visions, and a finerepertoire of subjectively supernatural experiences. Hoist with my own petard,some would say.” The cool rationalism that called occultism a “flight fromreason” seemed helpless before the kinds of experiences he had gone through.“Despite the undoubtedly hallucinatory nature of many of my experiences,” hewrote, “a residue remains which I simply have to take seriously.” He tried tofit what was happening to him into some system, calling on Gnostic notions ofAeons and Hindu kalpas. But the visions were too vivid and extraordinary to beneatly filed into some metaphysic. The gist of them had to do with time. Theworld had become a kind of Heraclitean flux. He had seen “molecules.”Webb’s letter was postmarked Durisdeer in Dumfrieshire. He and Mary had leftLondon and had moved into a renovated old church. Joyce wrote back immediately.Webb replied at great length; he thought she had rebuffed him in his hour ofneed. His account of his breakdown was harrowing. He had been in and out ofvarious hospitals, had been in the hands of several psychiatrists, was doped onLargactil (sold in the United States as Thorazine) and had only just escapedelectroshock therapy. He had given up writing and was just barely keeping hissanity. Joyce berated herself for not responding sooner. She soon made up forthis. During the next five months she and Webb exchanged a lengthy andextraordinary correspondence. Two or three times a week several pages of Webb’sincreasingly wild account reached her door.He wrote of a “shattering vision of the wheel of life.” He saw his previousincarnations. He became convinced that there is a “principle of consciousnesswhich is not merely the result of a congeries of experience”—what Ouspensky hadcalled the linga sharira, the “long body” that extends through countless lives.But the worst was that there seemed to be no stability. Things would not “standstill.” No sooner did he look at something than he saw its entire history, itspresent, past, and future. An oak was an acorn, then a rotting mass of mulch.Although he believed there was a way out, Webb shrank from the knowledge that weare all “imprisoned in the coils of cyclical time.”Finally Joyce could offer something more than sympathy. She was familiar withthese visions. During her time with the Maharishi, she had experienced the samephenomena, the result of too much Transcendental Meditation. It had brought herto the brink of suicide. She suggested exercises to keep his mind focused intime. These helped for a while, but increasingly Webb’s thoughts turned todeath. He wrote to Joyce that “Rodney Collin was quite right about theimportance of dying properly.” He also said that he had “revised my opinionabout the manner of Ouspensky’s death.”Strange deaths were indeed not uncommon among professors of Gurdjieff’s “work.”When Gurdjieff died in 1949, the doctor performing the autopsy declared that hisinternal organs were in such bad condition that he should have been dead yearsbefore; Gurdjieff had apparently willed himself to stay alive. Ouspensky’s deathwas even stranger. He was obsessed with time; his particular fascination waseternal recurrence, the notion that, with slight variations, our lives repeat,over and over. The only possibility of escape is in becoming more conscious. Inhis last days, a sick and dying Ouspensky visited various favorite sites, fixingthem in his mind, in order to remember them in his next recurrence. Weirdpsychic phenomena occurred; in his efforts to die consciously, witnesses reportthat Ouspensky had become telepathic.And when, on October 2, 1947, Ouspensky passed away, Rodney Collin, his closestdisciple, locked himself in the room next to his master’s and did not emergeuntil a week later. He told his wife—and Joyce—that he had been in communicationwith Ouspensky the entire time. Nearly ten years later, on May 3, 1956, Collinhimself would die after falling from a tower in Cusco, Peru. He was found in aposition resembling the crucified Christ; earlier he had prayed that a crippledpeasant boy be cured, and he had told his wife that he had offered God his bodyin exchange. There is some suspicion that he too had attempted to “dieconsciously.” Webb had written skeptically about the events around Ouspensky’sand Collin’s death. Now he had reason to change his mind.Joyce considered the possibility that Jamie was going through some kind ofself-inflicted initiatory process. She knew that their conversations had openedhim to the reality of the occult. His armor of skeptical rationality hadcracked; in his letters he spoke of curious precognitive dreams and of a kind ofGnostic personal myth. He had long fantasized that he was a member of a crewwhose spaceship had crashed on an alien planet. Enslaved by the natives, theysoon forgot their past. But occasionally a dim memory stirred, the crew membersrecognized each other, and they recalled their mission. “The tragedy,” he toldher, “is infinitely far distant, the adventure infinitely long. And we areageless, ageless.”Had Webb been allowed to explore these intuitions, it’s possible he may havesurvived. But after several months of having him around the house, Mary forcedhim to take a job. They didn’t need the money. Understandably, she felt thatsome work might give her husband some ballast. But she really had no insightinto his plight and little patience for his talk about the soul, later tellingJoyce that she considered all that sort of thing “rubbish.” A copywriting jobfor an Edinburgh advertising agency was not quite what Webb needed. Theuncongenial atmosphere had the opposite effect, throwing him deeper intoalienation. His letters to Joyce became wilder. He was researching a book aboutesoteric movements in Scotland but he “couldn’t get the pattern of it anymore.”More and more, he believed, someone was after him because he knew too much,Finally, Joyce decided she had to see him. By this time their telepathic linkhad increased. She had visions of him at his desk and could feel a pain in theback of his neck, a vulnerable spot he shared with both her and Rodney Collin.She could hear him crying at night and in her mind reached out to comfort him.Although she had never been there, she had images of the grounds around thehouse; later, after Webb’s death, she saw that these had been accurate. In a fewweeks, she and her husband would go to Scotland for their holiday. She decidedthen to see Jamie.It was too late. On the afternoon before their trip, Joyce heard Webb’s voicecalling her name. “I’m coming,” she answered mentally. Then something like anenormous explosion went off in her head. At once she told her husband,“Something is wrong with Jamie.” He said it was her imagination. Incredibly, shedidn’t telephone. When they arrived at their holiday cottage there was a messageto ring Mary. At three o’clock the previous day, Webb had shot himself. Joycelater discovered the immediate cause was a domestic quarrel.Visiting Webb’s parents, Joyce discovered the full extent of his madness. Onenight, he crouched before the fire at their estate, repeating the Lord’s Prayerover and over and muttering repeatedly, “What is it all about?” On anotheroccasion, he ran out into the night in a state of hysteria. He waded waist-deepacross a river to reach Dunblane Cathedral twelve miles away, where he bangedfuriously on the door. Oblivious to those around him, for a few weeks the “madschoolmaster” was certifiably insane.Inevitably, Joyce blamed herself for not seeing him sooner. Jamie had plungedinto a dark night of the soul, and she hadn’t been there for him. Her sense ofguilt, then, may account for what followed. She began to feel Webb’s presence.First he asked her to visit his mother. Then he wanted her to carry on his work.Two visits to a medium convinced her that some part of Jamie had survived.Material emerged unknown to her that later proved unsettlingly accurate. Thevoice told her that he “would come to her,” asking that she get his books fromMary, who “doesn’t understand them.” “Make a replica of me,” it said.At first Joyce was thankful for these messages. But then she felt that somethingwas “not right” about them. This was not the “whole” Jamie, merely bits andpieces of him. Jamie, or some part of him, didn’t know he was dead and wouldn’t“move on.” Joyce began to feel that she was being “taken over.” Eventually, aclergyman friend of spiritualist persuasion offered to say a requiem to helpWebb relinquish his attachment to the world. Satisfied that the rite would notinterfere with them finding each other in the next incarnation, Joyce agreed. Asshe and the clergyman read the prayers in the candle-lit chapel, she feltsomething lift up from her consciousness and take flight. Jamie had moved on.There was one other curious phenomenon. During her first wave of grief, Joycefound herself crying aloud, “Why didn’t you help him?” In the depths of heranguish she heard a voice that said, “I did.” At the same time she saw a face,dark-haired, dark-eyed, with a deep, penetrating gaze. She thought it might havebeen Rudolf Steiner. At the time of his suicide, Webb had been commissioned towrite a book about Steiner, a task that later went to Colin Wilson.
