That Cosimo should make such a request wassurprising. Only recently the great patron of the arts and learning had askedFicino to translate Plato so that he could read the philosopher’s complete worksbefore he died. Cosimo, a very old man for that time (he was 74) more thanlikely knew he didn’t have long to live, yet if it had been his desire to readall of Plato — a considerable task, even with a lifetime ahead of you — he musthave surely known that taking Ficino off the job would make this impossible.That he had Plato’s works to be translated at all was sheer luck; it was onlythrough the uncertain twists of history that they had become available. Thethreat of the Turks had led many Christian scholars to abandon Constantinople(modern Istanbul), capital of the Byzantine empire and the second Rome, and headwest. The city would fall to the Ottomans in 1453, and to escape Islamicintolerance, the intelligentsia took what they could of their libraries andfled. It was this exodus that brought Plato to Ficino’s eager hands, but it alsobrought the work that took him out of them.Leonardo de Pistoia, a monk who worked for Cosimo as an agent, purchasing anyinteresting scholarly works he came across, had discovered an item in Macedoniathat he was sure his boss would appreciate. It was a near complete edition of acollection of texts whose existence was suspected, but which had been lost tothe west since late antiquity and the beginning of the Dark Ages. Its author wasa figure of vast renown, one of the great sages of the past, perhaps thegreatest, a magician, philosopher and teacher who many believed had lived beforethe Flood, and whose teachings were the foundation of a great tradition ofwisdom through the ages — a wisdom that Plato himself, Cosimo’s favourite, hadpartaken of. Cosimo’s hunger for ideas, for philosophy, and for the intellectualtreasures of the past, had sent his agents far and wide, in search of lostknowledge, and they had returned with many marvels. But de Pistoia must haveknown that he had hit the jackpot. Plato and his disciples were nothing tosneeze at, surely. But what he had here was something else. Cosimo would bepleased. The work de Pistoia brought back to Florence from the land of Alexanderthe Great was the Corpus Hermeticum, and its author was, depending on yoursources, a god, a magician, or something in between: the fabled HermesTrismegistus, ‘thrice-great Hermes’.It was no wonder that Cosimo told Ficino to put Plato aside and to get to workon this, and no wonder that Ficino immediately agreed. They both knew from thechurch fathers, from Lactantius and Augustine, that Hermes Trismegistus was far,far earlier than Plato, and that hunger for the wisdom of the past, for theorigin and source of things, that characterizes the time we call theRenaissance, demanded he take precedence. Cosimo and Ficino knew that HermesTrismegistus was the initiator of the prisca theologia, that ‘perennialphilosophy’ they both were eager to absorb, and now they had in their hands theactual words of the Great Teacher. So it made perfect sense that before he readPlato, Cosimo would read Hermes. He did, and soon after, he died, in 1464. Onlyafter this did Ficino return to translating Plato."},{"pageContent":"HERMETIC TRACES As the historian Frances Yates, who tells this story, remarked, the situation is‘extraordinary’.1 [index_split_008.html#filepos52440] There is Plato, to whom,as the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said, all subsequent westernphilosophy is merely a footnote, all ready to be translated, and at the lastminute he is put aside, to make room for — who? Hermes Trismegistus?Although his cachet today is not quite what it once was, if asked to name aphilosopher, most people would come up with at least one, Plato, or Socrates,who they would know of through Plato. But ask someone if they know who HermesTrismegistus is, and unless you happen to pick a student of western esotericism,you’ll more than likely get that who? and a shaking head. Yet half a millenniumago, this was not the case. In late antiquity, throughout the Middle Ages,during the Renaissance, and up to the beginning of our modern times, HermesTrismegistus was a name to conjure with, literally, ranking, not only withPlato, but with Moses and, in some cases, Jesus Christ. Today most people mighthave some sense of the Greek god Hermes, and have a vague idea of a characterwith winged sandals and a funny helmet, who could run very fast — an attributeof his Roman equivalent, Mercury — and who was a messenger for the gods. If theyare American, and of a certain age, they might remember the Mercury dime, a tencent piece taken out of circulation in 1945.2[index_split_008.html#filepos52717] Some may think of the logo for FTD florists,who have a winged Mercury swiftly delivering a bouquet. And an observant fewmight note that Hermes/Mercury often stands guard over banks; as the god ofmerchants (and also of thieves, which for some may seem ironically apt) thismakes sense. But these few crumbs of iconographic significance are a paltrylegacy for a figure who once commanded enormous respect from philosophers,theologians, and even scientists. And the epithet ‘Trismegistus’ or‘thrice-great’, which characterized the author of the Corpus Hermeticum, wouldundoubtedly baffle most people today. ‘Great, great, great’, you say? Isn’t thata bit over the top?Cosimo didn’t think so, nor did Ficino, nor did the many who read histranslations of these strange, mystical texts. First printed in 1471, they ranto sixteen editions by the end of the next century, and appeared in manytranslations and in many other collections. Although it’s commonly understoodthat the Renaissance was fuelled by the rediscovery of the knowledge andliterature of the ancients, of Plato and his school, what’s less known is howinfluential the Corpus Hermeticum was on one of the pivotal moments of westernconsciousness. The man responsible for this, it seems, was the ByzantineNeoplatonic philosopher George Gemistos Plethon. Plethon had studied Zoroaster,the Chaldean Oracles, and astrology, and while in Florence during the Council ofFerrara-Florence (1438–1445) — the failed attempt to heal the rift between theCatholic and Orthodox churches — he lectured Cosimo and his circle on what hecalled the ‘primal theology’, the revelation given to mankind at the dawn oftime, and the essence of the world’s great religions. Plethon’s discourses onPlato, and his Alexandrian followers Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, andIamblichus, so impressed Cosimo and his friends that they dubbed him the ‘secondPlato’. A perhaps greater tribute to Plethon’s inspiration was Cosimo’s desireto found a new Platonic Academy, which he did in 1462, with Ficino at its head.The original Academy had started in Athens in 387 BC, but by the first centuryAD it had petered out, and a revived Academy in 410 became a centre forNeoplatonic study, until it was closed down in 524 by Justinian I. Now, nearly amillennium later, Cosimo’s passion for Plato was responsible for a philosophicaldiscussion group whose members would include Renaissance figures such as Picodella Mirandola and Michelangelo Buonarroti, and whose ideas would inform thegreat cultural movement behind the birth of Humanism and the modern world.If Gemistos Plethon had looked to Plato for wisdom and insight, Plato himselfhad looked to Hermes Trismegistus. And others had too. If the legends aboutHermes Trismegistus were true, then practically every sage and mystic from timeimmemorial had looked to the thrice-great one as the source of their wisdom. Yettoday he is virtually unknown. A faint echo of his influence barely remains whenwe speak of ‘hermetically sealed jars’, a usage that has trickled down from thetime when alchemy, of which Hermes Trismegistus was believed to be the founder,was taken seriously. This seems small acclaim for someone to whom even Plato hadto take a back seat."},{"pageContent":"HERMES TRISMEGISTUS AND THE CORPUS HERMETICUM Who is Hermes Trismegistus and what is the Corpus Hermeticum? The secondquestion is somewhat easier to answer than the first. The Corpus Hermeticum is acollection of writings of a mystical, philosophical and initiatory character,believed to be part of a much larger body of work, commonly referred to as theHermetica, which are attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, hence their name, butwhich were certainly written by a number of different authors over many years.Most of these are lost, but from scattered references we can assume that manymore Hermetic works existed than we have copies of today. The second centurytheologian Clement of Alexandria, for example, speaks of forty-two books ofHermes, and a fourth century scribe, who copied a Hermetic text later foundamong the famous Gnostic Gospels of the Nag Hammadi collection, apologized fornot including more Hermetic works, justifying the omission by saying that theywere ‘numerous’. This could be an excuse for laziness, or a recognition that theworks were already well-known. The collection that reached Ficino itself wasincomplete, containing only fourteen of the fifteen texts making up the corpus.This was more than likely put together by a Byzantine scholar, sometime in thetenth or eleventh century; at least there is no mention of the Corpus Hermeticumas a specific collection prior to that time, and the eleventh century ByzantinePlatonist Michael Psellus is the first to refer to it as such. Which is to saythat the writings that reached Marsilio Ficino were more than likely notoriginally collected in the way he received them.Some works, however, that are a part of the Corpus Hermeticum were known ofearlier than Psellus. The third century Greek-Egyptian alchemist Zosimus ofPanopolis (about whom the psychologist C.G. Jung gave a famous seminar) speaksof two of them, and around AD 500, John of Stobi (or Stobaeus) in Macedonia,edited an anthology of Hermetic writings which includes excerpts from the CorpusHermeticum. Another work included in the Hermetica is the Asclepius or PerfectDiscourse of Hermes Trismegistus, whose Greek original was lost but a Latintranslation of which — incorrectly attributed to Apuleius, author of The GoldenAss — was widely known during the Middle Ages. Indeed, it was through theAsclepius that Hermes Trismegistus’ importance was made known to Ficino andothers in Cosimo de’ Medici’s circle. But while the texts of the CorpusHermeticum are of a mystical, philosophically pious character, the Asclepius issomewhat more sensational. Among other things it speaks of Egyptian magic, andgloomily prophesizes the downfall of the ancient Egyptian religion and a descentinto barbarity.There are other Hermetic texts and collections but the most famous Hermetic workis undoubtedly the fabled Tabula Smaragdina, or Emerald Tablet of HermesTrismegistus, one of the most celebrated works of occult lore. For thenineteenth century French occultist Eliphas Levi, the Emerald Tablet ‘containsall magic in a single page’.3 [index_split_008.html#filepos53040] The source ofthe most well known Hermetic dictum, ‘as above, so below’, the key to astrology,alchemy, and other occult sciences, the Emerald Tablet has a history asmysterious as its author’s. One legend has Sara, the wife of Abraham, finding itin a cave after the Flood, clutched in the hands of the dead Hermes himself. Inanother account the sage, magician and contemporary of Jesus Christ, Apolloniusof Tyana, is believed to have been its author, and for still others Alexanderthe Great is said to have found it in a hidden vault beneath the feet of theSphinx.So much for the Corpus Hermeticum. What of its mysterious author, thethrice-great Hermes? Here we enter uncertain ground. Depending on your source,there are numerous Hermes Trismegistuses to choose from. One, as mentioned,lived before the Flood and, after inventing hieroglyphics, inscribed his wisdomin them on stele, to preserve it from destruction. After the Flood, anotherHermes Trismegistus translated this wisdom into Greek, and transcribed it intobooks.4 [index_split_008.html#filepos53286] One built the pyramids.5[index_split_008.html#filepos53563] Another created the fantastic city ofAdocentyn, where talismanic images were used to regulate the Nile, as well as tomake the inhabitants virtuous, and where a towering multi-coloured beaconflashed a different colour everyday.6 [index_split_008.html#filepos53810] Onewas Adam’s grandson, and inscribed his wisdom on two columns, one of brick andthe other of stone, again to preserve it from some world conflagration. Anotherdid the same, this time in secret chambers below Egyptian temples.7[index_split_008.html#filepos53997] One passed on his wisdom to Abraham (perhapsthrough Sara), and thus was responsible for the rise of Israel.The Roman philosopher and statesman Cicero spoke of five Hermes, the last ofwhom, after killing many-eyed Argus, as the Greek myth has it, fled to Egypt andthere gave the people their letters and their laws. For Marsilio Ficino, restingon the authority of St Augustine, Hermes Trismegistus was a near contemporary ofMoses, certainly more ancient than Plato or Pythagoras, and for Lactantius (andless so for Augustine), he presaged the incarnation of Christ.8[index_split_008.html#filepos54174] For some he was older than Moses, and wasidentical to Enoch, who interceded with God on behalf of the fallen angels whowere cast out of heaven after dallying with the ‘daughters of men’. For some heis the same person as Idris, one of the Islamic prophets, while for others, heis Cadmus, the founder of Thebes who brought the alphabet to the Greeks. For theJesuit Joachim Bouvet, a correspondent of the sixteenth century philosopherLeibniz, Hermes Trismegistus was probably responsible for the Chinese I Ching,or Book of Changes, and for an eccentric German scholar of the fifteenthcentury, he is the founder of the German people.9[index_split_008.html#filepos54359]As we can see, Hermes’ reputation was certainly based on some remarkableachievements. But in general, and in addition to these accomplishments, HermesTrismegistus is the mythical creator of civilization, responsible for medicine,chemistry, writing, laws, art, astrology, music, magic, rhetoric, philosophy,geography, mathematics and much more. No wonder that Zosimus the alchemist, nostranger to hyperbole, called him ‘one thousand times great’. When Clement ofAlexandria attributed forty-two books to him — no mean feat for any writer — hewas actually selling the thrice-great one very short. The Neoplatonicphilosopher Iamblichus credited Hermes Trismegistus with twenty thousand books,while for Manetho, an Egyptian historian and priest of the third century BC, hewas responsible for thirty-six thousand. According to the esoteric scholar ManlyP. Hall, one of these, the legendary Book of Thoth, ‘contained the secretprocesses by which the regeneration of humanity was to be accomplished’.10[index_split_008.html#filepos54627] Some believe that the Tarot deck is thisfabled book, but others, such as Eliphas Levi, recognize that ‘the monuments ofEgypt’ are its ‘scattered leaves’, where ‘the capital letters are temples, andthe sentences are cities punctuated with obelisks and the sphinx’.11[index_split_008.html#filepos54887] It’s no surprise then that throughout theMiddle Ages and up to the late Renaissance, Hermes Trismegistus was known simplyas ‘the Egyptian’.Yet while for Ficino, Lactantius, St Augustine, and many others HermesTrismegistus was a real person, a great sage who started the ‘Hermetic chain’ ofadepts, reaching from his own primal age to Plato, his real origin lies in theimpact of Egyptian religion and philosophy on the Greeks who inhabited Egyptafter its conquest by Alexander the Great. When Alexander founded Alexandria onthe shores of the Mediterranean in 331 BC, it quickly became the centre ofHellenistic culture in Egypt. Here, in a pluralistic, multi-cultural societymuch like our own, many different religious and philosophical traditions met andinfluenced each other. Jewish, Egyptian and Greek ideas — and later those ofearly Christianity — blended into strange new combinations, giving rise to thereligious syncretism that is synonymous with the city of its origin. One resultof this was the syncretic Greco-Egyptian god Serapis, who was a Hellenisticversion of the Egyptian gods Osiris and Apis and whose main temple was theSerapeum in Alexandria, and whose popularity later even reached Rome. Anothersyncretic union was the result of the identification of the Greek god Hermeswith the Egyptian wisdom god Thoth.Thoth was an important deity, responsible, among other things, for magic andwriting, and he was, like Hermes, a psychopomp, or guide to souls in theunderworld. When Hermes met Thoth in Greco-Egyptian Alexandria, HermesTrismegistus was born. Not long after, followers of the thrice-great one cametogether and devoted themselves to understanding his wisdom and to achieving thesame cosmic illumination that Hermes himself had experienced, and which theyspoke of as gnosis, a sudden, direct, and transformative knowledge of reality.It was then that the Hermetic ‘Religion of the Mind’ began."},{"pageContent":"IN SEARCH OF ANCIENT WISDOM As Frances Yates points out, one of the great ironies of history lay behind therediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum and the ‘Hermetic Renaissance’ thatfollowed it. This was the belief, mentioned above, that Hermes Trismegistus wasa real person and that the Hermetic texts were written in a pristine, goldenpast, a time when men ‘walked more closely with the gods’12[index_split_008.html#filepos55063] and the light of the divine shone morebrilliantly. For the men of the Renaissance, the idea that the more ancient awisdom or sage, the more respect it or he warranted, was predominant. This isnot that different from how many people feel today, as a look in any New Agebookshop, with titles like Supernatural: Meetings With the Ancient Teachers ofMankind, and Ancient Wisdom: Modern World, suggests.13[index_split_008.html#filepos55244] As in the Renaissance, for many of us the‘old’ means the ‘better’. The idea of a perennial philosophy, that primaltheology that Gemistos Plethon spoke of, became a central theme of Ficino’sHermeticism, and has informed esoteric philosophy ever since. As the historianChristopher McIntosh remarked, Ficino ‘started the habit of talking in terms ofa special wisdom handed down from sage to sage’, and practically every occultthinker who followed him did the same.14 [index_split_008.html#filepos55459]Indeed, ‘Hermetic’, ‘occult’, and ‘esoteric’ are by now interchangeable termsused to refer to ideas and beliefs associated with that wisdom. Yet by the earlyseventeenth century, the myth of Hermes Trismegistus had suffered a severe blow.Several factors were responsible for this, but it was the rise of Humanistscholarship that first sounded Hermes’ death knell. It was almost by chance thatin 1614 the Huguenot scholar Isaac Casaubon, caught up in the struggle betweenRome and Luther that led to the Reformation and reshaped the face ofChristendom, realized that the Hermetic writings that had had such an immenseinfluence over philosophers, theologians, and scientists were most likelyforgeries — or in any case, were not what their many advocates believed theywere. Casaubon discovered that they were not, as many believed, written in dimages past, but had emerged in late antiquity, a product of the philosophicalmelting pot of Alexandria in the years following Christ. This discovery,combined with a strong anti-Hermetic movement within the Church, and the rise ofmodern science — evidence of a profound shift in western consciousness — meantthe downfall of the thrice-great one. From a figure of awe and universalrespect, Hermes Trismegistus became something of a joke, his believers obstinatemadmen, and his philosophy superstition.Yet the power of the Hermetic vision remains, as anyone who reads the CorpusHermeticum will know. Ficino and his contemporaries may have been wrong aboutwho Hermes Trismegistus was and when his books were written — although somescholars now believe they were not quite as wrong as was thought — but as I hopethis book will show, they were right about his importance."},{"pageContent":"HERMES REVISITED As someone interested in the Hermetic tradition, I had of course known of themythical Hermes Trismegistus, and years ago had written an article about the‘Hermetic Renaissance’ for the journal Gnosis.15 But it was while writing mybook Politics and the Occult that I began thinking about him again. Part of thebook was devoted to the ideas of René Guénon and Julius Evola, two influentialwriters who belong to the Traditionalists, a school of esoteric thought thatspeaks of a ‘perennial philosophy’, and whose work is based on the belief thatages ago, mankind received an original and once-and-for-all divine revelation.This was subsequently lost — although traces of it, they believe, can be foundin the world’s great religions — and until it is recovered, modern civilizationwill remain mired in materialism and decadence, at least according to Guénon,Evola, and their followers. As readers of Politics and the Occult will know, Itook argument with much of the Traditionalist view, yet I found myself wantingto know more about the figure most associated with this idea of a ‘primordialrevelation’, and with the writings in which this revelation was revealed. That afigure who for some centuries was rated as highly as Moses — perhaps even higherby some — could be relegated to the intellectual dustbin, and his worksconsidered forgeries, intrigued me, and it was a strange feeling to come uponsome image of Hermes or Mercury overlooking a bank and to realize that this wasan echo of the same figure gracing many alchemical texts, or the tile floor ofSiena Cathedral.16When I went back and read the texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, and theworks of scholarship that have gathered around them, I became fascinated withthe history of the Corpus Hermeticum, which more and more read like aphilosophical adventure story. From its origins in Ptolemaic Alexandria to itsrediscovery in Renaissance Florence, the Corpus Hermeticum was secretly shuttledacross medieval Egypt, Turkey, and the Middle East. Fleeing the ravages ofreligious intolerance and wars of conquest, it travelled from Alexandria to themysterious city of Harran, where it became the prophetic book of a strangecommunity of Hermeticists. From Harran it reached Baghdad, where, in the midstof Islam, it informed the mystical philosophy of the Sufis. And when Islamicfundamentalism came to power, it abandoned Baghdad to find a haven in aConstantinople that would itself soon fall to the Turk. I was struck by howwhile cities fell and empires crumbled, the fragile pages of the CorpusHermeticum miraculously survived, testament to how the mind, that insubstantialmystery, can withstand the harshest blows of the material world. The Hermeticquest took place within, in the interior world, that was true; but it travelledroads in the outer world as well. And Hermes Trismegistus himself, hisspectacular rise and fall, from the source of ancient wisdom to a literary hoax:the more I thought of this curious history the more it struck me that it wasemblematic of some great change in western consciousness itself, a change thatthe philosopher Jean Gebser spoke of in terms of different ‘structures ofconsciousness’. And the Hermetic teachings which, with Hermes’ fall, went‘underground’, these too seemed evidence that now, centuries later, anothershift in consciousness was on the rise.The more I looked at these teachings of Hermes, the more I was struck by howmuch they resonated with ideas I had discussed in some of my books. This wasespecially true of the Hermetic idea of gnosis. It was a curious sensation tofeel that a knowledge that anonymous seekers pursued centuries ago in thedeserts of Egypt was the same knowledge that I had myself sought in differentways today, here in postmodern London. This feeling of continuity made theseunknown seekers come to life, and made my own part in the Hermetic quest morereal. It was a strange feeling to suddenly grasp that what I was reading werenot just words on paper, but the record of someone, much like myself, trying tograpple with the unknown. At times I had a dizzying sense that time, space, andhistory had vanished, and that the unknown seekers of Alexandria and myself werein a very real way contemporaries.What follows is a record of my own attempt to understand gnosis, and to tracethe course of Hermes Trismegistus and his teachings in western history.Generally, the ideas associated with Hermetic philosophy are at best assigned amarginal place in accounts of western consciousness. But as I hope a reader willsee, Hermes was a key player in our history, and the Hermetic quest was involvedin some of the most important developments that led to who we are. But HermesTrismegistus is not only a figure from our past. He is, I believe, equallyimportant for our future.As Frances Yates, who opened doors to spiritual and intellectual palaces so manyof us have entered, remarked, Hermeticism is a religion ‘without temples orliturgy, followed in the mind alone’.17 If this is true, than anyone interestedin the Hermetic quest needs nothing more than his or her own mind to embark onit.NOTES 1 [index_split_005.html#filepos27601].

This is at the centre of not only theCorpus Hermeticum and other Hermetica; it is at the heart of practically allspiritual, esoteric, mystical, and occult literature and practice. It is a Greekword meaning knowledge, but it is a knowledge different from, but notnecessarily exclusive of episteme, another Greek word meaning knowledge. Butwhile episteme refers to the body of ideas arrived at through reason andexperience — what we usually refer to when we speak of knowledge — and fromwhich the discipline of epistemology, the philosophical analysis of how we knowwhat we know, arises, gnosis is something different. That 2 + 2 = 4, that wateris composed of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen, and that the earthcircles round the sun, are items of knowledge that fall under episteme. We mayargue about these things, question whether they are true, and, as somephilosophers have done, come up with reasons why we can’t possibly know them oranything else, but they are all items of knowledge that have been arrived atthrough reason and empirical observation. What one knows with gnosis isn’t. Adictionary definition of gnosis gives us ‘intuitive knowledge of spiritualtruths’. A more forceful definition might be ‘immediate, direct, non-discursivecognition of reality’. In this sense gnosis is as immediate and direct anexperience as being thirsty and drinking cold water on a hot day. What one knowsin gnosis isn’t arrived at by argument, logic, or empirical — that is, sensory —observation. It can’t be taught in schools, although the means of arriving atgnosis have been, and continue to be, not in universities and colleges, but ingroups dedicated to esoteric practice, as the Hermetic groups who sought theHermetic gnosis did. I should mention that ‘esoteric’, ‘Hermetic’, and ‘occult’are often used interchangeably, to refer to studies and disciplines that falloutside the mainstream organs of orthodox religion, philosophy, and science, anddeal with extra-sensory reality. While ‘Hermetic’ refers specifically toHermetic philosophy — although it too is often used very loosely — ‘occult’ is amore broad umbrella term, and ‘esoteric’ indicates an ‘inner’, not necessarilysecret but, let’s say, less advertised aspect of a religion, spiritual teachingor school of thought.While in the knowledge that falls under episteme we may be subject to doubt anduncertainty, in gnosis we are not. There, as G.R.S. Mead, a great modernHermetic scholar, remarked, ‘is certitude, full and inexhaustible, no matter howthe doubting mind … may weave its magic …’1 [index_split_022.html#filepos126950]The doubting mind, Mead tells us, knows ‘discursive knowledge’, the ‘noise ofwords’, and ‘the appearance of things’. This, Mead continues, ‘the followers ofHermes left to the “Greeks.” For the Hermeticist ‘only “wisdom” would do’.2[index_split_022.html#filepos127286] And that wisdom was Egyptian.The ‘Greeks’ in this instance stand for the dialectical reasoning of thePlatonic dialogues. By the time the Corpus Hermeticum was being written, thishad reached, as Frances Yates argued, a standstill from which nothing new couldbe expected. Although initially driven by Plato’s original and searching mind,it had hardened into a kind of empty exercise, a wheel of arguments that lednowhere. Egyptian wisdom, gnosis, was a way of escaping this dead end andarriving at a direct apprehension of reality. Not the reality of the senses,which was shifting, changing, and unreliable, but the true, eternal, and livingreality that lay beneath appearances. Its essence was the irrefutable insightthat ‘the individual is fundamentally no different from the Supreme’,3[index_split_022.html#filepos127461] a realization common to many forms ofmysticism. For example, it is the Tat tvam asi, ‘Thou art that’, of VedanticHinduism, the recognition that the Self, in its fundamental form, is identicalwith the ultimate reality, the ground of all phenomena. In both Vedanta andHermeticism, this knowledge, this gnosis, is a form of liberation and salvation.It was this identification of the human self and the divine, found in Christianmystics such as Meister Eckhart, that the Church balked at, even though for sometime Hermes Trismegistus was considered an important precursor of andfellow-traveller with Christianity."},{"pageContent":"NEITHER FAITH NOR BELIEF Although Mead remarks that ‘the very essence of gnosis is the faith that man cantranscend the limits of the duality that makes him man, and become a consciouslydivine being’, Gnosis has really little to do with faith or belief, except thefaith and belief that gnosis is possible, which is the same faith and belief wehave about any knowledge.4 [index_split_022.html#filepos127781] The gnosisitself is neither an expression of faith nor an assertion of belief. In aninterview given to the BBC in his last years, the psychologist C.G. Jung, one ofthe great gnostic thinkers of the modern age, was asked whether he believed inGod.5 [index_split_022.html#filepos127961] ‘Believe?’ Jung replied. ‘Hard tosay. I know. I don’t need to believe.’6 [index_split_022.html#filepos128627]Jung had had an experience that convinced him of the reality of God. He didn’tbelieve in God. He knew God. Jung, Mead would say, had gnosis. I should pointout that by ‘God’ Jung didn’t mean the traditional bearded patriarch on athrone; ‘spiritual reality’, although more abstract is a less contentious termwhich nevertheless conveys the same meaning. The point isn’t what Jung meant byGod but the fact that he had passed from belief to knowledge. Earlier in theinterview, Jung asserts that, as a scientist, he never had any use for belief.This was exactly what the devotees of the Hermetic gnosis wanted to do.The content of the gnosis, what the Hermeticists were gaining knowledge of, werethe true relations between man, the cosmos, and the divine. Again, this is theessence of most mystical or esoteric teachings. We live in ignorance, unaware ofthe true nature of reality and of our place in it. For many people, perhapsmost, this isn’t a problem. They accept day-to-day life and do not ask why weare here and what we are supposed to do now that we are. The seekers of gnosis,however, are unsatisfied with this. They neither accept the ignorance of themany nor the a-gnosis — not knowing — of those who claim that we cannot know theanswers to these questions. These agnostics — the word was coined by T.H. Huxleyin 1860 — argue that gnostics cannot know what they want to know, definingknowledge in the sense of episteme. The knowledge the gnostics seek isn’tamenable to discursive reasoning — Mead’s ‘noise of words’ — nor empiricalobservation, and hence for agnostics isn’t knowledge. The seekers of gnosisdisagree. It’s an argument that’s gone on for some time and won’t be settledhere, although as this book progresses I hope to throw some light on it.The Hermetic teaching tells us that the man of gnosis ‘does not speak much norgives heed to many things’, because ‘God … and the Supreme Good cannot be spokenof or heard’.7 [index_split_022.html#filepos128887] The impossibility ofspeaking of the divine is a common theme in spiritual literature, whether of theEast, where it can be found in the Tao Te Ching — ‘The Tao that can be spoken ofis not the real Tao’ — or the West, where it emerged in the ‘negative theology’of Nicolas of Cusa, whose philosophy was deeply influenced by Hermetic thought.This being so, many of the Hermetic treatises end either in an ecstatic song ofpraise or a mystical silence. This is the same silence that follows listening togreat works of music, which seem to stir feelings and emotions which wordscannot express. Whether this is an immutable characteristic of gnosis is adebatable question, but before the Hermeticist arrives at that pregnant silenceor ecstatic song, the Hermetic treatises do indeed speak of many things."},{"pageContent":"WHEN TRISMEGISTUS SPEAKS The treatises of the Corpus Hermeticum are generally structured as a kind ofconversation or question and answer session between Hermes Trismegistus or otherinitiate and a student, or between Hermes and Nous, the Divine Mind.8[index_split_022.html#filepos129070] They are some of the earliest examples of aform that will become very familiar in esoteric literature, in which ‘one whoknows’ passes on his knowledge to one who wants to know, Ficino’s ‘specialwisdom handed down from sage to sage’. As Clement Salaman remarks, in theIntroduction to his translation of the Asclepius, ‘the setting … is one wheredisciples wait expectantly to hear mysterious secrets from their teacher whichthey hope will transform their lives’.9 [index_split_022.html#filepos129844] Amore recent example of this form is P.D. Ouspensky’s account of his years as astudent of the Greek-Armenian esoteric teacher G.I. Gurdjieff, In Search of theMiraculous, where Ouspensky, who wants to know, sits at the feet of Gurdjieff,who does.In the first treatise of the Corpus Hermeticum, Book I, the Poimandres, forexample, Poimandres or Nous reveals to Hermes the nature of reality. In Book II,Hermes relates some of what he has learned to his student, Asclepius, the nameof the Greek god of healing who was associated with the Egyptian god Imhotep.Other figures like Ammon, and Agathodaimon, who were familiar to Greco-Egyptianmythology, take part in the conversations, as do characters named Tat and Bitys,who are unique to the treatises. The conversations have a dramatic characterthat most likely was modelled on the Platonic dialogues and which helped tocreate and maintain the impression that the individuals involved in them arereal people, a literary tactic that allows for greater identification on thepart of the reader. He or she could identify with the students and go throughthe same process of gnosis as they do, rather as readers of fiction canexperience the emotional ups and downs of the characters in novels.But unlike the Platonic dialogues, which bring their reader to an understandingof things through a process of reason and argument, the aim of the Hermetictreatises isn’t to argue their propositions. ‘Their meaning,’ Clement Salamanwrites, ‘is the change they effect in the hearts of their readers or listenersin awakening them to the truth.’10 [index_split_022.html#filepos130942] Andunlike characters in novels, whose day to day lives we enter, what theparticipants in the Hermetic treatises discuss is somewhat more fundamental. Thecreation of the universe and our place in it; the dual nature of mankind; theliving cosmos; the essential unity of being; destiny and freedom; the means ofactualizing our spiritual nature; the divine mind; spiritual rebirth; the cycliccharacter of history; immortality; the power of magic: these are some of thethings knowledge of which Hermes Trismegistus and his disciples pass on to theireager audience. Although I won’t discuss all of the individual treatises thatmake up the Corpus Hermeticum, excellent, readable translations of these areavailable, and the reader is urged to take the time and read them for himself.11[index_split_022.html#filepos131126] The treatises are short, often aphoristic —the Asclepius is one of the longer ones, but even it is no longer than a chapterin an average book — and what they sometimes lack in literary finesse they makeup for in spiritual and mental stimulation. They are, as one of theirtranslators remarks, ‘spiritual exercises aimed at developing the mentalfaculties of the subject’, whose ‘Hermetic sentences get mysteriously carved inyour memory’.12 [index_split_022.html#filepos132216]"},{"pageContent":"THE WORLD ACCORDING TO HERMES The Poimandres or Divine Pymander, or Pimander as Marsilio Ficino’s translationof the Corpus Hermeticum was called — and which is still retained as the titlein some editions — is the most well known Hermetic treatise, aside, that is,from the Emerald Tablet, which is not a part of the Corpus. As might beexpected, like the Emerald Tablet, the Corpus Hermeticum, and especially thePoimandres, has been adopted by a variety of occult writers and schools, whoseuse and understanding of it is often at odds with that of more serious studentsof esotericism, and certainly with the academic/historical study of these works.One work of this class is the Kybalion, which purports to contain the essence of‘Hermetic Philosophy’. First published in 1908 — the book is now in the publicdomain and is available on the internet — its authors were the anonymous ‘ThreeInitiates’, but there is good reason to believe it was written by William WalkerAtkinson, a prolific writer of pseudo-occult and self-help books, who used anumber of pseudonyms; Atkinson also owned the ‘Yogi Publication Society ofChicago’ which published the Kybalion. Central to the Kybalion’s ‘philosophy’ isthe teaching of the ‘Seven Principles’, which are based on the Hermetic idea ofthe individual’s identity with the divine mind. No record of any work, Hermeticor otherwise, with this name — which one suspects it is derived from theKabbala, the Jewish mystical tradition — exists prior to the Kybalion’spublication, and no recognized authority on Hermeticism includes it in thecanon. A more recent book, The Secret (2006), by Rhonda Byrnes, a bestsellingrehash of the ‘mental science’ promoted in the Kybalion and other similarself-help books of the early twentieth century, makes much use of one of these‘principles’, ‘the Law of Attraction’, which it employs to guarantee its readersthe wealth and happiness they deserve. Needless to say, neither the SevenPrinciples nor the Law of Attraction make any appearance in the CorpusHermeticum, or in any other part of the Hermetica, and the kind of wealth andhappiness both the Three Initiates and Rhonda Byrnes have in mind was not partof the Hermetic program.The fame of the Poimandres is understandable, given that it speaks of ‘firstthings’. It’s an account of the creation of the universe and our place in it. Itbegins with Hermes Trismegistus focusing his mind on the question of ‘the thingswhich are’ — a topic that had troubled Greek philosophers since Parmenides —while his senses are quiet and his understanding is ‘raised to a great height’.He is, that is, in a contemplative, meditative state, detached from the world,when the harangue of the senses has stilled and he is deeply aware of his innerlife. This is the key theme of the treatises and of all esoteric, or inner work:the need to quiet the body to allow the mind to become aware of itself. Man, asHermes Trismegistus will discover, is an inhabitant of two worlds, the outerworld of matter and the senses, and an inner world of consciousness. TheHermetic path is the path to greater consciousness, and one sets out on it bywithdrawing consciousness from the activity of the body and directing it inward.While in this quiet state, Hermes becomes aware of ‘someone great of infinitedimensions’ calling his name and asking him what he wishes to hear and see andwhat he wishes to know. The divine mind, Poimandres, appears to Hermes as aGreat Man, like the Anthropos of the Gnostics, or Adam Kadmon of the Kabbala.Later sages, like the Scandinavian philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg and the poetWilliam Blake will also see the divine in human form; in fact for them, as forthe Hermeticists, the entire creation itself has a human form. Poimandres orPymander is often translated as ‘Shepherd of Men’, a reading that helpedChristian Hermeticists square their Hermeticism with their Christianity; Christ,of course, was a ‘fisher of men’. But another translation offers ‘mind ofauthority’ or ‘mind of sovereignty’, which suggests the power of theexperience.13 [index_split_022.html#filepos132407] This tells us that Hermes isin the presence of something unmistakably real.Poimandres tells Hermes that he knows what he wishes and that he is with himeverywhere; that is to say, he, Poimandres, is Hermes’ own mind and that hehimself has the answers to his own questions. Hermes wants to know ‘the thingsthat are and to understand their nature and to know God’. Poimandres tellsHermes to hold these questions firmly in his mind and he will teach him.What happens next is the creation myth according to Nous. Suddenly, ‘all thingsopened up’ before Hermes and he looks out on a ‘boundless view’. Then Hermessees light, filling his view.14 [index_split_022.html#filepos132651] After ashort while, out of this light darkness appears in the form of a kind of spiralor curling, curving motion leading downwards, which fills Hermes with fear andloathing. Then the darkness turns to water which churns and gives out smoke anda sorrowful cry, which Hermes believes comes from the light. From the light theHoly Word or Logos emerges and enters the churning water — which is also mixedwith earth — and which then emits a flame. The flame rises up and brings with itair, leaving behind the watery earth. Fire and air separate but the water andearth remain mixed for a time, although they too will soon drift apart. Here isthe separation of the classical elements, fire, water, air, and earth, from theprimal chaos.Poimandres explains that the light is Nous, himself, who existed before the darkwaters. The ‘word’ that appeared out of Nous Poimandres calls ‘the Son of God’.The expressions ‘Son of God’, and also ‘Father’, with which the Hermetictreatises sometimes refers to Nous, were seen by Lactantius and other churchfigures as evidence that Hermes Trismegistus was a prophet of Christianity: histhrice-greatness, for example, was seen as his recognition of the Trinity. Whilesome church figures saw this as a reason to include Hermes Trismegistus amongthe precursors of Christianity, others argued that the Hermeticists had stolenthese and other ideas. The most recent scholarship suggests the opposite. TheHermetic reference to a trinity, a ‘Son of God’ and a ‘God the Father’ seems topredate the Christian use of these terms; so the Christians may have borrowedfrom Hermes. Whatever the case, Poimandres tells Hermes that Nous, or mind,existed before the creation, and explains to him that what in him ‘sees andhears’ is ‘the Word of the Lord’, and that this isn’t separate from Nous. SoPoimandres seems to be saying that something in Hermes existed before thecreation.Poimandres then looks at Hermes in a way that makes him tremble and Hermes thensees in his own Nous, or mind, that the light had become an ‘infinite world’ —the cosmos — and he sees a fire ‘encompassed by a mighty power’. AfterPoimandres explains that Hermes has seen Nous in its primal form, a kind ofabsolute archetype that precedes beginning or end (the state of things, say,before the Big Bang), he tells Hermes that the elements originated in anotherNous, created by the first one through the power of the Word, another themefound in Christianity. The androgynous Nous creates a second Nous, who becomesthe craftsman, the creator of the world. The second Nous or craftsman formsseven powers who encircle the sensory world (what will become Earth) in sevenspheres which govern it; their control over the sensory world is what we know ofas destiny. These seven spheres are the seven ancient planets: Moon, Sun,Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Those who remain subject to theirrule are called ‘processions of fate’.15 [index_split_022.html#filepos133734] AsHermes will discover, the aim of the Hermetic work is to transcend thesespheres, in order to reach an ‘Eighth sphere’, beyond the planets, and further,to reach a ‘Ninth sphere’, where those who have awakened to Nous rejoice intheir gnosis. Seeing the pure world of the creator — the world beyond the sevengovernors — the Word or Logos rises up from the watery sphere (Earth) and joinsthe creator Nous — they are in some way the same thing — and the Earth is leftbehind, bereft of the Logos, mere matter."},{"pageContent":"HERMETIC MAN Now the craftsman Nous puts the cosmic wheels in motion, causing the sevenspheres to turn. Because of this motion, living things begin to emerge out ofthe watery earth, but because they lack the Word, being formed only of earthlyelements, they had no speech. Speech, language, and mind are all related in theHermetic vision, and it is not until Man is created that the Word reaches theEarth.Now, having created the creator, and the creator having created a world, thefirst Nous, the Father, thought it good to create a being like himself towitness and enjoy this creation. So he brought forth Man, who Poimandres says isthe ‘same as himself’, the Father Nous. Nous the Father loved Man as he wouldhis child, but we can’t ignore the element of narcissism that plays a great rolein the Hermetic creation myth. Nous loves Man because he is very beautiful,‘bearing the image of his Father’. The Judeo-Christian resonance here isunmistakable; in that myth too, God creates Man in his own image. Nous theFather so loves Man that he hands creation over to him.Seeing the beauty of creation, Man himself wished to create. Nous the Fatheragrees and the craftsman, his brother, gives Man of his power, sharing with himthe forces of the seven spheres. Man becomes curious about activities on theEarth, and wishes to see how his brother, the craftsman, is handling thingsthere. He pierces the seven planetary spheres and looks down upon the Earth,allowing Nature to see him, and in him, the form of Nous. Thus seeing Man,Nature falls in love with him. Seeing his reflection on Earth’s waters(Narcissus again), Man falls in love with Nature, and wishes to be with Her. Nosooner did Man wish this than it was done, and he descended through the spheresand entered a form without the Word: in other words, a body. Nature wrapped herarms around him and, to be brief, they made love, and have been doing so eversince. It was through this love that Man became, as mentioned earlier, a dwellerof two worlds: the earthly world of nature, matter and the senses (the body),and the heavenly world of Nous (mind).Depending on how you look at it, this ‘fall’ was either a mistake or inevitable.Either way, it accounts for the fact, which we all experience in one way oranother, that no matter how much we would like to ‘get back to nature’ andembrace our animal heritage, there is a part of us that is of the stars, thatis, the mind. Hence it is that man/Man is both mortal and immortal, of the Earthand not of it, subject to fate (the seven governors) but able to transcend theirrule. For better or for worse, one part of us is beyond the cosmos, another isslave to it. Hence the ancient interest in astrology was centred around thepossibility of escaping the influence of the stars, and becoming free of it, andnot, as it is today, with gaining insight into our personalities or divining ourfuture. Yet for the Hermeticists, unlike their contemporaries the Gnostics, ourearthly inheritance is not an evil to be shunned, but a responsibility to beembraced. Because of our dual nature, as Hermes Trismegistus tells Asclepius,man ‘raises his sight to heaven while he takes care of the earth’ and ‘lovesthose things that are below him and is beloved by the beings above’.16[index_split_022.html#filepos133914]"},{"pageContent":"THE ASCENT THROUGH THE SPHERES Now having embraced Man, Nature brought forth seven androgynous beings, whoshared in the powers of the seven spheres, and from life and light — the essenceof Nous — Man became soul and mind, that is, our emotional, feeling life, whichmotivates our will, and our intellect. Things remained in this state until theend of a cycle, when all living beings, which had been androgynous, wereseparated into male and female, including Man, much as happens to theandrogynous early humans in Plato’s Symposium. Nous then commands all livingthings to go forth and multiply — again, a very Biblical injunction — andadmonishes all men endowed with mind to remember their immortality, and to knowthat desire, which is of the body, is the cause of death. All those who doremember will come to the ‘Supreme Good’, but all those who prize the body, willremain wanderers in the darkness.When Hermes Trismegistus asks Poimandres why the ignorant must be deprived ofimmortality, he is reminded that as the body is formed of the ‘grim darkness’that preceded the creation, those who cherish the body must return to it, whilethose who remember that they are born of light and life — in other words Nous —will ‘return to life’. Nous himself helps those who seek the light: the devout,noble, pure, merciful, and pious, who, by dampening the dominance of the body,prepare themselves for the presence of mind. Those who lack Nous, or who abandonit for a life of the senses only, are led deeper into darkness. Then Poimandresinforms Hermes that the way back to Nous lies through the ascent through theplanetary spheres, during which one surrenders to them those parts of oneselfwhich they control. To the Moon goes growth and diminution; to the Sun the meansof evil; to Mercury, deceit; to Venus, avarice; to Mars, daring and recklessaudacity; to Jupiter, desire for wealth; and to Saturn, falsehood. Havingsloughed off the parts of oneself that fall within the dominance of thegovernors, one is ready to pass into the realm of the eternal.There one enters the Eighth sphere, where one sings praises to Nous, and hearsthe voices of those who occupy the Ninth sphere. Then, having passed beyond thepowers, the seekers of gnosis become the powers themselves, and then finally allmerge together in God. For, as Hermes tells us, ‘This is the end, the SupremeGood, for those who have had the higher knowledge: to become God’."},{"pageContent":"HERMES’ MISSION Having explained all this to Hermes, Poimandres asks why he does not, havingheard the good news, become the guide of those who are worthy to receive thisgnosis? Hermes accepts his mission, and calls out to those who are lost insleep, drunkenness and ignorance to wake up. Why, he asks, having immortality,do you embrace the mortal? Why, having knowledge, do you remain ignorant? Why,knowing the light, do you remain in darkness? As most prophets and teachersdiscover, the majority either ignored his words, or laughed at them. Only a fewgrasped their meaning, and asked him to teach them the way. To these he passedon his knowledge. For them ‘the sleep of the body became the sobriety of thesoul’, and ‘the closing of the eyes true vision’.17[index_split_022.html#filepos134098] Hermes then gives thanks to Nous in song,and then closes the Poimandres with a prayer, that he may not fall fromknowledge, and that he may lead others out of their ignorance. He then goesforth to carry out his mission."},{"pageContent":"COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS The rest of the Corpus Hermeticum concerns itself with spelling out the mainthemes of the Poimandres and with understanding the consequences of the centralHermetic insight, the unity of being, which the Hermeticists express in theformula ‘the One, the All’. As Hermes tells his disciple Asclepius, ‘all thingsdepend upon the one and all things flow from the one’.18[index_split_022.html#filepos134267] The entire Hermetic philosophy arises fromthis fundamental insight; the dictum ‘as above, so below’, which is the basis ofthe Hermetic doctrine of correspondences, sums up the recognition thateverything in the universe (the One) is related to everything else (the All),and that far from a vast, empty space, peppered here and there with lumps ofdead matter, the universe is alive, an infinite spiritual being, of which we allare parts. ‘There is nothing,’ the Corpus Hermeticum tells us, ‘that comes intobeing or has come into being anywhere that is not God.’19[index_split_022.html#filepos134443]This, in essence, is what the gnosis is about, and much of the Corpus Hermeticumfocuses on what is necessary to achieve this vision, because it is only byachieving it that we become truly human. Without this gnosis, human beings arelittle better than brutes. Worse, in fact, because while the brutes have nopossibility of gnosis, it is our birthright, which we forsake only out ofindolence and fear, subjecting ourselves to what the Hermeticists called the‘twelve tormentors’: ignorance, sorrow, intemperance, lust, injustice, greed,deceit, envy, treachery, anger, recklessness, and malice.20[index_split_022.html#filepos134627] The perceptions of those without Nous ‘arelike those of dumb animals, having a mixture of rage and lust’. They ignore‘things worthy of attention’ and ‘only parade through the cosmos, led astray bypleasures of the body’, which is the way of ‘death’.21[index_split_022.html#filepos134973] But man, Hermes Trismegistus tells us, is a‘divine being’ and ‘is not to be counted amongst the other creatures on earth’.He really belongs among the gods, or ‘to speak the truth boldly, the true man isabove the gods, or at least fully their equal in power’.22[index_split_022.html#filepos135156] This is because while the gods are fixed intheir place in the great cosmic scheme, man, according to Hermes, is free torise to the heights, or plunge to the depths, partaking of all the universeoffers. Man isn’t limited to one niche in the macrocosm, whether that of theangels or the apes, for the simple reason that he is a microcosm, a littleuniverse himself.And what gives man this remarkable status in the cosmos? Gnosis. As you might expect, as I read the treatises in the Corpus Hermeticum andstruggled with their insights, the question of what exactly gnosis is came to memore than once. And while I don’t claim to have answered that question entirely,I do believe that some clues to a possible answer can be found in what follows.In a remarkable passage in Book XI, Nous, or Mind, is again speaking to Hermes,and is trying to explain to him that ‘within God everything lies inimagination’. ‘Consider this,’ Nous tells Hermes:> > Command your soul to go anywhere, and it will be there quicker than your> > command. Bid it to go to the ocean and again it is there at once … Order it> > to fly up to heaven and it will need no wings … and if you wish to break> > through all this and to contemplate what is beyond, it is in your power … If> > you do not make yourself equal to God you cannot understand him. Like is> > understood by like. Grow to immeasurable size. Be free from every body,> > transcend all time. Become eternity and thus you will understand God.> > Suppose nothing to be impossible for yourself. Consider yourself immortal> > and able to understand everything: all arts, sciences and the nature of> > every living creature. Become higher than all heights and lower than all> > depths. Sense as one within yourself the entire creation … Conceive yourself> > to be in all places at the same time: in earth, in the sea, in heaven; that> > you are not yet born, that you are within the womb, that you are young, old,> > dead; that you are beyond death. Conceive all things at once: times, places,> > actions, qualities and quantities; then you can understand God.23> > [index_split_022.html#filepos135331] Again, in the Asclepius, Hermes cautions Asclepius and the others present, Tatand Hammon, to ‘be entirely present, as far as your mind and ability arecapable. For the knowledge of God is to be attained by a godlike concentrationof consciousness’. ‘Such knowledge,’ Hermes informs them, ‘comes like a rushingriver tumbling in flux from above to the depths beneath. By its headlong rush itoutruns any effort we make as hearers, or even as teachers.’24[index_split_022.html#filepos135506] And later Hermes again admonishes hisdisciples to listen to his discourse with ‘attentive obedience’, otherwise itwill ‘fly over you and flow round you, or rather it will flow back and mingleagain with the waters of its own source’.The need for ‘attentive obedience’, ‘wakefulness’, and ‘concentration’ will belooked at later. Right now I want to focus on the description of gnosis — ‘theknowledge of God’ — as a ‘rushing river tumbling in flux’, and the kind ofmystical perception described in Book XI of the Corpus Hermeticum, which theacademic Florian Ebeling aptly referred to as ‘omni-vision’.25[index_split_022.html#filepos135690]While reading Nous’ words to Hermes in Book XI, and Hermes’ words to Asclepius,I was reminded of a more modern account of an altered state of consciousnessthat seems remarkably similar to the Hermetic gnosis. In 1873, the Canadianpsychologist Richard M. Bucke was visiting London, and while riding in acarriage after an evening reading poetry with friends, he entered a curiousstate of consciousness unlike anything he had ever experienced. ‘His mind’ —Bucke tells the story in the third person — ‘deeply under the influence of theideas, images and emotions’ stirred by the poetry ‘was calm and peaceful’ andBucke found himself in a state of ‘quiet, almost passive enjoyment’. Then:> > All at once, without warning of any kind, he found himself wrapped around as> > it were by a flame-coloured cloud. For an instant he thought of fire, some> > sudden conflagration in the great city; the next, he knew the light was> > within himself. Directly afterwards came upon him a sense of exultation, of> > immense joyousness accompanied or immediately followed by an intellectual> > illumination quite impossible to describe [my italics]. Into his brain> > streamed one momentary lightning-flash of the Brahmic Splendour which has> > ever since lightened his life; upon his heart fell one drop of Brahmic> > bliss, leaving thenceforward for always a taste of heaven. Among other> > things he did not come to believe, he saw and knew that the Cosmos is no> > dead matter but a living Presence, that the soul of man is immortal, that> > the universe is so built and ordered that without any peradventure all> > things work together for the good of each and all, that the foundation> > principle of the world is what we call love and that the happiness of> > everyone is in the long run absolutely certain. He claims that he learned> > more within the few seconds during which the illumination lasted than in the> > previous months or even years of study, and that he learned much that no> > study could ever have taught [my italics].> > > The illumination itself continued not for more than a few moments but … it> > was impossible for him ever to forget what he at that time saw and knew …> > The supreme occurrence of that night was his real and sole initiation to the> > new and higher order of ideas.26 [index_split_022.html#filepos135869] We should note that before his ‘illumination’, Bucke was in a calm, peaceful,quiet state, much as Hermes is before Nous appears to him at the start of theCorpus Hermeticum. And like Hermes, Bucke is suddenly ‘raised to a great height’and given a ‘boundless view’. And as the passages I’ve italicized show, Bucke’sexperience had a powerfully cognitive aspect. It was not simply an inordinaterush of feeling or emotion, although, to be sure, powerful emotions did appear,nor was it something necessarily supernatural, in the sense of a vision of a godor angel. Its essence was a knowing, a gnosis, which seemed, as Hermes hadwarned Asclepius, to come to Bucke in a rush ‘tumbling in a flux’. Yet in thetorrent of insights, Bucke ‘saw and knew’ and was initiated into a ‘new andhigher order of ideas’. Some years after this experience, Bucke wrote a bookabout it, Cosmic Consciousness, first published in 1901, in which he argued thathuman beings were slowly evolving into this higher, expanded form ofconsciousness, and that examples of it can be found throughout history. Some ofBucke’s examples include Buddha, Jesus, and Mohammed; in fact, Bucke argues thatthe major world religions were all founded upon an experience of ‘cosmicconsciousness’, an idea that seems to chime with Gemistos Plethon’s notion of aprisca theologia. Bucke also offered some more recent examples of cosmicconsciousness, the most prominent of which was the pantheistic poet WaltWhitman, of whom Bucke was a devotee. Curiously, in a literary study ofHermeticism, E.L. Tuveson argues that Whitman was one of the ‘avatars ofthrice-great Hermes’, although Whitman himself seems not to have been familiarwith the Hermetica, nor does Hermes Trismegistus figure in Bucke’s pantheon ofthose who have experienced cosmic consciousness.27[index_split_022.html#filepos136717]"},{"pageContent":"THE NITROUS OXIDE EXPERIMENTS Some readers of Bucke’s book were also privy to snippets of cosmicconsciousness, and their accounts of it seem to offer some insight into theHermetic gnosis as well. The philosopher and psychologist William James, whodiscusses Bucke’s ideas in his classic Varieties of Religious Experiences, hadtwo experiences similar to Bucke’s, one under the influence of nitrous oxide,the other with no apparent stimulus. Both shared in the cognitive quality ofBucke’s vision.Under the effects of the gas, which produced a ‘tremendously exciting sense ofan intense metaphysical illumination’ in which ‘truth lies open to view in depthupon depth of almost blinding evidence,’ James felt an ‘immense emotional senseof reconciliation’ as ‘every opposition … vanishes in a higher unity in which itis based’. James saw that ‘unbroken continuity is of the essence of being’ andthat ‘we are literally in the midst of an infinite, to perceive the existence ofwhich is the utmost we can attain’. And if the prompt for James’ insight —nitrous oxide — makes us question its value, consider his other moment of cosmicconsciousness, which happened while he was engaged in conversation, with noimmediate trigger. While talking, James was suddenly:> > … reminded of a past experience; and this reminiscence, ere I could conceive> > or name it distinctly, developed into something further that belonged with> > it, this in turn into something further still, and so on, until the process> > faded out, leaving me amazed at the sudden vision of increasing ranges of> > distant facts of which I could give no articulate account [my italics]. The> > mode of consciousness was perceptual, not conceptual — the field expanding> > so fast that there seemed no time for conception or identification to get in> > its work. There was a strongly exciting sense that my knowledge of past (or> > present?) reality was enlarging pulse by pulse [my italics], but so rapidly> > that my intellectual processes could not keep up the pace … The feeling — I> > will not call it belief — that I had had a sudden opening, had seen through> > a window, as it were, into distant realities that incomprehensibly belonged> > with my own life, was so acute that I cannot shake it off today. Again, there is a distinct cognitive character to the experience. But thecognition came in such a flood — Hermes’ ‘rushing river tumbling in flux’ — thatJames couldn’t hold on to it, recalling Hermes’ words to Tat in Book X, that the‘Supreme Good cannot be spoken of or heard’. A similar problem occurred duringJames’ nitrous oxide experiment. Trying to nail down some of the teemingthoughts, James took some notes, only to find afterward that ‘to the soberreader’ they would seem ‘meaningless drivel’. ‘Sheet after sheet of phrasesdictated or written during the intoxication … which at the moment oftranscribing were fused in the fire of infinite rationality’ had dwindled tononsense like ‘What’s a mistake but a kind of take? What’s nausea but a kind of— ausea?’Another reader of Bucke, and James, was the Russian journalist and writer P.D.Ouspensky, best known as a follower of Gurdjieff, but an important thinker inhis own right.28 [index_split_022.html#filepos137016] Impressed by James’account, and by Bucke’s book, Ouspensky repeated James’ nitrous oxideexperiment, with much the same results. Like James and Bucke, Ouspensky foundhimself in a world of total unity, in which there was ‘nothing separate, thatis, nothing that can be named or described separately’.29[index_split_022.html#filepos137262] In this new world, which was ‘entirelyunlike anything that occurs in life’, Ouspensky found that everything wasconnected, unified, linked together, and that this insight led to the samedifficulties that James had experienced. This new consciousness ‘gave at once somuch that was new and unexpected, and these new and unexpected experiences cameupon me and flashed by so quickly, that I could not find words, could not findforms of speech, could not find concepts, which would enable me to remember whathad occurred even for myself, still less to convey it to anyone else’. This lastremark is strikingly similar to Hermes’ admonition to Asclepius that gnosis in‘its headlong rush outruns any effort we make as hearers, or even as teachers’,and Ouspensky learned the truth of it when he tried to talk to a friend aboutthe insights he was having. ‘I began to say something,’ he wrote, ‘but betweenthe first and second words of my sentence such an enormous number of ideasoccurred to me and passed before me, that the two words were so widely separatedas to make it impossible to find any connection between them.’30[index_split_022.html#filepos137519] Like James, Ouspensky took notes of whatwas happening, and like James he was disappointed in what he read afterward.‘Think in other categories’ was the ‘key’ with which he wished to trigger thisnew cognition at a later date. More disturbing still was the effect of lookingat an ashtray. ‘Suddenly,’ he writes, ‘I felt that I was beginning to understandwhat the ashtray was, and at the same time, with a certain wonder and almostwith fear, I felt that I had never understood it before and that we do notunderstand the simplest things around us.’ The ashtray had ‘roused a whirlwindof thoughts and images’ and contained an ‘infinite number of facts’. Everythingconnected with smoking and tobacco ‘roused thousands of images, pictures,memories’. And the ashtray itself: how had it come into being? What of thematerials it was made of? How had they been discovered? Who had made it? Theseand dozens of other questions tumbled through Ouspensky’s mind and he once againtried to capture some of this flux in words. The result was the disquietinginsight that ‘A man can go mad from one ashtray’. By this Ouspensky had tried toconvey the insight that ‘in one ashtray it was possible to know all’.Again, if we are inclined to question the significance of Ouspensky’s ashtraybecause he was observing it while under the influence of nitrous oxide, anearlier, non-drug stimulated experience has a remarkable similarity to the kindof ‘omni-vision’ Florian Ebeling finds at the core of Hermetic philosophy. In1908, while on a steamer crossing the Sea of Marmora in Turkey, Ouspensky stoodon deck, watching the waves, as they crashed against the ship. He felt the waves‘drawing’ his ‘soul’ to themselves. Then:> > Suddenly I felt it go to them. It was only a moment, maybe less than a> > moment. But I entered the waves and, with them, with a roar, attacked the> > ship. And at that moment I became all [italics in the original]. The waves —> > they were myself. The violet mountains in the distance — they were myself.> > The wind — it was myself. The clouds, hurrying from the north, the rain —> > were myself. The huge ship, rolling indomitably forward — was myself … The> > mate on duty and the bridge was I; and two sailors … and the black smoke,> > billowing from the funnel … everything. It was a moment of extraordinary> > liberation, joy and expansion.31 [index_split_022.html#filepos137702]"},{"pageContent":"TALKING WITH ANGELS Like Bucke, whose moment of cosmic consciousness produced ‘a sense ofexultation, of immense joyousness’, Ouspensky’s moment filled him with joy, anda sense of ‘liberation’. James, too, felt an ‘immense emotional sense ofreconciliation’, a feeling that everything was good, that all was right, verymuch like the sense of cosmic unity that end many of the Hermetic books andwhich often leads to ecstatic songs of praise. Exactly why everything was goodand all was right, neither Bucke, James, nor Ouspensky could convey in anyrational, articulate speech. When considering this I was reminded of somethingthe Scandinavian religious philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg, who often visitedheaven and hell, said about the angels: that they ‘can say more in a minute thanmany can say in half an hour’. Angelic language, Swedenborg wrote, ‘has nothingin common with human language’. Angels, Swedenborg tells us, can ‘set down in afew words the contents of many written pages’, and their speech ‘is so full ofwisdom that they with a single word can express things which men could notcompass in a thousand words’. And in his conversations with angels, Swedenborgexperienced the same inability to retain what he had learned that James andOuspensky had in their moments of cosmic consciousness. ‘On occasion,’Swedenborg tells us:> > … I have been assigned to the state in which angels were and … have talked> > with them. At such times I understood everything [my italics]. But when I> > was sent back into my earlier state … and wanted to recall what I had heard,> > I could not. For there were thousands of things that had no equivalent in> > concepts of natural thought, that were therefore inexpressible except simply> > through shiftings of heavenly light — not at all by human words.32> > [index_split_022.html#filepos137948] In the Introduction, I mentioned that Hermes Trismegistus was said to havewritten a remarkable number of books; one estimate was twenty thousand(Iamblichus), another thirty-six thousand (Manetho). To the rational mind, thisseems absurd, even if some writers do rack up an unusual number of volumes(Georges Simenon, for example, the creator of Inspector Maigret, wrote nearlytwo hundred novels.) But if we consider Swedenborg’s remarks about angeliclanguage, one wonders if the thrice-great one wrote his works in a similartongue? A few volumes written in the language of the angels would be equivalentto many dozens in our earthbound speech. In any case, with Swedenborg we get, aswe do with Hermes, Bucke, James, and Ouspensky, the idea of a huge amount ofinformation channelled in a short space of time to a consciousness not quiteable to assimilate it. Cosmic consciousness occurs in moments, and Swedenborg’sangels say ‘more in a minute than many can say in half an hour’. The experienceis accompanied by a sense of happiness, of joy, so powerful that it marks forlife those who have it, and in the case of the Egyptian Hermeticists circa 200AD, it leads to either a mystical, thankful silence or to ecstatic songs ofpraise, triggering the ‘yea-saying’ faculty that James believed alcohol andother stimulants had the power to release."},{"pageContent":"MIND AT LARGE What prompts this response? Why should an increase in knowledge lead to‘exultation’ and an ‘immense sense of reconciliation?’ After all, I am at thismoment sitting in the British Library, surrounded by the ‘world’s knowledge’,with immediate access, not only to thousands of books, but also to the globalnetwork of electronic sources, the internet and worldwide web, that makes up ourplanet’s cerebral cortex. I am glad I am here and can use this resource, but Iam not overjoyed, although perhaps I should be. Why is the knowledge one getswith gnosis different?The answer should be obvious. In gnosis, the knowledge one receives is immediateand direct, not filtered through the rational mind. It is not abstract, butliving. It is real. I can sit here and reflect on the thought that ‘all is one’,and consider the arguments of philosophers who have said this, Plotinus, Hegel,Whitehead, and others. But although I can follow their thoughts and even agreewith them, and perhaps have brief flashes of this unity, I don’t feel it to betrue. Yet in gnosis I would.Considering the experience of Bucke and the others, I was reminded of somethingAldous Huxley said in his book The Doors of Perception, his account of hisexperiment with the drug mescaline. Famously, after taking the drug Huxley foundhimself ‘seeing what Adam had seen on the morning of his creation — the miracle,moment by moment, of naked existence’.33 [index_split_022.html#filepos138219]Later, Huxley tried to account for the remarkable effects of the drug, which,along with a heightening of perception included the kind of widening of thesense of self that Ouspensky felt on the Sea of Marmora, when he was the waves,the mountains, and so on. Huxley speaks of everything shining with an innerlight that reflected the infinity of its significance (much like Ouspensky’sashtray), and when gazing at the bamboo legs of a chair, he felt he had becomethem. Huxley reflected that an idea first suggested by the philosopher HenriBergson could possibly explain what had happened. He quotes the philosopher C.D.Broad, who paraphrases Bergson’s idea. ‘The suggestion,’ Broad writes:> > … is that the function of the brain and nervous system and sense organs is> > in the main eliminative and not productive. Each person is at each moment> > capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving> > everything that is happening everywhere in the universe [my italics]. The> > function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being> > overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant> > knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or> > remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special> > selection which is likely to be practically useful.34> > [index_split_022.html#filepos138466] Mescaline and other psychedelic drugs work, then, by opening up the brain’s‘reducing valve’, thus allowing more of reality into consciousness. And thesame, I think, can be said of moments of cosmic consciousness that aren’ttriggered by a drug. In them, for some reason, the ‘reducing valve’ is opened ofits own accord.The Hermetic character of the passage I’ve quoted is remarkable; Huxley evenfollows it by commenting that ‘according to such a theory, each one of us ispotentially Mind at Large’, which is more or less what Nous is at pains to teachto Hermes. The statement that ‘each person is at each moment capable ofremembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything thatis happening everywhere in the universe’ is a neat abstract of Nous’ command toHermes to ‘conceive yourself to be in all places at the same time: in earth, inthe sea, in heaven; that you are not yet born, that you are within the womb,that you are young, old, dead; that you are beyond death. Conceive all things atonce: times, places, actions, qualities and quantities’. Broad’s remarks, orBergson’s, can’t be rejected as airy speculation by hard-nosed scientistsdemanding proof, as there is some very hard evidence for them. In 1952, theCanadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield accidentally stimulated a section of apatient’s brain while performing an operation. As the brain has no pain centres,the patient was awake when Penfield did this, and reported experiencing, notmerely a memory of a past event, but an absolutely vivid ‘re-experience’ of it,as if the past event was happening then and there. Subsequently, neuroscientistsestablished that the brain retains an acute memory of everything it hasexperienced, including memories of events that we are not consciously aware ofat the time, something the novelist Marcel Proust discovered when he tasted abiscuit dipped in tea and suddenly found himself back in Combray, a part ofFrance where he spent his childhood holidays. The result was Proust’s enormousnovel A Remembrance of Things Past, a work deeply influenced by Bergson’s ideasabout ‘involuntary memory’."},{"pageContent":"TOO MUCH INFORMATION? We will return to our remarkable, if generally unknown and unused ability tovividly re-create past events later. For the moment I want to focus on why wearen’t aware of ‘everything that is happening everywhere in the universe’ moreoften. The basic reason is the one that Huxley points out: we simply don’t needto be. ‘To make biological survival possible,’ Huxley writes, ‘Mind at Large hasto be funnelled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system.’ And‘what comes out … is the measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which willhelp us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet’.35[index_split_022.html#filepos138635] If I am trying to cross a busy street,being aware of what is happening on some planet in a galaxy many light yearsaway is of no immediate use to me. Being overwhelmed by cosmic consciousnesswill not help me in the day-to-day struggle for survival, and so I — or who orwhatever is responsible for human evolution — edit it out. Huxley goes on tomake some remarks that refer to the distinction between gnosis and epistemediscussed at the start of this chapter. ‘To formulate and express the contentsof this reduced awareness,’ Huxley writes:> > … man has invented and endlessly elaborated those symbol-systems and> > implicit philosophies we call language. Every individual is at once the> > beneficiary and victim of the linguistic tradition into which he or she has> > been born — the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the> > accumulated records of other people’s experiences [the ‘world’s knowledge’ I> > am in the midst of at the British Library], the victim in so far as it> > confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness is the only awareness and> > as it bedevils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his> > concepts for data, his words for actual things.

The various ‘other> > worlds’, with which human beings erratically make contact are so many> > elements in the totality of the awareness belonging to Mind at Large.36> > [index_split_022.html#filepos138811] Episteme, then, is knowledge of the world seen through ‘reduced awareness’;gnosis is the knowledge of ‘Mind at Large’.We might think that starting out, as it were, as Mind at Large, Nous, or whoeveris responsible, made a mistake by squeezing itself into our pitifully smallbrains. The loving embrace of Man and Nature, then, would indeed have been a‘fall’. But as Asclepius tells his disciples, in order to care for creation,which is part of our purpose, we need a body, and a body needs a brain. So Godgave Man a ‘corporeal dwelling place’ and ‘mixed and blended our two naturesinto one’. Thus He did justice to our ‘twofold origin’, and we can ‘wonder atand adore the celestial, while caring for and managing the things on earth’.37[index_split_022.html#filepos138980] Huxley himself remarked that if everyonetook mescaline, there would be no war, but there would be no civilizationeither: looking at a sink full of dirty dishes, Huxley thought they were toobeautiful to bother about. Many a less disciplined psychedelic imbiber felt thesame. Under mescaline — and other inebriants — Huxley recognized that ‘the willsuffers a profound change for the worse’ and ‘the mescaline taker sees no reasonfor doing anything in particular’.38 [index_split_022.html#filepos139176] Othermental voyagers confirm this. At the end of his essay on his nitrous oxideexperiment, James wrote that: ‘indifferentism is the true outcome of every viewof the world which makes infinity and continuity to be its essence’. If all isone, why do one thing rather another? Why, indeed, wash those dishes? (James,after all, was one of the founders of pragmatism, an eminently practicalphilosophy.) Being continually awash in cosmic consciousness or psychedelicintoxication, we could hardly fulfil our responsibilities as carers and managersof the Earth. This isn’t to say we necessarily do a good job of it now — that isnot the point — but we would do infinitely worse if we were all in a will-lessstate of bliss.It strikes me then that, rather than the result of a ‘fall’ or cosmic error, ourconsciousness is purposefully limited — by whom is unclear — in order for us toget on with our business here, which seems to be the slow, often frustratingprocess of assimilating gnosis to episteme, of grabbing hold of the insightsthat come ‘like a rushing river tumbling in flux’ and turning them into words,contrary to the common idea that such mystical experiences are ineffable. Thepoint of gnosis, then, is not only to have the experience, but to communicateit, and by doing so, to add to our understanding of ourselves and the cosmos, anunderstanding that Nous, God, or whoever, wants and is engaged in acquiringthrough us. This is a point we will return to further on."},{"pageContent":"LIFE FAILURE AND THE GOLDILOCKS EFFECT The reader may think I have come a long way from Hermes Trismegistus, but I mustbeg his indulgence for a little while longer. Now, although the brain’s‘reducing valve’ works very well in helping us ‘stay alive on the surface ofthis particular planet’, it also produces some unhelpful side effects. One isthe curious narrowing of consciousness that we call boredom and its accompanyingsense of meaninglessness. We know that in childhood, we all feel something ofwhat Huxley felt under mescaline, that sense of ‘seeing as Adam had seen on themorning of his creation’, when practically everything we encounter isdelightful. And we also know that as time passes, we lose this; ‘the glory andthe freshness of a dream’ fades and we feel the ‘shades of the prison house’close in, as Wordsworth tells us (‘Intimations of Immortality’). This is theeffect of ‘growing up’ and it leads to the ‘been there done that’ sensibility socommon today. This sense of ‘life failure’, as Colin Wilson calls it, can be sogreat that it can even lead to suicide, or to ‘living dangerously’ (Nietzsche),in order to stimulate the will to life. It can also lead to other undesirableresults — alcoholism, drug addiction, violence, sexual perversions — and otherways in which we try to get a more satisfying return on our investment in life.And it can also lead to a broad philosophical belief that life, the universe, ismeaningless, a view that much of contemporary science and contemporary cultureseems to share.Gnosis, cosmic consciousness, psychedelic experiences can revive ‘the glory andfreshness of a dream’. But as we’ve seen, having too much of this, as seems tohappen on these occasions, is equally problematic. We seem to be stuck in themiddle between too much meaning and not enough. Too much meaning incapacitatesthe will. Not enough meaning gives us nothing to will for. Clearly the idealwould be to find some profitable middle ground, that ‘just right’ condition Ihave called the ‘Goldilocks effect’, where we can open the valve and let in moremeaning, so that at thirty-five or forty, we aren’t asking about life ‘Is thatall there is?’ but not open the tap so wide that we are flooded with moremeaning than we can do anything with. I think the Hermeticists were trying to dothis, or were at least trying to give the experience of gnosis some structure.That is, they were trying to strengthen their minds, so that who or whatever wasresponsible for opening the brain’s ‘reducing valve’, would recognize that theywere disciplined enough to absorb a greater degree of reality, withoutsuccumbing to the cosmic lethargy symbolized by Huxley’s unwashed dishes."},{"pageContent":"REPTILE BRAINS Again, talking about the brain may seem to lead the discussion away fromHermeticism, which is, after all, about alchemy and magic and the macrocosm andmicrocosm. But as we will see in the next chapter, the Egyptian wisdom thatHermeticism is supposed to be based on, is itself concerned with the function ofthe brain, at least according to one of its interpreters. Here I will note that,in talking about Hermetic philosophy, the esoteric scholar Manly P. Hallremarked that ‘when certain areas of the brain are stimulated by the secretprocesses of the Mysteries, the consciousness of man is extended and he ispermitted to behold the Immortals and enter into the presence of superiorgods’.39 Clearly, one reference isn’t proof that gnosis has to do with thebrain’s ‘reducing valve’, yet the Hermetic books themselves seem to suggest thattheir authors had an intuition about the brain’s evolution and structure. InBook X, Hermes informs Tat that ‘human souls which gain immortality aretransformed into spirits’, and enter the ‘choruses of the gods’. But those whodo not awake their Nous and ‘remain evil’ are turned back on their journey(toward God) and move ‘towards the reptiles’.40 In the 1950s, the neuroscientistPaul D. MacLean developed his theory of the triune brain, which argued that thepeculiar human brain, the cerebral cortex, grew out of two previous ‘brains’,what he called the ‘R-complex’ and the ‘limbic system’. The limbic system is our‘old mammalian’ inheritance and is something we share with other mammals; it isthe seat of our emotions. The R-complex is also called the ‘reptilian brain’,and is formed of the brain stem and cerebellum. It is the oldest part of thebrain and is involved with regulating autonomic functions, like breathing andheartbeat, and is primarily reactive: it has no free will or power of choice.These are associated solely with the cerebral or neo-cortex, which isresponsible for reason, speech and cognition — three functions clearlyassociated with Hermetic man. In saying that those who fail to awaken Nous slipback ‘towards the reptiles’, did the author of this Hermetic book intuit that byforgoing our peculiar human abilities, we actually do retreat back into ourreptile brain? That fact that in world mythology a snake, dragon, or otherreptilian creature is often used to symbolize the condition of chaos prior tothe world’s creation — or the state of unconscious being before the rise ofself-consciousness — seems to offer support for this possibility.Let us leave this question for now. Further on we will have more to say aboutthe brain and its relation to gnosis. But at this point let us take a look atthe land where the Hermetic philosophy was thought to have been born.

As with ‘romantic’ and ‘existential,’‘gnostic’ has taken on a usage and meaning that exceeds reference to thereligious and spiritual communities and beliefs that arose in the firstcenturies following Christ and is now often used in a broader sense to meansecret, hidden, or occult, as well as the individuals who pursue knowledge ofthis kind. For the specific historical groups and teachings that make upGnosticism, I will use Gnostic. For less specific references, I will usegnostic.6 [index_split_010.html#filepos62383]. C.G.

There are several definitions andinterpretations of the Greek word Nous, which in English is sometimes used tomean ‘common sense’, and which is the probable source of the American slangphrase ‘use your noodle’, meaning to ‘use your head,’ to think somethingthrough. For different Greek philosophers — Anaxagoras, Plato, Aristotle — itmeans intellect, mind, logos, reason, either that of the individual or of God.In terms of experience, as I hope will become clear, for the Hermetic thinkers,the sense in which it is understood as a sudden godlike cognition is probablythe closest.9 [index_split_011.html#filepos66409]. Clement Salaman, Introduction toAsclepius The Perfect Discourse of Hermes Trismegistus (London: Duckworth,2007), pp. 11–12. Readers who go on to read Salaman’s excellent translations maynote that some of the language used is remarkably similar to that of theGurdjieffean ‘fourth way’. This is not surprising, given that Salaman is amember of the School of Economic Science, an offshoot of P.D. Ouspensky’s London‘fourth way’ schools of the 1930s and ‘40s. This is not to say that Salaman hasimported language from one ‘esoteric school’ to another. ‘Wakefulness’ and thestruggle against ‘sleep’ that characterizes the ‘fourth way’ are themes inherentin the Hermetica, as well as in other spiritual philosophies. Salaman is alsothe editor of a translation of The Letters of Marsilio Ficino (1999) prepared bythe London Language Department of the School of Economic Science.10 [index_split_011.html#filepos68178].

In his fascinating book The ReflexiveUniverse (New York: Delacorte Press, 1976), the philosopher and inventor ArthurM. Young makes some remarks about light that seem to have an Hermetic cast.‘Light,’ Young says, ‘is the unitary purposive principle which engenders theuniverse,’ and ‘has the nature of a first cause’. (p. 23) ‘Light, because it isprimary, must be unqualified — impossible to describe — because it is antecedentto the contrasts necessary to description.’ (p. 10) ‘Light is not an objectivething that can be investigated as can ordinary objects … Light is not seen. Itis seeing.’ (Ibid.) The history of light as a metaphor for vision and knowledge— illumination, enlightenment — is too long to enter here, but seems to warranta serious study.

OUT OF EGYPT The idea that Egypt is the source of all wisdom is almost as old as Egyptitself. According to the tradition, practically every western wise man or sagewent to school in the land of the pyramids and the Sphinx. Probably the mostwell known example of this is found in Plato’s Timaeus, in which Solon, one ofthe Seven Wise Men of Greece, is informed by an Egyptian priest that the Greeksare ‘only children’. The same priest told Solon the story of Atlantis andinformed him that Egyptian civilization was eight thousand years old. Yet Solonwasn’t alone. Plato himself, legend has it, followed in Solon’s footsteps, andothers took the journey before him, Pythagoras, Orpheus, Thales, Anaximander,not to mention Moses too, to name a few. For Herodotus, the ‘father of history’,who also made the trip, the Egyptians ‘were scrupulous beyond all measure in thematter of religion’,1 [index_split_032.html#filepos204285] and their expertisein questions of life, death and the world beyond, was common knowledge among theancients. Because of this, going to Egypt to learn the mysteries became a kindof obligatory gesture among the Greeks, much as making a ‘journey to the East’to sit at a guru’s feet was in the 1960s and 70s, or backpacking amongindigenous ‘shamans’ is today. In fact it became so de rigueur for Greekphilosophers and wise men to make the trip to Egypt that later historians cameto doubt the truth of their journeys, and argued that their biographers includedthem in the accounts of their lives, simply because this was the expected thing.No self-respecting sage would have missed such a voyage, and so, the argumentwent, their followers added one to their CV, whether they actually went there ornot.Yet the Greeks weren’t the only Egypt-besotted people. The popularity of Egyptas a holy land and site of mysteries was so great that many Romans visited theretoo, seeking out the hidden secrets, fuelling a busy trade in ‘esoteric tourism’that continues today, as the dozens of travel guides and package tours to‘mysterious Egypt’ available to modern consumers show. That the Romans, who forus are ancient, saw Egypt as a land of hoary mysteries tells us that Egypt hasbeen old for a very long time — it is, in fact, difficult to think of Egypt as‘young’ — and that its reputation as the source of the deepest knowledge andwisdom has been around for awhile.Small wonder then, that with such a reputation, academic students of the historyof Hermeticism began to see Egypt as ‘the almost mythically overrated origin ofall divine wisdom and human pious practices’.2[index_split_032.html#filepos204534]"},{"pageContent":"THE WRITING ON THE WALL Such assessments may be too harsh, but for many today, they seem justified.Whether or not Plato, Pythagoras and the others made the trip to Egypt to learnof its dark secrets remains a much debated point, but in one sense it isunimportant. The view of Egypt as a land of esoteric mysteries received aconsiderably blow in 1822 when Jean-François Champollion, a French scholar oflanguages, famously cracked one Egyptian mystery: the meaning of thehieroglyphics, which had hitherto baffled linguists. Champollion made hisbreakthrough by comparing the three inscriptions of the same text, in Greek,demotic (or written Egyptian), and hieroglyphics, carved into the surface of astele found in Rosetta, Egypt, and which dated to 196 BC. The stele, of course,soon became known as the Rosetta Stone, and because he could read Greek andcould work out the demotic through his understanding of Coptic — the lateEgyptian language written in the Greek alphabet — Champollion could compare theinscriptions in these languages with the hieroglyphics, and decipher theirmeaning. Yet what Champollion found was not ‘the highest mysteries of theDivinity’, as some earlier students of hieroglyphics argued the strange figuresand symbols contained, but a ‘dull record … of the acts and attributes ofkings’.3 [index_split_032.html#filepos204712] The Rosetta Stone in particular,which is on display in the British Museum, announces a repeal of taxes oncertain temples. An interesting addition to our knowledge of ancient Egypt, nodoubt, but not a particularly mystical discovery.Champollion was not the only one to try to uncover the hieroglyphics’ secret,and he shares credit for unlocking their mystery with the Englishman ThomasYoung. Both Young and Champollion, however, profited by the work of those whocame before them, like the French Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy and his student,the Swede Johan David Akerblad. But ironically, one of the most remarkablestudents of the hieroglyphics was a scholar who did much to promote the idea ofEgypt as a land of ancient mysteries and occult secrets. So significant was hisearly work that he has come to be seen as the founder of Egyptology, a creditthat many contemporary Egyptologists wish to ignore. This isn’t surprising,given that modern mainstream Egyptology is dead set against the idea thatancient Egypt had anything to do with the kind of mystical, esoteric philosophythat the founder of their discipline believed in wholeheartedly."},{"pageContent":"THE LAST RENAISSANCE MAN Athanasius Kircher was a seventeenth century German Jesuit priest, scholar andpolymath, who devoted his considerable intellect and energies to anastonishingly wide range of interests, from the study of volcanoes and themathematics of music, to the investigations of microbes and the geography ofChina. Because of the breadth of Kircher’s research, he is rightly known as oneof the last of the Renaissance men. He was also one of the last great Hermeticscholars, developing and applying the macrocosmic/microcosmic system he hadlearned through Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, and the Corpus Hermeticumto a number of disciplines. Although by the time Kircher published his massivework on Egypt, Oedipus Aegyptiacus, in 1652–54, Isaac Casaubon had already datedthe writing of the Corpus Hermeticum to the early centuries AD— therebyundermining their authority — Kircher, who believed Hermes Trismegistus andMoses were identical, ignored this, and continued to work in a determinedHermetic tradition. In the history of science he is seen as one of the last,great dinosaurs, working away at his immense Hermetic tomes just at the timewhen Cartesian rationalism was firmly establishing itself. But for students ofless reductive systems of thought, his vision remains thrilling and ofteninspiring.Kircher himself is a good advertisement for the Hermetic dictum that, unlike anyother being, man has no fixed place in the cosmos, and can ascend to the heightsor plunge to the depths at his desire. His studies of music led him to believethat its harmony reflected the proportions of the universe, an ancient ideagoing back to Pythagoras, and which is the basis for the notion of the ‘music ofthe spheres’, the celestial tones made by the revolutions of the planets. Yetalthough Kircher’s head was in the stars, he was very ‘down to earth’,dangerously so, in fact. His passion for geology was so great that in 1638,during a visit to southern Italy, Kircher had himself lowered into the crater ofMount Vesuvius, then on the point of erupting, in order to observe its interior.His fascination with mechanical marvels also had an Hermetic touch; among hisinventions, which included a variation on the ‘magic lantern’, a magnetic clock,and a ‘perpetual motion machine’, were automatons, ‘talking statues’, an ideacentral to the Asclepius, which describes how the ancient Egyptians used magicto draw the gods down into their representations. Indeed, it was this accountthat led Augustine to condemn Hermes Trismegistus’ ‘magic’ as ‘demonic’. Yet thenotion of magically animating statues and images has a long history in the west;it was a speciality of Hero of Alexandria, and even Pope Sylvester II was saidto have consulted a mechanical talking head.Kircher knew Hebrew and Syriac, and was fascinated with languages; at one pointhe even tried to decipher the mysterious Voynich Manuscript.4[index_split_032.html#filepos204960] In 1636 he published Prodromus Coptus siveAegyptiacus, the first western Coptic grammar, which he followed in 1643 withhis Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta, which became the basis of all later Copticstudies. Kircher argued rightly that Coptic was intimately related to thelanguage of Pharaonic Egypt, yet when he came to the hieroglyphs, his approachwas purely symbolic. He became interested in their mystery in 1638, when he reada book on the Sistine Obelisk. Originally erected in Heliopolis by the PharaohMencares in 1857 BC, the obelisk was brought to Rome by the Emperor Caligula in37 AD, and later moved to the centre of St Peter’s Square by Pope Sixtus V in1586. Other books on Egypt, like Hörwart von Hohenburg’s Thesaurus, whichcontained pictures of hieroglyphics, and which Kircher found in a library inSpeyer, Germany, intrigued him. But the real trigger for turning Kircher intothe ‘founder of Egyptology’, was receiving a copy of the Bembine Tablet of Isis,from Nicholaus Claude Fabri de Peiresc, a wealthy patron from Avignon.Named after Cardinal Bembo, who acquired it after the sack of Rome by the HolyRoman Emperor Charles V in 1527, the Bembine Tablet is believed by officialaccounts to be of Roman origin, and today rests in the Museum of Antiquities inTurin. Made of bronze, silver, gold, copper, and enamel inlay, the tabletdepicts the Egyptian goddess Isis, surrounded by Egyptian stylized figures andsymbols — including the god Thoth — in different hieratic and ritual poses, andis considered an important example of ancient metallurgy. Although mostEgyptologists consider it an expression of decadent Roman taste for Egyptianmystery, with a possible use at a site of Isis worship, the consensus is thatthe ‘hieroglyphics’ it contains are meaningless, rather as if a student ofKabbala, with no knowledge of Hebrew, decorated a tablet in Hebrew letters,which, because of their strange shapes, to the unlearned seem ‘mysterious’."},{"pageContent":"THE LANGUAGE OF ADAM AND EVE Unfortunately, Kircher based his ‘translation’ of the hieroglyphics on those ofthe Bembine Tablet, and once Champollion had cracked the Rosetta Stone, hisinterpretations were seen to be nonsense, at least according to the officialview. An oft-quoted example of Kircher’s howlers are the hieroglyphics that read‘dd Wsr’, which means ‘Osiris says’. Kircher’s ‘symbolic’ interpretation gives:‘The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature isguarded by the vigilance of Anubis’. He also believed that ancient Egyptian wasthe language of Adam and Eve. Yet although it is easy to use Kircher asanti-esoteric Egypt whipping boy, it is also easy to lose sight of hisachievement, which was considerable, given that, as his biographer JoscelynGodwin points out, he ‘had no Rosetta Stone, no large body of hieroglyphicinscriptions to study, and of the sources available to him many were late,corrupt, or virtually meaningless’.5 [index_split_032.html#filepos205742]But Kircher’s symbolic approach can’t be explained purely by less than perfectmaterials. He had a whole tradition of seeing Egypt and especially thehieroglyphics in this symbolic way behind him. Horapollon, the fourth centuryGreek grammarian, believed that hieroglyphics were a kind of ‘picture writing’,and that any future interpreter should look for symbolic meaning in them. In OnThe Mysteries, the Neoplatonic philosopher Iamblichus stated that ‘The Egyptiancharacters were not fortuitously or foolishly made, but with great ingenuityafter the example of Nature’ and he argued that their authors ‘imitate thenature of the universe and the god’s work of creator, by producing symbolicimages to represent mysterious, occult and invisible meanings’.6[index_split_032.html#filepos205924] Kircher also had it on the authority ofseveral scholars before him that Hermes Trismegistus himself had created thehieroglyphics as a means of housing his knowledge of the cosmos and the divine.Kircher himself seems to have had a remarkable intuitive sympathy with thesestrange figures he found so compelling. In 1666, he was asked to translate thehieroglyphics on a broken obelisk found in Rome during building excavations. Hetranslated the three visible sides, but the fourth, on which the obelisk rested,was hidden by the ground. Kircher proceeded to copy out what he believed wouldbe found on the hidden side, and when the obelisk was raised, he was provedabsolutely correct. In the past he had even added new hieroglyphics to effacedportions of a fallen obelisk that Pope Innocent X had ordered to be re-erectedin the Palazzo Pamphili.7 [index_split_032.html#filepos206187] Had Kircher beenalive to witness Champollion’s discovery, one would imagine that he would agreewith Manly P. Hall’s caution that ‘a great part of Egyptian literature iscryptic; its true significance was probably unknown in the Ptolemaic period evento the Egytians themselves’. Therefore ‘we should […] not be too confident ofthe accuracy of our translations, realizing that beneath the surface we lightedwith the small ray of our knowledge, is a Stygian darkness deeper than Egypt’snight’.8 [index_split_032.html#filepos206369]This is not, of course, to reject Champollion’s and other acceptedEgyptologist’s interpretations and contributions, but to allow for thepossibility that Kircher may have been on to something more than a colossallinguistic blunder, just as many believe that alchemy was something more thanthe stumbling of amateurs that accidentally gave way to chemistry. If we canaccept that ‘the chief obstacle to our understanding the Egytian tradition’, is‘the current modern incapacity to think analogically’,9[index_split_032.html#filepos206625] as the esoteric scholar Arthur Versluisbelieves, then the hieroglyphics that fascinated Kircher and many others maystill hold secrets yet to be revealed.Kircher certainly believed they did. In Oedipus Aegyptiacus he wrote that ‘asymbol is a notation signifying some arcane mystery … it leads our soul by acertain similarity to the intelligence of something very different from thethings of sense-perception’.10 [index_split_032.html#filepos206803] The mysteryat the centre of Egypt, Kircher believed, was the prisca theologica that Ficinohad inherited from Gemistos Plethon, and which Kircher and others still believedwas embodied in the writings of the thrice-great one. Kircher was one of thelast to expound this notion, and the pages of Oedipus Aegyptiacus show it.Kircher believed that the world’s religions came out of Egypt, and theauthorities listed on the title page of his magnum opus make this clear.Egyptian wisdom, Phoenician theology, Chaldean astrology, Hebrew Kabbala,Persian magic, Pythagorean mathematics, Greek theosophy, Mythology, Arabianalchemy, Latin philology: as all these emerged out of Egypt’s fecund bosom,Kircher looked to all of them for clues to the secret of Egypt’s mystic script.This was, of course, putting the cart before the horse: if the great religionsof the world didn’t come out of Egypt, then looking to them for insight into thehieroglyphics was pointless. This possibility, however, was one Kircher didn’tconsider, and having determined that the hieroglyphics by definition containeddeep, philosophical wisdom — which is what the term ‘hieroglyph’, or ‘sacredcarving’ means — he looked to what he could gather about Egyptian philosophy tounderstand what they might be saying. In the process, as Joscelyn Godwin pointsout, he ‘restated the entire canon of ancient theology’, making OedipusAegyptiacus a kind of one-stop-shop of the perennial philosophy, spelling outthe teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, Zoroaster, Orpheus, Plato, Pythagoras, andmany more. In this sense, whatever we may think of his reading of thehieroglyphics, Kircher’s huge work remains a storehouse of primal wisdom, agreat well overflowing with the divine knowledge of which the thrice-great onewas the essential source."},{"pageContent":"THE SHAMANS OF EGYPT Although Kircher’s use of the Bembine Tablet puts him beyond the pale for mostmainstream Egyptologists, not everyone was convinced that the tablet was meredecoration, or worse, an outright forgery. For the nineteenth century Frenchoccultist Eliphas Levi, the Bembine Tablet was a key to the ancient Book ofThoth, the name Levi and others gave to the Tarot deck. Levi wasn’t alone inthis belief, and among those who agreed with him was W.W. Westcott, co-founderof the celebrated Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the most famous magicalsociety of modern times. Yet others had a perhaps even more profound idea of thetablet’s purpose. Thomas Taylor, the nineteenth century English Neoplatonist,who was the first to translate the complete works of Plato into English, andwhose translations of Proclus, Porphyry, and Iamblichus influenced people suchas William Blake and Ralph Waldo Emerson, thought the tablet took part in theancient Egyptian mysteries themselves. Taylor believed that the tablet, which hecalls the ‘Isiac Table’, formed the altar when, at the age of forty-nine, Platowas initiated into the Greater Mysteries, in an underground chamber below theGreat Pyramid of Giza. The ‘Divine Plato’, Taylor tells us, stood before thealtar, and the ceremony of the Mysteries ‘enkindled and brought from its dormantstate’ what ‘was always his’, presumably, his spiritual knowledge. ‘After threedays in the Great Hall, [Plato] was received by the Hierophant of the Pyramid …and given verbally the Highest Esoteric Teachings, each accompanied with itsappropriate symbol.’ According to Taylor, Plato remained another three monthswithin the pyramid, before he was sent out into the world, ‘to do the work ofthe Great Order, as Pythagoras and Orpheus had been before him’.11[index_split_032.html#filepos206986]Clearly, Taylor is one of those who believe Egypt was on the travel itinerariesfor Greek philosophers, yet not everyone agrees that this dramatic account ofPlato’s initiation is sheer fantasy. In Plato, Shamanism, and Ancient Egypt,Jeremy Naydler argues that there is good reason to believe that Plato and theothers actually made the trip to Egypt and received some form of initiationthere. In Plato’s case, according to Naydler, this led to his philosophy — towhich, as already mentioned, all subsequent western thought is merely afootnote, which suggests that a book on The Egyptian Roots of Western Philosophyremains to be written. Exactly what Plato and the others received may not beabsolutely clear, but Naydler believes that by trying to understand Plato’srelationship to Egypt, we can gain a firmer grasp, not only on Plato’s ideas,but also on ‘that deep current of thought and spiritual practice known as theHermetic tradition’.12 [index_split_032.html#filepos207179]Naydler argues persuasively — to my mind at least — that some form of shamanismwas involved in ancient Egyptian spiritual practice. Naydler points out that thecentral narrative in Egyptian mythology is the story of Osiris’ dismemberment atthe hands of his evil brother Set and his resurrection by his consort Isis, andargues that this is paralleled in the dismemberment motifs in shamanicinitiation rituals.13 [index_split_032.html#filepos207435] He also argues thatthe journey of the soul through the underworld — what the Egyptians called theDuat — as described in the Book of the Going Forth By Day, otherwise known asEgyptian Book of the Dead, can be found in shamanic ritual, as can be the ideaof a spiritual ascent, which is another Egyptian theme. In both shamanic andEgyptian religious accounts, this ascent to the sky takes place via wings or akind of ladder, and it should come as no surprise that a parallel idea appearsin the Hermetic notion of a journey through the planets to the ‘Eighth sphere’.That Plato described a version of this stellar ascent too, suggests for Naydlerthat his version and the Hermetic one stem from the same source.Predictably, Naydler’s ideas put him in the Kircher camp, as most mainstreamEgyptologists reject the notion of Egyptian shamanism. They reject it because,Naydler argues, they are fixated on the funerary interpretation of Egyptianreligious texts, such as the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Like the Tibetan Book ofthe Dead, the Egyptian Book of the Dead is a collection of hymns, spells,incantations, magical ‘power words’, and instructions used to guide the soul ofthe deceased in the after-world. Unlike the Tibetan Book of the Dead, however,the Egyptian Book of the Dead, which is much older, is an often wildlyheterogeneous assembly of writings, gathered over millennia, and is not really abook at all, at least not in the modern sense. Its earliest ‘chapters’, known asthe Pyramid Texts, were written on the walls of the tombs of the pharaohs circa2350–2175 BC, but originated in sources much earlier; the practice ofmummification and concern for the afterlife can be dated to at least 3100 BC,and according to the occult scholar Lewis Spence, an inscription on thesarcophagus of Queen Khnem-Nefert of the 11th Dynasty (circa 2500 BC) statesthat a chapter of the Book of the Dead was discovered in the reign of Hosep-ti,the fifth king of the 1st Dynasty, ‘who flourished about 4266 BC’.14[index_split_032.html#filepos207700]We may take Spence’s remark with a grain of salt, but the fact remains that thematerial making up the Book of the Dead is at least five thousand years old.Later parts of it, circa 1700 BC, came from what are known as the Coffin Texts,writings found on the sides of wooden coffins, or contained in scrolls placedwith the dead. Although originally reserved for the pharaohs, this sort of RoughGuide to the afterlife gradually became available to anyone who could afford ascribe to copy it out. Perhaps the most well known version is the Papyrus ofAni, a copy of the Book of the Dead made for the scribe Ani circa 1240 BC, whichcontains the famous illustration of the god Anubis weighing Ani’s heart on thescale of Ma’at, the goddess of justice. Late versions appeared with blank spacesfor the names of individuals not yet dead. Initially the privilege of an elite,the spiritual rebirth associated with the journey through the underworld becameover time something more democratic.Yet while the funerary aspect of the Book of the Dead was certainly made use of,Naydler argues that the text had another, more central use. It was, he believes,a manual on how to ‘practise dying’, a method of learning how to experience theseparation of the soul from the body, which normally happens only in physicaldeath, while still alive. Naydler argues that as this was also the aim ofPlato’s philosophy — the Phaedo famously argues that philosophy is a‘preparation for death’ — there is good reason to believe that rather thanmerely picking up an idea that was ‘in the air’, Plato learned it at first handfrom the priests at Heliopolis. The belief that one’s nous was immortal whileone’s body was subject to death and decay was, as we’ve seen, a central theme ofthe Hermetic books, and this suggests that, rather than repackaging Platonicideas — as some have argued the Corpus Hermeticum does — both it and Plato’sphilosophy originated from the same source."},{"pageContent":"BODY AND SOUL As anyone who has studied them knows, ancient Egyptian religious ideas arecomplex and often seemingly contradictory, with gods appearing in multiple formsand new gods often being worshipped alongside old. Creation myths, for example,vary and often seem the result of competing priesthoods vying for ascendancy.15[index_split_032.html#filepos207979] And it’s understandable that a reading ofthe Book of the Dead, with its many demons and monsters that the soul mustovercome, can give the impression that the Egyptians were a morbid,superstitious people. Yet what may seem contradictory on the surface can presenta different aspect when viewed as the Egyptians themselves may have viewed it,that is, symbolically. If, as R.T. Rundle Clark, an Egypt scholar with a broaderperspective, remarks, ‘it has come to be realized that Egyptian art is nearlyall symbolism’, one can expand this and say that for these ‘deeply God-consciouspeople’, their myths were symbolic too.16 [index_split_032.html#filepos208255]The Egyptians, Rundle Clark argues, ‘used their myths to convey their insightsinto the workings of nature and the ultimately indescribable realities of thesoul’, and were not, as some more mainstream Egyptologists suggest, asuperstitious people who believed in animal-headed deities, although, to besure, the common people may have had rather simple ideas about religion, just assome Christians might still believe that God is a white-bearded old gentleman ona throne. That is, the Egyptians used myths and symbols to express ideas. Andaccording to Rundle Clark, they seemed to concentrate on two central themes: toexplain the structure of the universe and how it came into being, and todescribe the origin and development of consciousness. It is this second themewhich will chiefly concern us.One of the most complex aspects of Egyptian religion is their notion of thesoul, or, put more precisely, the physical and non-physical components making upa human being. According to the Egyptians, human beings are made up of ninedifferent but related entities, each of which has its own form of afterlife. Thekhat is the physical body, which must be kept secure after death, hencemummification. The ka is a kind of ‘astral’ double, that inhabits the bodyduring life, but which is freed in death, and can enter other forms, likestatues or representations of the deceased. The ba is what we would consider thesoul, or inner identity or consciousness. The sekhem is a kind of life force,what in theosophical terms we can call the ‘etheric’ body, which animates thematter of the khat. The ab is one’s moral consciousness, the sahu the intellectand will, and the khabit is a kind of shadow, like the ka but different. Butperhaps the most important part of the soul is what the Egyptians called theakh. This is our divine essence, an incorruptible spiritual body which has thepotential to escape from the earthly realm entirely and dwell among the stars,and even to pass beyond them. While each of the other parts are subject tocertain limitation, the akh, which is also the means by which we acquired divineinsight and wisdom, is likened to the gods. So, in essence, in our akh, we tooare gods.The ba is usually depicted as a bird with a human head, hovering over the bodyof the deceased; to modern eyes these depictions resemble accounts of‘out-of-the-body-experiences’, which suggests that the body depicted may not bedead at all. The human headed bird symbolized the idea that for the Egyptiansthe soul resided in the head — an idea, Naydler points out, that they sharedwith the Greeks — and that it could rise above the body, that is, could beseparated from it. Naydler remarks that this notion of the ba was not, as mostEgyptologists believe, a common belief, but was reserved for the priests; thatis, it formed part of the esoteric, rather than exoteric, religious teachings.The ba can separate from the body during sleep or at death, but it could also beseparated during a third state, of trance, or deep relaxation. For the ba torise above the body, Naydler argues, ‘the central requirement was that thepsycho-physical organism be stilled’. ‘The ba only comes into its own,’ hewrites, ‘when the body is inactive and inert.’17[index_split_032.html#filepos208431] This is strikingly similar to the stateHermes Trismegistus was in when he received gnosis from Poimandres.Naydler points out that for the ancient Egyptians, as for the Greeks,consciousness wasn’t, as it is for us, located solely in the brain. For both theEgyptians and the Greeks, consciousness was located in different forms indifferent parts of the body. Naydler refers to Homer’s account in the Iliad andthe Odyssey, where he speaks of waking consciousness being located in the chest,and of other forms of consciousness being dispersed throughout the rest of thebody, in the limbs, heart, hands, etc.18 [index_split_032.html#filepos208614]This suggests that for the Homeric Greeks, the body wasn’t perceived as a unity,but as an association of different parts, each with their own consciousness.Naydler points out that these Greeks had no singular word for the living body,but usually referred to it in the plural, and that soma, which means ‘body’ inour sense, was used to refer to a corpse. While the Egyptians shared this notionof a multiple bodily consciousness with the Greeks of Homer’s epics, they had avery different idea of the soul, or psyche, than the Greeks. For the earlyGreeks, the psyche was rather more like our modern idea of a ghost, a kind ofinsubstantial wraith or eidola, a faint image of the deceased that is releasedon death, and that has a reduced form of existence in the underworld, as Ulyssesdiscovered during his sojourn there. The dead Ulysses meets are like vapoursrising from a swamp, and long to return to life. When we speak of someone being‘a shadow of their former self’, we are speaking of them as early Greeks did thesoul. For these Greeks, physical reality was paramount, and any kind ofafterlife was an unsatisfying shadowy affair.For the Egyptians the ba had a more ‘concrete’ existence, to speakmetaphorically about something purely spiritual. While the body was active, itsnoise and demands obscured the ba. But when the body was silent, the ba could beknown. In order to experience the ba consciously — that is, while awake andalive — it was necessary to withdraw consciousness from the limbs and innerorgans, and to concentrate it, to gather it into a unity in the head, whichseems rather like the ‘godlike concentration of consciousness’ that Hermes tellsAsclepius and the others must be attained before they can receive the ‘knowledgeof God’. When the soul forces were thus concentrated and the body quiet, the bacould awaken, and the ‘I’ could feel itself to be an independent entity, notdependent on or restricted to the body’s limitations. As the ba is our innerself, our sense of identity, what this means is that we, who usually associateour self with our body, become directly aware of our independence of it. Weinhabit a body, but during these states of profound physical relaxation andinner concentration, we realize that ‘we’ are not ‘it’."},{"pageContent":"PRACTISE DYING One result of experiencing the ba’s independence is the recognition thatconsciousness can exist outside of a physical body and brain, which suggeststhat it is not necessarily subject to the body’s decay.19[index_split_032.html#filepos210227] Or, to put it another way, that a part ofus isn’t subject to death. Yet, paradoxically, to arrive at this insight, onemust ‘practise dying’. Naydler suggests that this was the secret of the EgyptianMysteries, or one of them at least, and given that, as is the case with theEleusinian and Orphic Mysteries of Greece, we have very little information aboutexactly what went on in these, he may very well be right. The Greek historianHerodotus, who tells us he witnessed the Egyptian mysteries at Sais, isinfuriatingly coy, and after keenly piquing our interest about them, decides tokeep mum. Naydler argues that after his initiation, Plato developed these ideasinto his own philosophy, and that dialogues like the Cratylus, the Phaedo, thePhaedrus, and the Republic all contain important elements of the Egyptianmysteries, elements that can also be found in the Corpus Hermeticum. One isthat, with the recognition that the ba or soul can exist independently of thebody, and that the way of realizing this is to ‘practise dying’, paradoxically,the body itself is seen to be a kind of tomb. As Plato says in the Cratylus, thebody (soma) ‘is the tomb (sema) of the soul, which may be thought to be buriedin our present life’. That Plato refers to the Pythagoreans as the source ofthis knowledge is for Naydler strong evidence that its origin is Egyptian;Pythagoras, too, tradition has it, went to school in Egypt. That the authors ofthe Corpus Hermeticum may have had the same teacher — or at least the samelesson — is suggested by Book VII, where it is said that in order not to becarried away by the great flood of ignorance, the seeker of gnosis must ‘stripoff the garment’ he is wearing, the body, which is referred to as the ‘sentientcorpse’ and ‘portable tomb’.20 [index_split_032.html#filepos210834] It is inthis sense that Socrates, in the Phaedo, declares that ‘true philosopherspractise dying’, and it is in this sense that the Egyptian Book of the Dead,Naydler argues, is concerned with dying, and not solely in the literal way thatproponents of its funerary use argue.Another Egyptian idea that Naydler finds in Plato, and which can also be foundin the Hermetic books, is the notion of the akh. The akh, as mentioned, is thatpart of our inner being that can be considered divine. It has the potential toescape entirely from earthly and even cosmic limitations, and it is through theakh that we can receive divine wisdom and insight. Once the ba is seen to beindependent of the body, then it is possible to come to know the akh, which wasseen by the Egyptians as luminous and associated with the sun, and which, afterdeath or through the ritual of the mysteries, found its place among the stars.Naydler argues that the akh found its equivalent in Plato’s philosophy in theform of the daimon, or, as Plato sometimes refers to it, nous. And as for theEgyptians, one who has realized his akh, or, more accurately, become akh, isfilled with divine wisdom and can find his place as a star in the cosmos, forPlato, the philosopher who comes to know the Form of the Good — the highestknowledge possible — also rises to the stars. From this vantage point, Platowrites in the Phaedrus, he ‘stands on the back of the universe’ and can perceivethrough nous — not his senses — the unmanifest Reality ‘behind’ or ‘before’ thecosmos. Naydler suggests that an illustration from the tomb of Ramses III of thepharaoh looking out beyond the stars while standing on two entwined serpentsthat encircle the cosmos, is a depiction of Plato’s account of ‘standing on theback of the universe’. The similarity between these two ideas and that of theHermetic ascent to the Eighth and Ninth spheres should be apparent, and in theAsclepius, Hermes Trismegistus tells his students that ‘there is a place beyondheaven where there are no stars’.21 [index_split_032.html#filepos211018]"},{"pageContent":"THE DUAT Another aspect of Egyptian religion that seems to have found its way intoPlato’s philosophy, and also into the Hermetic books, is the Duat, the name theEgyptians gave to the spirit world. Although it is usually presented as an‘underworld’ one arrives at in the ‘afterlife’, the Duat is really just as muchan ‘overworld’ and a ‘beforelife’. Unlike the hell of Christianity, the Duat isnot really a place of punishment or torture, nor is it like the shadowy realm ofthe dead of the Homeric Greeks, although, to be sure, it is a dangerous placeand one is judged there. Yet although it is the ‘destination of all that is oldand worn out’, it is also the ‘origin of all that is fresh and new’.22[index_split_032.html#filepos211202] It contains all the forms which belong tothe past or the future, and in this sense, Naydler argues, it is more likePlato’s world of archetypal Forms; thus, by studying philosophy — which forPlato and his followers was not, as it is today, a circumscribed academicexercise, but more like a transformational path — one could enter the spiritworld while still living. But the Duat is also similar to Jung’s collectiveunconscious, the Akashic Record of Madame Blavatsky and Rudolf Steiner, theAstral Light of the occult philosopher Eliphas Levi, or the Pleroma of theGnostics. I would also add that it is equivalent to the non-temporal realmaccessed through the Hermetic gnosis, the source of the infinite significanceP.D. Ouspensky saw in an ashtray during his experience of cosmic consciousness,and on a more immediate, physical level, the brain’s ‘total recall’ that theneuroscientist Wilder Penfield discovered while operating on a patient and thenovelist Marcel Proust triggered while tasting a biscuit dipped in tea.Knowledge of and passage through the Duat was a central theme in Egyptianreligion, and if proponents of the Egyptian Mysteries are correct, there weretwo ways to experience these. One of these, physical death, was unavoidable. Theproblem with this was that entering the Duat unprepared could have undesirableconsequences; at any rate, you were taking your chances. This highlighted theattractiveness of the second way: through the mysteries. By undergoing theinitiation into the Duat, by ‘dying’ while still alive, one had the chance tobecome akh, to identify with the divine, to gain gnosis and lose the fear ofphysical death. This was the non-funerary purpose of the Book of the Dead. Andwhile it is true that the Book of the Dead is an often dizzying collection of attimes contradictory texts — unavoidable, perhaps, given its age and the Egyptianhabit of hanging on to everything old — two central Duat narratives emergethrough the welter of material.One we have already touched on, the story of Osiris, his death and dismembermentat the hand of his brother Set, and his resurrection as lord of the underworldthrough his sister and consort Isis. Osiris’ followers believed that after deaththey would join him in Sekhet Hetepet, the ‘Happy Fields’, where they wouldenjoy an eternal life, much like the one they had known, only better. To reachSekhet Hetepet, however, one’s heart or ab was placed on the balance of Ma’at,the goddess of order, and weighed against a feather. If found heavy with sin,one’s soul was devoured by Amenet, a crocodile-headed creature, but if foundequal to the ‘feather of Ma’at’, one was taken by Horus, the son of Osiris, tothe happy lands.Another Duat narrative involved the sun god Ra. Ra was believed to sail in hisbarque across the sky from east to west during the day, but at sunset he sankbelow the horizon, in the Western Lands, and entered the Duat. There,accompanied by his divine retinue, he continued his voyage, but this timethrough the dark and dangerous waters of the Duat, where, among other perils, heencountered the demon Apophis (Apep), a serpent or dragon-like entity that wasbelieved to be the source of chaos and evil. Ra’s voyage was segmented intotwelve hours, each with its own challenge and trial, and at the end of it heemerged once again in the east, renewing the day, and bringing life and lightagain to the land.Over time, Apophis became associated with Osiris’ enemy Set, who was laterassociated with the Greek monster Typhon, who in some accounts is defeated byHermes Trismegistus. Typhon, too, is like Apophis another reptilian enemy, and Iremind the reader of my comments on the reptilian brain in Chapter 1 above; hereseems another suggestion that consciousness or gnosis is in a perpetual struggleagainst atavistic chaos, or the cerebral cortex in battle with the old brain. AsRa is the sun god, the source of light and life, and as Apophis is the primevalchaos, Ra’s defeat of Apophis re-enacts the original creation myth, in which‘the positive region of light and form was generated amid the indefinite waterynothingness of the timeless night’.23 [index_split_032.html#filepos211386] Inthis sense, the original creation myths, and Ra’s defeat of Apophis, can be seenas an account of the rise of self-consciousness out of the darkness of theunconscious, and their similarity to the account of creation in the Poimandresseems clear. In some way, the Egyptian Mysteries seemed to have embodiedelements of both the Osiris and Ra narratives into rituals and practices thattook the initiate into the Duat, in order to confront the trials necessary toawaken his or her akh, and so experience his identity with the divine andeternal, while still physically alive. By doing this, the initiate understoodhis real nature and no longer feared the ravages of physical death. These trialsencountered in the Egyptian Mysteries found a more modern vehicle when theybecame part of the initiatory rituals of Freemasonry."},{"pageContent":"THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE HEART One modern scholar of ancient Egypt who believed that its hieroglyphics, andindeed, all of its culture, should be understood symbolically, and that itsrituals and mysteries were aimed at a transformation of consciousness, was thealchemist and esoteric philosopher R.A Schwaller de Lubicz. I have written aboutSchwaller de Lubicz’s life and work in my book A Secret History ofConsciousness; here I want to focus on his ideas about the kind of consciousnesshe believed the ancient Egyptians possessed, a consciousness that seemsremarkably similar to that portrayed in the Corpus Hermeticum.As mentioned earlier the Egyptians believed that consciousness wasn’t locatedsolely in the head. Along with the ‘head’ consciousness that we are familiarwith — the reason and logic we associate with the cerebral cortex, or ‘newbrain’ — Schwaller de Lubicz argued that the Egyptians recognized another kindof consciousness, what they called ‘the intelligence of the heart’. In a seriesof demanding but illuminating books, Schwaller de Lubicz explored the meaning ofthis ‘intelligence of the heart’, and came to conclusions that seem to echo manyof the insights of the Hermetic books, suggesting that the insights of HermesTrismegistus may have been born of a similar consciousness.To understand Schwaller de Lubicz’s ideas, it may help to backtrack a bit andconsider again the work of the philosopher Bergson, discussed in the previouschapter. Bergson, we remember, suggested that the brain and nervous system servean eliminative function; that is, they are designed to keep information out ofconsciousness, and to allow only as much of it to reach awareness as isnecessary to help us survive. This ‘reduced’ consciousness provides a highlyedited version of reality, and presents us with the solid, stable,three-dimensional world we are familiar with. Yet while this edited realityenables us to get on in life admirably, the picture of the world it supplies uswith is incomplete. Basically, what it shows us is the surface of things. It isunable to give us a glimpse of their inside. In order to get some idea of thiswe need to take a psychedelic drug, as Aldous Huxley did, or hope for aspontaneous ‘mystical experience’, as Ouspensky had on the sea of Marmora. Yet,poets and artists do seem to be able to see below the surface of things and toreach their essence. To risk a generalization, we can say that poetry is thelanguage of the interior, while prose is that of the exterior. Poets and artistsare able to do this, Bergson tells us, because they possess a mode of cognitionthat can pierce the ‘dead’ surface of things provided by ‘survival’consciousness, and enter into their ‘living’ interiors. We all possess it infact, but in poets and artists, and others of a similar sensibility, itfunctions to a high degree.Bergson calls this mode of cognition intuition. In his early career, Schwallerde Lubicz was a student of the painter Henri Matisse, who was himself a studentof Bergson, and as I’ve suggested elsewhere, Schwaller de Lubicz’s intelligenceof the heart seems to me a version of Bergson’s intuition.24[index_split_032.html#filepos211576] This is not to reduce Schwaller de Lubicz’sidea to a variation of Bergson’s, but to show that the kind of questions posedby esoteric thought can also be found in mainstream philosophy, and are not asmarginal as its critics believe.Schwaller de Lubicz’s intelligence of the heart is essentially a participatorymode of consciousness.25 [index_split_032.html#filepos212105] In ‘survivalconsciousness’ the distinction between ourselves and the world ‘outside’ isrigorously maintained. In order to deal with the world, we need to be able tohold it at arms length, and have a clear sense of what is ‘I’ and what is‘not-I’. Yet, as Ouspensky experienced on the sea of Marmora and Huxley didafter taking mescaline, there are moments when this distinction dissipates, theinvisible wall separating ourselves from the world vanishes, and ‘I’ and ‘not-I’seem to meld. In these moments, which happen more often than we suspect, but notalways in such dramatic form as Huxley or Ouspensky experienced, we, ourconsciousness, participates in the world. ‘I’ and ‘not-I’ seem to be one. Thisis the ‘intelligence of the heart’, and Schwaller de Lubicz believed it was thekey to understanding the secret of ancient Egypt. As he wrote in Esotericism andSymbol ‘Reason’, not rationalism, but the kind of reason associated with nous,‘is the intelligence of the heart which allows us, in love, to be the thing, tobe inside the thing, to grow with the plant, to fly with the bird, to glide withthe serpent, to be that ‘way of a man with a maid’ which the Proverbs say cannotbe known; to become cubic space with the cube. It is to this Reason thatesotericism addresses itself’.26 [index_split_032.html#filepos212386]Schwaller de Lubicz made the same point in his deeply Hermetic work Nature Wordwhen he wrote that by knowing through the ‘intelligence of the heart’ we can:> > Tumble with the rock which falls from the mountain.> > Seek light and rejoice with the rosebud about to open:> > labour with the parsimonious ant;> > gather honey with the bee;> > expand in space with the ripening fruit.27> > [index_split_032.html#filepos212648] Compare this to Tat’s remarks to Hermes Trismegistus in Book XIII, where he saysthat:> > O father, I have been made steadfast through God; I now see not with the> > eyes, but by the operation of spiritual energy in the powers. I am in> > heaven, in earth, in water, in the air; I am in living creatures and plants;> > I am in the womb, before the womb, after the womb. I am present> > everywhere.28 [index_split_032.html#filepos212908] It is interesting to note that in his commentary on Book XIII, G.R.S. Meadrefers to this section as ‘The Dawn of Cosmic Consciousness’, and remarks that‘this consciousness, whatever else it may be, is a transcending of ourthree-dimensional limitation of consciousness’.29[index_split_032.html#filepos213092] Mead’s Thrice Greatest Hermes was publishedin 1906, and although there is no mention of R.M. Bucke in the index, Mead wouldcertainly have been aware of his book, Cosmic Consciousness, published in 1901.This kind of participatory consciousness, Schwaller de Lubicz believed, was atwork in the hieroglyphics, and his ideas about them put him, along with JeremyNaydler, in the Kircher school of Egyptology. Modern readings of thehieroglyphics and other Egyptian works, like the Book of the Dead, Schwaller deLubicz argued, are fixated on a literal interpretation, and are as limited as aconsciousness unable to understand metaphor would be when confronted withpoetry: for it, a rose is a rose, and nothing else. Modern consciousness,Schwaller de Lubicz believed, suffered from what he called ‘cerebralconsciousness’, which functions by ‘granulating’ reality, turning it intodiscreet bits and pieces, severing the connections that run through it like thefibres of a spider’s web. ‘All in the universe,’ Schwaller de Lubicz wrote, ‘isin interdependent connection with all’, an Hermetic remark if there ever wasone.30 [index_split_032.html#filepos213357]Like Bergson’s ‘survival’ consciousness, ‘cerebral consciousness’ has itsfunction and is absolutely indispensable (otherwise we would not have evolvedit), but when it dominates, as it does in some reductionist, scientistic worldviews, it leads to disastrous results. Because our science ‘wants to penetratethe mysteries of life through its ordinary means of comprehension’, it arrivesat remarks like that of the astrophysicist Steven Weinberg, who famous announcedthat ‘the more the universe seems comprehensible the more it also seemspointless’.31 [index_split_032.html#filepos213553] This is precisely theopposite of what Hermetic science discovers as it seeks to understand thecosmos. For it, with each new gnosis, the universe, and everything in it — evenan ashtray — becomes the locus of an almost overwhelming meaning. For a StevenWeinberg a grain of sand is just a grain of sand, and galaxies and planets are,essentially, merely large accumulations of them. But for a William Blake —schooled in Hermetic science by Thomas Taylor, and equipped with his own naturalpredilection for it — a grain of sand is a world, and heaven can be found in awild flower. But this meaning can only be recognized in that other mode ofcognition, what Schwaller de Lubicz calls the ‘intelligence of the heart’ andwhich is also, he tells us, the ‘intelligence of the universe’, which ‘will tellus everything’.32 [index_split_032.html#filepos213803]"},{"pageContent":"SIMULTANEITY OF OPPOSITE STATES This unity, in which we are told ‘everything’, is reminiscent of the knowledgeR.M. Bucke, William James, and P.D. Ouspensky received in their moments of‘cosmic consciousness’. Like cosmic consciousness, it’s beyond our usualcomprehension. In this unity, ‘our cerebral intelligence can no longer discernanything, and so has no further role to play’, something, we’ve seen, thatBucke, James, Ouspensky, and even Hermes Trismegistus himself quicklydiscovered.33 In order to grasp something of the reality of this unity we need,as Schwaller de Lubicz argues, that other mode of cognition, a mode, hebelieves, the ancient Egyptians were familiar with, so familiar, indeed, thatthey based their entire religion upon it.Why were the Egyptians more familiar with this mode? The reason, I believe, isthat consciousness in general was different then, and less dominated by‘cerebral consciousness’ than our consciousness is today. For brevity’s sake, wecan say that the consciousness of ancient Egypt was more ‘right brained’, gearedtoward pattern and meaning, than our modern, ego-based, analytical left brainconsciousness is. This indeed was something that Schwaller de Lubicz himselfrecognized. The ‘two qualitatively different minds inhabiting the human psyche’that Schwaller de Lubicz explored, can be relegated to the two cerebralhemispheres, and, as Robert Lawlor, Schwaller de Lubicz’s translator, remarks‘localization in the right hemisphere of the highly intuitive aspects of thoughttogether with the capacity for non-verbal pattern recognition, is consistentwith the dominant quality of mind which, in Schwaller de Lubicz’s view, couldhave produced the temple architecture and hieroglyphic writings of the ancientEgyptians’.34Allowing this speculation permits some interesting suggestions. If ‘the beliefin a solid world, understood as hard, dense, physical substance’ is ‘what reallydefines the western mentality’, as Naydler argues, then it is possible that forancient Egypt ‘the world was still permeable’ and that in it a ‘spiritual lightshone, illuminating it with a divine radiance’.35 If we think of that ‘spirituallight’ and ‘radiance’ as meaning, then this begins to make sense. Somethingalong the lines of a ‘right brain consciousness’ would need to be at work, Ithink, in order for us to recognize that, along with their literal, ‘cerebral’meaning, the hieroglyphics can also be understood symbolically.This was certainly what Schwaller de Lubicz believed when he developed hisnotion of symbolique. Along with Bergson, in his early years, Schwaller deLubicz was influenced by the rise of the ‘new physics’, especially by NielsBohr’s ideas about light, and Werner Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle. As mostreaders probably know, Bohr ended the debate over the nature of light, which hadbeen raging since Christian Huygens and Isaac Newton, about whether it was bestdescribed as a wave or as a particle, by developing his notion of‘complementarity’, which states that it is both. In some contexts, light behavesas a wave, in others, as a particle, hence the portmanteau term ‘wavicle’.Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle declares that we can’t know both the positionand the speed of an elementary particle, but only one or the other: by observingone, we obscure the other, hence the ‘uncertainty’. In both cases what Schwallerde Lubicz took from this was the idea that reality could exist in two seeminglymutually exclusive states, a notion that our mundane, ‘cerebral consciousness’finds disorienting, but which can be accommodated by the ‘intelligence of theheart’.This ‘simultaneity of opposite states’, as Schwaller de Lubicz called it, playsa great part in his understanding of the hieroglyphics. It is the essence ofwhat he calls symbolique, which is a way of holding together the object of senseperception (given by cerebral consciousness) and the content of inner knowing(Bergson’s intuition and the intelligence of the heart) in a creative polarity.Seeing the hieroglyphic of a bird, Schwaller de Lubicz argued, the Egyptiansknew it was a sign for the actual, individual creature, but they also knew itwas a symbol of what he called its ‘cosmic function’, flight, as well as all theother characteristics associated with it. To put this in a neat formula, forSchwaller de Lubicz, hieroglyphics not only designated, they evoked, which isreminiscent of Athanasius Kircher’s remark that I quoted earlier: ‘a symbol is anotation signifying some arcane mystery … it leads our soul by a certainsimilarity to the intelligence of something very different from the things ofsense-perception’.This, I would say, is the essence of the Hermetic notion of correspondence, theidea that realities of the ‘higher world’ — as above — correspond with those ofthe ‘lower’ one — so below. It is also, on another level, the essence ofmetaphor, the trick of speech in which one thing stands for another, something Ihave written about elsewhere.36 The notion of correspondences is so crucial toHermetic and esoteric thought, that it is difficult to contemplate anHermeticism or esotericism without it. It takes pride of place in the esotericscholar Antoine Faivre’s ‘fundamental elements’ of esotericism. For Faivre,these ‘correspondences … are intended to be read and deciphered’. ‘The entireuniverse,’ he tells us, ‘is a huge theatre of mirrors, an ensemble ofhieroglyphics to be decoded. Everything is a sign, everything conceals andexudes mystery; every object hides a secret.’ And, in what seems a nod toSchwaller de Lubicz, he continues: ‘The principles of noncontradiction and theexcluded middle of linear causality [i.e. cerebral consciousness] are replacedby those of the included middle and synchronicity.’37The idea that the entire universe is an ‘ensemble of hieroglyphics’ waiting tobe decoded, or, as many have said before, a vast book waiting to be read,suggests that the method of symbolique, the simultaneous consciousness ofopposite states, is not limited to an understanding of the hieroglyphics. Asmany poets and thinkers have done, without calling it such, it can be applied toeverything. As we’ve seen, Ouspensky saw what wonders were hidden in a simpleashtray. The world, then, becomes a kind of language, or better, a poem; in anycase, something that presents us with the challenge of discovering what itmeans. And just as a book or a poem does not give up its meaning unless I devotethe requisite attention to it, so too the book of nature, the cosmos, the whole,will not communicate much to me unless I focus my attention on it, concentratemy mind, as Hermes advises, and try to grasp what its author — whoever that maybe — is trying to say. As Christopher Bamford writes in his important Forewordto Nature Word, ‘The world only lives because it speaks to us in a language wecan understand’, and its ‘meaning becomes alive for us to the extent that we canassimilate it’.38 And as Bamford and so many others have pointed out, we graspthat meaning through the senses, but with the mind, just as we see through awindow but with our eyes. As Book X of the Corpus Hermeticum makes clear:‘knowledge is incorporeal; the organ which it uses is the mind itself’. Themeaning of a book, then, is not the book, it seems, but the strange alchemy ittriggers in your mind. We have, perhaps, come a long way from Plato and other western sages receivinginitiation in subterranean chambers below the pyramids. What I’ve tried to do inthis chapter is give some idea of what the Egyptian wisdom, thought to be at theroot of the Hermetic tradition, may have been about. These speculations are, ofcourse, not exhaustive, but I believe they are suggestive. In the next chapterwe will stay in Egypt, although we will move on a millennia or two, to see if wecan get an idea of what the world that Hermes Trismegistus and his followersknew was like.NOTES 1 [index_split_023.html#filepos140884].

Naydler 2005 p. 22.18 [index_split_028.html#filepos171218]. Naydler remarks that Homer speaks ofthumos, located in the chest, as the centre of man’s emotional life, and saysthat Homer’s characters ‘conduct an inner dialogue with their thumos, and cometo decisions about what to do, and how best to act’. (p.16), A similar idea waspresented in Julian Jaynes The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of theBicameral Mind (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1977). Briefly, Jaynes argues thatHomeric man lacked the kind of interior space we possess and did not, as we do,‘ask ourselves’ what we intend to do about something and come to decisions aboutit. Rather, Homeric man possessed two consciousnesses, housed in different sidesof the brain (hence, ‘bicameral,’ which means ‘two chambered’). He felt the leftside of the brain as ‘I’ — as we do — and the consciousness on the right sidecame to him as ‘voices’. When Homeric man heard ‘messages’ from the gods, Jaynesargues, he was really receiving instructions from the right side of the brain.Jaynes argues that a series of catastrophes and upheavals forced Homeric man tofuse the two consciousnesses together, to arrive at the kind ofego-consciousness familiar to ourselves. The right brain, however, continues toposses a consciousness of its own, as experiments with split-brain subjects haveshown, although for the most part it remains ‘unconscious’ for its left braincounterpart.19 [index_split_029.html#filepos174082]. This, of course, flies in the face ofall modern ideas about consciousness and its relation to the brain, which can besummed up in the philosopher John Searle’s remark that ‘the brain causesconsciousness’. Yet how much brain is actually necessary for not onlyconsciousness, but a high level of intelligence, is debatable.

WHEN THOTH MET HERMES In 332 BC, Alexander the Great, king of Macedon, student of Aristotle, andup-and-coming ruler of one of largest empires in the ancient world, began hisconquest of the Phoenician city of Tyre, which was then under Persian rule.Seven months later, after a long and brutal siege, Tyre capitulated. Alexanderhad all the men of military age of the defeated city slaughtered, and he soldtheir women and children into slavery. Not long after this he repeated thisvictory in Gaza, again slaughtering the men and sending the women and childrento the slave market. Whatever philosophy Alexander may have learned fromAristotle, it took second place to the practical wisdom of creating an empire.Alexander is hailed today because the empire he created, which at one pointstretched to India, brought Greek culture to the rest of the known world. Afterhis father Philip’s assassination Alexander consolidated the power he inheritedby murdering potential rivals, and after gaining control of the Balkans, Syria,Persia, and much else, not knowing what to do with himself, he famously criedfor new worlds to conquer. He died in 323 BC at the age of 32, ostensibly from afever, although he may have been poisoned. Either way, there seemed littlereason for him to go on living, and what he may have learned from Aristotleseemed not enough to compensate the loss of further conquest. Had more ofAristotle’s learning rubbed off on his most famous pupil, he may have found moreinterior territory to lay claim to.Alexander’s reputation and invincibility preceded him in many places, and somecities he conquered without lifting a sword. In Jerusalem, for example, hearingof the fates of Tyre and Gaza, the leaders of the city welcomed him with openarms, seeing in him the fulfilment of a Biblical prophecy that a great Greekking would defeat the Persian tyrants. Alexander agreed with them and the citywas spared. And in Egypt, in 331, the response was the same. The people theresaw him as a liberator, as Egypt had been under Persian rule since the defeat ofKing Nectanebo II, the last native Egyptian ruler, by Artaxerxes III in 343 BC.Hailed as the ‘master of the universe’, and proclaimed the son of Ammon (Greekfor Amun, greatest of the Egyptian creator deities) at the god’s oracle in Siwa,Alexander must have felt gratified at his welcome, and at the divine lineage hisnew subjects recognized in him. Subsequently he referred to Zeus-Ammon as histrue father, conveniently forgetting Philip. But Alexander himself, howevergreat he may have been, has really only a walk-on part in the story of one evengreater, two times greater in fact. Because it was not Alexander, but the cityhe founded and named after himself, that provided the milieu for HermesTrismegistus to arrive, even if, as legend has it, Alexander was said to havediscovered the Emerald Tablet in the thrice-great one’s tomb in Hebron.Alexander founded Alexandria in 331, and after a few months stay, left, never toreturn — alive, that is. After Alexander’s death in the palace of NebuchadnezzarII in Babylon, Ptolemy Soter I, one of Alexander’s generals and founder ofEgypt’s Ptolemaic Dynasty, took his body to Memphis, where it was entombed amongthe pharaohs, and some years later, during the reign of Ptolemy’s successor,Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the golden sarcophagus containing the great king wasbrought back to his eponymous city. The Ptolemaic dynasty would rule Egypt fornearly three centuries, finally coming to an end in 30 BC, when Cleopatra VII,the last of the Ptolemies, committed suicide with her lover Mark Antony, whenCaesar Augustus had defeated their army and captured them. After this, Egyptwould be under Roman rule, and then Byzantine, until its conquest by MuslimArabs in 639 AD. It was during this Roman Egypt that the writings making up theCorpus Hermeticum and the people who followed their teachings, seem to havefirst appeared."},{"pageContent":"CITY OF SECTS AND GOSPELS The Hellenistic Age, the name given to the time following the death of Alexanderto the death of Cleopatra VII, is considered the period when Greek dominance inthe world reached its peak. With Alexander’s conquests reaching into the Nearand Middle East and North Africa, the time was characterized as a period offusion between Greek culture and that of these exotic, formerly ‘barbaric’lands. One place above all symbolized the cultural, religious, and intellectualsyncretism that characterized the Hellenistic Age, and that was Alexandria. Evenafter the Roman conquest of Egypt, Greek learning, thought, and language was thedominant cultural force, and the Roman Egypt that saw the emergence ofHermeticism was in many ways Greek.Today ancient Alexandria is known for its fabled lost lighthouse, on the islandof Pharos, off the city’s coast, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World,and for its library, which is believed to have been the largest in ancienttimes. Both the lighthouse and the library — twin sources of illumination — roseto prominence under the Ptolemies, and both were lost to the ravages of time.The lighthouse succumbed to earthquakes, the last, in 1323, reducing it torubble. The library, which suffered fire on several occasions, has remained asymbol of learning and the mandarin seclusion of scholars. Accounts of thenumber of books — scrolls, actually — housed within it differ, as do theaccounts of its destruction. Estimates of the number of works collected withinthe library of Alexandria range from 500,000, to more than a million, but as nolist or catalogue of the library’s contents has ever come to light, thesefigures must remain possibilities. The number of scrolls, however, must havebeen great, as the library was founded by Ptolemy I Soter, and continued toexist in some form until the sack of Alexandria by the Arab leader Amr ibnal’Aas in 639 AD. Asked what should be done with the library, Amr ibn al’Aas isreported to have said that the books ‘either contradict the Koran, in which casethey are heresy, or they agree with it, in which case they are superfluous’, andordered they be burned to heat the baths for his soldiers. Debate remains overthe truth of this, as it does over much that is said about the library, but bythis time it had been accidentally burned by Julius Caesar, when heinadvertently set fire to it while trying to prevent Ptolemy III from reachinghis ships (48 BC ); suffered pillage by the Emperor Aurelian (273 AD ); and wasdestroyed by the Christian Patriarch Theophilus in 391, when the ChristianEmperor Theodosius ordered the destruction of all pagan temples. On thisoccasion, the Serapeum, dedicated to the worship of the syncretic god Serapis,was also destroyed, as were temples to Mithras and other heathen deities.Alexandria had been a remarkably tolerant city under Greek and pagan Roman rule,but by the time the Christians had control, this liberal attitude had vanished,and Theodosius is credited with inaugurating the practice of burning books onpurpose (unlike Julius Caesar, who only did it by accident.) Not long afterTheophilus started scouring Alexandria clean of heathens, the pagan philosopherHypatia, one of the most brilliant women of the ancient world, was attacked by amob of Christian fanatics, who skinned her alive with oyster shells and burnedher remains. They were encouraged in this by Cyril, the Christian patriarch whofollowed Theophilus, and who was later canonized. Although the Platonic Academywould carry on for another century or so, to all intents and purposes, the paganworld ended with Hypatia’s death.As the library housed most of the world’s great knowledge it understandablyattracted the world’s thinkers and scholars. We can only surmise what otherwritings could be found in this lost treasure — many, no doubt, that we havenever heard of — but known to have been contained in its shelves were the worksof Euclid, Archimedes, and the astronomer Ptolemy, whose view of the cosmoswould remain dominant until Copernicus pointed out its discrepancies in 1543.Among others whose work could be found in the library were Eratosthenes, whoknew the circumference of the Earth, and Aristarchus, who argued that theplanets orbit the sun, centuries before Copernicus did. The forty-two books thatClement of Alexandria attributed to Hermes Trismegistus were, he believed,available at the library. These, alas, he also believed had been destroyed byJulius Caesar’s clumsiness, although the esoteric scholar Manly P. Hallmaintains that some books escaped the fire and were secretly buried in thedesert, a suggestion bolstered in 1945 by the discovery of some Hermetic textsamong the Gnostic scrolls unearthed at Nag Hammadi.1[index_split_045.html#filepos278978] As Justin Pollard and Howard Reid write inThe Rise and Fall of Alexandria, the city was ‘the greatest mental crucible theworld has ever known’, and that with the loss of its library ‘most of theknowledge of the first thousand years of Western civilization is missing’.2[index_split_045.html#filepos279158] That the human mind recovered from thisdamage is testament to the resiliency of its spirit.But Alexandria attracted more than scientists and philosophers, those keepers ofepisteme, and it quickly developed a reputation for being open to religious,mystical, and esoteric teachings of all sorts. Among the many preachers ofdifferent faiths that flocked to the great world city were Pythagoreans,followers of the Chaldean oracles, readers of the Greek myths, and Platonic andStoic philosophers. Judaism, the Greek Mystery schools, Zoroastrianism,astrology, Buddhism, and later Christianity and alchemy, all had their advocatesin Alexandria, sharing philosophical space with the city’s native dwellers, whostill kept the old Egyptian spirit alive. Along with the Greeks, Babylonians,Persians, Phoenicians, and others who came to populate Alexandria (which, untilthe rise of Rome, was the largest city in the ancient world, and after Romeremained the second largest), there was also a large Jewish population. TheSeptuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, emerged from Alexandria.And there were, of course, the Egyptians themselves, who dominated an area knownas Rhakotis, the name of the original Egyptian city on the site, which wasquickly overrun by its new Greek immigrants. In many ways Alexandria was muchlike many major cities today, a sometimes unwieldy mix of differing peoples,beliefs, and cultures, and like today, it offered an often dizzying range ofphilosophies and belief systems to its inhabitants. If today we think of the NewAge as a ‘spiritual marketplace’, the epithet would fit Roman Alexandria to atee.The Greeks and later the Romans were the dominant social and political force inAlexandria, leaving the native Egyptians and the Jewish population as secondclass citizens. Spiritually, however, Egypt remained in control, as thehistorian Garth Fowden makes clear.3 [index_split_045.html#filepos279433] Forthe Greeks, as for the Romans who followed, Egypt was, as noted in the lastchapter, a holy land, a land of mysteries and secrets, and the Egyptian priestsenjoyed the kind of prestige that the Greeks awarded more exotic sages like theBrahmins and Gymnosophists (fakirs) of India. Alexandria was, as the novelistLawrence Durrell in The Alexandria Quartet, remarked, a ‘town of sects andgospels’, and if this was true of the Alexandria of Durrell’s quartet — postWWII — it was even more true of the Hermetic Alexandria. Unlike Christianitywhich, when it conquered, worked to eradicate or at least to erase as much ofthe previous pantheon as possible, the Greeks and Romans were happy toaccommodate their own gods to those of the Egyptians. Serapis, as we’ve seen,was one result of this creative fusion. Another was the seemingly fated pairingof Hermes and Thoth."},{"pageContent":"A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN As more Greeks and Greek-speaking people came to Egypt, they began to see aresemblance between some of their gods and those of the Egyptians. Unlike theJews, who had contempt for the dominant idolaters, and the later Christians, whodemonized the heathen deities, the Greeks thought it made perfect sense thatsome of their gods shared characteristics with those of other peoples. And whenit came to the Egyptian gods, tradition maintained that they take a certainprecedence. Egypt was after all the land of religion, and the idea that its godsand goddess were archetypal (Greek arkhaios) did not lessen the reverence theGreeks felt for their own deities. There was also the fact that although theGreek population enjoyed privileges not shared by the native Egyptians, and inmany ways segregated themselves from them, there was a certain tendency to ‘gonative’, especially in religious and spiritual matters, and it was in these thatthe ancient Egyptian wisdom took prominence.Thoth, one of the major Egyptian deities, had been worshipped for millennia. Theorigins of that worship are aptly shrouded in mystery, but there is evidencethat Thoth was venerated in Egypt from at least 3000 BC, although this may be aconservative estimate. Originally a creator god, a demiurge similar to the oneportrayed in the Poimandres, this creative power was later recognized in hismastery of speech, language, writing, and magic, and it was through his wordsthat the will of Ra, the sun god, was made manifest. Along with Ma’at, thegoddess of order, Thoth stood with Ra on his solar barque, and it was he whorecorded the outcome of the weighing of the soul when the dead were judged inthe Duat. His main centre of worship was the city Khemennu (Greek Hermopolis),in Upper Egypt, thought to be the oldest city on earth, where he was the head ofa group of eight deities called the Ogdoad, rivalling the pantheons ofHeliopolis and Memphis, which were ruled by Ra and Ptah.4[index_split_045.html#filepos279690]In the earliest monuments, Thoth is symbolised by an ibis, a bird once so commonin Egypt that thousands of ibis mummies were made as offerings to Thoth eachyear. At Sakkara, site of the ancient Memphis necropolis, buildings werediscovered that served as hatcheries for the sacred bird, and an estimated fourmillion ibis mummies are believed to have been laid to rest here. As BrianCopenhaver remarks, this suggests that ‘ten thousand dead ibises were stacked inthese corridors in each year of the four centuries when the Sakkara complex wasactive’, a morbid testament, perhaps, to the devotion of Thoth’s followers.5[index_split_045.html#filepos279867]Often depicted as an ibis-headed man holding a pen and tablet, Thoth’s name, theEgyptian Tehuti, may have originated in an old name for the bird sacred to him;in later times he was also associated with the baboon. In the Pyramid Texts,Thoth is closely associated with Osiris, and he is believed to have writtenparts of the Book of the Dead, not surprising for a god who is also a guide tothe underworld.6 [index_split_045.html#filepos280050] Self-begotten,self-produced, as many of the Egyptian deities are, it was Thoth who made thecalculations that kept the cosmos in order, regulating the movements of thestars, the sun, and the moon, with which he was associated. As a moon god he wasalso, as said, the god of magic, and as master of writing and creator of thehieroglyphics, Thoth is the god who embodies the link between writing and magicthat is at the heart of occultism; hence the tarot has been called the Book ofThoth. Spells, words of power, and incantations are essential in practically allforms of magic and it is Thoth who is responsible for them. It was throughThoth’s magic that Isis was able to restore the dismembered Osiris and conceivethrough him the child saviour Horus.Thoth was also the god of intelligence, both of a cosmic and spiritual kind, butalso of wit and cleverness. A legend has it that Thoth is responsible for a yearbeing 365 days; originally it was only 360. Ra had put a curse on Nut, goddessof the night sky, making her sterile. To help her avoid this fate, Thoth gambledwith Khonsu, the moon, and was so clever that he won 1/72 of its light. 1/72 of360 is 5, and during these five new days, Nut was free of Ra’s curse, andquickly gave birth to Horus, Osiris, Set, Isis, and Nepthys. Thoth was also seenas a mediator, keeping the balance of power stable, whether it was between thegods, the gods and man, or between order and chaos. In the war between Ra andApophis, he is said to help each side when necessary, so that neither one northe other is dominant. In a sense he could be seen as the great cosmicgo-between and reconciler of opposites.The Greek god Hermes shares many of Thoth’s characteristics, so it shouldn’t besurprising that the Greeks living in Egypt began to associate the two. Hermes isa messenger god, a god of writing, of speech and eloquence; he is also apsychopomp, and like Thoth, he guides the dead to the underworld. Unlike Thoth,however, Hermes’ origins are somewhat more humble, and they are thought to liein the stone piles, or cairns, left by travellers at crossroads. These stonepiles, or herms in Greek, which date to 600 BC, later developed into pillarstopped by a bearded head of Hermes, with an erect phallus at the base. Althoughlater rendered as a young god, Hermes began as a more Priapic deity. Because ofhis roots in the herms, Hermes is a god of crossroads and boundaries, and he isthe patron god of people on the move, of shepherds, cowherds, travellers, butalso thieves, who cross boundaries of a different kind. Like Thoth he is amediator, bringing the earthly souls to the spirit worlds, but also bringingdreams, or messages from the gods, to men. His intermediary and interpretativefunction — he not only conveys the messages of the gods but explains them —leads to the modern discipline of hermeneutics, the art or science (depending onyour perspective) of discovering and understanding meaning. That luck or chanceis often involved in this discovery links this hermetic pursuit with the Greekhermaion, which is a ‘lucky find’. And that one does not always find what onewants is an expression of Hermes’ character as a trickster, the Roman Mercurius,about whom Jung wrote an important essay.7 [index_split_045.html#filepos280227]That Mercury/mercury moves too quickly to be caught (quicksilver), slips throughyour fingers, changes shape, is unstable, flighty, and unreliable, may not seemqualities associated with Thoth, yet we must recall the older deity’s connivingon behalf of barren Nut.Hermes association with thieves seems disreputable, but it was with him from thestart. Soon after his birth he stole Apollo’s cattle. Apollo, god of prophecy,discovered the theft and brought Hermes before Zeus for retribution. Hermes atfirst denied the act, but then confessed, but when he brought Apollo to the cavewhere he had hidden the herd, Apollo saw the lyre Hermes had just invented,using a tortoise shell and sheep gut. Hermes strummed the lyre — he had justinvented the plectrum too — and Apollo was so enchanted that he quickly agreedto take the lyre in lieu of the cattle. Although not a god of magic, Hermes wasa god of astrology and astronomy, of diplomacy, cunning, and persuasion. LikeThoth’s ibis head, pen, and writing tablet, he had accoutrements that wereunmistakable. His winged sandals — with which he moved swiftly and unheard —winged helmet (more an emblem of Mercury than of his Greek counterpart), andchlamys cloak were recognizably Hermesian, but perhaps even more Hermetic washis caduceus staff or kerykeion."},{"pageContent":"THE CADUCEUS Accounts vary for the origins of the caduceus, which is usually depicted as awinged staff with twin serpents curled around it in a double helix, suggestiveof the DNA molecule. The staff was first born by Iris, messenger of Hera, butwas later handed to Hermes. One account says it was Apollo who gave it to him,when appointing him as messenger after receiving the lyre as payment for thiscattle. One myth of the caduceus’ origin says that the prophet Tiresias, comingupon two mating snakes, killed the female with his staff and was himselfinstantly turned into a woman. He remained so for seven years, until he foundtwo more mating snakes, and this time killed the male. He is said to have thenpassed the staff and its transformative powers on to Hermes. Other accountssuggest a possible Mesopotamian origin of both Hermes and the caduceus in theSumerian underworld god Ningishzida, who is often depicted as a serpent with aman’s head and whose symbol — two snakes curled around a rod — is the earliestof its kind, dating to 3000–4000 BC.Other accounts have Hermes himself creating the caduceus. Like Tiresias Hermescame upon two snakes, although this time they were wrapped in mortal combat.Hermes separated them with his staff, and brought peace between them, thusacting as mediator, god of boundaries, and also suggesting the alchemicalreconciliatio. That serpents and staffs seem to go together is suggested by themagical powers of both Moses and Aaron’s rod, which are able to turn theiropponents’ staffs into serpents. That snakes shed their skin and appear rebornmay account for their link to both magic and medicine. The caduceus is said tobe often confused with the rod of Asclepius, a symbol of the Greek god ofhealing, yet the fact that Asclepius (the Egyptian Imhotep) appears in theCorpus Hermeticum as a student of Hermes Trismegistus suggests that theconfusion may only be apparent."},{"pageContent":"ENTER TRISMEGISTUS Exactly when Hermes Trismegistus emerged from the union of Thoth and Hermes isunclear. Herodotus, in the fifth century BC, identified the two in hisHistories, and there is a suggestion that Thoth was called ‘very, very, verygreat’ as early as the Egyptian Late Period (664–332 BC ).8[index_split_045.html#filepos280531] A reference to a TI-RI-SE-RO-E, or ‘threetimes hero’, on a Greek Linear B tablet from Pylos — the form of Greek used bythe Mycenean civilization (sixteenth to eleventh century BC) — may be an earlyform of ‘thrice-great’, and although a reference to an early form of Hermesappears on the tablet as well, it is not clear if it is linked in any way to the‘triple hero’.9 [index_split_045.html#filepos280770] Thoth is spoken of as‘great, great, great’ in an inscription on the Temple of Esna, which may date tothe Ptolemaic period (Ptolemy III Euergetes, third ruler in the Ptolemaicdynasty, who reigned 246–222 BC, may have been responsible for the temple), andthe forty-two books of Hermes Trismegistus that Clement of Alexandria spoke ofmay be the same as some sacred writings inscribed in the second century BC in atemple in Edfu.10 [index_split_045.html#filepos281007]Brian Copenhaver suggests that the earliest surviving instance of the epithet‘three times great’ appears in the minutes of a meeting of the ibis cult ofSakkara, mentioned above, concerning irregularities in the cult’s duties, anddating to 172 BC. It appears that for some time the birds were mistreated, andthat burial jars which patrons had paid for to be interred containing amummified ibis, were actually empty. Potsherds recording the meeting spoke ofthe decades long decline of the cult, and of the arrest of six of its members.It also contained a warning that ‘no man shall lapse from a matter whichconcerns Thoth … who holds sway in the temple in Memphis’ and speaks of ‘thebenefit which is performed for the ibis, the soul of Thoth, the three timesgreat’.11 [index_split_045.html#filepos281191] Garth Fowden, however, arguesthat a reference in Athenagoras of Athens (133–190 AD), a Greek philosopher whoconverted to Christianity, or possibly Philo of Byblos (64–141 AD), a Phoenicianscholar, constitute the earliest application of ‘thrice-great’ to Hermes.12[index_split_045.html#filepos281374]As in so much regarding the ancient world, exact knowledge in this matterescapes us. Yet the scholarly debate over Hermes Trismegistus’ origins,fascinating as it is, won’t bring us any closer to the people for whom thethrice-great one was something more than a novel way of referring to the amalgamof Thoth and Hermes. By the time the Corpus Hermeticum was being put together,the figure of Hermes Trismegistus — man, sage, god, philosopher — had acquiredan identity of its own. He didn’t replace either Thoth or Hermes, but hisqualities and attributes grew out of them. What was more important, however, washis function as an embodiment of the old Egyptian religion, the prisca theologiathat dazzled Marsilio Ficino when he rediscovered it more than a millenniumlater. When Thoth or Hermes or their fused selves were first called‘thrice-great’ may remain a mystery. What is certain is that by the firstcenturies of the common era, there were groups who followed the teachings andpractices of the thrice-great one, whether he ever existed or not."},{"pageContent":"HERMETIC PREJUDICES The Dominican André-Jean Festugière, whose translation of and commentary on theCorpus Hermeticum dominated scholarly study of it in the first half of the lastcentury, made three claims about the Hermetic writings that have subsequentlybeen strongly challenged. One is that the Hermetic books can be separated into‘philosophical’ and ‘magical’ works, appealing to a learned and a popularaudience respectively, and that the philosophical ones warrant criticalattention, while the popular ones were occult rubbish. In voicing thisFestugière was echoing the sentiments of an earlier Hermetic scholar, WalterScott, who also dismissed the magical Hermetica as junk. Another is that theEgyptian elements in the books are strictly decorative and rhetorical, and thattheir origins lie solely in Greek philosophy. The Egyptian tropes in theAsclepius, it argues, are a kind of window dressing, lending the text an exoticallure, but the ideas can be found in Plato, and were more than likely takenfrom him. A third is that there were no ‘Hermetic communities’. The books of theCorpus Hermeticum were solely literary works, read by interested individualswith a taste for philosophy, and were not, that is, part of a Hermeticcurriculum, aimed at producing gnosis within the context of a spiritualpractice.Most scholars today challenge these conclusions. Indeed, the Gnostic scholarGilles Quispel goes so far as to assert that ‘it is now completely certain thatthere existed before and after the beginning of the Christian era in Alexandriaa secret society, akin to a Masonic lodge’. ‘The members of this group,’ Quispelcontinues, ‘called themselves “brethren”, were initiated through a baptism ofthe Spirit, greeted each other with a sacred kiss, celebrated a sacred meal andread the Hermetic writings as edifying treatises for their spiritual progress.’And as for the pseudo-Egyptianism that Festugière argued for, ‘even if theCorpus Hermeticum was written down rather late, its concepts could easily bevery old and Egyptian’. ‘And in fact,’ Quispel goes on, ‘the basic principles ofemanation, of the world as an overflow from God, and of man as a ray of sunlight(“All is one, all is from the One”) are typically ancient Egyptian.’13[index_split_045.html#filepos281553]No one, except die hard occultists, argues that the Hermetic texts were reallywritten before the flood, but the discovery in 1945 of some Hermetica among theGnostic writings found in Nag Hammadi argues in favour of a ‘spiritually’Egyptian origin of the Corpus Hermeticum. It also suggests that there wereindeed Hermetic communities, like those of the Gnostics, which gathered in orderto study and put into practice the ideas presented in the Hermetic books. The‘learned’ and ‘popular’ distinction, many now believe, may be the result of thetastes of the Byzantine editors who first collected the Hermetic writings into asingle anthology, a literary segregation that helped to keep the philosophicalHermetica alive for a time in the Christian world, at the expense of theirmagical brothers. That scholars in the early twentieth century would eschewanything to do with magic may go without saying, but in recent years, magic, theoccult, and the esoteric have become popular items in academia, and so what wasonce considered unacceptable now turns up in dozens of thesis projects.Yet more important than the new academic tolerance of the occult, which allowsfor a broader understanding of the Hermetica, is what the ‘brethren’ who readthe Hermetic texts were aiming at in the first place."},{"pageContent":"EGYPT’S DARK DAYS Among the tales of magic and expositions of Hermetic cosmology contained in theAsclepius can be found a saddening account of the demise of ancient Egypt. ‘Atime will come,’ Hermes tells Asclepius, ‘when it appears that the Egyptianshave worshipped God with pure mind and sincere devotion in vain. All their holyworship will turn out to be without effect and will bear no fruit. For the godswill withdraw from earth to heaven and Egypt will be deserted.’14[index_split_045.html#filepos282238] Hermes goes on to tell Asclepius that whenthe gods abandon Egypt, foreigners will overrun the land, and religion itselfwill become prohibited. Egypt will then become a true land of the dead, and onlystories and myths will remain to tell of its former glory. The Nile will runwith blood, the dead will outnumber the living, all the ancient customs will belost, and the only thing that will show that one is Egyptian is the ancientlanguage. Cruelty will reign. Men, tired of living, will no longer observe thecosmos with wonder and reverence, but come to despise it. Darkness will bepreferable to light and death to life. Spiritual people will be called mad andmaterialists wise. The immortality of the soul will be laughed at, and worse,its pursuit will become a crime. Only evil spirits will remain, leading men intowar, robbery, and other vile acts. ‘Every divine voice will of necessity bestopped. The fruits of the earth will wither, and the land will no longer befertile. The very air’ Trismegistus tells us, ‘will hang heavy in lifelesstorpor.’15 [index_split_045.html#filepos282428]A sorry picture indeed. Yet it is not all bad, and Trismegistus holds out hope.He counsels Asclepius that a time will come when the ancient ways will berestored, that when things have reached rock bottom — ‘the old age of the world’— God will take a stand against corruption, and set things to rights, after apurging cataclysm or plague. Then the world will once again become worthy ofwonder and reverence, and all that is good will return, and men will once againsing hymns of praise and thanks for its beauty. At that time Egypt, which hadonce been ‘the temple of the whole cosmos’, will once again become ‘an image ofheaven.’16 [index_split_045.html#filepos282604]This dark scenario can be read in two ways. One is as a general account ofthings when the understanding of the spiritual has been lost and the lower,material values dominate, a situation that can happen at any time and which is arecurring danger, and which, for many people, would seem to be the case today(the zeal with which atheist thinkers like Richard Dawkins decry religion seemssuggestive). The other is as an account of the state that Egypt specificallyfound itself in under the Romans.17 [index_split_045.html#filepos282780] Theidea of a spiritual decadence that is wiped out through some apocalypse whichrestores the original Golden Age is a common theme in many cultures; yet Egyptitself was clearly in danger of losing its identity under the rule offoreigners, which, by the time the Corpus Hermeticum was being written, had beenthe case for centuries. Trismegistus’ dire predictions, then, can be read as awarning applicable at any time, and as a jeremiad specific to Egypt circa100–200 AD. I would suggest that the people who first encountered this prophecyunderstood it in this way, and were especially moved by its message, as itseemed that the warning of spiritual decay clearly applied to their time. Onepossible result was that they formed groups and even large communities in orderto maintain the old spiritual traditions and to aid each other in achieving thegnosis that would help deflect the catastrophe from its course."},{"pageContent":"GNOSIS IN THE DESERT To be sure, many drawn to the Hermetic ideas may have remained in cities likeAlexandria, and, while leading ordinary lives, followed the Hermeticdisciplines, perhaps even acting as instructors and recruiting agents for theteaching, distributing copies of the Hermetic texts, or reading or speakingabout them in public spaces. Many others, however, very likely abandoned thecity, in order to pursue their spiritual path free from the distractions andconstraints of urban life, and also, perhaps, of the observation and censure ofothers. One clear attraction of leaving the urban centres was the unobstructedview of the heavens the desert could offer. Throughout the Hermetic texts we areoften told that in order to know God, we should observe the cosmos. ‘If you wishto see Him,’ Hermes tells his son Tat in Book V, ‘consider the sun, the courseof the moon, the order of the stars.’18 [index_split_045.html#filepos282968]This gives a very concrete sense to the idea of ‘cosmic consciousness.’ Byobserving the stars and their celestial order, one would come to understand themind behind them, and also stimulate one’s own mind to encompass them. Standingbeneath the night sky on the Egyptian sands would facilitate this practice, andalso, one would think, make it difficult to argue with its conclusions.The Hermeticists who did go out to the desert wouldn’t have been alone. Othergroups withdrew there as well. One were the Essenes, a Jewish ascetic communitywho flourished circa 200 BC–100 AD, and who are thought to be responsible forthe famous Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in Qumran, on the West Bank, in 1947. Aswith so much else pertaining to this time, there is still debate about this, asthere is about the claim that Jesus himself may have been a member of theirsect. The Essenes, who came from different cities, lived communally. They werecelibate and pious, rejected animal sacrifice, abstained from sensual pleasure,believed in a god they called the Deity and in the immortality of the soul, andpractised baptism or ‘purification by water.’ They were forbidden to swearoaths, were against violence, practised righteousness toward others, wereobliged to maintain and transmit their teachings, and anticipated the coming ofa Messiah figure, the Teacher of Righteousness. The Essenes consideredthemselves the true carriers of the Judaic faith and referred to other Jews asthe ‘breakers of the covenant’, and many of their practices, such as baptism,seemed to have been shared by the Hermeticists.The other desert mystics with whom the Hermeticists are often closely associatedwere the Gnostics. As both the Gnostics and the Hermeticists pursued gnosis,this is understandable. Yet while there is much in common between the twocommunities, and while the inclusion of some Hermetic texts among the GnosticGospels found in Nag Hammadi suggests a close relationship between them, thereare also profound differences. One is that the Gnostics worked within aJudeo-Christian framework, seeing Jesus as one of their teachers. TheHermeticists stayed within an Egyptian narrative and do not refer to Christ.Another is that while we know who some of the great Gnostic teachers were —Carpocrates, Valentinus, Basilides — no comparable Hermetic names have come downto us. The Hermetic masters were all anonymous, and while the RenaissanceHermeticists who rediscovered the Corpus Hermeticum believed that HermesTrismegistus was a real person, it seems clear that the true authors of theHermetic books assigned their works to him as a sign of the devotion and respectwarranted by the wisdom responsible for them. It was common practice in theancient world to assign the authorship of a work to a respected predecessor, notout of ego or pride, but out of humility. In the case of the Hermetic books, itwas to show that an individual mind wasn’t responsible for them, but the greatMind.Another important difference between the Gnostics and the Hermeticists was intheir conception of gnosis. Anyone who has studied the Gnostic writings can’t beblamed for coming away from them dizzied by the scores of demons, hierarchicalaeons, and levels of spiritual reality that the Gnostic aspirant to higherknowledge has to struggle with. For example, there are the ‘Orders of the ThreeAmens, Child of the Child, Twin Saviours, Great Sabaoth, Great Iao the Good,Seven Amens’, as well as the ‘Orders of the Uncontainables, Unpassables, and theOrders of those who are before and beyond these’.19[index_split_045.html#filepos283152] These are only some of the many spiritualrealities the Gnostic had to encounter on his path to spiritual freedom. TheHermeticist, by comparison, had a simpler, purer challenge: to raise hisindividual mind to the level of the Great Mind and to achieve cosmicconsciousness. And while the Gnostic achieved liberation by soaring into‘transcendent heights of vision and apocalypse’, the Hermeticist, though alsoexperiencing ecstasy, worked to anchor this in the rigours of Platonic logic,‘so that,’ as G.R.S. Mead wrote, ‘the vital substance received from above may berightly digested by the pure mind and fitly used to nourish the nature below’.20[index_split_045.html#filepos283471]As Claire and Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke remark, this distinction highlights thecentral difference between Gnosticism and Hermeticism.21[index_split_045.html#filepos283648] While both recognize that man has in someway ‘fallen’ from a spiritual state to the material world (i.e., that ourconsciousness operates on a level far lower than its potential), and both workto ignite the spark of spirit locked within the physical body, the similarities,for the most part, stop there. For the Gnostics, the world itself is evil, theproduct of an idiot demiurge who suffers from the delusion that he is the realgod. For them we remain trapped within his creation, slaves to the malevolentArchons, or ‘rulers’, who block our path to the true transcendent God beyond.(Shakespeare captures this feeling in Macbeth, where he says that life is ‘atale told by an idiot … signifying nothing’. The Hermeticists would not agree.)The Gnostic aimed to escape this ‘prison’, and it isn’t surprising thatGnosticism has been associated with existentialism, with its sense, in MartinHeidegger’s phrase, of being ‘thrown’ into the world, and that postmodern‘conspiracy consciousness’, exemplified in the writings of Philip K. Dick andThomas Pynchon, has been labelled gnostic. An atmosphere of paranoia permeatesthe Gnostic cosmos that is absent in the Hermetic world. Some Hermetic books dofocus on the limitations of the physical world, speaking of it as ‘evil’, butthis is also qualified, specifying that the ‘earth’ is the ‘country’ of evil,but ‘not the cosmos as some blasphemously affirm’, raising the question of whothose ‘some’ might be.22 [index_split_045.html#filepos283817] One possibility isthat this is a reference to the Gnostics, who the Hermeticists must have beenaware of. In any case, the ‘evil’ of the earth is further qualified, in theremark that ‘the man who fears God will support all since he has realised trueknowledge; for to such a man all things are good, even those that are evil forothers’. ‘When entangled with difficulties’, such a one ‘refers all things totrue knowledge; he alone turns evil into good.’23[index_split_045.html#filepos284019]But most of the Hermetic books do not emphasize the evil of the world, andindeed many celebrate the cosmos as evidence of divine order and beauty. Thedifference between the Gnostics and the Hermeticists is that Hermetic mandoesn’t want to escape from the world, but to realize his full potential withinit, in order to embrace his obligations, so that, as Hermes tells Asclepius, hecan ‘raise his sight to heaven while he takes care of the earth’. He cannot takecare of the earth if he escapes from it. As Glenn Alexander Magee writes, ‘TheHermeticist does not need to escape from the world in order to save himself; hewants to gain knowledge of the world in order to expand his own self, andutilize this knowledge to penetrate into the self of God’. ‘Hermeticism,’ Mageewrites, ‘is a positive gnosis, devoted to the world.’24[index_split_045.html#filepos284195] And while the body is seen as a ‘portabletomb’ it is also celebrated. Poimandres, we remember, tells Hermes to multiply,and in Book II, Hermes explains that ‘the raising of children is … most blessedby right-thinking people’ and that if someone dies childless, it is the‘greatest misfortune and impiety’.25 [index_split_045.html#filepos284470]And not only children, but the means of creating them is sacred. In theAsclepius, Hermes speaks of the ‘sweet and vital mystery’ of sex, and explainsthat in the mutual orgasm of sexual intercourse, ‘the woman acquires thestrength of man and the man relaxes in the female passivity’. This exchange,Hermes tells Asclepius, in which the divinity of both arises from their mutualembrace, embodies the ‘greatest tenderness, joy, gladness, longing and divinelove’, and its mystery was bestowed upon all creatures by God.26[index_split_045.html#filepos284654] The Gnostics, on the other hand, often heldthe body and procreation in contempt, and saw giving birth as a sign of thedemiurge’s triumph, one more soul caught in the snares of the Archons. So,although Hermetic man must struggle to free himself from the limitations of thebody, and must work to liberate himself from his slavery to the planetaryspheres, this is in order for him to take his true place in the cosmos, not toreject it.But perhaps the clearest sign that the followers of Hermes had an attitudetoward the world different than the Gnostics, is that many of the Hermetic textsend in praise. When, after his spiritual labours, the initiate reaches theeighth sphere, he hears the voices of those who have gone before, singing inthanksgiving, a sentiment the poet Rilke captured in his notion of dennochpreisen, ‘praise in spite of’. In his Sonnets to Orpheus, Rilke says themythical Greek poet’s mission was ‘praising, that’s it/Praise was his mission’.One characteristic of cosmic consciousness is the recognition that ‘all isgood’, as R.M. Bucke found when he saw that ‘the universe is so built andordered that without any peradventure all things work together for the good ofeach and all, that the foundation principle of the world is what we call love’.As far as I can tell, this is not a vision given to many Gnostics."},{"pageContent":"THE HERMETIC WORK Although many modern scholars of the Hermetica believe that there were Hermeticcommunities, the nature of those communities and the practices they may haveengaged in remain a matter for debate. While the singing of hymns seems to behave been part of their practice, the notion and character of Hermetic‘sacraments’, such as baptism, is unclear, with some scholars suggesting that anactual physical immersion took place, and others suggesting that the idea hadbeen ‘spiritualized’ into a more metaphorical act. The same is true for notionsof, say, sacrifice. My own feeling is that, as Hermeticism is, in Frances Yates’words, a religion ‘without temples or liturgy, followed in the mind alone’, theidea of a set ritual, with sacraments, a priest and so on, seems unnecessary.Yet, while the available material doesn’t allow for a clear cut assertion, wecan, I think, permit ourselves some speculation, or at least the pleasure ofconsidering others’ speculations.In his important Introduction to G.R.S. Mead’s Hymns of Hermes, the Gnosticthinker Stephan A. Hoeller suggests what being involved in one of the Hermeticcommunities may have entailed.27 [index_split_045.html#filepos284844] Hoellersuggests that a follower of Hermes Trismegistus began by reading some of theHermetic books, or possibly by hearing them read or discussed in one of thepublic squares in places like Alexandria. As Alexandria was a city of sects andgospels, the Hermetic philosophy had competition, and as a degree of thought,logic and argument was involved in understanding it, we can assume that itattracted only a small number of people, the majority finding devotional orsacrificial beliefs more to their liking. After reading and hearing about theHermetic path, following a probationary period, the few who felt drawn to itwould continue their studies and be led to the next stage. This would haveinvolved joining with others in a small group, within which rituals and guidedmeditations would have been practised, the idea being to acclimatize theaspirant to the spiritual atmosphere conducive to gnosis. This stage would actas a preparation for the ascent through the planetary spheres, and during it,the aspirant would have to master some basic principles, something perhaps alongthe lines of recognizing the independence of the ba from the body, as discussedin the previous chapter."},{"pageContent":"JOURNEY BEYOND THE PLANETS Next came what Hoeller calls the ‘progress through the Hebdomad’, or the journeythrough the seven planets. As Hoeller writes, ‘as the initiate’s interior powersincrease, the stranglehold of the cosmos and the planets decreases’.28[index_split_045.html#filepos285524] We must remember that for the Hermeticist,man, as a being of two natures, is subject to planetary, stellar and cosmicforces, and the idea is to become free of them. Increasingly, as one masteredthe Hermetic vision, one became less dominated by necessity and fate and moreable to act independently, to be motivated by self-consciousness and consciousdecision, and not pushed and pulled by either cosmic or corporeal forces. Thisstage would probably involve both some kind of guided ecstatic inner ‘ascent’through imaginal planetary realms — perhaps something along the lines of theKabbalistic ‘path work’ — and an ethical discipline in which the limitationsassociated with the planets are jettisoned. One would imagine that this would bean ongoing process, with the passage through each planetary sphere — bringingone’s consciousness closer to Nous — being accompanied by a comparable conquestof personal limitation, an overcoming of impatience, let’s say, or of indolence,or other personal faults. As mentioned, for the Alexandrian and RenaissanceHermeticist, astrology was a means of understanding stellar or astral (Latinastra = stars) forces in order to avoid them. Unlike today, they read theirhoroscopes, not in order to predict their future, but in order to master it.This notion of both movement through the planets and escape from their influence(our word ‘influence’ itself has its roots in the idea that a force or fluidflowed into us from the stars) would remain as central themes in modernesotericism. In Rudolf Steiner’s anthroposophy, for example, as a soul descendsto earth, it acquires characteristics from planetary angels, which it gives upin its passage from life to rebirth, and his scheme of an ‘evolution ofconsciousness’ entails a movement from earlier planetary levels — for example,Old Sun, Old Moon — to later ones — Jupiter, Venus, and beyond.Perhaps more clear is the use of this theme in the work of the enigmaticesoteric teacher G.I. Gurdjieff. According to Gurdjieff, the universe isstructured along the lines of what he calls the ‘Ray of Creation’, reaching fromthe Absolute to the moon. At each ‘octave’ of this ray, certain cosmic ‘laws’dominate. The aim of Gurdjieff’s ‘work’ is to free oneself from as many of theselaws as possible. The moon, the lowest level in the Ray of Creation, is subjectto 96 laws. The earth, the next lowest, is subject to 48 laws, and that is whereman finds himself. Through ‘working on himself’, man can raise himself to thenext level, that of the planets, which is subject to only 24 laws. By working onhimself further still, he can reach the next level, that of the sun, which issubject to only 12 laws, and so on, until we reach ‘the Absolute’, which seemsquite similar to the Hermetic ‘the One, the All’.29[index_split_045.html#filepos285792] The whole system of Gurdjieff’s Ray ofCreation is a more or less modernized version of the emanationist cosmologyassociated with Hermeticism and, earlier, with ancient Egyptian religion, inwhich creation is the result, not of a arbitrary act of a creator God (creatioex nihilo), but of an ‘overflow’ or emanation from the divine. This is not tosay that Gurdjieff ‘stole’ the idea, although he wouldn’t have been bothered bythe accusation, but that it is so central to esoteric thought that it hasremained in it, practically unchanged, aside from surface variations, forcenturies."},{"pageContent":"THE EIGHTH SPHERE Having passed through the planetary spheres, the Hermeticist was now able tojoin the Brotherhood of the Ogdoad, the earlier voyagers who have reached theEighth sphere, where they have freed themselves of their cosmic limitations.They have, in other words, achieved gnosis and experienced cosmic consciousness.Here they rejoice in their freedom and sing praises to the One. In practice, itseems that a kind of baptism may have been part of the ritual, recognizing a newinitiate in the mysteries, and in the Asclepius, a communal meal is alsomentioned. The ecstasy of the voyage was, as mentioned, often given voicethrough hymns of praise, in which the new, transcendent consciousness wascelebrated. In his Hymns of Hermes G.R.S. Mead gives several examples of theseecstatic songs. In ‘The Secret Hymnody’ that ends the Poimandres, Hermes sings:> > Let every nature of the world receive the utterance of my hymn!> > Open, thou Earth! Let every bolt of the Abyss be drawn for me! Stir not, ye> > Trees! I am about to hymn creation’s Lord, both All and One. Ye heavens> > open, and ye Winds stay still, and let God’s Deathless Sphere receive my> > word! For I will sing the praise of Him who founded all; who fixed the Earth> > and hung up Heaven …30 [index_split_045.html#filepos286066] Again, in The Eighth Reveals the Ninth, one of the Hermetic texts found in NagHammadi, we find a long string of vowels and what seem ‘magical’ words, such as‘Zoxathazo a oo’ ee Zozazoth’, which, while similar to some Gnostic ‘powerwords’ are also reminiscent of the ‘barbarous words of evocation’ associatedwith ceremonial magic. The sense is that on achieving gnosis, the rational mind,responsible for ordered speech, is short-circuited, so that no logical accountof the experience is possible, a problem, as we’ve seen, encountered by moremodern pursuers of cosmic consciousness. What these ‘words’ may have meant tothe Hermeticists is unclear, as is whether they were used to trigger an alteredstate, as chanting is in shamanistic practice, or were a sign that one had beenachieved. As Hoeller rightly remarks, ‘this heavenly mystery is not profitablyapproached in rational terms’, and ‘the utterance ensuing from suchextraordinary states of consciousness also must be of an other than ordinarykind’.31 [index_split_045.html#filepos286246]"},{"pageContent":"LANGUAGE AND SILENCE Although the Corpus Hermeticum was written in Greek, another important part ofthe Hermetic ritual was the use of the Egyptian language. Just as thehieroglyphics were, the Egyptian language was considered magical and sacred. Itssounds had a power of their own, aside from the meaning of the words, whichcould not be translated into another language, and certainly not into Greek,which was the language of ‘distortion and unclarity’ (Book XVI). The power ofspeech sets man apart from the animals, but the power of the Egyptian languageis that of God. As Asclepius tells King Ammon in Book XVI, ‘the very quality ofthe speech and the sound of the Egyptian words have in themselves the energy ofthe objects they speak of’, and ‘the energetic idiom of Egyptian’ employs not‘speeches (i.e. the Greek dialectic of G.R.S. Mead’s ‘doubting mind’) but soundsthat are full of action’. This aspect of the ancient Egyptian language was lateremphasized by the Neoplatonic philosopher-magician Iamblichus in his work On TheMysteries, in which he argued that the ‘performance of mysterious acts whichsurpass all understanding’ and the ‘power of unutterable symbols, intelligibleto the gods alone’ effect ‘the theurgic union’.32[index_split_045.html#filepos286422] For Iamblichus, the correct words said inthe correct way should transcend logic, and have a real, palpable effect,capable of drawing the gods down to concrete manifestation.Yet along with hymns, words of power, and other evocative sounds, the Hermeticbooks also often emphasize that silence is the best way to praise the godhead.In this they are oddly reminiscent of the philosopher Wittgenstein’s famousremark ‘What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.’ Yet thisHermetic silence is not the mere absence of sound; it is filled with theintelligible songs of the mind, the wordless recognition of the reality of Nous.As Hermes says at the end of the Poimandres ‘You whom we address in silence, theunspeakable, the unsayable, accept pure speech offerings from a heart and soulthat reach up to you’. In The Eighth Reveals the Ninth the point is made moreclearly. On achieving gnosis, an initiate declares, ‘I am Mind. I have seen!Language is not able to reveal this. For the entire eighth, my son, and thesouls that are in it, and the angels, sing a hymn in silence. And I, Mind,understand’. And when the aspirant asks instruction in how to sing the silenthymn, this curious question and answer sequence occurs:> > What is the way to sing a hymn through it (silence)?> > > Have you become such that cannot be spoken to?> > > I am silent, my father. I want to sing a hymn to you while I am silent.> > > Then sing it, for I am Mind.33 [index_split_045.html#filepos286608] And when, at the end of the Asclepius, Tat asks Asclepius if, in giving thanksto God, they should also burn incense, Hermes replies that doing so would be anact of sacrilege, as silent thanksgiving is, in God’s eyes, already the bestincense."},{"pageContent":"BECOMING AION Another way of expressing that the initiate had achieved gnosis was that he had‘become Aion’. Our word ‘aeon’ means an immense period of time, but for theHermeticist ‘Aion’ meant that he had achieved an existence outside of space andtime. This state, in which one imagined ‘the dawn of existence in the womb’ orthat of ‘the soul before entering the body’ and ‘after leaving it’, was not merefantasy but a way of ‘seeing the invisible, of anticipating the Great Beyond, areal training for immortality’.34 As Maurice Nicoll, a student of Gurdjieff andOuspensky, writes, the Hermetic practice of ‘living at all points of the life’ —that is, being vividly aware of the reality of one’s past and future — leads toour transformation into ‘eternal substance’, and makes ‘the invisible side ofthing real’.35 This power to concretely grasp, in Colin Wilson’s phrase, ‘thereality of other times and places’, was proof that the Hermeticist had escapedthe constraints of the cosmos, which kept him trapped in the present moment. For‘becoming Aion’ is nothing other than actualizing the power of the imagination,which is essentially the ability to grasp realities that are not immediatelypresent.Yet while the Hermetic initiate and his modern counterpart may ‘become Aion’ andescape the limitations of time, the Corpus Hermeticum, sadly, could not. Sometime after their writing and before their rediscovery in the Renaissance, theHermetic books fell into obscurity and were lost. And before Cosimo de’ Medici’sliterary scout found them again, a different Hermes Trismegistus made hisappearance on the scene.NOTES 1 [index_split_034.html#filepos225379].

EMERALD TABLETS Between the time when it is believed to have been written — from 100 BC to 300AD— and its rediscovery by Leonardo of Pistoia in 1460, the Corpus Hermeticumentered a literary limbo. All we know of it throughout this period comes fromscattered references in other philosophers and scholars. These few remarks,however, show us that Hermes Trismegistus’ prestige had in no way dimmed. Infact, the truth seems to be quite the opposite. The thrice-great one was takenup by two streams of spiritual thought that used his authority in ratherdifferent ways. For the church fathers Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, andLactantius, the Hermetic works were heralds of a triumphant Christianity. Theonly major anti-Hermetic voice among Christian writers was Augustine, who, inthe City of God, condemns Hermes as a heathen and the Asclepius as a work ofidolatry. (We remember that he singled out the account of the Egyptian statuesanimated by the gods as especially demonic.) Yet for all his disdain Augustinenevertheless concedes Hermes’ importance, and it was in him that laterHermeticists sought authority for their belief that the thrice-great one was acontemporary of Moses. As we will see, Hermes’ importance as a Christian heraldand fellow-traveller continued well into the Renaissance, and Hermetic ideaspowerfully influenced Christian thinkers such as pseudo-Dionysius, MeisterEckhart, and Nicolas of Cusa.The other spiritual tradition that made great use of Hermes was alchemy.Alchemyis so closely associated with Hermeticism that the two are often consideredsynonymous. When one speaks of the ‘Hermetic Art’, one is usually referring toalchemy, and it wouldn’t be surprising for a reader of this book to wonder why,so far, there has been barely a mention of it. Yet in the tracts making up theCorpus Hermeticum, and also in the Asclepius, alchemy makes no appearance. TheHermetic work in which the link between Hermeticism and alchemy is most clear,the fabled Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, was by all accounts unknown tothe Alexandrian Hermeticists, although alchemy itself may not have been unknownto them, nor they to the alchemists. Although it is believed to have beenwritten by Hermes Trismegistus, the earliest reference to the Emerald Tablet —or, as it is also known, the Tabula Smaragdina — appears in the work of theArabic alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan, otherwise known by his Latinized name Geber,and dates to the eighth century. Another early Arabic version appears in a ninthcentury work entitled The Secret of Creation, and is wrongly attributed to theGreek philosopher-magician Apollonius of Tyana. Both Arabic versions arebelieved to have been translated from Syriac.No Greek original of the Emerald Tablet has ever been found, although its mostfamous aphorism, ‘as above, so below’, seems to be echoed in an alchemical workof the second century AD, The Dialogue of Cleopatra and the Philosophers.Cleopatra of Alexandria (not the queen who died with Mark Antony) is one of theearliest known alchemists, and in this dialogue, among other things, ‘thephilosophers’ ask her to ‘Tell us how the highest descends to the lowest and howthe lowest rises to the highest’.Accompanying the text, which is only a fragment, is a page of symbolic drawingsknown as The Gold-Making of Cleopatra. Among images of alchemical apparatuses,there is one of the Ouroboros, the serpent swallowing its own tail, an ancientEgyptian symbol of infinity dating to nearly 1500 BC. The oldest knownrepresentation of the Ouroboros is found on the northern wall of the burialchambers of Tuthmosis III (1479–25 BC), which also contain a complete version ofThe Book of What is in the Duat.1 [index_split_056.html#filepos352221] WithinCleopatra’s Ouroboros are the words ‘One is All’, written in Greek. Anotherdrawing shows the alchemical symbols for gold, silver, and mercury enclosed intwo concentric circles. In the circles can be read, also in Greek, ‘One is Alland through it is All and by it is All, and if you have not All, All inNothing’. ‘The One, the All’, is the central Hermetic teaching. Whether there isany direct relation between The Dialogue of Cleopatra and the Philosophers andthe Emerald Tablet is unknown, but the parallel concern with ‘the highest’ and‘the lowest’ and the ‘above’ and the ‘below’, as well as the celebration of ‘theOne, the All’, suggest some kind of connection.Undoubtedly, the Emerald Tablet is the most famous work of alchemicalliterature. Even the father of modern science, Isaac Newton, translated it fromLatin into English, and the phrase ‘as above, so below’, a concentrate of itsopening statement, has drifted into common parlance.2[index_split_056.html#filepos352473] There are many translations of it, but allmore or less present the same concise and somewhat gnomic dictums.

Which isn’t to say that it’s a completemystery. In his classic work on the history of alchemy, E.J. Holmyard suggeststhat the Emerald Tablet speaks of ‘a correspondence or interaction betweencelestial and terrestrial affairs’, and that its central insight is that ‘allthe manifold forms in which matter occurs have but a single origin’. ‘Auniversal soul or spirit,’ Holmyard writes, ‘permeates both macrocosm andmicrocosm, and this unity in diversity implies the possibility oftransmutation.’4 [index_split_056.html#filepos352925]There’s nothing to argue with here, and everything certainly fits the Hermeticview. (My own take is that the ‘thing’ referred to in the Emerald Tablet isconsciousness itself, but how it ‘accomplishes miracles’ is another story.) Butthe first thing a reader of the Corpus Hermeticum and the Asclepius notices isthat the Emerald Tablet isn’t written in the style of either of these works.Granted that the Hermetic books were most likely written by differentindividuals at different times, they nevertheless share certain stylistictraits. As mentioned, the most obvious is the ‘teacher-student’ format.Practically all of the Hermetic books have ‘one who knows’ conferring hisknowledge onto one who ‘wants to know’. The Emerald Tablet isn’t in this form.The writer is supposed to be Hermes Trismegistus, but he isn’t addressing anyonein particular, nor are the other Hermetic books as obscure as the Emerald Tabletis. The Hermetic texts borrow not only ideas from Plato — or reiterate ideasPlato himself borrowed from the Egyptians — they also adopt his didactic style,and the teacher in the texts is often at pains to make clear that the studentunderstands exactly what he is teaching, sometimes at tedious length. TheEmerald Tablet seems to be written in that ‘esoteric’ style so common toalchemical writings, meaning it employs a language that deliberately hides itssignificance from those not privy to it. What this means is that a reader comingto the Poimandres or the Asclepius for the first time may find the writingdifficult, in that the style is very different from modern writing, but theauthor of these works is not going out of his (or her) way to be obscure. Thesame modern reader could find the same difficulty in Plato or any otherphilosopher of antiquity. But with a little effort and diligence, somethingcould be got out of it.The same can’t be said for alchemical literature, which is generally andpurposefully enigmatic. Alchemical writing wants to hide something from thoseoutside the alchemical community. The Hermetic books want to convey insights toanyone who is interested in grasping them. The result is that an average readercan pick up the Asclepius and, while he may not find it gripping, can still makesome sense of it, while the Emerald Tablet would leave him scratching his head.Yet while the Emerald Tablet doesn’t seem to be of a piece with the otherHermetic texts, its impact on western consciousness was certainly as powerful asthat of the other Hermetic books. And while alchemy doesn’t turn up in theCorpus Hermeticum, it arose from the same milieu as Hermes Trismegistus did, andclearly shares much with the thrice-great one. A work on Hermeticism withoutsome account of alchemy seems somehow criminal. Let’s take a look then at theorigins of the ‘Hermetic art’."},{"pageContent":"ALL THAT GLITTERS Again, as with so much in this book, the origins of alchemy lie deep in thepast, and its earliest mention is unclear. Even the origin of the name isdebatable. Some, like R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, argue that it originates in theArabic al-kemi, ‘out of Egypt’. Others suggest al-kimia, Greek for ‘transmutinggold and silver’. Other scholars offer other suggestions.5[index_split_056.html#filepos353156] Yet one of the curious things about alchemyis that it seems to have had a parallel development in the west and in the east.One of the earliest extant references to alchemy in China occurs around the sametime as one of the earliest extant references in the west, a coincidence thatC.G. Jung, who wrote a great deal about alchemy, may have considered asynchronicity. A Chinese edict of 144 BC mentions it, and roughly around thesame time, Bolos of Mendes — a Greek alchemist often confused with Democritus,the pre-Socratic philosopher who lived circa 460–370 BC— wrote a book about it.There is an Indian alchemy tradition as well, originating in the mythical figureof Agastyar, a kind of Hindu Hermes Trismegistus. The earliest extant Indianalchemical references appear in the Artha-Sastra, which dates from the fourth tothe third centuries BC, roughly contemporaneous with its Chinese and westerncounterparts. Although emerging at around the same time, alchemy in the eastpursued a different goal, that of long life, or immortality, than that whichoccupied early western alchemists, namely, the making of gold. Yet, over time,eastern influences informed western alchemy, and the pursuit of alchemical gold,the philosopher’s stone and the elixir of life became more or less synonymous.The roots of western alchemy seem to lie in Egyptian gold working, in thesecrets of metallurgy, the crucible, and the forge.6[index_split_056.html#filepos353406] These themselves most likely emerged out ofprehistoric metalworking and smithcraft. The mysteries of gold were the concernof a priestly order centred in the temple of Ptah, one of the great creatorgods, at Memphis, where the art of producing gold substitutes or of increasingamounts of gold by skilfully blending it with other metals was carefullyguarded. Exactly when this began is again unclear. The famous Leyden andStockholm papyri, which contain recipes for making ‘false gold’ or forincreasing the amount of gold by adulterating it with other metals, date to thethird century AD, but the recipes themselves date to several centuries earlier.7[index_split_056.html#filepos353664] The idea of alchemy as a spiritual pursuit,which is how it is most seen today, seems to have arisen at a later date, and inthis ‘spiritual alchemy’ bears the same relation to metallurgy as ‘speculativemasonry’ does to ‘operative masonry’. Sometime between 1550 and 1700, ‘operativemasonry’ — the actual working with stone — was transformed into ‘speculativemasonry’ — Freemasonry — a philosophical concern with the meaning ofarchitecture, with ideas about ‘sacred geometry’ and the symbols decoratingcathedrals. Likewise, at some point, the gold-making that the early alchemistsconcerned themselves with was itself transformed into a concern withself-transformation, with making alchemical gold, which was not the same as themetal. (Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi, the sixteenth century Paracelsianalchemist Gerhard Dorn said.) Yet, in its early days, although it later becamethe butt of many jokes, making gold is exactly what alchemy was about.This gold however, was not gold as we understand it. ‘Gold’ was the shineassociated with polished metal, and any metal that had some glitter was,contrary to the old adage, considered to be to some degree golden. Thealchemist’s job was to increase this, and he did the same with silver, gems, andother rare materials, using a number of methods, including dyes. This was notnecessarily a shady operation, as the effect and not the purity of the materialwas the central point. To be sure, over time, how to detect if some other metalhad been substituted for gold became a problem, and it was a one-time residentof Alexandria who discovered one way to do this. Archimedes’ famous cry ofEureka — ‘I’ve found it’ — allegedly occurred, circa 270 BC, when he realizedthat when he entered a bath, a specific volume of water was displaced, becauseof the volume of his body.8 [index_split_056.html#filepos353843] Hiero II ofSyracuse had asked Archimedes to discover whether a gold crown he had orderedfrom a goldsmith was true gold, or made of some alloy. Archimedes took a pieceof gold the same weight as the crown, placed it in a bowl of water, and notedhow much of it was displaced. He then did the same with a piece of silver of thesame weight. Because silver is less dense than gold, it occupies a greatervolume, and more water was displaced. Archimedes then placed the crown itself inthe bowl, and saw that the amount of water it displaced was somewhere betweenthat displaced by the pure gold and the silver. The crown, he discovered, wasadulterated, and the goldsmith no doubt suffered Hiero II’s wrath.This early stage of alchemy is represented by Bolos of Mendes, whose book,Physika kai Mystika, which can be translated as ‘Nature and Initiation’,collected a number of instructions on making gold, silver, gems, as well as onmastering the art of dyeing, especially the colour purple, which was and isassociated with royalty. The concern with dyeing highlights the importance thatcolour had for the early alchemists, and the changes that stone underwent whensubject to intense heat led to the fascination later alchemists had with thechanges in colour that the prima materia, or basic matter, endured during thealchemical process. Along with its purely ‘craft’ aspects, Bolos’ book alsodealt with the more mystical or initiatory aspects of alchemy, and is famous forsupplying one of the classic alchemical aphorisms: ‘Nature rejoices in Nature,Nature conquers Nature, Nature masters Nature’. The alchemist was one who,discovering the secrets of nature, used these to surpass nature itself, to, ineffect, improve on it. In this alchemy shares with science the notion that mancan employ the ‘laws’ of nature in order to go beyond it. Bolos wrote on anumber of other topics, including magic, agriculture, hieroglyphics, astrology,chemistry, and medicine. Although Bolos is the earliest source for informationabout alchemy, he more than likely inherited his knowledge from earlier, stillunknown alchemists, and, as mentioned, some of his writings are attributed toDemocritus, who developed one of the earliest versions of atomic theory."},{"pageContent":"THE FIFTH ESSENCE From Mendes, the Greek name for the ancient Egyptian city of Djedet, in theeastern Nile delta, the alchemical trail led to Alexandria. Here the notion ofan actual transformation of matter, rather than the art of increasing a metal’sallure, seems to have entered the mix. The notion that ‘Nature masters Nature’,echoed Aristotle’s belief that all things seek perfection; in trying totransform a base metal to a more noble one, alchemy was merely speeding up aprocess already at work. The idea, too, that metals somehow ‘grew’ in the earth,suggested that they were amenable to change. Another important influence was thebelief that all matter was a result of the operations of the four classical‘elements’, fire, water, air, and earth — first proposed by the pre-Socraticphilosopher Empedocles (circa 490–430 BC) — and that these could change into oneanother. To these four elements was also added a fifth, the ‘quintessence’, the‘universal soul or spirit’ that ‘permeates both macrocosm and microcosm’, asE.J. Holmyard wrote of the Emerald Tablet. By getting at this ‘fifth essence’ —which is what ‘quintessence’ means — the alchemist could transform oneexpression of this ‘universal spirit’ into another.After Bolos of Mendes, two women alchemists appear, Maria Prophetissa and theaforementioned Cleopatra. Maria Prophetissa is known for developing alchemicalapparatus like the bain marie, a bath that kept water heated at a constanttemperature, and the tribikos, an alembic or still, used for distillation. Sheis also credited with the saying ‘One becomes two, two becomes three, and out ofthe third comes the one as the fourth’, an example of the increasing obscurityin alchemical prose.9 [index_split_056.html#filepos354173] Yet it is unclear ifMaria was an actual woman, or even an actual and not mythical individual. Duringher time alchemy entered the strange brew of Egyptian magic, Greek philosophy,Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, Babylonian astrology, Christian theology, and paganmythology familiar to the denizens of Alexandria. At the same time it alsodeveloped the enigmatic language that makes its interpretation so difficult. Howmuch Zosimos of Panopolis, who flourished circa 300 AD, contributed to this isunclear, but, as mentioned, he is known today to a great degree because of aseries of visions he recorded and on which C.G. Jung wrote an importantcommentary.10 [index_split_056.html#filepos354350]"},{"pageContent":"THE HERMETIC CONNECTION Zosimos was called the ‘Crown of Philosophers’ by the later Olympiodorus, and heis seen as the ‘father’ of alchemy proper. Born in Panopolis (Akhmim) in UpperEgypt, he later moved to Alexandria, where he came into contact with bothHermetic and Gnostic ideas. Some commentators suggest that he actually belongedto either a Gnostic or Hermetic community, or to some combination of both. Heequated Thoth with Adam, and remarked that Jewish alchemists, like MariaProphetissa — who was also known as Maria the Jewess — could write openly aboutalchemical secrets; he, as an Egyptian, was bound to oaths of secrecy. He sawthe Egyptian priests as the guardians of the alchemical art, and is one of thefirst alchemists to credit Hermes as the originator of the work.If alchemy began as a means of making gold, with Zosimos it clearly moved intomore interior territory. In his account of his strange vision, he speaks of abowl-shaped altar, which was guarded by an Egyptian priest. In Book IV of theCorpus Hermeticum, Hermes explains to Tat why, while giving all men ‘reason’ —the ability to ‘figure things out’ — God did not give everyone an equal share of‘mind’, nous. Hermes tells Tat that God put mind in a great bowl, or krater, asa prize to be sought. He then had his herald announce that whoever recognizesthat his true nature is beyond the earthly can immerse themselves in the krater.Those who did received gnosis and perfected themselves, while the many whoignored the call remained obsessed with physical gratification. Zosimos’ visionseems to be a version of the Hermetic call, to which he added an alchemicalflourish, bringing in elements of dismemberment — reminiscent of the ‘shamans ofEgypt’ — fire, and painful self-transformation. In one part of his vision heencounters Agathodaimon, a figure in the Hermetic books.Zosimos worked with a woman partner, Theosebeia — it’s unclear if she was hisactual sister or his soror mystica, ‘mystical sister’ — and himself complainedabout the increasing obscurity of alchemical writing. ‘If the mysteries arenecessary,’ he argued in his alchemical memoir Final Quittance, ‘it is all themore important that everybody should possess a book of chemistry, which shouldnot be hidden away.’11 [index_split_056.html#filepos354537] Theosebeia, itseems, was partial to keeping the teachings secret, discussing them only with asmall, select group, and Zosimos railed against this, as he did against theselfishness and vanity of who those who set themselves up as some kind of elite.But as his dream narrative shows, Zosimos himself wasn’t averse to usingsymbolic language, and in the same memoir he refers directly to the Poimandresand Book IV, when he urges Theosebeia, who seemed more turned toward ‘material’alchemy, to follow their spiritual philosophy.12[index_split_056.html#filepos354726]"},{"pageContent":"LOVE OF FATE But what is most fascinating about Zosimos is his attitude toward ‘fate’, thenecessities inflicted upon men by the edicts of the cosmos. While the Hermeticpath is a way of transcending fate, Zosimos argued against the idea of usingmagic to avoid or alter that which the cosmos brought his way. Zosimoscriticized those who, by identifying solely with the body, become nothing but‘marchers in the procession of fate’, a clear allusion to Book IV.13[index_split_056.html#filepos354903] Yet in his own attitude toward fate, headopted an almost Taoist approach of ‘not-doing’, wu wei. Zosimos argues that‘the spiritual man, one who has come to know himself, need not rectify anythingthrough the use of magic …nor must he use force upon necessity; but rather heshould allow necessity to work in accordance with her own nature andjudgment’.14 [index_split_056.html#filepos355087] And to Theosebeia he advisedthat ‘being calm in body, calm also your passions, desire and pleasure and angerand grief and the twelve portions of death. In this way, taking control ofyourself, you will summon the divine to you, and truly it will come, that whichis everywhere and nowhere’.15 [index_split_056.html#filepos355266]As Garth Fowden comments, Zosimos argues that ‘the philosopher should besensitive to the personal significance of what happens to him by unavoidablenecessity, rather than seeking to subvert or transcend by magic the divinepowers inherent in the universe’.16 [index_split_056.html#filepos355443] Thissense of what we can call ‘karmic wisdom’ is reminiscent of the process ofpersonal transformation that C.G. Jung remarks on in his commentary to theclassic of Chinese alchemy, The Secret of the Golden Flower. Relating thealchemical art to his own notion of ‘individuation’, the lifelong process ofpsychological and spiritual maturity, Jung speaks of patients who, by acceptingwhat came to them, instead of desperately trying to avoid it, outgrew theproblems that had almost wrecked them. ‘Some higher or wider interest arose onthe person’s horizon,’ Jung writes, ‘and through this widening of his view theinsoluble problem lost its urgency.’ ‘What, on a lower level, had led to thewildest conflicts and panicky outbursts of emotion, viewed from the higher levelof the personality, now seemed like a storm in the valley seen from a highmountain-top.’17 [index_split_056.html#filepos355620] From this perspective, theproblems and complexities of life have a purpose: we learn about ourselves fromthem, and trying to avoid them is the same as avoiding self-knowledge. A similarview was expressed by the philosopher Jean Gebser when he wrote that ‘Everythingthat is happening to me is a challenge to have insight into it’.18[index_split_056.html#filepos355887] And another philosopher, very differentfrom Gebser and Zosimos, Friedrich Nietzsche, summed up this attitude in aconcise formula: amor fati, ‘love of fate’.19[index_split_056.html#filepos356165]"},{"pageContent":"ALCHEMY’S DECLINE Zosimos’ writings on alchemy were collected in a huge, twenty-eight volumeencyclopedia, Alchemical Matters, most of which, sadly, is lost to us. Oneimportant saying that has survived concerns the alchemist’s perpetual goal: thephilosopher’s stone. Zosimos called it ‘a stone which is no stone, this preciousthing which has no value, this polymorphous thing which has no form, thisunknown thing which is known to all’, thus contributing to the very obscurity hecomplained about to, while adding a Christian element to the alchemical brew.20[index_split_056.html#filepos356442] Psalm 118:22 says: ‘The stone the buildersrejected has become the corner stone.’ Exactly when talk of the philosopher’sstone first began is, as with so much else in this context, unclear. Somesuggest Bolos speaks of it, but this reference comes from an account bySynesius, an alchemist who followed Bolos, and who claims that Bolos was taughtby Ostanes, a mythical figure who was said to be Alexander the Great’s personalalchemist.21 [index_split_056.html#filepos356639] Zosimos, however, seems tohave known of it.Alchemy continued in Alexandria after Zosimos, but by this time it, like Egyptitself, was in decline. Stephanus, an alchemist who lived in the seventhcentury, carried on the tradition, but added nothing new, and he eventually leftAlexandria for Constantinople. The decline of Egypt, prophesized in theAsclepius, may even have prompted alchemy’s rise, in the same way that it mayhave acted on the Hermeticists. It’s possible that the alchemists, wanting tosalvage some of Egypt’s ancient wisdom, collected it in their art. It’s evenpossible that the notorious obscurity of alchemical texts is based in an attemptto keep this wisdom from prying, foreign eyes. Ironically, alchemy’s survivalwas the result of the philosophical and spiritual interests of Egypt’s lastconquerors, the Arabs."},{"pageContent":"HERMETIC HARRAN When Amr ibn al’Aas conquered Alexandria in 639, he more than likely didn’trealize that he would be helping alchemy and Hermeticism reach the Muslim world.But like every other conquering people that had entered Alexandria’s gates, theArabs soon recognized the wealth of learning they had captured by gainingcontrol of the city. Soon Arab scholars and philosophers were clamouring fortranslations of the Greek and Latin texts they had inherited, as well as forthose in other languages. And along with the many works of mathematics,philosophy, medicine, and other sciences that survived the conquering army’sbaths (see p.76), were works of alchemy. It’s true that the Arabs had alreadyshown an interest in alchemy prior to the capture of Alexandria. But thisinterest became something of an obsession when Egypt’s ancient knowledge cameinto their hands.It’s very likely that the meeting between Greco-Egyptian and Chinese alchemyhappened through an Arab broker. Arab sailors reached Canton in 627, the firstknown direct contact between the two people, and the Arabs actually built amosque there which remains today.22 [index_split_056.html#filepos356816] It isafter this that the different pursuits of eastern and western alchemy —immortality and the philosopher’s stone — seem to have merged. The elixir oflife, as the magic potion of alchemical longevity was called, was first known tothe Chinese as a kind of ‘pill of immortality’.23[index_split_056.html#filepos357061] A pill is not too far from a stone, andboth the pill and the stone were believed to be miraculously effective inminiscule quantities. The term elixir itself comes from the Arabic al-ixsir,which means ‘essence’, Aristotle’s ‘fifth element’.Unlike the Alexandrian Christians, the Arabs were at first tolerant toward thefollowers of Hermes, whom they associated with the prophet Idris, much as theGreeks associated Hermes with Thoth. One example of this tolerance is themysterious city of Harran, in northern Mesopotamia, now Anatolia (Turkey),centre of an ancient copper industry. Once the site of perhaps the world’soldest university, Harran has been a ruin for nearly a millennium, following itsdestruction by the Mongols in 1271 AD. It was founded around 2000 BC, but thearea in which Harran rose is home to possibly the oldest artefacts ofcivilization. Temples dating to 9,500 BC were discovered there in 1995, and astatue, the world’s oldest, dating to 11,500 BC, was discovered in a nearby areain 1993.24 [index_split_056.html#filepos357241] Both finds are much earlier thanCatal Huyuk, also in Anatolia, previously considered the world’s oldestNeolithic site. Harran means ‘crossroads’ or ‘caravan’, suggesting that the sitewas on many trade routes, an apt name for a city that would be associated withHermes. Among the ancient figures that passed through the city is Abraham, whothe Bible tells us stayed in Harran after leaving Ur.Harran’s university attracted many thinkers and scholars, and as the Christiansrose to power in Alexandria, many of its pagan philosophers went there. Withthem they brought knowledge and wisdom from many sources: the Chaldeans, theMagi, the Greeks, the Jews, even the Christians. But the most important wisdomschool in Harran was that of Hermes Trismegistus, whom the Harranians revered asa great teacher and sage. At least some of what we know as the Corpus Hermeticumis thought to have been their most sacred text, and it’s possible that the copyof the Hermetic books that reached Marsilio Ficino may have arrived inConstantinople and then Macedonia via Harran.That Harran was a city devoted to Hermetic thought has prompted much speculationabout it. Some suggest that the mysterious city of Damcar, mentioned in theenigmatic Rosicrucian manifestoes of the early seventeenth century (as thesource of their founder Christian Rosenkreutz’s esoteric knowledge), may indeedhave been Harran, although the dates don’t coincide.25[index_split_056.html#filepos357452] Whether or not Harran and Damcar are thesame, what is clear is that Harran was one of the last outposts of pagan,Hermetic, and Neoplatonic thought, perhaps the last. When Christianity reachedthe city, many Harranians refused to be converted. This led to Harran beingknown as ‘the city of pagans’ among Christians. In 633–43 Syria and Mesopotamiacame under Arab rule, and in 744 the Umayyad Caliph Marwan II established hiscapital in Harran. Marwan II’s reign, however, was short-lived, and when he wasdefeated by the Abbasids in 750, they soon moved the capital to Baghdad. In 830,en route to his campaign against the Byzantines, the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma’mūnpassed through the city of pagans. He asked the Harranians what their religionwas. They answered: ‘We are Harranians.’ Not satisfied with this, al-Ma’m?nasked if they were Christians, Jews, Magians, or Muslims, to which the peopleanswered: ‘No.’ When he asked about their holy scripture and prophet, theyequivocated. Al-Ma’m?n then informed them that they were idolaters, and that if,by the time he returned, they had not converted to Islam or to some other beliefsanctioned by the Koran, he would be forced to kill them.Al-Ma’m?n died during his campaign, but before hearing of this, some Harraniansconverted to Islam, others to Christianity. Many, however, remained pagans, thatis, Neoplatonic and Hermetic philosophers, seekers of gnosis. Realizing theirprecarious position, they consulted a Muslim jurist, who suggested that theycall themselves Sabians, one of the religions protected by the Koran. It was notenough, however, to merely choose a name; they also had to produce a sacred textand a prophet. For their prophets they chose Hermes Trismegistus andAgathodaimon, and as a sacred text the Hermetic books. To make their acceptanceeven easier, they suggested that Hermes was the same person as Idris, who theMuslims associated with Enoch, one of the prophets named in the Koran;Agathodaimon they equated with Seth, a son of Adam.26[index_split_056.html#filepos358455] The Harranian Hermeticists — henceforthcalled Sabians — were thus allowed to live and study in peace, and Harrancontinued as a centre for philosophical thought for many years."},{"pageContent":"THE PAGANS OF BAGHDAD One of Harran’s pagans was the famous Arabic scholar Thabit ibn Qurra (835–901).A student at Harran’s university, Thabit and his party moved to Baghdadfollowing a schism among Harran’s Sabians. Here he was introduced to the caliph,and received high favour in court, and he was invited to study at the House ofWisdom. This had been established in 750 by the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid,of Arabian Nights fame, as a great seat of learning. Indeed, the AbbasidCaliphate is recognized as a golden age of science and culture, and during thistime the Arabic world was the unrivalled centre of civilization. With hiscompanions Thabit founded an independent pagan/Hermetic community in Baghdad,who were also known as Sabians. Hearing of this, many of the Hermeticists inHarran came to Baghdad to join him, and a kind of Neoplatonic academy rose up,with the Hermetic books as its central texts. Thabit wrote numerous books on avariety of subjects, including mathematics, medicine, logic, astronomy, as wellas astrology and magic. He also made many translations from Greek to Arabic. TheHarranian Hermeticists as a whole were highly regarded as translators, anaccolade that was later ascribed to the Brethren of Purity, a community ofHermetic scholars in tenth century Basra (Iraq), responsible for an encyclopediaof esoteric science which deeply influenced Sufism. Thabit’s central work,however, was philosophy. His passion for Hermetic and Neoplatonic ideas, and hisbelief in their value, can be seen in this passage:> > We are the heirs and propagators of Paganism … Happy is he who, for the sake> > of Paganism, bears the burden of persecution with firm hope. Who else have> > civilized the world, and built the cities if not the nobles and kings of> > Paganism? Who else have set in order the harbours and rivers?

They have also made known the art of healing the body.> > They have filled the earth with settled forms of government, and with> > wisdom, which is the highest good. Without Paganism the world would be empty> > and miserable.27 [index_split_056.html#filepos358887] For Thabit to write this while living in Baghdad is testament to the breadth ofthought which, for a time at least, was tolerated, even encouraged, in theMuslim world. If nothing else, to claim that the Deity revealed itself to thepagans — that is, to the philosophers, a term of abuse for orthodox Muslims —was heresy. And considering the religious wars and persecution associated withboth Christianity and Islam, the paganism of the Greek philosophers clearlywarrants Thabit’s praise. I don’t recall many pagan philosophers warring on eachother, or persecuting different schools.Thabit’s paganism continued in Baghdad for a century and a half after his death,and the work of his followers informed a great deal of the intellectual life ofthe capital. By 1050, however, this liberality of thought had succumbed to agrowing orthodoxy, and the Baghdad pagans soon faded from view. One exception tothe rising fundamentalism was the Persian theosopher Suhrawardi, known as ‘theMartyr’, because of his execution by the religious authorities in Aleppo in1191, charged with heresy. Taking Hermetic philosophy and combining it withShi’ite Islam, Suhrawardi developed the idea of Hūrqalyā. This is an objectiveinner world that, through prayer and meditation, one can ‘travel’ in and withinwhich one can encounter equally objective sūpiritual beings, much as theHermeticists could journey inwardly through the planetary spheres, or theEgyptian initiate could travel through the underworld. Hūrqalyā is in essenceidentical to the realm of the Duat, and also to the inner realm within which theauthor of the Poimandres encountered Nous. Hūrqalyā is also striking similar tothe interior worlds explored in different ways by seers such as Swedenborg,Rudolf Steiner, and C.G. Jung. Swedenborg’s heaven, hell, and ‘spirit world’,Steiner’s ‘Akashic Record’, and Jung’s ‘collective unconscious’ are all interiorspaces which are nonetheless objective. Although imaginal they have an existenceindependent of the psyche exploring them, and although not material, they arenevertheless ‘real’.Suhrawardi’s modern interpreter, the French philosopher Henry Corbin, refers toHūrqalyā as the mundus imaginalis, the Imaginal World, which is not to beconfused with the ‘imaginary worlds’ we find in science fiction and fantasy.28[index_split_056.html#filepos359064] It is ‘imaginal’ in the sense that we enterit through the imagination, but the imagination in the sense that I speak of inChapter 3, in the context of ‘becoming Aion’, as the ability to grasp realitiesnot immediately present. Brought up on the limited, rationalistic sense ofimagination as something ‘false’ or ‘not real’ (‘That’s just your imagination’,we say) we find it difficult to appreciate that Suhrawardi, as well as theHermeticists, could explore an imaginal realm that had its own laws, its ownnecessities, and also its own inhabitants, something Aldous Huxley discoveredduring his own inner voyages, facilitated, in his case, by psychedelic drugs.29[index_split_056.html#filepos359370] Yet the notion of man as microcosm arguesthat an entire world exists within us, and, as we’ve seen in Chapter 1,something as ‘hard’ and unimaginative as neuroscience to some degree supportsthis.Suhrawardi paid the price for his Hermetic beliefs. But it’s possible thatearlier, some of Baghdad’s pagans, escaping persecution, headed forConstantinople, which in many ways had become the new Alexandria. Among otheritems they may have brought with them the Corpus Hermeticum, and it is in thisway, perhaps, that it eventually reached Michael Psellus, with whom the CorpusHermeticum takes on the form in which we know it.30[index_split_056.html#filepos359984] In Constantinople Psellus himself seems tohave acted as Gemistos Plethon did four centuries later in Florence, gathering agroup of scholars interested in Hermetic and pagan thought, some of whom mayhave been the pagans of Baghdad. The collection of Hermetic texts they studiedmay well have been the one that some Christian scholar, fleeing the approach ofthe Turk in 1453, took with him and deposited somewhere in Macedonia, later tobe found by Cosimo de’ Medici’s agent."},{"pageContent":"JABIRISH It’s unclear to what extent, if any, Thabit ibn Qurra was interested in alchemy.As he was interested in magic and other areas of occult science, he may verywell have been, although there is no record of any alchemical work by him. OtherArab scholars, however, certainly were. The first Arab alchemist we know of isKhalid ibn Yazid of Damascus, an Umayyad prince who lived from 660 to 704.Khalid is said to have studied with Morienus, a Byzantine hermit who lived nearJerusalem, and who had himself studied under Stephanus, one of the lastalchemists of Alexandria. Morienus agreed to teach Khalid because he hoped toconvert him to Christianity. But when Morienus successfully transmuted some basemetal into gold, and Khalid, angered at the failure of his Arab alchemists to doso, had them executed, Morienus understandably fled. Khalid had Greek scholarsfrom Egypt translate alchemical texts from Greek to Arabic — the firsttranslation of a foreign language into Arabic, at least according to Khalid’sbiographer31 [index_split_056.html#filepos360162] — and is himself responsiblefor at least two works: The Paradise of Wisdom and The Great and Small Books ofthe Scroll. But the real name that put Arabic alchemy on the map was Jabir ibnHayyan, known to the west as Geber, from which our word ‘gibberish’ derives.Jabir was born in Tus, Khurasan, a province of Iran, in 721. His father, achemist, was involved in the revolt against the Umayyad Caliphate, and wasarrested and executed. Jabir’s family fled to Yemen, where he studied the Koran,mathematics and other subjects. When the Umayyads were overthrown and theAbbasids gained power, Jabir went to Kufa (in present-day Iraq), where he beganhis studies in chemistry and alchemy. He later became a student and disciple ofthe sixth Imam, Ja’far al-Sadiq, an Islamic teacher, esoteric philosopher, andSufi. He is also said to have studied with Prince Khalid ibn Yazid, althoughtheir dates don’t seem to coincide.32 [index_split_056.html#filepos360342]Sufism, the mystical branch of Islam, was deeply influenced by Hermetic andNeoplatonic thought, to a great degree through the work of Basra’s Brethren ofPurity. Their name is said to come from suf, Arabic for wool, reference to thecoarse garments the ascetic Sufis wore as a criticism of the lush fineries ofthe court. The Sufis sought tawhid, ‘unity of being’, the essence of Islam,through meditation, ritual, prayer, spiritual disciplines and, most famously,dance. In the thirteenth century, Rumi, the Sufi mystical poet, founded thecelebrated order of the Mevlevi dervishes, whose hypnotic whirling mirrored theperpetual circling of the stars.Jabir became an alchemist in the Baghdad court of Harun al-Rashid and came underthe protection of his Barmacides vizier, Ja’far. (The Barmacides were a familythat came to political power under the Abbasids, much like the Florentine deMedicis of Marsilio Ficino’s time.) Although by training an Aristotelianscientist — his contributions to chemistry are what he is most remembered fortoday — Jabir held the ancient Egyptian view that man’s real seat ofintelligence was the heart, a belief he shared with the Sufis (and R.A.Schwaller de Lubicz), and which led to his being called ‘Al-Sufi’. Jabir wroteone of his alchemical books, The Book of Venus (Kitab al-Zuhra), on ‘the nobleart of alchemy’ for Harun, and when one of the favourite concubines of aminister fell ill, Jabir gave her a small taste of an elixir, which cured her onthe spot. The minister was so impressed that he fell to Jabir’s feet and kissedthem. Jabir gave him the rest of the elixir and encouraged the minister topursue alchemical studies himself, which he did.33[index_split_056.html#filepos360543]In 803, the Barmacides family fell out of favour — badly, as Harun had one ofthem executed — and Jabir’s links to them led to his leaving Baghdad andreturning to Kufa, where he established a laboratory. Two centuries after hisdeath, a golden mortar was discovered on the site, but it is unclear if it wasmade of vulgi or alchemical aurum. He died in Tus in 815, allegedly with themanuscript of his Book of Mercy under his pillow, although some accounts say helived until 833.34 [index_split_056.html#filepos360735] Although some twohundred books are attributed to him, it is debatable how many are actually byhis hand. One group of works, known as ‘The 112 Books’, contains, as mentioned,what is considered the earliest known version of the Emerald Tablet. Jabir citesas the principal sources of his alchemical knowledge the Egyptian and Greekgods, Pythagoras, Socrates — an unlikely candidate — and Agathodaimon andHermes, of the Corpus Hermeticum. (As the Corpus Hermeticum is not known to havebeen available to Jabir, he may have taken a leaf from Zosimos’ book — literally— by including Hermes and Agathodaimon in his list of predecessors; Thabit ibnQurra, who could have known of the Corpus Hermeticum, came after Jabir.) He alsomakes the curious assertion that Arius, a precursor of Hermes, was the actualfounder of the art, and that ‘it was he who applied to the Stone the firsttreatment…’35 [index_split_056.html#filepos360915] Exactly who Arius might be isunknown; he is not the Christian priest from Alexandria (250–336 AD) responsiblefor the Arian heresy.36 [index_split_056.html#filepos361092] But Jabir’s remarkreminds us that, among his many alchemical interests — which included takwin, orthe creation of artificial life (the homunculus of western alchemy); numbermysticism; and adding the qualities of hotness, dryness, wetness, and coldnessto the four classical elements — the pursuit of the philosopher’s stone remainedparamount."},{"pageContent":"HOLY STONES AND PHILOSOPHERS’ GRAILS Yet Jabir’s own contribution to this quest is, if anything, more obscure thanZosimos’, and his books are written in so oblique and mysterious a style that itis understandable many readers considered them gibberish — the word, asmentioned, derived from his name for precisely this reason.37[index_split_056.html#filepos361386] Of the qualities of the philosopher’sstone, Jabir speaks of ‘oleaginy (oiliness), affinity, tenuity of matter (thatit can be liquefied), clearness of purity, radical humidity, fixing earth, andtincture’. The stone can bring alchemical mercury and sulphur to perfection, andit is formed from different substances using different techniques. But what itis exactly and how to find or make it, remains unclear. In his Book of Stones(Kitab Al-Ahjar) Jabir explains why he is less than forthright about thisproblem. ‘The purpose,’ he says, ‘is to baffle and lead into error everyoneexcept those whom God loves and provides for.’38[index_split_056.html#filepos361711] The small number of those who havediscovered the philosopher’s stone suggests that God loves and provides for someprecious few. Many have sought the stone without success, just as many have readJabir’s labyrinthine writings, and come away from them knowing no more than theydid beforehand, possibly even less.Yet, although it may have been known to Bolos and Zosimos, when Jabir’s worksreached Europe, in Latin translations in the twelfth century — most notably Hughof Santillana’s rendition of the Emerald Tablet — the search for thephilosopher’s stone rivalled that for the Holy Grail. There is even good reasonto suspect that the stone and the Grail may be the same thing. Sometime between1200 and 1210, Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzival, his account of the Grailstory, appeared in Europe. Wolfram is a mysterious character, about whom we knowvery little. In his account of how he came to write Parsifal, Wolfram claimedthat Chrétien de Troyes’ earlier version of the Grail story, Perceval, leftunfinished in 1190, was inaccurate, and that he had learned the true accountfrom a ‘Kyot of Provence’, who had himself received it from someone namedFlegetanis, a Jewish astrologer who had converted to Christianity. Wolframwrites of the valorous knights who ‘reside by the Grail at Munsalvaesche’, andremarks that they ‘live by a stone whose nature is the most pure’. The stone iscalled lapsit exillis, and ‘by that stone’s power the phoenix burns away,turning to ashes, yet those ashes bring it back to life’. ‘Never,’ Wolfram tellsus:> > … was a man in such pain but from that day he beholds the stone, he cannot> > die in the week that follows … Nor will his complexion ever decline. He will> > be averred to have such colour as he possessed when he saw the stone … If> > that person saw that stone for two hundred years, his hair would never turn> > grey. Such power does the stone bestow upon man that his flesh and bone> > immediately acquire youth. That stone is also called the Grail.39> > [index_split_056.html#filepos361912] The Grail is often depicted as a cup, or goblet, but equally as a bowl. Weremember that in Zosimos’ vision recounted earlier in this chapter, he saw abowl-shaped altar, protected by an Egyptian priest, and that this seems to be areference to Book IV of the Corpus Hermeticum, in which Hermes tells Tat of ‘thebowl of mind’ which God put forth in order for the worthy to immerse themselvesin it. ‘Bowl’ in Greek is krater, and if, as Wolfram says, ‘the stone is alsocalled the Grail’, then the Grail, conversely, is also a stone, and we seem hereto have a direct link between Hermeticism, alchemy, and the Grail mysteries.Lapsit exillis can be read as lapsit ex caelis, ‘the stone from the heavens’,yet its ability to heal, to preserve youth and to prolong life, makes the lapsitexillis very much like the Chinese ‘pill of immortality’, which, as we’vealready seen, bears more than a slight resemblance to the philosopher’s stone.It is possible then that lapsit exillis is a corruption of lapis elixir, ‘thestone of the quintessence’, or ‘the stone of the fifth element’, the elementnecessary for the kinds of transmutation associated with the philosopher’sstone. This suggests a fascinating possibility. It leads us to ask whether, intheir pursuit of some physical object, either the stone or the Grail, alchemistsand Grail hunters have been missing the point for centuries, as both appear tobe metaphors for the Hermetic realization of mind, in other words, cosmicconsciousness. The Hermetic link is even evident in Chrétien de Troyes’Perceval, in which the monk Trevizrent — ‘threefold knowledge’ — tells thehistory of the Grail.40 [index_split_056.html#filepos362204] If Wolfram wasaware of this, he seems to have made no mention of it.Another possible link between the Grail, alchemy, and the Hermetic gnosis, isthat Wolfram calls the knights of the Grail ‘Templars’.41[index_split_056.html#filepos362388] The Order of the Knights Templar wasestablished in 1118 to ensure the safe passage of Christians in the holy landsduring the Crusades. Among the legends surrounding the Templars is one of a‘treasure’ discovered during excavations carried out on Temple Mount inJerusalem; it was from their association with this sacred site that the Templarsgot their name. Some suggest that the ‘treasure’ was a collection of scrollswritten by the Essenes, which housed revelations concerning the origins of theChristian faith. Another possibility is that the ‘treasure’ wasn’t a physicalobject, but a teaching: the Hermetic philosophy contained in the works of HermesTrismegistus. As the Hermetic teachings were preserved by Arab philosophers andalchemists following the decline of Egypt, the suggestion is that Templars wereintroduced to them during their time in the Holy Land. That the Templars arealso associated with the rise of Freemasonry, and that Freemasonry itself,according to Joscelyn Godwin, is considered the ‘most lasting creation of theHermetic tradition in the West’, makes this possible link even moreintriguing.42 [index_split_056.html#filepos362676] If nothing else this bearsconsidering, as does the fact that Jabir, one of the many who pursued thephilosopher’s stone, has a krater of his own, on the moon.43[index_split_056.html#filepos362918] The moon, we remember, was associated withthe Egyptian god Thoth."},{"pageContent":"PARACELSUS: HERMES OF THE NORTH One consequence of the Emerald Tablet and the search for the philosopher’s stoneis that it led to an Hermeticism very different from the kind associated withRenaissance humanism or with the Hermeticists of Alexandria. As Florian Ebelinghas argued, the alchemical tradition makes little use of the Corpus Hermeticum,although it does see Hermes Trismegistus as one of its founders.44 Likewise, thePlatonic Hermeticism associated with Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola,which we will discuss in the next chapter, doesn’t refer to either the EmeraldTablet or the philosopher’s stone. Nor, as already mentioned, did theHermeticism responsible for the Corpus Hermeticum. And if, in the ItalianRenaissance tradition, Plato seemed to be the culmination of a long lineage ofsages reaching back to the thrice-great one — the Hermetic or Golden Chain — forthis ‘alchemical Hermeticism’, the major modern (that is, Renaissance) figurewas Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541), otherwise known asParacelsus. Paracelsus was an alchemist, natural philosopher, and healer, and hecan be seen as the founder of ‘alternative medicine’, at least in the west.45His prestige was so great that Paracelsus was considered a veritable ‘Hermes ofthe North’, the north being, for Italian humanists, the land beyond the Alps,specifically Germany, although Paracelsus himself was Swiss.Although Hermes, too, was at the fount of this alchemical tradition, it did notinclude important exponents of the prisca theologia such as Plato or Pythagoras.The prisca theologia itself played no part in it. Nevertheless, until there-emergence of the Corpus Hermeticum, it was alchemical Hermeticism that keptat least one version of Hermetic thought alive during the Middle Ages.46 This‘alchemo-Paracelsianism’47 seems not directly concerned with gnosis or theexperience of cosmic consciousness in the way that the Alexandrian Hermeticists,or those of the Italian Renaissance were, although, to be sure, there is noreason to believe that some of its practitioners did not experience it. A handythough not absolutely adequate way to differentiate ‘alchemical’ Hermeticismfrom ‘gnostic’ or ‘cosmic consciousness’ Hermeticism, is to say that thisHermeticism of the North was more geared toward practical results; inParacelsus’ case, these were of a medical nature. In Chapter 2, I remarked thatthe notion of ‘correspondences’ was of such importance that Antoine Faivre makesit a sine qua non of Hermetic or esoteric thought. Another of Faivre’sessentials is the notion of a ‘living nature’.48 With Paracelsus and thealchemical tradition, we can say that this aspect of Hermetic thought comes tothe fore, although, again, correspondence plays a central role in alchemicalthought as well. If nothing else, this tells us that it is exceedingly difficultto pry apart these basic requirements of Hermetic or esoteric thinking.Nevertheless, in the centuries before the rediscovery of the Corpus Hermeticum —the thirteenth and fourteenth, often considered alchemy’s heyday — it was thealchemical Hermes who carried the torch, or, more accurately, the caduceus.These two Hermetic currents would soon come together and with other esoterictraditions unite to form the basis of modern occultism. Strangely, the idea of aprimordial tradition, of a prisca theologia, of a wisdom unfathomably ancient —an essential of esoteric belief — would emerge from the same shift in westernconsciousness that gave birth to our modern world: the Renaissance.NOTES 1 [index_split_046.html#filepos291535].

THE DIGNITY OF MAN On April 26, 1336, the Italian poet Francesco Petrarca, known to posterity asPetrarch, did something that apparently no one else had done before, or at leastnot for some time. He climbed a mountain to see the view.1[index_split_067.html#filepos449322] In a famous letter to the Augustinianprofessor of theology — and Petrarch’s former confessor — Dionigi di Borgo SanSepolcro, Petrarch described his, for the time, unusual excursion. Mont Ventoux,an impressive French peak northeast of Avignon, had been the object ofPetrarch’s curiosity for years. That area of France itself has a history rich inesoteric significance, having been home to the troubadours, Albigensians, andCathars, and Petrarch tells Dionigi that the mountain had fascinated him sincehis early childhood. After reading an account of Philip of Macedon’s ascent ofMount Haemus in Thessaly, Petrarch says he was ‘seized by the impulse toaccomplish what I had always wanted to do’.2[index_split_067.html#filepos449980] ‘Nothing but the desire to see itsconspicuous height’ was behind this impulse, Petrarch told Dionigi, which, whilestrange for Petrarch’s contemporaries, is a fairly common reason for climbing amountain today. Petrarch tells Dionigi that as he and his brother — whom heasked to accompany him — were about to start their trek, an old shepherd triedto dissuade them. Fifty years earlier the shepherd had been foolish enough toattempt the same thing, but after scrambling through the rocks, all he came backwith was a bruised body and torn clothes, and ever since, no one had been madenough to follow his example. The old man’s warning only increased Petrarch’sdesire, and leaving their gear with him, the two brothers started their ascent,with the old shepherd shouting his misgivings after them.Petrarch’s account of his slow, meandering drift, filled with detours and wrongturns, in contrast to his brother’s direct approach, is often reminiscent ofDante’s admission at the start of The Divine Comedy that ‘Midway along thejourney of our life’ he had ‘wandered off from the straight path’, and suggeststhat Petrarch’s letter was a more self-consciously literary work than heclaims.3 [index_split_067.html#filepos450386] Petrarch himself compares hiscircuitous route with the difficulties of achieving the ‘blessed life’.4[index_split_067.html#filepos450663] He tells Dionigi that no sooner did hereturn to the ‘little rustic inn’ from which they set out, than he withdrew to aremote part of the house, in order to pen his account ‘on the spur of themoment’, a claim some commentators find unbelievable. Yet while these doubts areunderstandable — Petrarch’s prose is a model of clarity, and he seems to have onhand a formidable array of learned quotations, and the ascent of a holy mountainis a not uncommon trope — Petrarch’s assertion that he wrote the letterimmediately after his descent is not impossible. Inspiration can accomplishextraordinary things, and from Petrarch’s account it is clear that his ascent ofMont Ventoux moved him deeply.What becomes clear in reading Petrarch’s account is that he is at oncefascinated with what he has done and terrified by it. He has in some waytransgressed against the law, human and divine, and as much as he is exalted bythe view, he is filled with remorse for enjoying it. Although Petrarch realizesthat in some way, what he is doing will benefit others, he also feels an immenseguilt for allowing the splendours of the world to dazzle him. Yet the view fromthe top is stunning, and is unlike anything Petrarch has ever seen. He feels‘overwhelmed by a gale such as I had never felt before and by the unusually openand wide view’.5 [index_split_067.html#filepos450842] Space such as he has neverexperienced suddenly opens up in front of and below him: he remarks on theclouds gathering below his feet, and how the sight made Olympus seem lessfantastic. He looks toward Italy, and the Alps, ‘frozen stiff and covered withsnow’, seem ‘quite near … though they are far, far away’. He sees the mountainsof Lyon and the sea near Marseilles, and can make out the waves ‘that breakagainst Aigues Mortes, although it takes several days to travel to this city’,suggesting that, to some degree, a new sense of time, as well as space, has beengiven to him. Directly below him he saw the swiftly moving Rhone.It isn’t surprising that Petrarch wrote his account for his ex-confessor toread. All the while that his senses are overwhelmed with new, almost painfulimpressions, and his consciousness is struck by dazzling vistas, his consciencetugs at his awareness, reminded him of the prior claims that his interior world,his duty to God and the divine, has on his soul. His mind constantly returns toAugustine, his spiritual mentor, and he finds himself sinking into a gloomyintrospection, considering his moral failures, and his inability to cast asidethe things which he knows he should abandon, but cannot. He is so engrossed inhis inner soliloquy that he forgets where he is and must make an effort to turnhis attention back to the new world which has opened up at his feet. It isprecisely this tension between his inner and outer worlds that led thephilosopher Hans Blumenberg to call Petrarch’s ascent of Mont Ventoux a‘monstrous human temptation’ and to see it as ‘one of the great moments thatoscillate indecisively between the epochs’, making Petrarch, for Blumenberg,both ‘deeply Medieval’ and ‘early modern’.6 [index_split_067.html#filepos451017]Petrarch’s mind is moving into a more modern form of consciousness, and in hisascent of Mont Ventoux, it is as if he is pulling himself out of thetwo-dimensional world of a medieval tapestry, and entering the world ofperspective, which, in Petrarch’s time, was just beginning and which a centurylater would dominate Renaissance painting.Yet even as Petrarch’s senses and mind widen in order to take in the newperspective, some part of him wants to deny the widening. He tells himself,perhaps unconvincingly, that seen from the point of view of the soul, MontVentoux ‘seemed hardly higher than a cubit compared to the height of humancontemplation’.7 [index_split_067.html#filepos451280] From the point of view ofthe Hermetic gnosis, this comparison seems understandable, the infinite mindexceeding the limits of the finite world. Yet Petrarch’s trepidation isn’tmotivated by a sense of the vast inner spaces through which the Hermeticphilosophers journeyed and which, for him, were now reflected in the vast outerspaces his ascent of Mont Ventoux had revealed. His forced disdain of themountain’s grandeur — for it is clear that, for all his ‘spiritually correct’rejection of it, he is nevertheless fascinated by it — is prompted by thenegation of the world demanded by a cramped medieval Christian faith. Like theGnostics, the Christians of the Middle Ages believed that the world was therealm of evil, and the expansive views unfolding in front of Petrarch are, hefeels, just another temptation. With a world that had just become a hundredfoldlarger stretching out before him, he berates himself for still admiring earthlythings.This tug-of-war between his inner and outer worlds is reflected in a remarkablesynchronicity that Petrarch experiences just before he must make his descent.Troubled by his inner dissonance — he found himself ‘now relishing earthlyenjoyment, now lifting up my mind to higher spheres’ — Petrarch thought to takecounsel.8 [index_split_067.html#filepos451459] Opening his copy of Augustine’sConfessions — his constant companion — at random, he read the first passage hiseyes fell upon. Augustine, it seems, had been watching. ‘And men go to admirethe high mountains,’ he wrote in Book X, ‘the vast floods of the sea, the hugestreams of the rivers, the circumference of the ocean, and the revolutions ofthe stars — and desert themselves.’ Petrarch was shaken.9[index_split_067.html#filepos451636] Augustine, we know, was no fan of HermesTrismegistus, but if his Hermetic bête noire was the Asclepius — which Petrarchknew well10 [index_split_067.html#filepos453269] — from this passage we can besure he would have found Book V of the Corpus Hermeticum equally reprehensible.Here, we remember, Hermes tells his son Tat that if he wishes to see God heshould ‘consider the sun, the course of the moon, the order of the stars’.Petrarch was understandably stunned by this synchronicity, and believed it was asign. The climb down the mountain was taken up with his misgivings on hisdelight in earthly wonders and his resolve to ‘get under foot not a higher spotof earth but the passions which are puffed up by earthly instincts’.11[index_split_067.html#filepos453454] And strangely, as Petrarch headed down tohis rustic inn, filled with these dark thoughts, he remarked on men’s weaknessesin oddly familiar words. ‘I thought,’ he wrote, ‘over how greatly mortal menlack counsel who, neglecting the noblest part of themselves in empty parading,look without for what can be found within.’ This language is strikinglyreminiscent of Hermes’ words to Tat in Book IV, when he explains that those whochoose the way of the body rather than the way of mind are ‘only paradingthrough the cosmos’.12 [index_split_067.html#filepos453634] (We are alsoreminded of Zosimos’ blind ‘marchers’, whom we met in Chapter 4.) Petrarch,however, would not have known the Corpus Hermeticum, as it would be anothercentury before Leonardo de Pistoia, Cosimo de Medici’s book scout, found a copyin Macedonia, and hurried back to Florence to give it to his boss."},{"pageContent":"PERSPECTIVAL CONSCIOUSNESS The importance of Petrarch’s ascent of Mont Ventoux has not been lost onhistorians of western consciousness. For the nineteenth century culturalhistorian Jacob Burckhardt, writing of the roots of the Renaissance, Petrarch’sascent marks the beginning of a new awareness of nature. In Petrarch, Burckhardtwrites, nature’s ‘significance … for a receptive spirit is fully and clearlydisplayed’, making him ‘one of the first truly modern men’.13[index_split_067.html#filepos454783] That Petrarch presaged the even deeperappreciation of nature that would arrive with the Romantics is clear inBurckhardt’s remark that ‘an indefinable longing for a distant panorama grewstronger and stronger in him’, and was the central prompt for his ascent.‘Indefinable longing’ or Sehnsucht would, a few centuries later, be a commontheme of the German Romantic poets. In his Faust Goethe speaks of an‘unbelievably sweet yearning’ that drove him to roam ‘through wood and lea’, andin 1777 Goethe himself would make his own ascent of the Brocken, which, evenfour centuries after Petrarch, was still considered an unusual pastime.14[index_split_067.html#filepos455055]For the philosopher Ernst Cassirer, Petrarch’s ascent provides ‘testimony to[the] decisive change in the concept of nature that began in the thirteenthcentury’, and which is now seen as a ‘new means of expression’ for humanconsciousness; echoing Burckhardt, Cassirer remarks that ‘the desire toimmediately contemplate nature’ was the main motive behind Petrarch’s trek.Petrarch’s ascent, Cassirer further argues, exemplifies the tension the newRenaissance soul would experience, finding itself caught between the pull of thespirit and of the earth. ‘When it follows the path of spiritualism’ [that is,religion], it disparages ‘the value of life’, yet when it sees ‘soul and life’as one, it sacrifices ‘spirit and immortality’.15[index_split_067.html#filepos455238] More recently, for the post-Jungianarchetypal psychologist James Hillman, Petrarch’s revelation on Mont Ventouxuncovered ‘the complexity and mystery of the man-psyche relationship’, in which‘man may turn outward to the mountains and plains and seas or inward to imagescorresponding with these’. For Hillman this argues that ‘imaginal events’ — inthe sense of Henry Corbin — ‘have the same validity as do the events ofnature’.16 [index_split_067.html#filepos455548] Hence for Hillman, Petrarch isnot only a ‘discoverer’ of nature, but of the reality of the inner world aswell.Another cultural historian who recognized the importance of Petrarch’s climb wasthe German born Swiss philosopher Jean Gebser, author of one of the mostremarkable works of twentieth century philosophy, The Ever-Present Origin. ForGebser, Petrarch’s ascent is an ‘epochal event’ which marks the ‘discovery oflandscape’ and ‘the first dawning of an awareness of space that resulted in afundamental alteration of European man’s attitude in and toward the world’.17[index_split_067.html#filepos455985] With his ascent of Mont Ventoux, Petrarchbecame for Gebser the ‘first European to step out of the transcendental giltground of the Siena masters’, and ‘the first to emerge from a space dormant intime and soul, into “real” space …’ For Gebser this meant that with Petrarchwestern consciousness embarked on a radically new development, what Gebser callsthe ‘perspectival world’. According to one authority, ‘the man of the MiddleAges was humble, conscious almost always of his fallen and sinful nature,feeling himself a miserable foul creature watched by an angry God’.18[index_split_067.html#filepos456290] Now, no longer fixed in place, as onecreature among others, as his medieval ancestors were, this new ‘perspectivalman’ could ‘rise above his station’ — as Petrarch surely did — survey the vastlandscape of creation, and map out his own destiny. In a sense, it wasPetrarch’s daring ascent, and not the orbiting of the Russian satellite Sputnikin 1957, that inaugurated the ‘space age’."},{"pageContent":"JEAN GEBSER AND STRUCTURES OF CONSCIOUSNESS Gebser’s reading of Petrarch’s ascent is in the context of his own analysis ofwhat he calls the ‘structures of consciousness’. These are different forms ofconsciousness through which mankind has been ‘mutating’ since the emergence ofthe first proto-humans millions of years ago. A satisfactory account of Gebser’s‘structures’ is impossible here — I refer the reader to my summary in A SecretHistory of Consciousness — but briefly put, Gebser believes that mankind hasmutated through four previous structures of consciousness and that we arecurrently experiencing the breakdown of the fourth structure and the firststirrings of a fifth and final, ‘integral’ structure that will integrate theprevious four and re-unite our alienated ego with the world, while retaining ourindependent, conscious ‘I’. Gebser calls his earlier structures the archaic, themagical, the mythic, and the mental-rational, and each is characterized by anincreasing separation from what Gebser calls ‘origin’. This is a non-spatial,non-temporal ground or matrix, similar to the Hermetic ‘One and All’, out ofwhich the different structures emerge. In Chapter 2, I briefly remarked that theconsciousness of the ancient Egyptians responsible for the hieroglyphics, theBook of the Dead, and the Book of What Is In the Duat, was different from ourmodern consciousness, and suggested that seeing it in terms of what we can call‘right brain consciousness’ would be a handy way of distinguishing it from ourmore ‘left brain’ dominant consciousness. For Gebser, the ancient Egyptianswould have been a late example of what he calls the mythical structure ofconsciousness. Late, because for Gebser, the mythical structure began with thefirst civilizations after the last Ice Age, circa 10,000 BC, and ended roughlyaround 1200 BC, when the mental-rational structure began. In the mythicconsciousness structure feeling, rather than thinking dominates, and whatSchwaller de Lubicz called the ‘intelligence of the heart’ is the basic mode ofawareness. (This is also in all essentials identical to ‘right brainconsciousness’.) 19 [index_split_067.html#filepos456593] The mythical structureperceives the world not as an object of thought, but as a subject of feeling,and also as a living being. It is also in the mythical structure that polarityarises, and the previously undifferentiated cosmos of the archaic and magicalstructures separates into the binary pairs of earth/sky, male/female,gods/goddesses, and so on.One strong link between the mythical consciousness structure and theconsciousness of ancient Egypt is the symbol of the circle. For Gebser, thecircle is the purest symbol of the mythic consciousness structure, as itrepresents the loop of consciousness projecting itself into and returning fromnature. Gebser sees the myth of Narcissus as exemplifying this process, thebeautiful boy (the soul) falling in love with his own reflection in a pool(nature), and in Chapter 1 we saw the ‘narcissism’ of the creation myth depictedin the Poimandres. Yet another powerfully circular symbol is the Ouroboroswhich, as we saw in Chapter 4, is strongly associated with ancient Egypt.As I remark above, the mythic consciousness structure is, for Gebser, followedby the mental-rational structure, the structure that dominates in our ownconsciousness. This is characterized by a profound separation from ‘origin’, ofwhich our modern existential sense of being ‘lost in the cosmos’ is indicative.When a consciousness structure has exhausted its possibilities, it enters whatGebser calls its ‘deficient’ mode’, which inaugurates the breakdown of thatstructure in order to clear a way for the new structure to arise. In our case,this is the integral, which will be characterized — at least according to Gebser— by an integration of the four previous structures, and a consciousparticipation in ‘origin’. For Gebser, the deficient mode of the mental-rationalstructure began with the rise of perspective, with, that is, Petrarch’s ascentof Mont Ventoux. For Gebser this marks the beginning of the furthest separationof consciousness from ‘origin’, from its roots in a non-spatial, non-temporal,hence non-material or spiritual source.One result of this decoupling of consciousness from its source is the increasingalienation from both nature and itself that western consciousness hasexperienced for the last several centuries. Another result is the rise ofscience, rationalism, and the other specifically human achievements thatconstitute what we’ve come to call the modern world. Yet one of the paradoxes ofthe history of western consciousness is that the ‘perspectival shift’ thatembodied the new exhilarating and terrifying separation of ourselves from‘origin’, also triggered the last great revival of Hermetic thought. For perhapsthe most adventurous beneficiaries of Petrarch’s dangerous ascent were thereaders of Hermes Trismegistus who followed in his wake. Freed now from the‘embedded’ character of medieval consciousness, these new ‘perspectival’ mencould bring new meaning to the idea of man as a ‘little universe’. Yet at thesame time as the mental-rational structure began to deconstruct, the new‘integral’ structure, that would assimilate the previous consciousnessstructures into a creative whole, also began to emerge and find shape in theimaginations of these Renaissance Hermeticists."},{"pageContent":"FICINO: BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN Marsilio Ficino was born in Figline, Italy, in the Val d’Arno on 19 October1433, at 9:00 in the evening. Saturn, the planet of time, materiality, andrestrictions was in the ascendant, and if you have only a passing familiaritywith astrology, you will know that this is not a particularly auspicious augury.Readers of mythology will remember that Saturn — the Greek Kronos —ate hischildren and is usually depicted as an old man brandishing a scythe. Given theastral influences dominant at his birth, it’s not surprising that Ficino grew upwith a profound sense of melancholy and that he spent a great deal of his careerexploring ways to offset the dark character allotted to him at his entry intothe world.In many ways, Ficino’s use of the Hermetic wisdom he gleaned from the Asclepius,Corpus Hermeticum, and Picatrix — a Arabic manual of spirit evocation notascribed to Hermes Trismegistus, but which contains the story of the fantasticcity of Adocentyn, mentioned in the Introduction — was an early form ofpsychotherapy.20 [index_split_067.html#filepos456842] Frances Yates didn’t knowhow accurate she was when she remarked that reading Ficino’s Renaissance ‘selfhelp manuals’, collectively known as The Book of Life, ‘we might be in theconsulting room of a rather expensive psychiatrist who knows that his patientscan afford plenty of gold and holidays in the country’.21[index_split_067.html#filepos457225] Not long after Yates wrote this, JamesHillman would be claiming the ‘loveless, humpbacked, melancholy’ Ficino as anearly and seminal exponent of the ‘centrality of the soul’ which is at the heartof Hillman’s ‘archetypal psychology’.22 [index_split_067.html#filepos457407]It’s also not surprising that Ficino would become a ‘Doctor of Souls’, a phrasehe used to described Plato and which, legend has it, his patron, Cosimo de’Medici used to describe Ficino himself.23 [index_split_067.html#filepos457595]Ficino’s father was a successful doctor — one of his many influential patientswas Cosimo — and Ficino himself would more than likely have followed in hisfather’s footsteps, were it not for the influence of his mother, who seems tohave had considerable psychic gifts. She predicted several events accurately,such as her own mother’s death, that of a new born baby, and her husband’saccident with a horse, and had a reputation for being slightly odd.24[index_split_067.html#filepos457772] Some suggest that Ficino inherited hisoversensitive temperament and frail physique from her, and Ficino himselfbelieved that his overly coddled mother could, in some way, travel ‘out of herbody’. If Ficino did inherit his weakness from his mother, he countered them byassimilating his father’s character as a healer. In many ways Ficino’s career asan Hermetic medicine man was born of the union of his parents. As cliché wouldhave it, he was doctor and patient in one.Ficino was a sickly boy, and his humped back, dwarfish form and stammer meantfew friends, but what he lacked in physical vitality — he was, according to histranslator, ‘one of the least active of men’ — he more than made up for with anacute and highly active mind.25 [index_split_067.html#filepos458085] His onephysically attractive feature was his golden hair, and his gracious, courteousmanner made him immediately likeable. He first heard of his great love Platofrom Luca d’Antonio de Bernardi, his Latin teacher, who also introduced him toanother love, music. One form of Ficino’s later practical Hermeticism wassinging the Orphic hymns, which he translated, to his own lyre accompaniment.Yet Plato, who would take a back seat to Hermes, was also outranked byAristotle, and Ficino’s early education was Aristotelian through and through.Although scholars such as John Argiropolos would leaven his dry Aristoteliandiscourse with some occasional Platonic yeast, most church scholars distrustedwhat little they knew of Plato as anti-Christian. It wouldn’t be until Ficino’sown translations appeared that Plato would begin to receive the respect thefather of western philosophy deserved.His appetite for Platonic philosophy was whetted by the lectures he attended atthe University of Florence given by Cristoforo Landino. But when he was eighteenFicino started seminary school — he eventually became a priest — and theanti-Plato pressure was unavoidable. After reading some of his essays, Landinoencouraged Ficino to continue with Greek — and Plato — but soon after Ficino hada kind of religious crisis. He was forbidden to attend any of Argiropolos’lectures, and St Antoninus, the archbishop of Florence, accused him of heresy, apresage of the suppression later Renaissance Hermeticists would encounter.Sending him back to Figline, the archbishop advised Ficino to read ThomasAquinas. No doubt Ficino did — he seems to have read anything he could get hishands on, a predictable Saturnine trait — but he continued writing. For a timehe studied medicine at the University of Bologna, and seemed that he would,after all, become a doctor, like his father. But then came Ficino’s big break.The stars, it seemed, had something else in store for him."},{"pageContent":"PLATO RETURNS For all his importance for the history of western thought, George GemistosPlethon remains a shadowy figure. His discourse on Plato and the Neoplatonistsdazzled Cosimo de’ Medici and the members of his philosophical circle during theCouncil of 1439, but this wasn’t true of the Aristotelian churchmen, who thoughtPlethon could be the devil in Neoplatonic clothing. (It didn’t help that Plethonwas against the reunification of the Orthodox and Latin church — which he hated— and only supported it because the Byzantine Emperor Palaeologus needed helpagainst the Turks.) He was well versed in other arcane thought too. The ChaldeanOracles were another keen interest of Plethon’s, along with Orpheus, Pythagoras,Zoroaster, and other pagan minds whose ideas raised Catholic eyebrows andtempers, and he seems to have practised a kind of ‘magical music’, that Ficinohimself would pursue.26 [index_split_067.html#filepos458399] The Oracles,however, were especially important to Gemistos. Like the Corpus Hermeticum, theywere believed to have been written in dim ages past — Zoroaster, the founder ofthe ancient Persian religion, is often named as their author — and like theCorpus Hermeticum, we now know they weren’t. Their origins lie in second centuryAD Rome and with a family of astrologers and magicians called the Juliani, whocalled themselves ‘Chaldeans’ — the name can refer to ancient Sumer, Akkad,Assyria, or Babylonia — as some modern day western esoteric societies might callthemselves ‘Egyptians’. The father would put his son into a trance, using someform of theurgic ritual, and while in this altered state, the boy would answerquestions and prophesize the future. Neoplatonists such as Iamblichus collectedsome of these remarks, and as the esoteric scholar Joscelyn Godwin writes ‘fromthem it passed on to Byzantium, where it was commented on by Michael Psellus’.27[index_split_067.html#filepos458582] Gemistos, a high-ranking official in thecrumbling Byzantine empire, came upon the Oracles, and along with Plato,Plotinus and the rest, he brought his knowledge of them to Florence, too.When Plethon made his fateful and sole journey to Florence, Ficino was only aboy, and so he never met the man whose ideas and personal power would have sogreat an influence on his life. Plethon died in Mistra in 1452, when Ficino wasnineteen. During a private dinner with Cosimo, Plethon’s erudition inspired thegreat patron. He had already seen Plethon disarm his Aristotelian opponents withhis first hand knowledge of the Greek classics, and now the idea of bringingPlato himself to Florence thrilled him. He would, as we’ve seen, start a newPlatonic Academy, yes. But who would head it?It’s unclear whether Ficino’s father or his old teacher Landino was responsible,but someone caught Cosimo’s ear and told him of the brilliant young student whoknew Greek, loved Plato, and wrote exceedingly well. Marsilio had met Cosimoonce before, when he was nineteen, but failed to make an impression. This timewas different. In 1459, when Ficino was a mere twenty-six, the great Cosimorequested his presence and got it. The second time around, Cosimo was impressed.After some preparations Cosimo installed the young man in a villa in Careggi, inthe hills above Florence. Marsilio Ficino, Doctor of Souls, armed with somenewly purchased Platonic texts, hung his shingle out the door. The FlorentinePlatonic Academy was open for business. It was not long after this that Cosimoasked him to hold off on Plato, and concentrate on the newly rediscoveredHermetic texts. Having heard so much about the thrice-great one and havingstudied his divine Asclepius, Marsilio was eager to start.Ficino’s Platonic Academy quickly became a site of pilgrimage for artists,poets, and philosophers, which was just as well, as Ficino himself seems neverto have travelled far from Florence. Like most scholars, travelling in the mindwas preferable to him, although he kept in contact with other thinkers through avoluminous correspondence. Although it is true, as James Hillman writes, thatmaking Ficino ‘the only source of the quattrocento rebirth goes too far’, it isdifficult to exaggerate his influence.28 [index_split_067.html#filepos458764]Besides Pico della Mirandola, who we will meet shortly, Ficino’s character andhis Platonic-Hermetic philosophy informed most of the great minds of the time:Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, Dürer, were all touched by his presence,spiritually if not physically. Ficino ‘wrought a deep and lasting change inEuropean society’ and, as soon becomes clear to a student of the time, ‘thewhole intellectual life of Florence … was under his influence’.29[index_split_067.html#filepos458944] To mention only one example, as FrancesYates and others have pointed out, Ficino directed the painting of Botticelli’sPrimavera, one of the most immediately recognizable Renaissance works. As Yateswrites, the painting represents ‘a practical application of [Ficino’s] magic, asa complex talisman, an “image of the world” arranged so as to transmit onlyhealthful, rejuvenating, anti-Saturnian influences to the beholder’.30[index_split_067.html#filepos459128] This was in keeping with Ficino’s beliefthat the purpose of the visual arts is to ‘remind the soul of its origin in thedivine world’, and exemplified his use of Hermetic magic as a means ofattracting beneficial influences from the planetary spheres.31[index_split_067.html#filepos459340] But it was not solely as literal talismansthat Renaissance art embodied magic. As Yates suggests, likening the power ofRenaissance art to the magic associated with the Asclepius, ‘it is chiefly inthis imaginative and artistic sense that we should understand the influence ofthe Renaissance magic of the type inaugurated by Ficino … The operative Magi ofthe Renaissance were the artists and it was a Donatello or a Michelangelo whoknew how to infuse the divine life into statues through their art’.32[index_split_067.html#filepos459523] Ficino’s influence reached into otherexpressions of the great cultural rebirth too, and as his translator ClementSalaman has argued, in the century following Ficino’s birth, more progress wasmade in the arts and sciences than in the previous millennium. It is arguablethat — James Hillman’s caution aside — more than anyone else, Ficino isresponsible for the ‘birth of beauty’ associated with the fifteenth century.Ficino took his Platonism seriously, not only in the sense that he re-enactedthe Symposium every 7th of November — the date on which the original ‘night ofserious drinking’ and thinking took place — but in his dedication to thephilosophical life. He was an early riser, disciplined worker, and vegetarian,although he did, apparently, enjoy wine, hence the annual symposia. And whilethere’s reason to believe he was homosexual — he spoke of an ‘unique friend’,Giovanni Cavalcanti — Ficino is believed to have been chaste. As his devotion tothe Symposium suggests, his erotic focus was on the beauty of the soul. As itdid for Hermes Trismegistus, this soul encompassed everything. As Ficino wrotein his major work, The Platonic Theology, in which he attempted to synthesizePlatonic philosophy and Christianity, man’s soul ‘spans the heavens and theearth; he plumbs to the depths of Tartarus; nor are the heavens too high forhim, nor is the centre of the earth too deep’.33[index_split_067.html#filepos459706] The subtitle of this huge work, comprisingeighteen books and begun in 1469, is Immortality of Souls, and while the ideathat our souls are immortal was part of Christian thought, it didn’t become partof Catholic dogma until the Lateran Council of 1512. There is good reason tobelieve that Ficino’s work was an important influence in this decision, and wealso remember that, as we’ve seen in Chapter 2, one of the central ideas of theancient Egyptian religion was that a part of the soul, the akh, was immortal."},{"pageContent":"ESCAPE FROM THE STARS Although it is as a translator and commentator on Plato that Ficino’s reputationin mainstream culture is established, for students of esotericism andHermeticism, he is important in other ways too. Ficino not only made the CorpusHermeticum, long lost to western minds, available again. When Cosimo de’ Mediciinsisted he translated the Hermetic books before tackling Plato, Ficino used hisnew knowledge to develop a practical means of putting these Hermetic secrets touse, an application of Hermetic wisdom that, for practitioners of the arcanearts, remains useful today.That astrology remains a popular subject is proven by the millions who readtheir horoscopes each day. But modern fans of Mystic Meg have little idea howgripped the Renaissance mind was by the power of the stars. We may read what’sin store for us half-tongue-in-cheek, half in earnest, but for the Renaissancemind, the heavens were a living intelligence, a hierarchy of powers whoseinfluence was felt through the inescapable astral emanations. This sense of thedominance of the stars would remain well into the time after Isaac Newtonrefashioned our vision of the cosmos. For medieval man, who felt himselfcompletely embedded in the world, there was no escape from the power of thestars, and if a reader is interested in knowing how central the belief in astraldominance was in pre-modern times, I can refer him to a fascinating work, TheGreat Year: Astrology, Millennarianism, and History in the Western Tradition, byNicholas Campion.But as we’ve seen, with Petrarch’s ascent of Mont Ventoux, late medieval (orearly modern) man had pulled himself out of the medieval tapestry, and had begunto feel himself a free agent, able to direct his will and powers toward theworld, rather than being a passive recipient of its influence. Ficino expressedthis new freedom by using the power of magical talismans, a kind of astrologicalmagnet. Informed with Hermetic correspondences, and directed at the anima mundi,or world soul, that Plato spoke of in the Timaeus, these could deflect balefulastral emanations and attract beneficial ones. As mentioned, much of this effortwas directed at mitigating the heavy Saturnine influence Ficino was fated withat birth and also doubly attracted because of his scholarly inclinations.Whatever their birth signs, scholars and philosophers tend to fall prey toSaturn’s depressions, and need to counter these with influences of a lighter,more buoyant character, usually of Jupiter, Venus or the sun. Much of Ficino’s‘natural magic’ — magic, that is, that used cosmic and not demonic forces, asdid most magic of the Middle Ages — was based on material in the Picatrix, whichwas considered, along with the Asclepius, a somewhat ‘dangerous’ work. But withmuch equivocation Ficino was able to convince the church authorities that hismagic had nothing to do with ‘evil’ stellar demons, and relied on impersonal‘natural’ agents. As the Church had yet to condemn Hermetic philosophy outright,and as Plato was still seen by some as a precursor of Christianity, Ficino, whowas a priest, was able to develop his Hermetic prophylactic in relative safety.In keeping with his timid, retiring character, he understandably presented hisideas with numerous qualifications and with the caveat that, in the long run,the Church, of course, knew best.Ficino’s astral prescriptions became, as we’ve seen, very popular, and many cameto him for advice, regarding him as a sage who could pass on to others thesecrets of tranquillity and strength. In the Renaissance world of intrigue anddanger, these were highly desirable qualities. As James Hillman points out ‘theRenaissance psyche’ entailed ‘a fantasy of street-knifings and poisonings,murder at High Mass, selling daughters, incest, torture, revenge, assassination,extortion, usury amid magnificence’.34 [index_split_067.html#filepos459970] Butwith the Hermetic knowledge in hand, man now had it in his power to modify, evenmaster his fate. To some extent, Ficino’s ‘preventative magic’ seems theopposite of Zosimos’ Taoist wu-wei ‘non-doing’ and acceptance of fate, butFicino’s talismanic precautions were more therapeutic than an attempt to alterthe heavens to suit his desires. As Hillman makes clear, rather than banishdepression, as modern pharmapsychology aims to do, Ficino’s teaching aimed atlearning how to live with depression, to live, that is, with the soul, its highsand lows, its heavens and hells. Ficino’s means of ‘altering fate’ were assubtle as listening to ‘Jovial’ music or taking long walks in the sun, orarranging your chamber with the appropriate venereal (Venus) colours to balanceout the heavy Saturnine internal greys and blacks. In Spiritual and DemonicMagic from Ficino to Campanella, D.P. Walker presents a picture of how Marsilioworked his ‘spells’:> > He is playing a lira da braccio or a lute, decorated with a picture of> > Orpheus charming animals, trees and rocks; he is singing … the Orphic Hymn> > of the Sun; he is burning frankincense, and at times he drinks wine; perhaps> > he contemplates a talisman; in day-time he is in sunlight, and at night he> > ‘represents the sun by fire’.35 [index_split_067.html#filepos460152] As Yates makes clear, one would need a fairly substantial income to followFicino’s prescriptions, as they involved furnishing your private rooms with avariety of beautiful and symbolic objects. But for those who could afford it,Ficino’s medicine was welcome indeed. Knowing the correspondences betweenmicrocosm and macrocosm, the astral links between the great world and the small,Ficino’s patients could create an Hermetic ‘strange attractor’ drawing orrepelling the astral influence they chose. Understanding the connections amongthe various symbols, scents, colours, metals, numbers, dates, times, places,states of mind, and astral influence — as spelled out in Ficino’s ‘self help’work On Making Your Life Agree With the Heavens — the Renaissance Hermeticisthad gained a power his medieval brother lacked, or avoided, fearful oftrafficking with the devil.36 [index_split_067.html#filepos460335] Although tochallenge fate was a mark of hubris, a rejection of divine providence, andsuggested an alliance with the Evil One, Ficino’s subtle intellect and graciousmanner helped him over this hurdle, and allowed him to convince the authoritiesthat the wisdom of the thrice-great one was not antithetical to receiveddoctrine. He did have a scare in 1489 with the publication of his Book of Life,which attracted accusations of demonism and necromancy that made their way toPope Innocent VIII. But letters from various influential friends convinced thePope that the book was harmless and Ficino was allowed to spend his last decadein peace."},{"pageContent":"THE DIGNITY OF MAN This was not the case with one of Ficino’s most brilliant pupils, who seemeddestined to burn his short candle at both ends. One aspect of Ficinian magicthat made churchmen nervous was the idea that it could effect a kind of‘reparation’ of the sensible world. The Hermeticist, Ficino believed, could‘repair’ parts of the world which had ‘fallen from grace’, a claim that camedangerously close to treading on God’s prerogative. For Ficino, the talismanscharged with the Hermetic correspondences ‘worked’ because, as images andsymbols, they were closer to the Platonic Ideas, since they drew on the Platonicanima mundi that acted as an intermediary between the physical world and theintelligible, or Ideal one. In this way, the anima mundi is very similar toSuhrawardi’s Hūrqalyā, which, along with being an ‘imaginal’ yet objectivereality, also works as a kind of ‘blueprint’ for the physical world.37[index_split_067.html#filepos461320] An example from art may help clarify this.An artist has an idea for a painting. He forms an image of it in his mind. Hethen embodies this image on the canvas. For Suhrawardi, the Hermeticists, andother thinkers, the physical world is the result of an identical process. TheIdea (archetype) begets the image (imaginal world) which results in the cosmos(physical world — God’s canvas). It will be seen that the image is in the middleground between the Idea and the finished product, which suggests that, relativeto the finished product, it occupies a ‘higher’ place in the hierarchy ofcreation. This adds considerable weight to the old adage that one should becareful what one wishes for, a chestnut that the poet and magician W.B. Yeatsexpressed more eloquently in his belief that ‘whatever we build in theimagination will accomplish itself in the circumstances of our lives’.The Hermetic images were especially effective because, for Ficino and hiscontemporaries, having been part of the earliest dispensation, the priscatheologia, they were closer than any other to the divine source. By creatingimages of the external world in his imagination, the Renaissance magus couldchannel divine energies into the imperfect world of the senses. By employing thetalismanic devices fashioned through his knowledge of the Hermetic books, Ficinohad delivered to Renaissance man the means of becoming co-creator with God. TheHermetic books themselves suggest that in a very real sense, man is as necessaryto God as God is to him — Meister Eckhart’s belief — and that rather than anarbitrary act of divine will — creatio ex nihilo — God needed to create theworld, and man, in order to be fully himself, and that this creation is ongoing.As the Poimandres recounts, Nous created Man in order for someone to recognizehis handiwork and to care for it. It was precisely this kind of thinking thatwould lead to Hermes Trismegistus’ excommunication, because for the Church, Godwould remain God in all His perfection whether he created the cosmos, man, ornot. To suggest otherwise argues that God was in some way lacking, and that, ofcourse, was heresy.Ficino himself, aware of the potential danger of these ideas, kept quiet aboutthem, in keeping with his equivocal character and innate talent for surviving.His student, Count Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, however, was a differentstory. Born in Mirandola, near Modena, in 1463 — the year that Cosimo askedFicino to put aside Plato and turn to Hermes — Pico was raised in one of themost brilliant and wealthy of the great Renaissance families. As a child hedisplayed an astonishing memory, and early on his mother primed him for a careerin the Church. At fourteen, he studied canon law at Bologna, then passed throughItalian and French universities for several years, during which time he masteredGreek, Latin, Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic. Described as ‘the most romantic ofall the Humanists’, his fiery character was almost the polar opposite ofFicino’s caution and tact.38 [index_split_067.html#filepos461502] When hismother died in 1480 — Pico was seventeen — he abandoned canon law and turned tophilosophy, which he studied in Ferrara. Soon after he met Angelo Poliziano — afriend and patient of Ficino — and the young Dominican monk Girolamo Savonarola.Savonarola — the ascetic, book-burning millenarian and rabid anti-humanist, whowas responsible for the ‘Bonfire of the Vanities’ — would become a majorinfluence on Pico in his last years, and both his and Ficino’s impact showedthat, for all his oratorical brilliance, Pico remained a very impressionableyoung man, who was, it seemed, easily swayed by the minds around him.Pico came into Ficino’s orbit in 1484, when he settled in Florence and met bothLorenzo de’ Medici — Cosimo’s grandson — and the Doctor of Souls, on the daythat Ficino had picked to publish his translations of Plato. Ficino had chosenthe day because it was, he believed, astrologically auspicious. It seems it was,and not only for him, as both he and Lorenzo became lifelong friends of thebrilliant and volatile prodigy, who quickly became one of the leading stars atFicino’s academy.By that time, Pico had already devised his plan to defend nine hundred theses ontheology in a public debate in Rome. It was during a stay in Perugia, followinga disastrous love affair with the wife of one of Lorenzo’s cousins, that he cameupon works like the Chaldean Oracles and, most importantly, the Kabbala. Theancient Hebrew mystical system had roots going back to ages past, but had onlybeen codified in Spain by Moses de León in the late thirteenth century. Picoalready knew the Hermetica and the idea of a prisca theologia was at the heartof his theses. His great aim was to synthesize the Christian, pagan, and Hebrewtraditions — as they all had their roots in the primal revelation — and in thissense, Pico shared the syncretic impulse that gave birth to Hermetic thought inAlexandria more than a millennium earlier. In 1486, while in Rome awaiting thedebate, Pico had his theses published and Pope Innocent VIII — who would giveFicino a scare three years later — got wind of Pico’s plan and put a halt to it.Pico did, however, have the chance to deliver his famous Oration on the Dignityof Man, which encapsulates the essence of his theses. In 1487, Innocent VIIIcalled for the theses to be reviewed, and the result was that thirteen of themwere condemned outright. Pico humbly agreed to retract these, but then almostimmediately he published an Apologia defending them. Innocent VIII was notamused and this time he forced Pico to retract both the Apologia and thecondemned theses.The other 887 theses didn’t fare much better. Innocent VIII declared these to beunorthodox, and the central reason was that they ‘reproduced the errors of paganphilosophers’. Worse still, some of them seemed to endorse magic, and notFicino’s harmless ‘natural’ kind. One thesis in particular can stand as anexample of the sort of challenges the Church faced with Pico’s ideas, and whichit felt it had no choice but to condemn. It also makes clear how importantHermeticism and the Kabbala were for Pico. ‘There is no science which gives usmore assurance of Christ’s divinity’, Pico told the learned theologians, ‘thanmagic and the Kabbala.’ Although Pico wanted to use magic and Kabbala to assertChrist’s divinity, as far as the Church was concerned the fact that he would usethese to do so was scandalous, and suggested that Pico believed that Christ waslittle more than one magician among others. Faced with Innocent VIII’sdisapproval, in 1488 Pico understandably fled Italy but was arrested in Franceby Philip II of Savoy, who imprisoned him in Vincennes. He was released throughappeals by Lorenzo de’ Medici and allowed to live in Florence under his care,although it was not until 1493 and the ascension of Pope Alexander VI, whofavoured Hermetic philosophy, that Pico was cleared of papal censure. At thispoint he renewed his friendship with Savonarola, which had cooled because ofPico’s interest in heretical thinkers like Plato and Hermes Trismegistus. In hislast years he wrote his Heptaplus, an allegorical account of the creation, andDe Ente et Uno (1491), on being and unity. It wasn’t until after his death thathis Treatise Against Astrology, in which he rejected stellar determinism infavour of man’s ability to master his fate through free will and Ficinian magic,appeared.In 1492, as Christopher Columbus headed toward the new world, Lorenzo de’ Medicidied, and Pico moved to Ferrara. In the power vacuum left by Lorenzo’s death,Savonarola rose to prominence in Florence and began, like Patriarch Theophilusof Alexandria before him, to burn pagan works and enforce a religious and moralfundamentalism. Ironically, but no doubt shaken by his encounter with papaldispleasure, Pico became a fervent follower, rejecting Hermes, Plato, and theprisca theologia. Strangely, he was not alone; as D.P. Walker makes clear, mostof the other Florentine Platonists, with the exception of Ficino, becamefollowers of Savonarola too.39 [index_split_067.html#filepos461695] Savonaroladeclared that ‘the least little child of the Christians is better’ than Socratesand Plato, and suddenly the members of Ficino’s academy agreed.40[index_split_067.html#filepos461878] Never one to do things by half, Pico gaveaway his fortune and burned his own poetry. Years earlier he had expressed thewish to walk barefoot across Italy as a wandering evangelist, and now theasceticism of that youthful desire returned. But he never got the chance. Hedied under mysterious circumstances in 1494 — there’s some suspicion that he waspoisoned — at the age of thirty-one."},{"pageContent":"WHAT A GREAT MIRACLE IS MAN Unlike Ficino, who was satisfied with unlocking the secrets of the natural magicthat flowed from the anima mundi — thereby steering clear of the authorities —Pico had bigger plans, and aimed to bring human consciousness to the very sourceof being itself. His reading of the Kabbala informed not only his desire toeffect a union between Hebrew, Christian, and pagan belief; it revealed to himthe potential for man to master the secret logos, hidden in numbers and thealphabet, and hence to attain godlike powers. Pico argued that for magic to beeffective, it must reach beyond the stars, and into the higher, supercelestialspheres — the Eighth and Ninth, beyond the cosmos. His brand of magic tapped theforces that lay behind the sensible world: angels, archangels, the ten Sephirothor powers of God on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, even, perhaps, God himself,something the cautious Ficino would never have admitted. Pico’s Kabbalisticinvestigations would open doors for Christian variants on an adamantly Jewishtradition, and make possible the kind of Kabbalistic magic associated with latenineteenth century occult figures and societies, such as Eliphas Levi, and theHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, whose most famous members were the poet W.B.Yeats and the notorious Aleister Crowley (whose link to a tradition of Christianmagic seems peculiarly piquant). It is this tradition, stemming from Pico, thatinforms most modern magical practices today.41[index_split_067.html#filepos462054]This sense of man’s potential divinity is clear in the opening of Pico’s bestknown work, the Oration On the Dignity of Man. This has been called ‘themanifesto of humanism’, although ‘superhumanism’ may be more accurate, as Pico’ssense of human potential goes far beyond what most modern humanists, who are forthe most part secular thinkers, would accept today.42[index_split_067.html#filepos462416] (And even humanists close to Pico’s time,like Erasmus, were profoundly critical of his metaphysical preoccupations.) Picobegins his Oration by remarking that the esteemed Abdala the Saracen — todaythought to have been a cousin of the prophet Mohammed43[index_split_067.html#filepos462610] — when asked what in the world was mostworthy of wonder, had answered ‘man’. Pico supported this conclusion by quotingfrom the opening pages of the Asclepius, when Hermes tells Asclepius: ‘What agreat miracle is man’. That in 1603 Shakespeare would agree with Pico, writingin Hamlet ‘What a piece of work is a man!’ and extolling his virtues, suggeststhat he either knew or knew of the Asclepius or Pico’s Oration. The rest ofPico’s rhetorical display is aimed at stating the case for man as persuasivelyas possible. Ironically, the fact that he faced papal censure suggests that hewas successful.His basic argument, and one that no pope would ever agree with, is that man is agod who, as Colin Wilson puts it, ‘has forgotten his heritage and come to acceptthat he is a beggar’.44 [index_split_067.html#filepos462875] Pico was determinedthat we should remember our roots and reclaim our heritage. Central to hismessage is the idea that, unlike all other created beings, man has no fixednature, a notion that echoes Poimandres’ revelation to Hermes that man isdual-natured, equally of the earth and of the spirit, a revelation echoed in theAsclepius. ‘The Supreme Maker decrees,’ Pico tells us, that man ‘should have ashare in the particular endowment of every other creature … We have given you, OAdam, no visage proper to yourself.’45 [index_split_067.html#filepos463110]Nearly five hundred years later, this idea would be revived by an utterlyun-Hermetic thinker, the existential philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, who arguedthat man had existence but no essence (which is echoed in Sartre’s assertionthat there is a human condition but no human nature). Thus, for both Pico andSartre, man is protean, able to participate in all dimensions and spheres ofreality. (Needless to say, Pico draws rather different conclusions from thisinsight than Sartre.)For Pico, the microcosm really is the macrocosm, or at least has the potentialto be. ‘We have made you a creature neither of heaven nor of earth,’ the SupremeMaker tells man, ‘neither mortal nor immortal, in order than you may, as thefree and proud shaper of your own being, fashion yourself in the form you mayprefer’, a truly Hermetic proposition, and one the Church would findthreatening, as it had no room for ‘free and proud shapers’ of anything.46[index_split_067.html#filepos463306] Nevertheless, no longer fixed in hismedieval slot — long since freed by Petrarch — man can now make of himself whathe will. He can ‘descend to the lower, brutish forms of life’, or ‘rise again tothe superior orders whose life is divine’. The choice is his. ‘Whichever ofthese a man should cultivate, the same will bear fruit in him.’ This, we recall,is what Poimandres again told Hermes, and it is also the wisdom of the ancientChinese sage Mencius, who taught that ‘those who follow that part of themselveswhich is great are great men; those who follow that part which is little arelittle men’, suggesting that the essence of the prisca theologia can be found incultures having little or no physical contact between them.47[index_split_067.html#filepos463475]Pico’s Oration is a thrilling, inspiring work, and with the writings of HermesTrismegistus, Plato, the Kabbala, the Gospels, and the church fathers at hisdisposal, Pico believes he is in a good position to actualize these ideals. Hisconfidence in challenging the religious leaders of his time to a public debate,at the hoary age of twenty-four, argues in his favour, and I think it would bedifficult for anyone reading the Oration today to come away from it without anew sense of our potentials. Yet for some, this supreme self-confidence ismerely the hubris they contend is the most pervasive gift of the Renaissance,and which has resulted in the complete ‘humanization’ of the world, at theexpense of both the sacred and nature.48 [index_split_067.html#filepos463681] Itshould be admitted they have a good argument. Pico himself seems to have changedhis mind about man’s godlike potential, and put himself under the repressiveguidance of the anti-humanist Savonarola, who wanted to return to the MiddleAges, a disturbingly radical turnaround, which ultimately proved unsatisfactory.Yet, as Frances Yates writes, ‘the profound significance of Pico della Mirandolain the history of humanity can hardly be overestimated’.49[index_split_067.html#filepos464178] After him European man had the confidenceto act upon the world and to control his destiny through knowledge. Pico himselfmay have in the end rejected this, but it was something that no Savonarola couldtake back."},{"pageContent":"GIORDANO BRUNO — THE NOLAN One Renaissance Hermeticist who took Pico at his word was the philosopher andtheologian Giordano Bruno. In 1600, Bruno was burned at the stake at the handsof the Inquisition on the Campo de’ Fiori in Rome. Bruno’s auto da fe is usuallychalked up to his championing of the Copernican heliocentric solar systemagainst the reigning Ptolemaic geocentric one, which had been accepted by theChurch for ages, and which was shared, with one alteration, by the Hermeticists;for the Hermeticists, following the Egyptian system, the sun was just above themoon and not, as in the Ptolemaic, in the middle of the five other planets. Thispicture of Bruno, however, is not quite accurate. He was in fact an ‘acentrist’who believed in an infinite universe full of innumerable worlds — much like ourmodern conception — whose centre, as was said of God, ‘was everywhere and itscircumference nowhere’, a remark that is attributed to a variety of thinkers,ranging from Hermes Trismegistus and Empedocles to Nicholas of Cusa and therationalist Voltaire. Yet Bruno’s martyrdom was not to the godless, meaninglessuniverse of Big Bangs and black holes that emerged from the Copernicanrevolution, by which he would have been repelled. Bruno didn’t burn because hefavoured a cosmos reduced to mere energy and matter, drained of its spiritualcharacter. According to Frances Yates, Bruno took Pico’s challenge to reclaimour divine heritage so seriously — more seriously than the chastened Pico — thathe attempted to revive the ancient Egyptian religion that he believed was thesource of the Hermetic teachings. Bruno wished to break the repressive hold theChurch had over men and to resurrect in its place the pantheon of man’s earliestspiritual guides, the gods of ancient Egypt — with, admittedly, himself at itshead. It is for this, and not for his place in the standard histories of ‘thewarfare between science and religion’ that his ‘martyrdom’ should beremembered.50 [index_split_067.html#filepos464361]Giordano Bruno was born Filippo Bruno in 1548 in the southern town of Nola,which was then part of the Kingdom of Naples, in the foothills of MountVesuvius, an apt birthplace for this volatile personality. It was because of hisplace of birth that he later called himself ‘the Nolan’, and he took the nameGiordano from one of his tutors at the Augustinian monastery of San DomenicoMaggiore, when he entered the Dominican order at seventeen. We know little abouthis mother, but Bruno’s father was a soldier and it is tempting to anchorBruno’s own belligerent character in some paternal inheritance. He was educatedin Naples and it was while he was preparing to be ordained, which he was attwenty-four, that Bruno began to develop his remarkable powers of memory, aboutwhich he would later write several books. Pico, we’ve seen, also displayed aformidable memory, but Bruno’s apparently excelled even his. It was soastonishing that Bruno is said to have demonstrated his mnemonic abilitiesbefore Pope Pius V and the influential Cardinal Rebiba. Bruno later claimed thata book of his, since lost, On the Ark of Noah, was dedicated to the Pope. Inthose days dedications had to accepted by the dedicatee, and that Pius V agreedto it suggests he was impressed by Bruno’s gifts, a regard not shared by laterpontiffs.Like Ficino and Pico, Bruno was a man of the church, but his penchant forindependent thought and his appetite for proscribed books and knowledge soonbrought him into clashes with it. His turbulent and restless career can be seenas one long, wearying, and eventually futile battle against the authorities.It’s understandable that many regard Bruno as a hero of free thought, broughtdown by an ignorant, oppressive regime, but as France Yates makes clear, Brunowas no saint, and his pride, arrogance, and pugnacity often made him his ownworst enemy. In many ways he is reminiscent of his near contemporary Paracelsus,another aggressive Hermetic philosopher often at odds with the authorities, andwe remember that the word ‘bombastic’ derives from his middle name Bombastus.That the officials Bruno often found himself at odd with were also aggressive,strong-willed, dominant men makes a kind of ecclesiastical ‘clash of thetitans’, seem inevitable. Bruno’s first offence was to have thrown away imagesof the saints — he kept only a crucifix — and to have recommended a ‘dangerous’reading list to some unwary soul. More damaging was his defence of the Arianheresy, mentioned in Chapter 4, and his copy of Erasmus, the humanistphilosopher, who had been banned. These early black marks inaugurated a life ofcontention, and at twenty-four Bruno fled Naples, the Inquisition, and theChurch. In a time when the Church offered practically the only haven for men oflearning, to have stepped outside its bounds almost ensured a life of homelesswandering. Like other Renaissance magi — Paracelsus, whose prodigious travelsare legendary, again comes to mind — this is exactly what happened to Bruno. IfFicino was a sedentary stay-at-home, Bruno was an almost manic peripatetic.For the next thirteen years, until his arrest in Venice in 1592, Bruno movedfrom place to place across Europe, finding friends, but more often enemies, andbecause of his aggressive, paranoid character, often those who had began asfriends ended as enemies. He first went to the northern Italian port of Noli,then Savena, Turin, and Venice. In Padua, some fellow Dominicans urged him todon his habit again, an idea he seems to have adopted. He crossed the Alps intoFrance and in 1579 landed in Geneva, where he possibly joined the Calvinists. Heseemed to have changed his mind about his habit, and accepted a gift of‘civilian’ clothes from the Marchese de Vico of Naples, an Italian aristocratliving in Geneva who helped fellow countrymen. He attended the university, butafter attacking the work of one of his professors was arrested. As he would dooften from then on, he defended his actions, but prudence suggested he leaveGeneva, which he did.In Toulouse he earned a theology doctorate and lectured in philosophy; it seemshe also tried to return to the Church, but was denied. In 1581 he went to Paris,where he lectured and, as would become a frequent practice, again demonstratedhis powers of memory. He amazed his audience, although many believed hisabilities were rooted in black magic, a stigma that would haunt Bruno for therest of his career, and which had more than a degree of truth. Hisdemonstratiosn were so successful that he secured influential French patrons whoallowed him the time to write books about his theory of memory. In 1582 hepublished On the Shadow of Ideas, The Art of Memory, and Circes’ Song. Bruno wasnot the only thinker promoting a mnemonic system. Pierre de la Ramée, betterknown as Peter Ramus, who died in 1572 in the Protestant massacre of StBartholomew, developed a system, Ramism, which was basically a kind of learningby rote. Following his death, Ramus’ system became increasingly popular inProtestant countries, and its ‘logical’ approach is still applied today. As weshall see, Bruno’s system was something rather different.In 1583 Bruno travelled to England, as a guest of the French ambassador, armedwith letters of recommendation from Henry III of France, to whom Bruno dedicatedone of his books. There he befriended the poet Philip Sidney — who also receiveda dedication — and although there is no record of his meeting the magician andmathematician John Dee, Queen Elizabeth’s astrologer, Bruno moved in Dee’scircle and a meeting between the two sages would be likely. Bruno wasunsuccessful at obtaining a teaching position at Oxford, but he did lecturethere on the Copernican system. His unorthodox astronomical views, however,coupled with his belief in a coming Hermetic/Egyptian ‘new age’ — with himselfat its centre, in the same way that the sun was the centre of Copernicus’ system— caused controversy, as did the suspicion that he had plagiarised his ideasfrom Ficino. Bruno’s English stay was, however, productive. During this time hecompleted and published some of his most important works. In 1584 came The AshWednesday Supper; On Cause, Principle and Unity; On the Infinite Universe andWorlds; as well as The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast, in which he glorifiesthe ancient Egyptian-Hermetic religion, and in 1585 On Heroic Frenzies,something Bruno knew of personally, and which he believed could lead mankind tothe gods. Some of these works raised more than eyebrows and Bruno’s lack ofFicinian tact and basic social skills, as well as his overbearing character,meant that, predictably, some who had started out as champions soon foundthemselves regarded as foes. The possibility that Bruno was working as a spy,informing on clandestine Catholics to Queen Elizabeth’s ‘spymaster’, Sir FrancisWalsingham, could not have helped his reputation.51[index_split_067.html#filepos464641]"},{"pageContent":"MARTYR TO THE STARS After the French Embassy — where he was staying in London — was attacked byrioters, Bruno returned to Paris in 1585, but his 120 theses against Aristotleand his polemical pamphlets against the mathematical system of Fabrizio Mordenteagain sparked controversy. He moved on again, this time to Germany. Here he isbelieved to have started a kind of secret society of ‘Giordanistis’, dedicatedfollowers of his millenarian ideas, or at least had plans to. He taught brieflyat Wittemberg, then decided to try his luck with the Hermetic Holy RomanEmperor, Rudolf II of Prague. Rudolf II was a keen student of esotericknowledge, if a hopeless emperor, and he would play host to some famous Hermeticfigures, including John Dee and the alchemists Michael Maier and MichaelSendivogius. Rudolf II also hosted scientists such as Tycho Brahe and JohannesKepler, who combined astrology with the new discoveries in astronomy. Whether itwas strategic flattery or sincere belief, Bruno impressed on Rudolf II that hewas the ‘new Hermes Trismegistus’, and that his reign inuagurated a new age.52[index_split_067.html#filepos464894] Rudolf II, while a true believer andstudent of esoteric science, was often fickle, and while he could be generous,was equally parsiminous toward the scholars who knocked at his door. After a sixmonth stay during which he failed to obtain a teaching position, Bruno left,with a 300 taler gift from Rudolf. Helpful, but not the security he wanted.In Helmstedt Bruno was excommunicated by Lutherans, so he once more had to flee.Then, in 1591, at the Frankfurt Book Fair, fate began to close in. The patricianGiovanni Mocenigo invited him to Venice to tutor him in the art of memory.Around the same time, Bruno heard of a vacancy in the mathematics chair at theUniversity of Padua. Bruno had a prodigious memory, but he wondered if theInquisition had too, and bet on the possibility that they hadn’t. He didn’t getthe position in Padua, and so in 1592 Bruno returned to Venice. It was a mistakethat another Hermetic philosopher, the redoubtable Cagliostro, would make twocenturies later.53 [index_split_067.html#filepos465071] As had happened so oftenin the past, trouble started between Bruno and his benefactor, and Mocenigo,perhaps frightened by Bruno’s claims to semi-godhood, soon denounced him to theInquisition. Perhaps they had practised his mnemonic techniques; in any case,the Inquisitors had not forgotten about Bruno, and on 22 May he was arrested.The charges against him included blasphemy, heresy, magic, and preaching thebelief in a plurality of worlds. Bruno seems to have defended himself wellagainst his Venetian captors. He had magically prepared himself for theencounter with an array of talismans that were of an outright demonic nature —no gentle ‘natural magic’ for the volcanic Nolan. But word from Rome soon cameand in 1593 he was transferred to the Eternal City.Bruno remained in prison during his seven year trial. Although the chargesagainst him were complex, it’s unclear if promoting the Copernican system wasone of them. Heliocentrism wasn’t branded heretical until 1616 and even thenthis decision was overuled by more enlightened offices of the church.54[index_split_067.html#filepos465618] As Arthur Koestler makes clear in hisclassic history of astronomy The Sleepwalkers, the Church bent over backward toaccommodate Galileo, whose trial is seen as inaugurating the ‘warfare’ betweenscience and religion. Unfortunately, like Bruno, Galileo was another tactlessegotist who couldn’t back down from a battle, and he only saved himself fromBruno’s fate at the last minute. Yet preaching the belief in an infiniteuniverse full of innumerable worlds, which Bruno clearly did, was heretical.Most of the charges dealt with Bruno’s rejection of Christian dogma, but theones that concern us most are the accusations of practising magic. Bruno appearsto have accepted that he contradicted dogma and agreed to recant on the remarksthat expressed this. But he refused to recant on his belief in a plurality ofworlds and it was this that the equally wilful Cardinal Bellarmine, in charge ofthe proceedings, insisted on; Bellarmine would also lock horns with Galileo atthe beginning of his clash with the Church a decade and a half later. Brunoappealed to Pope Clement VIII, hoping that a partial recantation would besufficient and that the encouragingly named Pope would grant clemency. It wasnot to be. Clement VIII agreed with the guilty verdict. Deemed a heretic, Brunowas given over to the secular authorities and with a gag in his mouth to stophis ‘dangerous words’ — as well as his screams — the martyr to the stars met hisfate."},{"pageContent":"EGYPTIAN MEMORIES Bruno’s contribution to the Hermetic Renaissance is central, and for a fullaccount the reader can do no better than to to refer to Frances Yates’ classicwork, Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, on which I’ve drawnconsiderably for this chapter. But two aspects of Bruno’s philosophy stand out:his proposed Egyptian revival and his mastery of the art of memory. Again, Yateshas written at length on this ancient art, and the reader is referred to herbook The Art of Memory.55Known to the rhetoricians of antiquity and revived by Renaissance scholars,‘magical memory’, as Bruno’s mnemonic discipline is known, is a sine qua non ofthe true magus. One of the central themes in Bruno’s Hermeticism was thereflection of the universe in the mind of the magician, a theme we have alreadycome across more than once. In Book XI of the Corpus Hermeticum, the Divine Mindtells Hermes that: ‘Unless you make yourself equal to God, you cannot understandGod.’ ‘Like is not intelligible save to like,’ Hermes is told, and so theHermeticist is advised to: ‘Make yourself grow to a greatness beyond measure, bya bound free yourself from the body; raise yourself above all time, becomeEternity; then you will understand God’.Bruno’s way of accomplishing this was to engrave on his consciousness divineimages of the celestial archetypes — the seals of the stars, as he called them —in much the same way that Ficino had earlier used the imagination to fashionsymbols to attract the radiations of the anima mundi. As the title of his bookThe Shadow of Ideas suggests, Bruno saw these images as shadows or reflectionsof the Platonic archetypes. To furnish this inner universe — the microcosmhousing the macrocosm — he used a method familiar to classical orators. Romanrhetoricians would memorize a series of sites in an imaginary building and wouldattach to these ‘places’ images to remind them of the ‘talking points’ of theirspeech. As they gave the speech, they mentally ‘walked’ through the building,prompted by the memorized images. If we think of a virtual reality tour of anarchitectural site, or a trip through a castle in a video game, we have a fairidea of the process, except that the practitioners of the art used nothing buttheir own powers of imagination. As Yates points out, it is difficult for us toimagine a memory capable of the complex, vivid detail achieved by the ancientmnemotechnicians.Reviving this practice, Bruno adapted it to his magical projects. Taking thedivine images from the Hermetic books, and fashioning his own talismans, hefixed these in his imagination, thus furnishing his inner world with a blueprintof the universe. In the process he believed he acquired magical powers enablinghim to act upon the world.By thus reflecting the universe in his mind, Bruno became a co-creator with God,a theme that we encountered earlier in Ficino’s notion of the possibility ofHermetically ‘repairing’ parts of the fallen world. In doing this Brunofulfilled Pico’s injunction that man must embody the highest and greatest good,a privilege and responsibility vouchsafed to him alone. Bruno’s magical imageswere arranged in a mnemonic order with corresponding images of the natural world— plants, animals, minerals — and also with the sum of human knowledgesymbolized by the images of the great thinkers and sages. At the centre of thissystem stood the magician, above space and time, much as Petrarch stood abovethe medieval world below, and as the new Copernican sun stood as the focus ofits satellites — or one of them at least, as their elliptical orbits, soonrecognized by Johannes Kepler, required two foci. By reflecting within hisconsciousness the entire universe of nature and man, Bruno thus met the Hermeticchallenge of ‘becoming Aion’. It should be apparent that this ‘magical memory’shares many characteristics with the kind of experience had by R.M. Bucke,William James, and Ouspensky, discussed in Chapter 1.In practising this magical memory, Bruno hoped to break through the dense matterof the terrestrial world and return to his true stature as an agent of thedivine mind. This Hermetic ‘heresy’ — that man is not a mere creature butembodies the archetypal energies behind the world of appearances — is a radicaldevelopment of Ficino’s subtle astral magic, and of Pico’s own heaven-storming.It moves from manipulating natural forces toward actualizing the divine powersdormant within us. It was not exactly the sort of the thing the Church wouldencourage, and it didn’t.Bruno’s ‘Egyptian revival’, in which he hoped to bring back the ancient Hermeticreligion with its appreciation of man as magus, and which formed part of hiscontroversial Oxford lecture, was motivated by his deep antipathy to the imageof man promulgated by the Church. Bruno believed that the decline of the ancientEgyptian religion, lamented in the Asclepius, had actually been brought about bythe Church, and like Pico, Bruno believed it was his mission to awaken men totheir true place in the cosmos. He put his beliefs on the line in The Expulsionof the Triumphant Beast, in which he celebrates the magical Hermetic religion ofthe Egyptians. Throwing Ficinian caution to the wind, he proclaims that theancient beliefs will soon return, with him at their head, clearly the sort ofthing the Church could not ignore. Bruno’s Hermetic ‘reformation’ begins with acleansing of the zodiac by the divine Sophia, Isis, and Momus (the Greek god ofsatire), archetypal Hermetic powers. For him, not only man’s life on earth, butthe entire cosmos, must regain its magical heritage. Sadly, as we will see inthe next chapter, man’s vision of the universe was moving in an even moreradical direction. It is true that in The Ash Wednesday Supper, in which Bruno satirizes theacademic pendants who reject his Hermetic vision, he claims that the newCopernican heliocentric system is a sign that his Hermetic revival had begun. Itwasn’t, although in the next chapter we will see why Bruno would have thought itwas. As Nietzsche remarked, Copernicus unchained man from the centre of theuniverse, and ever since we have been rolling away toward some X, that is, someunknown.56 That Copernican universe is, however, much like the one Bruno saw inhis imagination, years before Galileo peered at it through his telescope.57 Fromthe terrifying ascent of a mountain — now part of the Tour de France cyclerace58 — Hermetic man had pushed his way to the stars. The Church however,ironically allied with its new rival science, would do its best to try to keephim down to earth.NOTES 1 [index_split_057.html#filepos364826]. There is some question about whetherPetrarch was the first to do this, or whether he actually made the ascent atall. Although subsequent historians have added to them, Lynn Thorndike’s‘Renaissance or Prenaissance?’ (Journal of the History of Ideas 4, No. 1,January 1943), presents the basic doubts. Others had of course climbed mountainsbefore Petrarch, but these ascents were motivated by practical reasons.Petrarch’s is unusual for being driven purely by curiosity.2 [index_split_057.html#filepos365656].

Ibid. p. 44. 9 [index_split_057.html#filepos373408]. Petrarch’s synchronicity seems double,in the sense that by definition, a synchronicity is an immediately apparentcorrespondence between an inner and an outer event. The outer event thatparalleled Petrarch’s inner one — the passage from Augustine — is itself aboutthe correspondence between the inner and outer world. Petrarch could have openedanother book and read something about mountains alone, and that would have beensynchronistic enough. But he read something about the relationship betweenmountains and the inner world, which was precisely the issue preoccupying him atthat moment. Petrarch, of course, did not have the benefit of the notion ofsynchronicity, which itself offers an answer to the issue troubling him, theconflict between the demands of his soul and the attraction of the outer world.In synchronicities we recognize directly that both worlds are one, or at leastthat the membrane separating them is permeable, which is an Hermetic insightitself. Also, Augustine’s rejection of the Hermetic notion that we can know God byobserving the cosmos, will soon be echoed by the new scientific consciousness,but for a different reason. For Augustine we should ignore the cosmos because contemplating it can leadour attention away from God. Science will tell us that it is pointless to lookfor God in the cosmos because He is not there. Hermeticism rejects both thesepositions.10 [index_split_057.html#filepos373656]. Copenhaver, p. xlvii.11 [index_split_057.html#filepos374359]. Petrarch, p. 46.12 [index_split_057.html#filepos375002].

The similarity may be nothing but coincidence, but it isstriking nonetheless, and there are other oddly Hermetic echoes.

(p. 40) Althoughinstantaneous mental travelling may not be an exclusively Hermetic motif, thesephrases do resonate with the kind of ideas presented in the Hermetic books. 13 [index_split_058.html#filepos376004].

Ficino himself died just short of his sixty-sixth birthday, which, for thattime, would have been considered old.37 [index_split_063.html#filepos409765].

In 1609 Galileo began experiments and observations with his telescope,developed from the earlier spyglass, which led to his book The Starry Messengerpublished in 1610. One of Galileo’s revolutionary observations — in more waysthan one — was of the moons of Jupiter. If, he asked, it was true that Jupiterhad moons, like the Earth’s, orbiting it, then it was possible that the Earthitself could orbit another body, the sun, which was what Copernicus had argued.Along with this remarkable discovery, Galileo was the first to gaze on stars andother celestial bodies, hitherto unseen. Before this, all men could work withwas the naked eye. Galileo had passed beyond this limit. Galileo’s discovery ledto the notion of a cosmos much larger than had been suspected, yet Bruno hadalready ‘discovered’ this years before, through an act of imagination, which hadpresented to him an infinite cosmos, sprinkled with innumerable worlds.58. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Ventoux"},{"pageContent":"6. HERMES IN THE UNDERWORLD Giordano Bruno’s execution marked a shift in the Church’s attitude toward HermesTrismegistus and his followers, but even before this, a strong anti-Hermeticstance was gaining ground within it. All throughout the sixteenth century, magicwas increasingly seen to be a threat, both to the Church’s authority, and to thesouls of its flock, and works like Cornelius Agrippa’s great compendium, OnOccult Philosophy, published in 1533, seemed to hearken back to the more‘demonic’ form of magic linked to the Picatrix and the Middle Ages. MarsilioFicino may have argued that his magic dealt purely with natural and cosmicforces, but why, many began to ask, did one need to turn to those forces at all,when Christ’s love and goodness should be sufficient? Pico may have declaredthat his magic sought out only the angels, but who could tell when an angel wasreally an angel, and not a demon or devil in disguise? Couldn’t some deviousspirit convince the magician that he was a messenger from God, when he wasreally a servant of the devil? Wasn’t it sheer hubris to think otherwise, as itwas to think of lowly man as some miracle? And what need had the Church of thesepagan beliefs anyway? Hadn’t Christ come to show men ‘the way and the life?’ Ifso, then what need have we of Plato or Hermes or any other pagan philosopher?Aren’t Christ’s teachings enough? Why seek out others, which can only lead toconfusion and set us off the one true path?These arguments, voiced by figures such as Giovanni Francesco Pico (Pico’snephew), the Protestants John Weir and Erastus, the Spanish Bishop Pedro García,the Jesuit Martín del Río, and others, were detailed and fine-tuned, but theiressence was simple and straightforward and boiled down to a basic belief. Magicwas evil, demonic, and misguided, and the Church had no need of it.It is difficult to argue against this kind of paranoia, which seems endemic tohuman psychology. Couldn’t those people really be communists or terrorists orwitches in disguise? How can you be sure? The Church alone was guarantor oftruth, and with Bruno’s example to point to, the danger entailed in pursuing theHermetic path seemed self-evident.Yet, although most of us would be surprised to know that the Church would haveever considered Hermes Trismegistus a ‘fellow traveller’, as mentioned, this hadbeen very much the case. The mosaic pavement at the entrance to the cathedral ofSiena, laid down in 1488 by Giovanni di Stefano, says this clearly.1[index_split_079.html#filepos559437] There, flanked by two Sibyls — ancientoracles who, like Hermes, were believed to have prophesized the coming of Christ— stood the thrice-great one. If this wasn’t enough to suggest the importanceHermes Trismegistus once had for the Church, the inscription tells us thatHermes was a contemporary of Moses, and a figure depicting the receiver of theTen Commandments seems almost to be bowing before the great Egyptian sage andmagician. Another figure stands behind that of Moses, and this may be, as somehave suggested, Asclepius or another Hermetic initiate, perhaps intent onhearing the conversation of these two ancient wise men. Hermes’ hand rests on atablet, on which is inscribed a passage from his Asclepius, in which, at leastaccording to the church father Lactantius, the thrice-great one is speaking ofthe glory of Christ to come.Although remarkable, the Siena Cathedral pavement isn’t the only Hermeticiconography associated with the Church. Perhaps even more surprising are thefrescoes in the Appartamento Borgia in the Vatican, painted for the ‘Hermetic’Pope Alexander VI by Bernardino di Betto, better known as Pinturicchio.Alexander VI, we remember, was the pope who cleared Pico of the charges againsthim, and he seems to have shown a real interest in Hermetic, pagan and Egyptianideas. Some of the frescoes seem to depict the career of Hermes. He’s shown asthe killer of many-eyed Argus (as Cicero recounted), then as the lawgiver to theEgyptians, then as teacher of Moses. Other Egyptian themes are prominent. Isisis shown sitting between Moses and Hermes, but perhaps most unusual are thescenes depicting the Apis bull, which was identified with Osiris and whichformed one half of the union of Osiris and Apis in the Alexandrian syncretic godSerapis (whose Serapeum, we recall from Chapter 3, was destroyed by thePatriarch Theophilus in 391). As Frances Yates points out, the bull was theemblem of the Borgia family, and in this series of pictures, the Borgia bullbecomes identified with the Apis bull.2 [index_split_079.html#filepos559621] AsApis was associated with Osiris, a sun god, the message seems to be that theBorgia pope is identifying himself with Egyptian sun-worship, perhaps even withthe pharaohs, who considered themselves gods.Yates suggests that Alexander VI agreed with Pico that magic and Kabbala couldbe important additions to Christian teachings, and one suspects that hadAlexander VI been pope when Bruno was promoting his own, admittedlymegalomaniacal version of a renewed Egyptian-Hermetic religion, he might nothave met with such a grim end. As Antoine Faivre remarks, ‘in the circles whereHermes passes, one can be sure that tolerance reigns’.3[index_split_079.html#filepos559803] Indeed, Princess EmanuelaKretzulesco-Quaranta, author of a study of Francesco Colonna’s late fifteenthcentury allegorical romance Hypnerotomachia Poliphili — made famous through thebestseller The Rule of Four — believes that Alexander VI wanted to turnChristendom into an Hermetic theocracy, not that different from the sort ofthing Bruno had in mind.4 [index_split_079.html#filepos559986] Unfortunately,Alexander VI was the ‘Borgia pope’ and is associated with all the decadence andinfamy linked to that family name. It was precisely against his nepotism andabuse that the fanatical Savonarola arose, and more than likely any associationof Hermeticism with ‘the most corrupt, ungodly and ambitious man who hadoccupied the throne’ was not to its benefit.5[index_split_079.html#filepos560244]As we’ve seen, Clement VIII didn’t share Alexander VI’s Hermetic tastes,although the Venetian scientist and Platonic philosopher Francesco Patrizi didtry to convince him to have Hermetic philosophy taught in Christian schools.6[index_split_079.html#filepos560509] Patrizi died in Rome in 1597, beforeBruno’s execution, and it’s unclear what his attitude toward Bruno might havebeen. He was, however, a critic of Aristotle, whose philosophy he believed wasat odds with church teaching, and he accepted, like many others, that Plato andother pagan philosophers had paved the way for Christ. This was a view put forthby the humanist Agostino Steuco in 1540, when he coined the term philosophiaperennis to account for the harmony he saw between the Church’s teachings andthe philosophers of antiquity. Patrizi’s and Steuco’s view, however, was anincreasingly minority one, and other forces were at work, which would drivebelievers in Hermes into a spiritual wilderness, not unlike the one the authorof the Asclepius envisioned in the dark days of Egypt. Yet one can’t helpwondering what the history of western thought would have been like if Patriziand others of a similar mind, like the scientist, alchemist, and Bishop of AireFrançois Foix de Candale, who argued that the Hermetic books should be madecanonical, had made their suggestions to more receptive ears.7[index_split_079.html#filepos560687]"},{"pageContent":"OH OH OH, IT’S MAGIC! Ironically, it was magic, or what seemed to be a version of it, that helpedwiden the rift in Christendom that would become the Protestant Reformation.Something that troubled many critics of Catholicism was the idea that priestshad some special relationship with God, or with the panoply of saints thatincreasingly resembled a pagan polytheism. One key issue was the ‘indulgences’that priests sold to the faithful. These were fundamentally bribes accepted bythe priests in return for assuring one’s own salvation, or that of a loved one.Whether the indulgences worked is doubtful, but the money went to rebuild thebasilica of St Peter in Rome, evidence, for Catholic critics, of a morestraightforward form of indulgence. For a certain sum, the priest would use his‘powers’ to make things right between you and the gods. If you paid enough now,you’d be assured of a good seat in heaven, or at least of a shorter time inPurgatory, an idea that was tabled at the Council of Florence that GemistosPlethon attended. The priests would, in essence, perform a spell and compel thesaints to work their magic, just as a student of the Picatrix would a demon.This disgusted people like Martin Luther, but the Church itself recognized therewas more than some truth in the accusation.One of the arguments against Ficino’s magic was that the Church already had itsown, and didn’t need his. As D.P. Walker points out, along with Hermes, Plato,and the Neoplatonists, one of the influences on Ficino’s magic was the Churchitself. It isn’t difficult to see the Catholic Mass as one of Ficino’s ‘naturalmagic’ workings, and Ficino, we know, was a priest. As Walker writes, theelements of the Mass, ‘music, words of consecration, incense, lights, wine, anda supreme magical effect — transubstantiation’, are remarkably similar to thesort of thing Ficino prescribed to his Saturnine patients.8[index_split_079.html#filepos560855] All the ingredients are there: symbols,correspondences, sensory effects, and, as in a magical ritual, if performedsuccessfully, the participant should feel a sense of renewal. That theincorporation of the body of the god — theophagy, or, put less graphically,communion — is an ancient magical practice is another link between the CatholicMass and pagan religions (see Sir James Frazer’s classic The Golden Bough, whichoffers many examples). If the Church was already performing its own magicalrituals it didn’t need competition from Ficino.Along with being against magic, Protestants also argued against bringing in any‘outside’ authorities to bolster Christianity’s stature. It was bad enough tohave deal with the hierarchy of the Church, but to drag Plato, Hermes, and whoknew who else into the picture only created more confusion and put moreintermediaries between the individual and God, which was exactly the opposite ofwhat the Protestants wanted. Even if Plato had sat at the foot of Hermes, all helearned was ‘bad’ Egyptian magic, and not the true religion, and Protestantsrejected outright the idea that Moses learned anything at all from theEgyptians. The Bible alone held the key to salvation, and nothing Plato oranyone else wrote or thought could add anything to it. The kind of Puritanismthe Protestants endorsed was essentially the same as the kind the Muslimorthodoxy raised against figures like Suhrawardi: if it isn’t in the Bible — orthe Koran — then why do we need it? The Protestants decided they didn’t, andfalling back on a tried and true method, they, like Theophilus of Alexandriabefore them, began to burn books. To give one example, during the reign ofEdward VI, the teenaged king and the first English ruler raised as a Protestant,the Anglican Church was remodelled as Protestant, and in 1550, during a visit bygovernment commissioners, huge bonfires were lit in Oxford, into which werethrown entire libraries."},{"pageContent":"HUMANIST, ALL TOO HUMANIST It seems understandable that the Church — both Catholic and Protestant — wouldtake issue with Hermeticism. After all, magic is in many ways a kind of‘speculative religion’ and the Catholics, who already had their own brand, andthe Protestants, who didn’t want any, would have no need of a rival. But theanti-Hermes movement wasn’t limited to the spiritual competition. Purelyacademic forces were gathering strength and they too were unhappy with theprestige of the thrice-great one. From their perspective it wasn’t so much themagical character of Hermeticism that troubled them, as its preoccupation withmetaphysical questions and a boorish lack of sophistication. The Church’santipathy to Hermetic philosophy was arguably rooted in its mission to savemen’s soul. But for the other anti-Hermes camp, their main objection was littlemore than a fastidious disdain for bad grammar.Humanism, we’ve seen, is linked to the Renaissance, but the kind of Humanismassociated with, say, Pico, is very different from the Humanism that found faultwith Pico’s celebration of Hermes and Plato. Pico’s Humanism is much more likethat of the poet William Blake, a student of the Hermetic sciences who seems toecho Pico when he writes, in ‘The Everlasting Gospel’, ‘Thou art a Man, God isno more/Thy own humanity learn to adore’. Blake wasn’t an atheist and his remarkthat ‘God is no more’ announces the rejection of the repressive Gnosticdemiurge, who in other poems Blake calls ‘Old Nobodaddy’. Blake’s Humanism ismuch more the ‘superhumanism’ I spoke of earlier in relation to Pico, with itscelebration of human imagination and creativity as supreme powers. This was notthe kind of Humanism that took issue with Hermes and which Blake would have seenas an expression of ‘single vision’, a kind of spiritual and intellectualmyopia. To understand that kind of Humanism, we need to backtrack a bit andvisit Petrarch once again.When he wasn’t climbing mountains, Petrarch devoted his time to a passionatestudy of the past, and to the Latin texts that had recently been recovered.Although he wasn’t alone in this, Petrarch can certainly serve as a convenientsymbol for the Humanism that found fault with Hermes. Petrarch, we remember,knew no Greek, and for his kind of Humanism, it was the Roman authors, and notthe Greek, that set the standard. We could almost say there were two differentkinds of Renaissance that appealed to two different aspects of humanconsciousness. The one that looked to Greek philosophy, the Neoplatonists andHermeticism was deeply interested in metaphysics and science; it was speculativeand inspired, and depended as much on intuition as it did learning, and sawthings in a ‘cosmic’ perspective. It was obsessed with the big questions, offate, destiny, and knowing God. The other Humanism, that looked to the Romanauthors, and is exemplified in Petrarch, was more focused on good form andrhetoric. It was urbane, sophisticated, and was concerned with ‘politelearning’. It kept itself in check, and ‘curbed its enthusiasm’. It wanted to‘get things right’. It did not, as Bruno and Pico did, ‘go over the top’. Itknew its limitations and stuck to them, and disdained the barbarous impetuosityof those who didn’t. The Romans created no philosophy, no science, and borrowedall they had from the Greeks. What they were good at was engineering, bothmechanical and social. They excelled at politics and law, that is, specificallyhuman pursuits. The idea of blasting off — even in the imagination — on ajourney into the cosmos would have struck the Roman literati as infinitelyadolescent, and this is how their Renaissance epigone felt as well. If Petrarchwas troubled by his ascent of Mont Ventoux, we can only imagine what he mighthave thought of Bruno’s infinite universe.With all consideration to the inadequacy of the idea, we might say that theGreek Renaissance was more ‘right brain’ while the Roman one was more ‘leftbrain’. One was concerned with plunging to the depths of things, the other withachieving a refined, dignified, and above all correct style. While Pico’soratory soared to cosmic heights, that of figures like Erasmus stayed distinctlydown to earth. This is clear in the academic curriculum that became associatedwith the two approaches. Urbane Humanism stuck to the trivium of grammar, logic,and rhetoric, while cosmic Humanism focussed on the quadrivium of arithmetic,music, geometry, and astronomy. (For what it’s worth, our word ‘trivial’,meaning unimportant, is linked to the Latin trivium.) For the cosmic or superHumanist, style is secondary to content, and he is willing, as Pico and Ficinowere, to refer to barbarous, uncouth (in the sense of having bad Latin) thinkersof the Middle Ages, if they can help him on his quest. For the‘all-too-humanist’ ( to steal a phrase from Nietzsche), style and form countabove all else, and the content is secondary. The poor Latin of the Middle Agesprevented them from taking anything written in it seriously. Here we can see apresage perhaps, of the famous ‘Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes’ that wouldcharacterize the early seventeenth century.In a sense, we could say that these two forms of Renaissance created an earlyversion of the ‘two cultures’ idea popularized in the late 1950s by thescientist and novelist C.P. Snow. When Bruno railed against the fools who failedto see the significance of his ideas, his favourite insult was to call them‘grammarian pedants’. Urbane Humanism can’t help but throw a wet towel on theaspirations of the mage. As Yates points out, ‘an atmosphere of unadulteratedhumanism is not one which is congenial to the Magus’.9[index_split_079.html#filepos561075] This would soon prove true. As time movedon, Humanism and religion would prove incompatible — Humanists are today behindthe ‘There is no God’ campaign, announced on bus hoardings — but initially thekind of Humanism associated with Erasmus posed no problem for the Church. BothErasmus and Petrarch were devout Christians, and they used their learning topromote the Church’s cause. Ironically, it was cosmic Humanism, which was deeplyreligious, that was seen as the Church’s enemy, and which today, in a variety offorms — the whole gamut of new spiritual movements — opposes the completesecularization of society."},{"pageContent":"MECHANICAL MARVELS It was not only at Hermeticists that urbane Humanists set their critical sights.They were also troubled by science, or at least by the rise of mathematics, thebed rock of science, and it was here that the ‘two cultures’ divide, mentionedabove, began. Earlier I mentioned that in Oxford in 1550, whole libraries wereput to the torch, a result of the Protestant rejection of Catholic magic.Included in the blaze were all works of metaphysics, but also those ofmathematics. Practically anything except the Bible was suspicious, but bookscontaining mathematical diagrams seemed especially so, as they were linked tothe dark arts. Even the notion of ‘calculation’ was associated with ‘conjuring’,and as John Aubrey, the seventeenth century antiquarian (and discoverer of the‘Aubrey holes’ at Stonehenge) remarked, Tudor authorities also ‘burnedMathematical books for Conjuring books’.10 [index_split_079.html#filepos561252]It is difficult to think of a Humanist as responsible for book burning, but asFrances Yates argues, Erasmus’ dislike of ‘dialectics, metaphysics, or naturalphilosophy’ led, by the strange twists of history, to the smoke and flamesrising above literary funeral pyres. ‘The humanist dislike of metaphysics andmathematical studies’ she writes, ‘had turned into Reformation hatred of thepast and fear of its magic.’11 [index_split_079.html#filepos561511] If there isan intelligence behind history, it certainly has a taste for irony.Another strange irony is that science, briefly in league with its enemy Humanistscholarship, would eventually undermine Hermeticism. Yet for a time, science wasa fellow traveller with Hermeticism, just as Hermeticism was considered a fellowtraveller with Christianity.One of the things that troubled St Augustine about Hermes Trismegistus, weremember, was those talking statues he spoke of in the Asclepius. That kind ofmagic was considered demonic and it was this perception of it that someone likeMarsilio Ficino had to overcome to have his ‘natural magic’ deemed acceptable.The link between magic and ‘mechanical marvels’ has a long history. Hero ofAlexandria was, as mentioned in Chapter 2, famous for his mechanical marvels,which included an aeolipile (a kind of steam powered rocket-like engine); avending machine; a ‘wind wheel’ (showing a first century AD concern for naturalenergy); and an entire mechanical play, devised for the theatre, includingartificial thunder, what we could call an early form of ‘special effects’. Otherinventors in Alexandria competed with Hero for acclaim (in The Rise and Fall ofAlexandria, Pollard and Reid have a fascinating chapter on Alexandrian automata)and it wouldn’t be surprising if some form of these mechanical marvels inspiredthe idea of the Egyptian talking statues. Later, Arab magicians and inventorsbecame equally interested with the link between magic and mechanics, afascination that fills the pages of The Arabian Nights, with its marvelloustales of automata: flying horses, humanoid robots, and living marionettes (atheme that would later obsess the German Romantic writer E.T.A. Hoffmann, whohad a deep interest in Hermetic ideas).Mechanics also played a great part in the Renaissance ‘pagan revival’, as seenin the many Renaissance ‘magical’ gardens filled with pagan and Hermetic imagesand allegories. One, the garden of the Villa d’Este in Tivoli, used techniquesdevised by Hero, which included bronze birds perched on artificial trees, which‘sang’ when water was pumped through them by a hydraulic device.12[index_split_079.html#filepos561688] Another, the Heidelberg castle and gardenof Frederick V of the Palatinate, designed by the architect Simon de Caus,included water organs and singing fountains, and was decorated in Hermeticfashion. Sadly, these were destroyed in 1620, at the start of the Thirty YearsWar.Hermeticists that followed Ficino, Pico, and Bruno, such as Athanasius Kircher,who we met in Chapter 2, were also fascinated by the magic of mechanics, as wasthe magician Cornelius Agrippa, who argued that a magician must have a secureknowledge of mathematics, as it is through this that he can perform what hecalled ‘real artificial magic’. As examples of this Agrippa cites the talkingstatues of the Asclepius and the moving statues of the mythical Greek wonderworker Daedalus. Number became an important tool in the magician’s workshop whenPico wedded Hermetic philosophy to Hebrew Kabbala. With its emphasis on themystical value of the Hebrew alphabet, the mastery of which, the Kabbalistbelieved, would reveal divine secrets, Kabbala was a means of ‘knowing the mindof God’, something scientists are still eager to do today. And as in the Hebrewalphabet letters have a numerical value, a system developed, called gematria, inwhich different ideas or names were seen to be related because of theirnumerical identity. (In essence, this was a version of the Hermetic theme ofcorrespondence.)Just as the Greek philosopher-mystic Pythagoras, a member of Ficino’s ‘Hermeticchain’, believed, Kabbala maintained that numbers have a qualitative character.Numbers like 1, 2, 3 and 4 have, for Kabbala, a metaphysical and not only anumerical meaning. For it numbers are not merely units in a series, but expressmetaphysical realities in themselves, an idea we’ve come across in Chapter 4,when we encountered the alchemist Maria Prophetessa and her enigmaticalaphorism: ‘One becomes two, two becomes three, and out of the third comes theone as the fourth.’ These are not merely integers, one following the next; theyare symbols of spiritual or ontological realities.But the understanding of number involved in the ‘real artificial magic’ Agrippaspoke of was moving much closer to the purely quantitative aspect of it that weassociate with modern mathematics and its application in science and technology.In order to perform ‘real artificial magic’, the magician had to abandon, or atleast temporarily put aside, the Kabbalistic kind of ‘mathematical magic’."},{"pageContent":"DR DEE One mathematical magician, versed both in mechanics and Kabbala, was theastrologer and inventor John Dee, like Bruno, a guest, for a time, of theHermetic emperor Rudolf II. Dee was more of an old school magician than one ofthe Ficinian type. Famously he and his scryer, Edward Kelly, made contact withseveral angels who spoke to Dee in a language he called Enochian. (HermesTrismegistus, we remember, is associated with this Biblical figure, who was adescendant of Adam and is the author of the apocryphal Book of Enoch.) Kellyspoke with the angels through a crystal ball, and for a time Dee was held inhigh esteem. He was Elizabeth I’s personal astrologer, although he eventuallyfell out of favour.Early in his career, while at Cambridge, Dee devised a mechanical flying scarab,as a special effect for a production of Aristophanes’ play Peace.13[index_split_079.html#filepos561906] The scarab, we know, was an importantsymbol for the Egyptians, representing the god Khephra, who was associated withthe rising sun and the resurrection of Ra after his journey through theunderworld. It’s not certain how Dee achieved his effect, but many thought blackmagic must have been involved, since, after all, he was using mathematics. Deewas not the last to combine science and magic. The fascination with mechanicalmarvels carried on into later centuries, and perhaps reached its high point inthe eighteenth century, with the Frenchman Jacques de Vaucanson’s flute-playingandroid and mechanical excreting duck, and the Austrian Wolfgang von Kempelen’scelebrated mechanical chess-playing Turk. One eighteenth century Hermeticist —although his modern followers would deny he was one — who was also a scientistand mechanical inventor was the Scandinavian Emanuel Swedenborg. In his earlyyears, Swedenborg, who would later talk to angels and visit heaven, hell, andthe planets, drew up plans for a flying carriage, an air gun, and a kind of DIYhome entertainment system, among other inventions.14[index_split_079.html#filepos562085]Dee’s mathematics, however, had a more serious aspect as well. According to hisbiographer Benjamin Woolley, Dee’s Propaedeumata Aphoristica, published in 1568,anticipated in several ways Isaac Newton’s epoch-making Principia Mathematica,and Dee also argued for the counterintuitive fact that bodies of unequal massnevertheless fall at the same speed. (The ‘discovery’ of this is usuallyattributed to Galileo, who, at least according to his first biographer VincenzoViviani, dropped two cannon balls of unequal mass from the top of the tower ofPisa, to disprove Aristotle’s theory that weights of unequal mass would fall atunequal speeds.) Dee also devoted a great deal of thought to the question of thetides, as did Galileo, and seems to have had some intuition of Newton’s insightinto gravity.15 [index_split_079.html#filepos562408] And like Newton andGalileo, Dee was a keen astronomer.Yet Dee, who, like Giordano Bruno, is believed to have been in the employ of theElizabethan spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, was eventually accused of blackmagic and sorcery, and died in poverty and obscurity.16[index_split_079.html#filepos562592] It seems that any knowledge outside theChurch, whether scientific or Hermetic, was considered dangerous, andmathematical knowledge, whether employed in mechanical calculations or callingKabbalistic angels, was doubly so."},{"pageContent":"HERE COMES THE SUN Perhaps the most surprising link between magic and mathematics can be found inwhat must be the single most important shift in human consciousness marking thebeginning of the modern age: the Copernican heliocentric solar system. LikeGalileo, Copernicus is usually depicted as a heroic pursuer of truth, anintrepid investigator, fearlessly following his insights to their end. In fact,Copernicus appears to have been a rather timid and pedantic scholar, who changedthe way we looked at the universe in spite of himself. As one writer remarked,Copernicus ‘was the type that Freud would label an anal erotic, meaning afusser’.17 [index_split_079.html#filepos562838] It wasn’t a sudden inspirationthat led to his new theory, but a nagging obsession with a minor problem in thereigning Ptolemaic system, with its confusing planetary epicycles, without whichCopernicus would have left it alone.18 [index_split_079.html#filepos563081] Asit was, Copernicus still kept a great deal of Ptolemy in his new system anyway,and even added to the number of epicycles. It was only at the end of his lifethat Copernicus agreed to publish his ground-breaking book On The Revolutions ofthe Heavenly Spheres (1543). Although he had written it decades earlier, hefamously held the first copy in his hands on his deathbed. Friends had urged himto publish it for years, but Copernicus demurred, most likely because of fear ofridicule and a disinclination to be the centre of attention. He also proved tobe a less than magnanimous individual. In the preface to the work, Copernicusfails to mention his friend and devoted follower, Rheticus (Georg von Lauchen),who had painstakingly copied out the manuscript after writing about the theory —without, following Copernicus’s demand, mentioning its author — in what hecalled the First Account. Rheticus, who had energetically promoted Copernicus’work among scholars and aroused more interest in it than Copernicus ever did,was left out of the picture when Copernicus’ achievement became well known.19[index_split_079.html#filepos563837]In the last chapter I mentioned that, while in Oxford, Bruno lectured onCopernicus’ theory, and presented it in the context of his own mission toresuscitate ancient Egyptian sun worship. One might think that this was a caseof one genius hijacking the work of another, and this, I gather, is what thedons at Oxford thought, although they more than likely didn’t consider Bruno agenius. Yet, as Frances Yates makes clear, Copernicus was himself soaked in theHermetic ideas that fuelled Bruno’s vision.The sun plays a central role in the Hermetic cosmology. In the Asclepius Hermesspeaks of the sun’s ‘divinity and holiness’ and tells Asclepius that he shouldthink of it as a ‘second god’. In Book XVI of the Corpus Hermeticum the sun iscalled ‘the craftsman’, Plato’s name for the demiurge in the Timaeus, and itsimportance is made clear in other Hermetic books. The sun’s work, Asclepiustells King Ammon in Book XVI, is to bind heaven and earth, by sending ‘essence’down to earth, and raising matter up to itself. Giving freely of its divinelight, its fructifying energies reach from above to below, from the clear skiesto the profound depths. The sun also had an important role in Ficino’s naturalmagic, being a conduit for the energies of the anima mundi.In introducing his work, two previous thinkers that Copernicus enlists in givingsupport to his theory are members of the Hermetic Chain of Ficino’s priscatheologia. Pythagoras, who learned the prisca theologia from Aglaophemus (anOrphic initiate), believed that the sun and the planets circled around what hecalled a ‘central fire’, and Philolaus, one of Pythagoras’ followers, and ateacher of Plato, agreed. But more to the point, Copernicus refers directly tothe Asclepius, and its appreciation of the sun as a ‘visible god’. Copernicus,of course, didn’t arrive at his new system through magic, yet the fact that inthe Hermetic cosmology the sun occupies a different position than it does inPtolemy’s, as mentioned in the last chapter, combined with the importance Hermesgives it, would have certainly been an influence on Copernicus’ thinking.Copernicus was well versed in the Hermetic literature, and as Yates put it, hisdiscovery ‘came out with the blessing of Hermes Trismegistus upon its head’.20[index_split_079.html#filepos564019] Yet its protracted pregnancy and longlabour — Copernicus began the book in 1507 and finished it in 1530, but itdidn’t see print for another thirteen years — leads one to wonder if it was morethan timidity and Copernicus’ retiring soul that compelled him to wait until theend of his life to make public his ideas. The anti-Hermes sentiment, we know,was on the rise, and, as we’ve seen from the career of Bruno, it wouldn’t be toolong before authors, and not only their books, would be burned."},{"pageContent":"MONSIEUR CASAUBON The mathematics behind Dr Dee’s flying scarab and Copernicus’ heavenlyrevolutions would, in less than a century, lead to a near complete devaluing ofHermeticism’s credibility. But the real hammer to hit the nails in HermesTrismegistus’ coffin — or sarcophagus — was the classical scholar andphilologist Isaac Casaubon.Born in Geneva in 1559 to French Huguenot parents, Casaubon, brilliant scholarthat he was, doesn’t strike one as a man responsible for a major shift in humanconsciousness, and in his own career, the part he played in bringing one aboutappears almost as an afterthought. Casaubon’s first lesson in Greek occurred ina cave in the Dauphiné in south-eastern France, following the St BartholomewMassacre in 1572 that killed Peter Ramus, Bruno’s rival memory theorist. Hidingfrom angry Catholics was a part of everyday life for Isaac, whose father was thehead of a Huguenot congregation, and until he was nineteen the only schooling hereceived was at home or on the run. In 1578 he was sent to the Academy of Genevawhere, after a few years, at only twenty-two, he succeeded his teacher, theCretan Francis Portius, as a professor of Greek. Casaubon was devoted to study.He spent all his money on books, and made copies of texts that were not yet inprint. He remained in Geneva until 1596, when he secured a position at theUniversity of Montpellier in France. His stay in Montpellier, however, was lesssuccessful than his time in Geneva, and after a few years Casaubon set himselfup as an independent editor of the classics.His star began to rise in 1600 when he was invited by Henry IV — Henry ofNavarre, whose marriage to the sister of Charles IX in 1572 sparked themassacres that had Isaac’s family hiding in caves — to come to Paris. There hebecame embroiled in the increasingly dangerous religious and political rowsbetween Catholics and Protestants. But through his readings of the churchfathers, Casaubon himself had arrived at an compromise position, a ‘middle way’that occupied the demilitarized zone between Calvinism and Ultramontanism, thezealous belief that the pope was the absolute ruler and final arbiter of theChristian faith. Yet the partisans on either side saw this as merelyfence-sitting, and each vied with the other to secure his full support. By 1610,Casaubon had enjoyed a pension from the king for many years, and had beenappointed the head of his library, and he was generally regarded as the mostlearned man in Europe. But when Henry IV was assassinated on 14 May 1610, byFrançois Ravaillac, a Catholic fanatic, Isaac knew his position was shaky. HenryIV himself had converted from Calvinism to Catholicism in order to accept thethrone in 1589. His Edict of Nantes of 1598 secured religious freedom forProtestants, and although it ended the religious civil war ravaging France, theCatholic powers were never happy with it. With Henry IV’s murder, theUltramontane party had shifted into power and Casaubon realized he would have tomove on.He had met and befriended Henry Wotton, the English diplomat and poet, yearsbefore in Geneva. In October 1610 Casaubon travelled to London with Wotton’sbrother, Edward, Baron of Marley, the English ambassador, having accepted aninvitation from the Archbishop of Canterbury to come to England. Casaubon’s‘middle way’ seemed a perfect fit with Anglicanism, and to have the most learnedman in Europe espousing the English path between two undesirable extremes seemeda good idea. Casaubon was received warmly by James I, and eventually he wascommissioned by the king to write a criticism of the Italian cardinal, churchhistorian and almost-pope Caesar Baronius’ vast Annales Ecclesiastici(1588–1607), a twelve volume history of the Church. It was while trawlingthrough this Counter Reformation response to Protestant attacks on Catholicismthat Casaubon’s philological expertise undermined the credibility of thethrice-great one, or at least of some of his most well known works.Baronius was no spin-doctor or propagandist for the Church. The nineteenthcentury British historian Lord Acton called his Annales the greatest churchhistory ever written, and he was known for his deep love of truth and personalhonesty. He’s said to have coined the term ‘Dark Ages’, and when discussing thecontroversy around Galileo, to have quipped that ‘the Bible tells us how to goto heaven, not how the heavens go’, suggesting that truth, and not dogma, wasimportant to him. But Baronius’ Greek was not exemplary, and neither was thetextual scholarship of the material he had to work with. Casaubon’s brief was toapply his own philological acuity to the learned cardinal’s great opus.It was while doing this that Casaubon discovered something. Baronius repeatedwhat the church father Lactantius had said about how Hermes Trismegistus, aswell as the Sibyls, had prophesized the coming of Christ. Casaubon’s urbaneHumanist instincts were alerted. Hermes Trismegistus was, he knew, supposed tobe the great sage behind Plato, yet Casaubon knew there was no mention of HermesTrismegistus, or the Sibyls, anywhere in Plato. There wasn’t any in Aristotleeither, or in any of the other great pagan thinkers who were supposed to havebeen the recipients of his wisdom. That was odd. You would think that if HermesTrismegistus was the fount of the knowledge that reached Plato via Aglaophemus,Pythagoras, and Philolaus, Plato would have mentioned him somewhere in all ofhis many writings. But he doesn’t. Not even once. The good cardinal wasn’tresponsible for this — he was, after all, only recounting what previous churchhistorians and chroniclers had said, and he had simply taken them at face value.But Casaubon couldn’t, his urbane Humanist integrity wouldn’t let him. He didn’tdeny that there most likely was a real Hermes Trismegistus, some time in the dimpast. But his philological instincts told Casaubon that however wise thisindividual was, he couldn’t have written the works attributed to him, andcertainly not the Corpus Hermeticum.Looking at these books closely, Casaubon came to the conclusion that they weremore likely Christian forgeries, pious frauds got up in the early days ofChristianity for perhaps good reasons, to anchor the Church’s authority in thewisdom of the ancients and to convince pagans that Christ was merely thefulfilment of what the earlier sages had only hinted at. But they were false allthe same. The Greek these texts were written in was not an early Greek, but aGreek of a later style, using a later vocabulary; it was not the Greek thatsomeone earlier than Plato would have used. It was the Greek of the first fewcenturies after the birth of the Saviour, the Greek, most likely, of RomanAlexandria. And the similarity between themes in the Corpus Hermeticum and Platowasn’t explained by the fact that Plato had learned from Hermes, but by the morelikely story that the authors of these forgeries borrowed Platonic ideas. Therewas nothing to suggest that the ‘wisdom’ in them originated in ancient Egypt.The Christian echoes were too clear for that. If we want to be specific, therewere traces of the Timaeus, St Paul, Genesis, and St John’s Gospel. There wereother traces too, but the idea was clear.Sometime around 100 AD in Alexandria, some enthusiastic Christians, hoping tobring pagans over to the true faith, concocted these forgeries, and to give themas powerful an authority as they could, they attributed them to a wise man ofthe past. Their readers most likely would not have had training in textualanalysis and so they were accepted as true. Then, with the collapse of Rome,they entered the maelstrom of the dark times, and when they were recovered, theenthusiastic Ficino — a great reader perhaps, but no true scholar, otherwise hewould have noticed the absence of Hermes in Plato — accepted them at face value.Having already been impressed by the Asclepius Ficino didn’t doubt these texts’authenticity, and until now, no real scholar has laid eyes on them. DidLactantius know they were fakes? Casaubon might have asked. Perhaps. A goodcause may require regrettable means. And the Asclepius? True, the Greek text waslost, but guilt by association is difficult to shed. Most likely it, too, wascut of the same cloth. Yet, these were not the only mistakes the good cardinal’shistory passed on, and the diligent Casaubon rolled up his ecclesiasticalsleeves and got back to work …Thus the glory of the thrice-great one was reduced to the stature of awell-meaning lie. It was not the most explosive transition from one view of thecosmos to another, but it was one just the same.Casaubon’s demolition job was housed in his detailed critique of a equallydetailed history of the Church and, although he was considered the most learnedman in Europe, it took some time before his revelations became widely known. Andwhen they did, they did not have an immediate effect. But it was only a matterof time. Yet Casaubon himself would not be aware of the results of hisphilological nitpicking. Baronius died after completing his Annales. Casaubondied after completing his critique of only the first half of the Annales’ firstvolume, which was published in 1614. His last years were not cheerful. James Iwas an increasingly unpopular king and because of his intimacy with him,Casaubon shared in this. Others around the king resented a Frenchman enjoyingEnglish privileges, and Casaubon was the recipient of a variety of insults,abuses, and even assaults. A malformation of his bladder plagued him, and heaggravated it by his tendency to overdo his studies. He was by contemporarystandards a workaholic and would have benefited by following some of Ficino’santi-Saturnine regimes. It was his desire to leave none of the cardinal’smistakes uncorrected that finally killed him — which does not speak well ofBaronius’ work — and he is buried in Westminster Abbey. His fame as a scholarexceeded his life and soon passed into the realm of myth. The dry as dustmythologist Mr. Casaubon in George Eliot’s Middlemarch (1874) is based on him,as is the scholar in Umberto Eco’s anti-Hermetic 1988 novel Foucault’s Pendulum.Curiously, 1614, the year of Casaubon’s death, saw the publication of what isconsidered another esoteric literary hoax, one that may have been linked to thenow discredited Hermetic works."},{"pageContent":"AFTER CASAUBON Although Casaubon’s criticisms discredited the idea that the Corpus Hermeticumwas written in primordial times, he may have inadvertently secured an even moreunassailable status for the thrice-great one. As Antoine Faivre remarked,Casaubon’s exposé may have helped to reinforce the belief in a hidden traditionwhich was now ‘all the more secret or primordial because one could no longerdate it’.21 [index_split_079.html#filepos564197] Of course, the value of aphilosophical or spiritual text isn’t anchored in its author or when it waswritten, but in its content, and by this standard — the only one by which theyshould be judged — the Corpus Hermeticum, the Asclepius and the other Hermeticaremain important works in the same way that the Gospels are important religioustexts regardless of when they were written. Yet by the time of Casaubon’sdating, the ‘quarrel between the ancients and the moderns’ was getting into fullswing, and the thinkers embodying the deficient mode of the mentalrationalconsciousness structure — inaugurated by Petrarch — were busy excising whatremained of the earlier animistic view of the cosmos from western consciousness.But although Casaubon’s dating clearly lowered Hermes Trismegistus’ cachet amongmany, indeed most scholars, it did not, as Yates suggests, mark his death. Ittook some time for the ripples of Casaubon’s work to reach beyond the readers ofchurch history, and even some of these were not entirely convinced of itssignificance. Ralph Cudworth and Henry More, the central figures among theCambridge Platonists, accepted Casaubon’s assessment of some, but not all, ofthe Corpus Hermeticum. Some of the treatises, they thought, could be Christianforgeries, but not all of them. And while Cudworth and More thought that Hermeshimself was no longer a viable figure, the idea of a prisca theologia rooted inEgyptian wisdom was still, they believed, of much value and could continuewithout the thrice-great one.22 [index_split_079.html#filepos564402] The greatEgyptian may have become a liability, they thought, but the philosophia perennisassociated with his name could get along without him.23[index_split_079.html#filepos564586]Another important figure to carry on the Hermetic tradition post-Casaubon wasthe sixteenth century Italian magician and philosopher Tommaso Campanella.Like Giordano Bruno, whose career his own parallels in many ways, Campanella wasa devotee of Ficino’s star magic and believed he was destined to lead amagical-religious reform that would inaugurate a new age of EgyptianHermeticism, something along the lines of the Hermetic Restoration following thedecline of Egypt predicted in the Asclepius. Unfortunately, when Campanellatried to put these ideas into political action, during a revolt againstSpanish-Habsburg rule in his native Calabria in 1598, the uprising was quicklycrushed and he was arrested. He was tortured and spent the next twenty-sevenyears in prison and Campanella only escaped Bruno’s fate by pretending to bemad, an example of the kind of survival skills Bruno lacked. This wasn’t thefirst time Campanella enjoyed the comforts of a Catholic cell. Like Bruno,Campanella had joined the Dominican order and like Bruno he soon found himselfrunning afoul of it. In 1593 he was arrested in Padua on charges of heresy,specifically for preaching the idea of a world soul, Ficino’s anima mundi. Afterbeing transferred to Rome in 1594 he was released in 1595, most likely becauseof a treatise he addressed to Pope Clement VIII, in which he portrayed him asmonarch of a vast universal religious and political union, transferring toClement VIII a destiny Campanella had envisioned for himself. He also supportedthe aims of the Spanish monarchy, a sign, Yates remarks, of Campanella’swillingness to say the right thing when necessary, an acceptance of realpolitikthat the older Bruno could have used. As his failed revolt suggests,Campanella’s advocacy of Spanish rule dissipated when it opened the door of hiscell. Years later, though, Campanella would radically change his views on Spain,and see it as a candidate for a universal Hermetic-Catholic empire.Toward the end of 1597, Campanella left Rome and headed to Naples. There he metwith astrologers who confirmed his view that the heavens portended great changeson Earth, specifically in the political and religious affairs of Europe. It wasthese signs that convinced him that it was time to put his Hermetic ideas intopractice. Campanella seems to have misread the stars; his revolt was a disasterand in 1599 he was back in prison, this time for a much longer stay.Although tortured, he put his confinement to good use and while in prisonCampanella wrote the work he is most known for, the utopian City of the Sun. Itwas first published in Germany in 1623, using a manuscript smuggled out by someof Campanella’s followers. Although traces of Plato’s Republic can be found init –as is the case with practically every western utopia — the central influenceon the City of the Sun seems to be the strange city of Adocentyn, mentioned inthe Picatrix. This is the city that Hermes Trismegistus is supposed to havebuilt in ‘the east of Egypt’ and in which he used magic to accomplish amazingthings. In Adocentyn Hermes’ magic could regulate the Nile, make himselfinvisible, animate statues to act as guardians of the city’s gates, raise amulti-coloured lighthouse — whose radiations would mimic those of the stars —and perhaps most spectacular, use talismans to make its citizens virtuous, aremedy for anti-social behaviour one could only wish worked. A similar magicalatmosphere inhabits Campanella’s solar city, one soaked through and through bythe power of the stars. Stellar magic is even responsible for a form of eugenicsthere. Only astrologically correct couples can mate, and only then when thestars are in the best position to ensure a beneficial issue. The city itself isdivided into seven sections, following the octave of the seven Hermetic planets,and in its centre is a vast temple, perfectly round, with a great domed ceilingcovered with symbols of the stars and their powers, a model of the macrocosm.Everything about Campanella’s city is arranged in order to achieve the mostbeneficial correspondence with the heavens, as if some Hermetic social plannerhad used Ficino’s On Making Your Life Agree With the Heavens as a blueprint. Thesocial order mirrored this as well, with a Sun Priest (most likely modelled onCampanella himself; like Bruno, he entertained messianic fantasies) as thesupreme ruler, a nod to the Copernican theory, of which Campanella was anadvocate. Along with the heavens, also worshipped were the great teachers andmagi, members of the prisca theologia. At the head of these was Christ, whoCampanella, like Pico, saw as a great magus.One difference between Campanella and Bruno was Campanella’s belief that themagical reform he envisioned could be carried out within the structure of theChurch. In fact, for him it was the natural place for it. For all his hereticalbeliefs, Campanella accepted the Catholic framework and was in the Picotradition that linked Hermetic magic with the powers of the angels. In 1628,after his release from prison, he even performed some Ficinian star magic forPope Urban VIII, who wanted to avoid the baleful emanations of an eclipse.24[index_split_079.html#filepos564799] Campanella suggested to Urban VIII that themagic he could perform for one person — it was successful; Urban VIII survivedthe eclipse — could, under the right conditions, be performed for an entirepeople, the sort of thing Hermes Trismegistus accomplished in Adocentyn. UrbanVIII was, like Alexander VI, a magical pope — at least he had a deep interest inastrology — and Campanella hoped he would adopt his reforms. Another powerbroker Campanella tried to interest in his ideas was Cardinal Richelieu. But itwas not until 1643, a year after Richelieu’s death, that France would see thereign of its own Sun King, Louis XIV."},{"pageContent":"THE GREAT FLUDD Campanella can be excused for continuing on in the Hermetic tradition in spiteof Casaubon’s debunking, as he was in prison when Casaubon’s work was published,and had little chance to read it. Even with reading privileges, one can hardlyimagine his jailers allowing him access to a Protestant critique of RomanCatholic history. But others knew of Casaubon and carried on in spite of him.One of these was Athanasius Kircher. Another was the philosopher Robert Fludd.According to his biographer, Fludd ‘lived at the very end of the era in which itwas possible for one mind to encompass the whole of learning’.25[index_split_079.html#filepos564977] A look at Fludd’s wide interests, whichencompassed medicine, mathematics, astrology, music, the art of war, divination,mechanics, and the art of memory, suggests this is no exaggeration. Fludd wasone of those embarrassingly prolific individuals who, for one reason or another,seem very rare in our time. His polymath abilities would have earned him a dozenmodern degrees. Like his contemporary Kircher, Fludd was a firm believer in theprisca theologia and in the ability of man, the microcosm, to house the cosmos,the macrocosm, and his own quest for knowledge suggests he took this notionliterally. This macrocosm/microcosm theme had a more than philosophicalapplication. Based on his Copernican vision of the heart as the sun and theblood as the planets, Fludd speculated on the cardiovascular system and arrivedat a correct picture of it earlier than his contemporary, William Harvey, who isusually accredited with establishing it.26 [index_split_079.html#filepos565218]Equally impressive are Fludd’s ideas for ‘mechanical marvels’. Patents forvariations on his ‘perpetual motion machine’, based on the work of Hero andArchimedes, were being taken out as late as the 1870s. As with John Dee, scienceand Hermeticism were equal partners in Fludd. His goal was to ‘summarize theknowledge of both the universe and man’, and in the pursuit of this Fludd wasnot going to let Casaubon’s’ philological fussing get in the way.27[index_split_079.html#filepos565668]Robert Fludd was born in Bearsted, Kent, in 1574, to a prestigious family. Hisfather was Sir Thomas Fludd, who was knighted by Elizabeth I for his services toEngland as war treasurer in the Netherlands. At seventeen Fludd entered StJohn’s College in Oxford. Although St John’s offered a wide range of studies,its focus was on theology, and Fludd did not escape this emphasis. According toJ.B. Craven, after his graduation in 1598, Fludd remained ‘a faithful andattached friend and member of the Church of England’.28[index_split_079.html#filepos565837] Like other Renaissance Hermeticists, Fluddwanted to find the common ground shared by the teachings of the Church and thoseof Hermes Trismegistus. One of his aims in later life would be to bring togetherthe creation myths voiced in Genesis and the Poimandres, a goal that hearkensback to the efforts of Pico della Mirandola.After graduating, Fludd spent several years travelling in Europe, journeyingthrough France, Spain, Italy, and Germany. It was during these journeys that hemost likely came upon the ideas of Paracelsus, the ‘northern Hermes’.Paracelsus, who died in 1562, had developed an alchemical system of ‘alternativehealth’. Based on understanding the inner workings of nature, the properties ofplants, and their use in medicines, it also included the influence of the stars,and, perhaps most important in the context of Hermeticism, the power of theimagination. Paracelsus called the imagination an ‘inner firmament’, a handy wayof referring to the Hermetic notion that the mind of man — the microcosm —contains the universe — the macrocosm. Through his contact with Paracelsianideas, Fludd developed an interest in alchemy and chemistry; the two had yet tosplit into separate pursuits. He also developed an interest in the occultsciences, in other words, Hermeticism and Kabbala. In Chapter 4, I spoke of thedifferences between the southern, Florentine Hermeticism, and its northernParacelsian brother. In Fludd, the two streams came together, and in many ways,the Hermeticism familiar to contemporary students, which combines alchemy andthe ‘cosmic’ vision of the Alexandrian Hermeticists, has its roots in Fludd’swork.After his travels Fludd returned to Oxford, where he entered Christ Church andworked toward degrees in medicine. Yet his growing mystical and occult intereststroubled his colleagues. Perhaps a memory of Bruno’s visit raised some eyebrows,but the fact that with Bruno and Paracelsus, Fludd seems to have shared a strongstreak of arrogance, can’t have helped. Bruno and Paracelsus found it difficultto suffer fools gladly. From most accounts it seems Fludd did too. One exampleof this was a dressing down he received from the college authorities over hisinsistence on the superiority of chemical medicines (drugs, an idea he absorbedfrom Paracelsus) over the remedies of Galen. Known as the ‘father of westernmedicine’, Galen was a Greek-Roman physician of the second century AD, whosetheories dominated medical thought for more than a millennium; in many ways hecould be seen as the Aristotle of medicine. Paracelsus infuriated the learneddoctors of his time by suggesting that they should abandon Galen and concentrateinstead on reading the book of nature, which contained the recipes for dozens ofcures. These were the chemical remedies Fludd championed, and just as Paracelsusdid, he caught flak for it. Paracelsus also angered his contemporaries by hisconcern for the poor and for treating them free of charge. Ficino didn’t accepta fee for his services either, and with the strong emphasis on imagination inboth thinkers, it seems clear that Paracelsus, the northern Hermes, wasinfluenced by his southern brothers.Fludd managed to steer through these difficulties, and by 1610 he had receivedhis degrees in medicine, and a license to practise. His combative characterdelayed his acceptance into the Fellowship of the College of Physicians ofLondon, but after two attempts he was received. He established a practice inLondon where by all accounts he was successful. Fludd maintained a laboratory,where he conducted alchemical and medical experiments. He also was able toemploy his own apothecary, rather like your local GP having a Boots to himself.But Fludd’s success wasn’t based solely on his academic studies. Like Ficino andParacelsus, Fludd seemed to have had a charismatic, ‘magnetic’ personality —‘magnetic’ in the way that another occult physician, the eighteenth centuryAustrian healer Anton Mesmer, would make popular. (The term ‘mesmerised’,meaning hypnotised, derives from him.) He seemed to exert a healing influence onhis patients, which suggests that Fludd may have been a natural healer. LikeFicino and Paracelsus, he also used astrology in his work, fine-tuning hisprescriptions to the specific needs of his patients, a ‘patient friendly’approach that had baffled Paracelsus’ contemporaries and no doubt Fludd’s aswell."},{"pageContent":"THE ROSY CROSS Amidst all this Fludd found time to write, and among his many interests one inparticular began to dominate his mind. Earlier I mentioned that in 1614, theyear that Casaubon delivered his bombshell, another esoteric literary ‘hoax’appeared on the scene. Whether the two are directly linked is unclear. But thefact that as one set of mystical writings were losing their grip on Europe’sintelligentsia, another dramatically arrived, begs the question of a connection.Elsewhere I have written at length about the mysterious RosicrucianBrotherhood.29 [index_split_079.html#filepos566085] Here I want to concentrateon its role as psychopomp, in leading Hermes Trismegistus and his followers intothe underworld. If Isaac Casaubon’s scholarly acumen led to the death of HermesTrismegistus, with the Rosicrucians, the Hermetic philosophy, which theyembodied in a new form, became a secret teaching. There had of course beenselect, élite groups dedicated to different mystical beliefs in the past.Pythagoras founded one, and perhaps the most well known ‘secret’ gatherings — ifwe can allow this oxymoron — were those associated with the Mysteries ofEleusis. But with the Rosicrucians we get, I believe, the first occult ‘secretsociety’ in the modern sense, because with them the occult — Hermetic philosophy— goes underground.Briefly, the Rosicrucian story is this. In 1614, in Cassel, Germany, a pamphletappeared announcing the existence of secret society, the Fraternity of the RosyCross. The pamphlet’s readers were invited to seek out the society and join itin its work. This was nothing less than the religious, scientific, social, andpolitical reformation of Europe, a reformation the pamphlet couched in obscureastrological and Hermetic language with clear anti-Catholic and anti-Habsburgtones. In the following two years more strange Rosicrucian pamphlets appeared,and soon a ‘Rosicrucian furore’ spread across the continent. Yet who theRosicrucians were exactly remained unclear, as every attempt to contact them metwith silence. The Rosicrucian brothers proved so covert that they were soonnicknamed ‘the Invisibles’. Because of this, many people began to believe thatthe whole thing was a hoax, and in the end, Johann Valentin Andreae, a Lutheranpastor and one of the authors of the Rosicrucian documents, admitted that atleast one of them, The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (1616), astrange alchemical text, was what he called a ludibrium, which translates as a‘serious joke’. As Andreae was a literary man, fascinated with the theatre, thismeant that the Rosicrucian documents were a kind of ‘play’ with a neverthelessserious intent.The Rosicrucians’ own story about who they were, however, was unambiguous. TheFama Fraternitas (‘The Fame of the Brotherhood’), the pamphlet announcing theirarrival, told the story of the brotherhood’s founder, Christian Rosenkreutz. Insearch of secret knowledge, Christian travelled in the east, where, among otherplaces, he reached the mysterious city of Damcar. In Chapter 4, I mentioned thatDamcar has been identified by some as Harran, the Hermetic city in ancientMesopotamia. After his travels, which took him to Arabia and Morocco, Christianreturned to Europe. Here he hoped to pass on the wisdom he had gathered tocongenial minds and to enlist them in his mission to spark a general reform ofChristendom. Unfortunately, he met only with derision, so in Germany, he decidedto build a temple to house his knowledge. Five years later he again set out totravel across Europe, but this time he was joined by a few followers. Eventuallythey separated, and these original Brothers of the Rosy Cross (Rosenkreutz means‘rose cross’ in German) went to different lands, in order to spread the word.Eventually, in 1484, Christian died — he was said to have been 106, having beenborn in 1378 — and knowledge of the brotherhood passed into myth. Yet, in 1604,a year signalled by heavenly events, such as the discovery of ‘new stars’ in theconstellations Serpentarius and Cygnus, the tomb of Christian Rosenkreutz wasdiscovered. (A supernova — an exploding star — was sighted in that year byJohannes Kepler, and it is called both Supernova 1604 and Kepler’s Supernova.)There, within a seven-sided vault illuminated by a kind of miniature sun, layChristian’s uncorrupted body. Geometrical figures covered the walls, and withinwere discovered works by Paracelsus, and a variety of mechanical marvels,including something the authors of the Fama called ‘artificial songs’. Alsowithin was a strange book containing Christian’s secret knowledge. For thetomb’s discoverers, this marked the renewal of Christian’s reforming mission,and so they travelled throughout the land, spreading word of the comingmomentous changes.Frances Yates suggests that the Rosicrucians may be linked to the sect ofGiordanisti that Bruno is believed to have founded in Germany, and there arealso possible ties with Tommaso Campanella. Some of Campanella’s followers weremembers of what the historian Christopher McIntosh calls the ‘Tubingen Circle’,which included Johann Valentin Andreae, and Andreae may have read the manuscriptof The City of The Sun they smuggled to Germany, where it was later published.30[index_split_079.html#filepos566292] Other possible sources for the brotherhoodare the Paracelsian groups that rose up after the northern Hermes’ death, suchas the Orden der Unzertrennlichen (Order of the Inseparables) and theFruchtbringende Gesellschaft (Fruit-Bringing Society), whose odd name forEnglish readers means ‘fructifying’ or ‘fruitful’.The origins of the Rosicrucians remain a mystery, but that needn’t detain ushere. What seems important is that by this time, the Hermetic science theypromoted, and through which they hoped to bring about the kind of reformation ofChristendom envisioned by both Bruno and Campanella, had gone underground.Ficino, Pico, Bruno, and Dee were very much out in the open about their Hermeticbeliefs. They talked to popes and queens about them. And we’ve seen how attemptswere made by many scholars to bring Hermetic ideas and Christian faith together.Now, following the Church’s rejection of Hermes, the Protestant attack on magic,and Casaubon’s Humanist debunking of the primordial status of the CorpusHermeticum, Hermetic science had to disguise itself. In fact, it had to becomeso covert that it actually turned ‘invisible’, as the Rosicrucians seem to havebeen. No longer is only the knowledge pursued by the Hermeticists ‘occult’,meaning ‘occluded’, that is unseen; now its proponents must be too. And as I’vesuggested elsewhere it is with this turn of events that modern occultismbegins.31 [index_split_079.html#filepos566542] Freemasonry, Swedenborgianism,Mesmerism, the occult revival of the nineteenth century, Theosophy,Anthroposophy, Gurdjieff, Jung, and the rest of the ‘alternative’ systems thatmake up the occult ‘counterculture’ of the west: all, in different ways, emergefrom the reservoir of ‘rejected knowledge’ formed by the ‘death’ of HermesTrismegistus. Yet Hermes’ tenure in the underworld, like that of the sun god Ra,may only be temporary, and may, as the name of one of the most famous Hermeticsocieties of the late nineteenth century had it, be heading toward a goldendawn.The central agent in this subterranean exodus wasn’t the Church, or itsProtestant reformers, or even the Humanists. They too, sooner or later, would,in different ways fall under siege by the power that was initially exertingpressure on Hermeticism. What was at work was a shift in human consciousness,and the visible sign of this was the rise of science."},{"pageContent":"MECHANICAL MONSTERS Robert Fludd’s first published work was a impassioned defence of theRosicrucians, who by this time had become the object of much calumny. TheApologia Compendiaria Fraternitatem de Rosea Cruce suspicionis et infamiaemaculis aspersam, veritatis quasi Fluctibus abluens et abstergens appeared in1616, and as its long title suggests, Fludd took defending the Rosicruciansseriously. There is a slight ‘serious joke’, however, in the title, as itsEnglish translation makes clear: A Compendious Apology for the Fraternity of theRosy Cross, pelted with the mire of suspicion and infamy, but now cleansed withthe waters of truth. As Fludd’s own name translates as de fluctibus in Latin,the ‘waters of truth’ here are Fludd’s own. This was the only facetious thingabout Fludd’s work. Fludd’s defence rested on his linking the Brotherhood to theprisca theologia, and he argues that the magic the fraternity employs is bothscientific and holy. In this statement alone it’s clear that Fludd is fighting awar on two fronts.In 1617 Fludd followed up his opening salvo with another Rosicrucian defence,the Tractatus Apologeticus, and his immense work, Utriusque Cosmi Historia — itsfull title is longer than that of his Apologia — also published in 1617, isprobably the most complete exposition of the philosophy of the macrocosm and themicrocosm — the above and the below — conceivable. It covers optics, music,mechanics, hydraulics, astrology, geomancy, and much more. Not surprisingly, itspages are filled with quotations from Ficino’s translations of the CorpusHermeticum. Fludd quotes Ficino so often that, as Yates suggests, he probablyknew him by heart. Yet oddly, Fludd dedicated this colossal text to James I, thesame king who provided Casaubon with the opportunity to undermine the authorityof the work on which, more than any other, Fludd’s own depended. As in the caseof Kircher, Fludd seems to be one of the last great dinosaurs, doggedly holdingon in an age no longer suited to his survival. His salutation of James I as ‘TerMaximus’, one of Hermes Trismegistus’ titles, thus linking the king to thefounder of the science he is trying to defend, seems, in hindsight, somewhatdesperate. This seems especially so when we recall that James I snubbed JohnDee, and that his own distaste of the occult materialized in a book,Demonologie, attacking witchcraft.But the real battle Fludd faced wasn’t with Casaubon, but with the Catholicmonk, theologian, philosopher, music theorist, and mathematician Marin Mersenne.Mersenne was born in 1588 in the province of Maine in France. He was educated bythe Jesuits and at the age of twenty-three he joined the Minim Friars, aCatholic religious order founded in Italy in the fifteenth century and noted forits devotion and humility. In 1620 Mersenne entered the convent of L’Annonciadein Paris, where he studied mathematics and music; one of his fellow studentsthere was the philosopher and mathematician René Descartes, with whom Mersennebecame friends, and Mersenne’s musical studies led him to being known as the‘father of acoustics’. Mersenne was what we would today call a ‘networker’,bringing together thinkers of like mind, and disseminating their ideas. Hecorresponded widely with a number of scientists and scholars, among them theDutch poet Constantijn Huygens, father of the astronomer Christian Huygens,accredited with the wave theory of light. Mersenne was also a devotee ofGalileo, and a friend of Galileo’s staunch defender, Pierre Gassendi. He alsoknew Campanella and at one point asked Descartes if he would like to meet him.Descartes declined.In 1623 Mersenne published a huge, unwieldy, and unclassifiable work,Quaestiones Celeberrimae in Genesim, a disjointed commentary on the Book ofGenesis. In essence, though, it really was a protracted polemic against theHermetic world view. Using the account of creation in Genesis, Mersenne launchedinto a bitter attack on magic, divination, Kabbala, pantheism, astral magic, theanima mundi, and perhaps most energetically, animism, the idea that the universewas a living, sentient being with whom man could communicate. As you mightexpect, the targets of Mersenne’s attack were the familiar followers of thethrice-great one. Ficino’s use of talismans and images, and his belief thatthrough these man could draw down forces from the stars, is presented as notonly against church doctrine — Mersenne’s critique is in the service of bothorthodox Catholicism and the new mechanical science — but insane.32[index_split_079.html#filepos566820] But Ficino is not alone. Pico’s belief inmagical Kabbala is also singled out, as is Agrippa’s own magic. Bruno andCampanella are not spared, nor are Hermetic apologists such as FrancescoPatrizi, and the recent Rosicrucian upstarts come in for it too. But the centralrecipient of Mersenne’s animus is the arch-Hermeticist and Rosicrucian defenderRobert Fludd.In Mersenne’s eyes, Fludd represents a dangerous attempt to turn back the clock,to revive or at least keep on life-support a view of man and the cosmos that isoutmoded, outworn, and out of touch with reality. If, as Joscelyn Godwin argues,Fludd wanted to promote a philosophy that ‘combines the practical examination ofnature with a spiritual view of the universe as an intelligent hierarchy ofbeings, which draws its wisdom from all possible sources, and which sees theproper end of man as the direct knowledge of God’, Mersenne wanted to show thatthis was a misguided project and a complete waste of time.33[index_split_079.html#filepos566998] Not only that, it was also a blasphemousimpediment to the growth of real knowledge, which, at this point, meant the kindof quantitative, mechanical knowledge associated with Galileo and laterDescartes. As Frances Yates writes, Mersenne was ‘actively combating Renaissanceanimism and magical conceptions in order to clear a way for the new times’,those new times being our own scientific, rationalist, decidedly un-magicalworld.34 [index_split_079.html#filepos567197] Mersenne was, in other words, oneof us. It’s no surprise that his friend Descartes would later argue that onlyman had an interior world — a soul — and that animals were merely a kind ofmachine, and that the world was moved not by an anima mundi, but by purelymechanical forces, thus introducing the debilitating mind-body divide that hasplagued us ever since. If Petrarch had one foot in the Middle Ages and the otherin the fledgling modern world, Mersenne has both feet firmly planted inmodernity."},{"pageContent":"GEBSER AGAIN Earlier in this chapter I wrote that, by the time of Casaubon’s bombshell ‘thethinkers embodying the deficient mode of the mentalrational consciousnessstructure — inaugurated by Petrarch — were busy excising what remained of theearlier animistic view of the cosmos from western consciousness’. Here let meexplain what I meant.By the time of Casaubon’s dating, and Mersenne’s attack on Fludd and the wholeHermetic tradition, the deficient mode of the mental-rational consciousnessstructure (introduced in Chapter 5) had, according to Jean Gebser, been dominantfor three centuries. As mentioned, in Gebser’s scheme, the mental-rationalstructure is the most distanced and separated from what he calls ‘origin’, ana-temporal, non-spatial, non-manifest reality not dissimilar to the Hermetic‘One, the All’. The previous consciousness structures, the archaic, magical, andmythic, all enjoy a greater participation in the world. The archaic structure ispractically identified with it, the magical experiences consciousness as unifiedwith its surroundings, and the mythic, as I remarked in Chapter 2, sees itsinner world reflected in the outer one. It is only with the rise of themental-rational structure that consciousness feels completely separated from thecosmos.This allows for greater freedom and individuation, and was absolutely necessaryfor the development of an independent, self-conscious ego, an ‘I’ able to thinkfor itself and to actualize free choice, something absent in the previousstructures. But it also gives rise to some problems. One is a sense of cosmicalienation. The mathematician, physicist, and religious thinker Blaise Pascalwas born in the same year that Mersenne published his anti-Hermetic polemic.Pascal was a prodigy, and at the age of twelve, he was sitting in on mathematicsdiscussions in Mersenne’s cell, along with thinkers such as Descartes. Pascalgrew up in the anti-animistic world that Mersenne’s work celebrated, and,regarding the vast, empty, oblivious universe we are all familiar with, he wouldwrite in his Pensées, ‘the eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifiesme’.It is true that the earlier Ptolemaic cosmos was a cosier place, with Earth atthe centre and the humming crystalline planetary spheres gracefully doing theirrounds. But Bruno’s infinite cosmos full of innumerable worlds was just asinfinite as the inanimate spaces that terrified Pascal. Yet Bruno wasn’tfrightened by them; indeed, he was eager to get to them. Likewise, although theHermeticists envisioned a cosmos similar to the Ptolemaic one, they also stroveto break out of it, to pierce the cosmic shell and enter a space ‘beyond heavenwhere there are no stars’. There’s nothing cosy about this. It is not simply theincreased size of the universe that troubles Pascal, but its silence. It isunaware of him, or of anyone else, and this is a problem that the unavoidablerise of the mental-rational structure precipitates. It provides us with a dead,inert universe, that is utterly oblivious of us, or of anything, and whichoriginated in an unfathomable explosion countless aeons ago. Bruno’s universe isjust as infinite, but it is a universe with which we can in some waycommunicate, or, as I would better put it, participate. The universe thatemerges from Mersenne’s anti-Hermetic attack — the universe, that is, that weall know — is one in which this is impossible, and in which any attempt to dothis is simply considered insane. I am not sure of the exact date when this sortof sensibility begins — Mersenne may be the one who starts it — but aninteresting study would be to find the point in western history when the beliefin being able to communicate with nature — the world — which is the essence ofanimism, is declared a sign of madness. Not black magic or demonism, butmadness, that is, in our modern sense of the term. Originally madness meant insome way being privy to the gods. This in itself is an interesting turnaround.Where before madness meant proximity to the gods, today talk of the gods is seenas a sign of madness.As Gebser and others, such as the spiritual scientist Rudolf Steiner, argue, therise of the mental-rational structure, its entering its deficient mode, and allthe developments that accompany this, were — are — unavoidable, and it would beeasy to agree with Mersenne and see Fludd and the whole course of modern‘underground’ Hermeticism as a futile attempt to stay within earlierconsciousness structures, in this case the magical and mythic.35 And it is true,I think, that in some cases, a turn toward the occult and magic is simply anattempt to avoid the ‘stranded’ feeling of modern consciousness by plunging intoearlier modes. But a look at the sophisticated systems that Fludd, Kircher,Ficino and others produced suggests that there is something more at work herethan an expression of cosmic nostalgia. As Joscelyn Godwin writes of Fludd, butwhich can be equally said of his fellow Hermeticists and Rosicrucians, he waspursuing the ‘possibility … of a cosmic view free alike from the myopia ofmaterialism and the absurdities of naïve spiritualism’. 36 In the openingchapter of this book, I remarked that the aim of gnosis was not to become simplyoverwhelmed by it, but to capture some of its insights so that they can betransformed into episteme, turning them into the kind of knowledge that can bepassed on to others. This, I think, is what Fludd and the other RenaissanceHermeticists were precisely about. To strive to be absorbed in the cosmos, toobliterate one’s individual, discrete, separated consciousness and melt into theinfinite buoyant waters would, I think, qualify as an attempt to slip back intoa previous consciousness structure. (This, in many ways, seems to be whathappens under the influence of psychedelic drugs.) But that is not what Fludd orthe other Hermeticists are doing. In this sense they are not ‘mystics’,although, to be sure, mysticism will be a charge made against them by more‘modern’ thinkers. They do not want to lose their individuality in the world,but to communicate with it, and you cannot communicate with the world if you arelost in it. As Glenn Alexander Magee writes, ‘salvation for the Hermeticistswas… through gnosis, through understanding’.37 You cannot have gnosis —knowledge, understanding — without a knower and a known, even if these twoultimately are in some way one.Magee is writing from the perspective of understanding one of western thought’sgreatest figures, the nineteenth century philosopher G.W.F. Hegel, in terms ofHermeticism. Hegel was one of the many minds in the west who were influenced bythe stream of Hermetic and esoteric thought that went underground following thework of Casaubon and Mersenne. Goethe, his great contemporary, was another, andthere were many more. A scholar somewhat earlier than Magee, the literary criticM.H. Abrams, also noted that Hegel had absorbed a great deal of Hermeticphilosophy. Like the Hermeticists, Hegel argued for the unity of being, but alsolike them he made knowledge and the struggle to achieve it the centre of histhought. Abrams noted that, for Hegel, and for the Romantic movement in whichAbrams sees him, ‘the overall course of things is envisioned as a circularmovement from unity into multiplicity, and, ultimately back to unity’.38 Yetthis unity isn’t simply given to us. What makes man ‘Man’ ‘is his aspirationtoward a harmony and integrity which is much higher than the unity he haslost’.39 The process of achieving this ‘higher unity’ seems to take adistinctive shape. It is, Abrams writes, an ‘ascending circle, or spiral’, and,as we are speaking Hermetically, one cannot but think of Hermes’ caduceus, withits spiralling snakes. Not simply a turn back to a former but outgrown unity —which would, in terms of Gebser’s scheme, mean a regression into a previousconsciousness structure — but a ‘return ahead’ into what Gebser calls the‘integral structure’, which unites and makes whole the previous four structures,and reinstates a ‘participatory’ consciousness, while retaining an independentego. Hegel himself said that ‘philosophy exhibits the appearance of a circlewhich closes with itself’, which seems another version of the HermeticOuroborus, the snake eternally returning into itself. Yet the oneness that itreturns to is somehow higher, somehow more, for the journey it has taken. As amore contemporary thinker puts it: ‘Deeper insight into the process of consciousevolution depends, to some extent, on having experienced the process ofalienation and learned how to transform it’.40 This is true for the individual,and I would suggest it is also true for a civilization as a whole.I offer these remarks as a suggestion that what Fludd and the others were doing,although it ultimately proved unsuccessful, was a kind of salvage operation,retaining the vestiges of the ancient wisdom, the prisca theologia, and unitingthem with the new knowledge emerging at the beginning of modern times. As Gebserargued, the previous consciousness structures do not simply disappear. Theyremain and are, in effect, ‘covered over’ by the new one, just asphysiologically our old ‘reptilian’ and animal brains were ‘covered over’ by ourdistinctly human cortex. And, as Gebser also argued, at the same time that adominant structure enters its deficient mode, the latent new structure begins toemerge. The new emerging structure, the integral, will, as mentioned earlier,integrate the four previous structures and will also achieve a new consciousrelationship with ‘origin’, with the ‘ever-present’ source of its being, unlikeour earlier ‘unconscious’ unity with it. This seems rather like the notion ofachieving a higher unity by following an ascending spiral. In its deficientmode, what was a credit in the earlier stages of a consciousness structure,begins to be a deficit, and what was an advantage becomes a liability. I thinkGebser was right in arguing that the kind of separation reached by themental-rational structure was a necessary stage in the development ofconsciousness. Although some might argue otherwise, I don’t think we weredestined to remain in the warm embrace of the early consciousness structures,and were only cast out into the cold daylight of reason because of some sin orcatastrophe. The kind of immediate, intuitive knowledge enjoyed by earlier formsof consciousness may be enviable, just as we may envy our children’s innocence.But none of seriously believes we would all be better off if we remainedchildren; certainly our own children would suffer if we did, for who then wouldcare for them? Whether we like it our not, we are obliged to grow up, and thismeans having an independent ego, able to face the cosmos on its own.We can even, I think, trace the shifts in the dominant consciousness structurethrough the different approaches to the Hermetic gnosis discussed in this book.The ancient Egyptians seem to have had an immediate, almost instinctualexperience of it. With the Alexandrian Hermeticists, we have areligious-spiritual practice aimed at triggering it: rituals, meditations, goinginto the desert, different techniques geared toward producing ecstatic states,which suggests these were not readily at hand. For the Renaissance Hermeticistsit becomes a complex magical-philosophical system, an intellectual enterpriserequiring arguments and proof. What it can be for ourselves remains to be seen,but by now, another four centuries on from both Casaubon and Mersenne, it istime to start thinking about the new consciousness structure which, according toGebser, we have already felt the presence of for at least the last century. Itmay be that what Hermes has to tell us can help bring it along.NOTES 1 [index_split_068.html#filepos470596]. Copenhaver, p. xxxii.2 [index_split_068.html#filepos472799].

HERMES RISING With the Rosicrucians the Hermetic tradition as we understand it today begins.With their appearance — or non-appearance — ideas and disciplines once discussedand practised openly moved to a shadowy realm on the margins of the mainstream,and aside from periodic ‘revivals’ — the most recent beginning in the 1960s —the once prestigious pursuit of ancient wisdom took on a somewhat furtive,almost criminal character.1 [index_split_087.html#filepos647745] The Church,traditionally seen as the enemy of the rising scientific enlightenment, has overthe centuries managed to withstand the buffetings the increasing dominance ofscientific rationalism has given it, and the two have more or less reached aworkable if not amiable détente. The same is not true of Hermeticism, nor of theother related esoteric disciplines.In a way this makes sense. The Church has a history of compartmentalizing thedemands of reason and of faith, and could accommodate the increase in scientificknowledge while affirming the sanctity of its own territories. Charles Darwin,who, perhaps more than anyone else, was responsible for dethroning humanity fromany privileged status in the cosmos, could, while telling us we were trouseredapes, remain a devout Christian.2 [index_split_087.html#filepos648003] But asHermeticism is precisely a way of knowledge, of gnosis, the new dispensation,characterised by Mersenne’s attack on the animism of Robert Fludd, had to wipeit out. Or, failing that, to cast such aspersions on it that no self-respectingthinker would give it the time of day, for fear of ridicule.Just as in many cases Christianity conquered by reducing the earlier gods of itsnew converts to the status of demons, the mental-rational consciousnessstructure, determined to sweep all before it in its ruthless deficient mode,began a policy of character assassination on the occult, esoteric, and Hermeticsciences. We, products of a unquestioned modernity, have been brought up withthe sense that the ‘occult’ is something disreputable, superstitious, and, in abroadly popular sense, ‘dangerous’, as the hundreds of ‘scary’ films aboutSatanists and ‘black magic’ attest. It is curious that in a time when mosthitherto ‘taboo’ subjects can now be discussed openly, we still can’t talk aboutthe occult in any objective, non-biased way. We encourage people to confess toand speak ‘frankly’ about sexual details and personal failings in a way thatwould scandalize an earlier age, and in our need for ‘transparency’ take anysign of reticence as an indication of ‘denial’. Yet any discussion of the occultin the popular media falls prey to what I call the ‘X-Files effect’. This meansthat, aside from sensationalistic treatments of it, the subject can never bediscussed without in some way suggesting that the people who concern themselveswith it are ‘odd’ or mentally ‘soft’, that any sane rational person willrecognize this immediately, and that in the end, only science can offer us anydependable knowledge of ourselves and our world.In saying this I am not trying to promote or ‘sell’ the occult. I am trying tosee if we can understand the way in which our culture has characterized it as anexpression of the need for a dominant consciousness structure to obliterate orat least radically minimize the value of a previous consciousness structure. Inorder to establish itself as the means of acquiring knowledge, the deficientmode of the mental-rational structure had to undermine any legitimacy that thenow outmoded Hermetic view might have retained. I should add that this was notsolely in order to usurp its position. Knowledge of the kind Mersenne celebratedcan be obtained only by regarding the world in the way he promotes, that is, asnon-animistic, in other words, as ‘dead’, a truth the Romantic poet WilliamWordsworth recognized in his poem ‘The Table Turned’, when he wrote that ‘wemurder to dissect’. It is only by divesting the world of its living characterthat we can gain the kind of knowledge about it that we associate with science.In order to grasp the laws of planetary motion we have to forfeit the idea thatthe angels move the stars. The fact that this kind of knowledge led to ourtechnological triumphs is generally regarded as evidence of its superiority.That the Mersenne view opened the way to undeniable advance practically goeswithout saying: more than one historian has pointed out that westerncivilization has advanced more in the last four hundred years than in theprevious four thousand. The point is not to deny the benefits that thisperspective produced, which are many and valuable, but to recognize thatsomething of equal value was lost in the process. That ‘something else’ is asimportant to our well being as the material benefits our technological advancehas created, although its absence is less immediately detected, and recognitionof this became the central theme linking the different ‘underground’ movementsthat resisted the complete rationalization of life. One source that thesemovements dipped into, in search of weapons or merely to revitalize their ownefforts, was Hermeticism.As I have written at length about the history of modern occultism andesotericism and its resistance to the complete ‘scientization’ of lifeelsewhere, it would be redundant to repeat this here, and a reader wishing tofollow this trajectory can continue it in my other books Politics and the Occultand The Dedalus Book of the Occult: A Dark Muse. In this last chapter I wouldlike to mention a few other ways in which the now rejected Hermetic view carriedon in the increasingly modern world."},{"pageContent":"MASONIC TRIALS In Chapter 4, I quoted Joscelyn Godwin’s remark that Freemasonry is the ‘mostlasting creation of the Hermetic tradition in the West’. Like much else in theHermetic and esoteric tradition, the roots of Freemasonry are, as the clichégoes, shrouded in mystery. In Chapter 4, I also mentioned that some historianstrace Freemasonry’s origins to the Knights Templar. Others, such as Thomas DeQuincey, the famous ‘English opium eater’, suggest that Freemasonry arose as anoffshoot of the Rosicrucians, and there is good reason to suspect that there isa link between Freemasonry and some of the practices associated with RenaissanceHermeticism. In 1583, James VI of Scotland (soon to become James I of England,enemy of witchcraft and friend of Isaac Casaubon) appointed William Schaw asmaster of works. Schaw was responsible for the organization of all thestonemasons’ lodges in Scotland, and he seems to have included an odd additionto the usual requirements for entry. Schaw made it a necessity for each newlodge applicant to be tested ‘in the art of memorie and the science thereof’.3[index_split_087.html#filepos648325] Was this ‘art of memorie’ the same as theone Bruno practised? Schaw could be referring to simple everyday memory, thekind needed to memorise rituals and passwords. But would one need to be ‘tested’in this, and would it be referred to as an ‘art?’ Robert Fludd, who, while not aRosicrucian himself was certainly a most vocal apologist for the Brotherhood,developed his own form of the art of memory, but this was after the ‘Rosicruciandiaspora’. This was the exodus from central Europe of various thinkersassociated with the Rosicrucians, following the defeat of Frederick V of thePalatinate at the hands of the Habsburgs at the Battle of White Mountain onNovember 8, 1620. So while there is clearly a link between the Rosicrucians andFreemasonry, it doesn’t account sufficiently for its origins, as William Schaw’s‘memory testing’ predates the Rosicrucian manifestoes.Others place Freemasonry’s beginnings even further back in history, intoprehistory, in fact. The Old Charges, a Masonic text dated to 1400 and found inwhat are known as the Cookes and Regius Manuscripts, claims that Freemasonrygoes back to antediluvian times. Its secrets were recovered after the Flood, andit is from them that Hermes Trismegistus and the sages who followed him gottheir wisdom. Probably the most accepted account of Freemasonry’s origins placesit in the tale of Hiram Abiff, master builder of Solomon’s Temple, who wasmurdered by three lower-grade masons when he refused to divulge the secret‘Mason’s word’. Yet according to at least one esoteric scholar, Manly P. Hall,Hiram Abiff himself is a kind of ‘code word’ for a ‘universal agent’, and is thefocus of the Hermetic Emerald Tablet.4 [index_split_087.html#filepos648652]Hall’s ‘universal agent’ is reasonably identifiable as the ‘universal soul orspirit’ that, as mentioned in Chapter 4, E. J. Holmyard argues is depicted inthe fabled Emerald Table, and while this clearly doesn’t confirm Hall’s claim,it at least suggests that it warrants some attention.In The Lost Keys of Freemasonry, Hall argues that there is a ‘definitecorrespondence between the Hiramic legend of Freemasonry and the Osiris myth asexpounded in the initiation rituals of the Egyptians’,5[index_split_087.html#filepos648907] a connection I mentioned in Chapter 2. Hallspeaks of a ‘remarkable scroll’ that provides ‘the almost undeniable evidencethat the Egyptian mysteries were the progenitors of modern Freemasonry’,6[index_split_087.html#filepos649082] and in support of this claim he enlists the‘early Masonic historians … Albert Mackey, Robert Freke Gould and Albert Pike’.Hall fails to provide the sources for his claims about the ‘remarkable scroll’,but he recounts a mysterious tale about the Emerald Tablet. He tells us that ‘avery ancient author’ — whose name, he admits, isn’t known — claims to have seenthe Emerald Tablet in Egypt. ‘Its characters,’ Halls writes, ‘were representedin bas-relief, not engraved.’ It was two thousand years old, and the emerald hadonce been in a ‘fluidic state like melted glass’, and then hardened through somealchemical process.7 [index_split_087.html#filepos649257] Hall further informsus that a ‘papyrus of the Book of the Dead definitely proves … that this strangedocument (presumed to be concerned solely with the destiny of the disembodiedspirit) was actually a dramatic ceremonial staged by living actors, presumablyin the recesses of the temples’, an idea we discussed in Chapter 2 in relationto Jeremy Naydler’s work.8 [index_split_087.html#filepos649432]Hall is less than forthcoming about his sources, so it’s not unreasonable for usto take his remarks with a grain of salt. Yet if we allow the possibility thatwhat he says has some foundation, it leads to some interesting speculations.Referring to the papyrus copy of the Book of the Dead, Hall calls it a‘mutilated fragment bearing witness of those arcane rites attendant upon theinstallation of the Initiate of the Osiris cult’, and that the identity of theOsiris and Hiram myths makes the Book of the Dead ‘the open sesame of symbolicMasonry …’ The essence of these rites centred around ‘the secret disciplines bywhich the reasonable nature [the mind, or nous] is emancipated from its bondagewithout the ministrations of decay’.9 [index_split_087.html#filepos649607] Inother words, they are the same as the injunction to ‘practise dying’ that, as wesaw in Chapter 2, Jeremy Naydler sees as the focus of ‘Egyptian shamanism’ andwhich also forms part of both Plato’s philosophy and Hermeticism. Like Naydler,Schwaller de Lubicz, and Athanasius Kircher, Hall believes there is more toEgyptian hieroglyphics than what the official account of them suggests, and hegoes further and argues that, since the rise of Christianity, there has been anorganized effort to obscure the true character of ancient Egypt. After theburning of the Serapeum by the Emperor Theodosius, Hall contends that ‘Christianscholars … inaugurated an elaborate program of archaeological reconstruction’,the result being a ‘ridiculous conglomeration of puerility which for severalhundred years was palmed off upon a comparatively illiterate world under thename of Egyptology’.10 [index_split_087.html#filepos649782] Hall in fact arguesthat there are two opposing schools of archaeology. One, composed of ‘strictlymaterialistic minded men … classifies but never attempts to interpret … or fittogether the fragments of old civilizations and cultures’. The other, to whichpeople like Schwaller de Lubicz and Kircher no doubt belong, are‘intuitionalists’ who ‘attempt to build some reasonable pattern out of thewreckage’. This distinction leads Hall to conclude that ‘in spite of all ourdiscussions, excavations and so forth, we are still for the most part ignorantof the real elements of Egyptian mythology’.Whether we accept Hall’s rendition or not there does seem to be a strongresonance between the trials and challenges one encounters in the underworld asdepicted in the Book of the Dead, and the initiation rituals associated withFreemasonry. If we accept, as Hall and Naydler argue, that the ritualsassociated with the Book of the Dead had a more than funerary function — wereindeed part of a ceremony in which the participant would ‘practise dying’ whilealive — then this connection seems strengthened. Other aspects of Freemasonry,such as the belief in a Supreme Being and the emphasis on moral and ethicalobligations — so rigorously tested in ancient Egypt by the feather of Ma’at —also suggest a connection. Although by now Freemasonry has accumulated a historyand mythology that would require an entire book to unravel, and which, for somereaders, might prove tedious, one delightful way of seeing the Egyptian (andhence Hermetic) character of Freemasonry is by attending a performance ofMozart’s Hermetic masterpiece, Die Zauberflöte, ‘The Magic Flute’. Along withHaydn and many other artists and thinkers of the late eighteenth century, Mozartwas a Mason, and in Die Zauberflöte, the trials and challenges facing theMasonic initiate are translated into a popular comic opera, a kind of musicalludibrium in which even the common man and woman are redeemed. As Goethe,thought to be a Mason himself, remarked about Die Zauberflöte, ‘It is enoughthat the crowd would find pleasure in seeing the spectacle; at the same time,its high significance will not escape the initiates’."},{"pageContent":"HERMETIC ROMANTICISM Mention of Goethe reminds us of the Hermetic character of much of Romanticism,which I briefly touched on in the last chapter. Goethe himself practised alchemyfor a time, and was a reader of the Corpus Hermeticum, as well as other esotericwritings. He was familiar with the work of Swedenborg, Jacob Boehme, Paracelsus,and the alchemist Thomas Vaughn, among other writers. Goethe’s interest inalchemy was not solely intellectual. As a young man he suffered a kind ofextended nervous breakdown, and he was cured from this condition by a ‘universalmedicine’ administered by a Dr Metz, who also advised that he read certainalchemical and Kabbalistic texts.11 [index_split_087.html#filepos649959] It wasafter this cure that Goethe set up an alchemical laboratory in his parents’attic and for a time tried to produce liquor silicum, a kind of alchemical glassthat dissolved when exposed to air. He was not very successful, but his interestin Hermetic ideas outlived his alchemical failures.The most obvious link between Goethe and Hermeticism is his classic occult dramaFaust, but Goethe was also deeply interested in the Rosicrucians, and hisunfinished poem Die Geheimnisse (‘The Mysteries’) is about the secretBrotherhood. Reading Johann Valentin Andreae’s Chymical Wedding of ChristianRosenkreutz, mentioned in the last chapter, inspired Goethe to write his ownHermetic fable or Märchen, The Fairy Tale of the Green Snake and the BeautifulLily. This in turn inspired Rudolf Steiner to develop his own form of Hermeticphilosophy, first under the auspices of theosophy, then later through his ownteaching, anthroposophy.12 [index_split_087.html#filepos650221]Steiner, who at the age of twenty-two was given the task of editing Goethe’sscientific writings, was also deeply influenced by the poet’s work on plantmorphology, The Metamorphosis of Plants. Here Goethe spoke of what he called‘active seeing’, a way of observing nature that saw it as living, developing,and purposeful, not as the ‘dead’ mechanism of Mersenne and Descartes. In natureGoethe recognized an animated whole that expressed itself in its innumerablecreations and their perpetual transformation, a perception that Ficino or Fluddwould have shared. ‘Active seeing’ is a way of participating with the thingobserved, and not, as the new scientific method proposed, of remaining‘detached’ and ‘objective’ toward it, which meant, in effect, to treat it as ifit were ‘dead’, with no reality other than that which could be weighed andmeasured. As Goethe practised ‘active seeing’, he discovered that he couldperceive what he called the Urpflanze, the archetypal plant from which allothers derived, a kind of Platonic ‘blueprint’ that, while not immediately‘visible’ to the untrained eye, can nevertheless be perceived through focussedattention to a plant throughout all its stages of development. The key here isthat the observer’s consciousness enters into a kind of union with the plant orother object of observation. For Goethe it also happened when he viewedStrasbourg Cathedral during its construction; he could, without seeing theplans, tell before it was finished how the completed structure would look.13[index_split_087.html#filepos650503] That is, through his imagination, Goethecould, when practising ‘active seeing’, enter into the inner being of whateverhe was observing, in the way that the philosopher Bergson argued ‘intuition’could. Here ‘imagination’ is not understood in the reductive sense of ‘unreal’but in the sense given it by Hermetic thinkers such as Ficino and Suhrawardi, asa means of entering the Hūrqalyā, the Imaginal World or anima mundi thatmediates between the world of pure abstraction (Plato’s Ideas) and physicalreality (in Goethe’s case, a plant or a cathedral). Another area in which Goetheapplied ‘active seeing’ was in optics, and in his Theory of Colour he famouslychallenged Newton’s discoveries about light, which he argued were obtainedthrough a kind of ‘torture’ of natural phenomena. (Like William Blake, who alsorailed against him, Goethe was unaware of Newton’s alchemical interests.)Goethe’s ‘active seeing’ and its concomitant recognition of a ‘living nature’was shared by the Naturphilosophie that developed in Germany in the last decadeof the eighteenth century. Represented by the philosophers F.J.W. Schelling,Franz von Baader, and others, it argued for a Nature as a living whole, which itbelieved was the visible aspect of Spirit — or, more Hermetically, Mind. Becauseof this union between Nature and Spirit, Naturphilosophie saw the world as anexpression of Spirit, and hence recognized it as a kind of text to be decodedthrough the principle of correspondence, which, as we saw in Chapter 2, is acentral theme of Hermeticism. As Antoine Faivre remarks, for Naturphilosophie,the world is full of ‘symbolic implications’ suggesting ‘invisible processes’,that correlate with human feelings; hence ‘knowledge of Nature and knowledge ofoneself go hand in hand’, clearly an Hermetic insight.14[index_split_087.html#filepos650811]Naturphilosophie influenced Hegel, whose Hermetic links were mentioned in thelast chapter, and it was also an influence on the philosopher Johann GottliebFichte, who, along with Goethe, was a strong influence on Rudolf Steiner. Again,against the new ‘scientific’ view of a dead, mechanical nature, and the oldreligious view of a lowly, corrupt one, Naturphilosophie proposed a vital,animated, and intelligent Nature, that it regarded and experienced holistically.A later thinker to share in this Hermetic perception of a living, intelligentuniverse was the nineteenth century psychologist Gustav Fechner, whose ideasinfluenced those of William James (see Chapter 1). Fechner did solid,fundamental work in experimental psychology, but he was also a visionary whobelieved that man stood in the centre of the cosmos, between the soul of Natureand that of the stars, which he saw as angels — a deeply Hermetic view.15[index_split_087.html#filepos650995] Henri Bergson (see Chapter 2) and AlfredNorth Whitehead, whose ‘process philosophy’ presents a living, growing universe,also shared the Hermetic notion of panpsychism, the belief that mind, ratherthan a product of material forces operating solely in human brains, pervades theuniverse. In more recent years the panpsychic idea has been proposed by thephilosopher of mind David Chalmers, and by now the notion of a living planet,James Lovelock’s Gaia, has become a part of our common culture.16[index_split_087.html#filepos651269]Another Romantic poet that shared Naturphilosophie’s Hermetic view of a livingcosmos and its belief in a unity between the spiritual and natural world wasFriedrich von Hardenberg, better known under his pen-name of Novalis. Novalis isperhaps the most openly Hermetic of the Romantics, in that his fragmentary workis full of the kind of aphoristic remarks that the scholar Jean-Pierre Mahéargues is of the essence of the Hermetic teaching.17[index_split_087.html#filepos651515] As Clement Salaman writes: ‘There arepassages in Hermes which may be read in a few seconds and yet contemplated forlife’.18 [index_split_087.html#filepos651809] The same can be said for much ofNovalis’ writings, which, like the Hermetic aphorisms, are meant to be ponderedand meditated on as aids to spiritual insight. As the Romantic movement saw ashift in occult practice from the meticulous observance of ritual and ceremonyto the power of the imagination, the figures of the poet or artist and the magebegan to merge, a metamorphosis I chart in A Dark Muse. Novalis recognizes thisin his Hermetic remark that: ‘The genuine poet is all-knowing — he is an actualworld in miniature’.19 [index_split_087.html#filepos651993] Thismicrocosmic/macrocosmic note is struck again when Novalis writes that: ‘We willcome to understand the world when we understand ourselves’; and again when hetells us that: ‘Man is a sun and his senses are planets’.20[index_split_087.html#filepos652265]"},{"pageContent":"BEES OF THE INVISIBLE Another of Novalis’ sayings leads us to a more modern Hermetic poet. ‘We dreamof journeys through the cosmos’, Novalis wrote, and added: ‘isn’t the cosmoswithin ourselves? The depths of the spirit we know not. Toward the Interior goesthe arcane way. In us, or nowhere, is the Eternal with its worlds, the past andfuture.’21 [index_split_087.html#filepos652441] With its echoes of Pico andBruno, this is a clear expression of the Hermetic idea that man must housewithin himself the entire universe. More than a century later, another poetwriting in German, the Austrian Rainer Maria Rilke, himself echoed Novalis. Inthe Seventh of his Duino Elegies, Rilke wrote that ‘Nowhere can the world existbut within’.22 [index_split_087.html#filepos652617] In response to what he sawas the ‘emptying’ of the world of significance through the rise of therationalistic reductive view, Rilke, like many other late-Romantic souls, turnedinward. The old symbols of meaning — whether religious or classical — were nolonger viable; as I’ve remarked elsewhere, ‘like exhausted batteries, they couldno longer hold a charge’.23 [index_split_087.html#filepos652918] So Rilkerecognized that his task — the task of the poet — was to save the visible, outerworld from complete meaninglessness, by taking it into his own soul. Themicrocosm would save the macrocosm, by sheltering it within itself.Rilke spelled out this idea in a remarkable letter to his Polish translatorWitold von Hulewicz. Not only were the once potent religious and spiritualsymbols no longer able to carry the force of the numinous, even the items ofeveryday life were now ersatz. Rilke speaks of ‘pseudo things’ and ‘Dummy-Life’coming from America — the increasingly disposable manufactured junk rolling offcountless production lines — and laments how, in the not too distant past, thearticles of everyday life still retained a kind of soul, an interiority. ‘Evenfor our grandparents,’ Rilke writes, ‘a “House”, a “Well”, a familiar tower,their very dress, their cloak, was infinitely more, infinitely more intimate…’24 [index_split_087.html#filepos653145] With that intimacy gone, it is up tothe poet, with his alchemical powers, to transmute the things of the earth intoa new kind of existence. Hence, Rilke advises that the Angel of the Elegies — asymbol of transfigured being — will not be impressed by any supernaturaldisplay, but that we should rather offer him some mundane item, a jug, a rope, abridge, provided it has been transfigured by our bringing it within.25[index_split_087.html#filepos653328] And what can this sheltering of things inour interior world mean but to transport them from the physical plane to that ofthe Imaginal World, to the soul of the Earth, where they will be protected fromfurther decay?It is through this process, Rilke told von Hulewicz, that we become what hecalled the ‘bees of the invisible’. In the Ninth Elegy Rilke asks: ‘Earth, isn’tthis what you want, to arise within us invisible? To be wholly invisiblesomeday?’26 [index_split_087.html#filepos653504] Rilke called the task ofaccomplishing this Herzwerk, ‘heart work’, and in his letter he spells it out indetail. ‘Our task,’ he writes, ‘is to stamp this provisional, perishing earthinto ourselves [my italics] so deeply, so painfully and passionately, that itsbeing may rise again, “invisibly,” in us. We are the Bees of the Invisible.’ Wedo not do this solely for ourselves, Rilke tells us, but as an effort on behalfof what he calls ‘the Whole’. ‘All the forms of the here and now,’ he told vonHulewicz, ‘are not merely to be used in a time-limited way, but, so far as wecan, instated within the superior significance in which we share …’27[index_split_087.html#filepos653673] That superior significance is not ‘aBeyond, whose shadow darkens the earth’, but a Whole into which transitorythings are ‘everywhere plunging’. Rilke’s Whole, like Gebser’s ‘origin’ strikesme as not too dissimilar to the Hermetic ‘One, the All’, and it may be worthnoting that Gebser began his explorations into the structures of consciousnessthrough a study of Rilke’s poetry.28 [index_split_087.html#filepos653850]If Rilke’s Herzwerk seems less triumphant than either Pico or Bruno’s challengeto ‘become the universe’, or even less Romantic than Novalis, this shouldn’t besurprising. Rilke was writing at a time when the deficient mode of themental-rational consciousness structure had reached a kind of peak (or, perhapsmore apt, a vale), and his call to ‘save the world’ understandably has, if notan air of desperation, at least an elegiac tone. Rilke was writing at the timeof ‘the decline of the West’, after the devastating catastrophe of the FirstWorld War, and in many ways his call to save the world is a salvage operation.Yet he gathers from it some remarkable prospects. Elsewhere I have commented onsome similarities between Rilke’s call to recreate the Earth ‘invisibly’ andsome ideas of Rudolf Steiner.29 [index_split_087.html#filepos654077] Having comeback to this theme, I now see more similarities. Rilke writes that the work ofconverting the ‘visible and tangible into the invisible vibration … of our ownnature … introduces new vibration-numbers into the vibration-spheres of theuniverse’, a thought that Pythagoras, one of the prisca theologia, would nothave argued with. Rilke goes on to say that: ‘since the various materials in thecosmos are only the results of different rates of vibration’ — an idea he sharedwith G.I. Gurdjieff 30 [index_split_087.html#filepos654976] — ‘we are preparingin this way, not only intensities of a spiritual kind, but — who knows? — newsubstances, metals, nebulae and stars.’31 [index_split_087.html#filepos655728]This is a remarkable reflection. By transforming the outer world into an innerinvisible one, Rilke is saying that we may indeed be creating new worlds, notonly interior ones, but ‘real’, physical, tangible ones. An astronomical analogymay make this clear. By drawing the things of the outer world into the ‘blackhole’ of our consciousness (which is invisible, as an astronomical black hole isbecause its gravity is so great that light cannot escape it), we may becreating, somewhere out in the universe, what some astronomers call a ‘whitegusher’, the other end of a black hole, a kind of cosmic geyser, out of whichall the matter sucked into a black hole emerges, but transformed into newmatter, Rilke’s ‘metals, nebulae and stars’. Rilke, in effect, is saying thatour mental acts, our consciousness, can create worlds, and this was an idea heshared with Steiner. One of the most baffling things Steiner said was that thefuture physical body of the Earth will be shaped by the thoughts of peopleliving today, just as the Earth of the past was formed by the thoughts ofearlier people (so the physical world we experience today — its clouds,mountains, lakes, and so on — has its roots, at least according to Steiner, inthe consciousness of people in the past).32 [index_split_087.html#filepos655917]In different ways, both Steiner and Rilke are saying the same thing: thatconsciousness, the mind, can create physical reality. This seems to take theHermetic view of man as a microcosm a step further: not only can we house thecosmos in our minds, we can actually use our minds to create it. If nothingelse, this puts a whole new meaning into the Hermetic notion that we are‘caretakers’ of the world."},{"pageContent":"ARTS OF MEMORY We may think the above speculations go a bit too far, but there are other,perhaps less radical ways in which we can understand the Hermetic idea of themicrocosm housing the macrocosm. One is through grasping the power of memory andits ability to transcend the present moment, giving us access to a wider rangeof reality than the immediate ‘here and now’. We know that the Art of Memory wasa central practice among Renaissance mages and that it was one of the tools theyused in order to embrace the cosmos. More recently the mind’s ability torecapture the past has been explored by the existential philosopher ColinWilson. In his book The Occult, Wilson introduced the notion of what he calls‘Faculty X’, the ability to grasp ‘the reality of other times and places’. InChapter 1, I gave an example of Faculty X that Wilson often cites, the novelistMarcel Proust tasting a madeleine, a kind of biscuit, dipped in tea, andsuddenly being transported to Combray, where he spent his childhood holidays.Proust was not simply reminded of this; he did not merely remember that as achild he spent the summer in Combray. Like the patient who suddenly‘re-experienced’ a past event, when his brain was accidentally stimulated by theneurosurgeon Wilder Penfield, for Proust it was as if he was suddenly thereagain. The experience was more than a ‘normal’ memory, which is generally atbest a pale reflection of a past event, and usually not more than the mereknowledge (in the non-gnosis sense) that it occurred. We can say that thedifference between the two would be like looking at a flat black and whitephotograph of some scenery and then suddenly finding yourself in it, in fullcolour and three dimensions, with all the sounds and smells.For Proust himself, the experience was almost mystical, and it gave him a senseof something in him that transcended time, in the same way that the aim ofPlato’s injunction to ‘practise dying’ was to bring about a sense of one’simmortality. ‘No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched mypalate,’ Proust writes, ‘than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intentupon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me. An exquisite pleasure hadinvaded my senses … And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferentto me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory [my italics] … I had ceasednow to feel mediocre, contingent, mortal.’33[index_split_087.html#filepos656173]Why did Proust no longer feel ‘mediocre, contingent, mortal’? Why was life’sbrevity now illusory? Because by tasting the madeleine Proust realized thatreality exceeded the limits of the present moment, the ‘here and now’ that he —and all of us — are trapped in most of the time. If someone was to simply remindhim that he spent his childhood holidays in Combray, he might feel a briefpleasure at the memory and breathe a sigh of nostalgia for times past. But the‘extraordinary thing’ happening to him had nothing to do with nostalgia, whichis a more or less melancholy reflection on the unavoidably fleeting character ofexperience. In fact, it was anti-nostalgic, because what it told Proust was thatthe past was still real, and that it could be grasped by the mind, which isexactly what Proust set out to do in his vast novel. He says as much when, aftertrying to revive the sensation again through sipping more tea and failing, hereflects that ‘the truth that I am seeking lies not in the cup but in myself’.The Combray of Proust’s youth exists, just as the entire life of WilderPenfield’s patient exists, in his mind.Wilson offers many other examples of Faculty X taken from literature. Anotherfavourite is from Hermann Hesse’s novel Steppenwolf. Harry Haller, Hesse’s hero,is a fifty year old intellectual who is so bored with his empty, uneventful lifethat he has decided to kill himself. On the way home to slit his throat, Hallerdecides to stop at a tavern and have a glass of wine. Then, as with Proust’smadeleine, something strange happens. Haller sips the wine and finds that: ‘Arefreshing laughter rose in me … It soared aloft like a soap bubble, reflectingthe whole world in miniature on its rainbow surface.’ Then a kind of past-lifeparade opens up to his inner eye. ‘In my brain,’ Haller tells us, ‘were stored athousand pictures.’ He reflects on these: an ancient, weathered wall, old,forgotten illuminated texts, poems long gone to oblivion, a solitary cypress ona forlorn hill, the movement of clouds at night above the Rhine. As these imagespass, Haller’s misery fades and he is surprised to find that he is happy. ‘Thegolden trail was blazed. I was reminded of the eternal, of Mozart and thestars.’34 [index_split_087.html#filepos656425]Like Proust, Haller’s experience gives him a sense of immortality. Again, if, inhis earlier suicidal mood, filled with grumblings about bourgeois civilization,someone had mentioned Mozart to him, he would have nodded and more than likelyreflected on how genius is destroyed by an uncaring world, and added one more tothe already many reasons he had to kill himself. But his sip of wine, likeProust’s madeleine, somehow triggered Faculty X, and now the fact of Mozart issuddenly real, just as the images of his past — the weathered wall, the cloudsabove the Rhine — are also real. And just as the reality of Combray makes Proustrecognize the illusion of life’s brevity — in other words, his own immortality —so too the reality of Mozart reminds Haller of the eternal. Clearly it is notsimply nostalgia for the past that makes Haller happy. Paradoxically, the past,at that moment at least, is no longer past. It, like himself, is timeless.Later, after spending a night with a dance hall girl, Haller has another FacultyX moment. ‘For moments together my heart stood still between delight and sorrowto find how rich was the gallery of my life, and how thronged the soul of thewretched Steppenwolf with high eternal stars and constellations.’ Again, thatrecognition of some part of him that transcends time.It should be apparent that what is involved in both examples is somethingsimilar to the distinction between gnosis and episteme discussed in Chapter 1.Both Proust and Hesse (Harry Haller is clearly an alter ego of his creator) knewabout their past. Neither the glass of wine nor the madeleine dipped in tea gavethem any new information about their past. What happens in both cases is thatthey both somehow ‘know’ the reality of the past — or of something objective,like Mozart — in a way that makes that knowledge real. Before they knew but nowthey really know. (Again, our language, which is not made to deal with thesedistinctions, breaks down.) They know in a way that the significance of thatknowledge is clear. We can say they know in 3D, as opposed to their ‘normal’ 2Dknowledge. Or we can simply say that they had a moment of gnosis. In sayingthis, we can see that Proust and Haller had an experience similar to Ouspenskywhen he confronted his ashtray, although, as they were not feeling the effectsof nitrous oxide, the sensation was not overwhelming. The reality of what theyalready know has hit them in so direct a way that it causes both to feelimmortal. It is not so much the content of that knowledge — which, I point outagain, they were already aware of — but the fact that they can now grasp itsreality vividly and vitally that effects the transformation.It should also be clear that the kind of memory Proust, Hesse, and Wilson areconcerned with is strongly linked to what Henry Corbin called the ImaginalWorld, which we met in Chapter 4. Again, the Imaginal World is not the world ofmake believe or of fantasy. It is an objective world perceived inwardly, withthe mind’s eye. Rilke’s ‘invisible’ interior world is a part of the ImaginalWorld, as is the kind of vivid awareness of ‘other times and places’ reachedthrough Faculty X. When Hesse’s Haller recalls the ‘thousand pictures’ stored inhis brain, and can recall vividly the clouds above the Rhine or an ancientweathered wall, he is no longer merely remembering these things in the usualway, but is, in a real sense, perceiving them again. They still exist, in hismind, and their images make up part of the Imaginal World."},{"pageContent":"BECOMING AION, AGAIN Now, along with showing us that our minds are all quite capable of housing theworld — as Bruno’s Art of Memory aimed at doing — Wilson’s Faculty X shows usthat we can also travel outside of the body, in the same way that the ancientEgyptians did when they practised releasing the ba from the constraints of thephysical form. While my physical body may be stuck in whatever ‘here and now’ itoccupies, mentally I can choose whatever ‘there and then’ I wish to visit. Aremarkable example of this can be found in the writer Christopher Isherwood’snovel The World in the Evening, published in 1954. Isherwood’s hero has had abad accident; both legs are in casts and he is forced to spend weeksrecuperating in bed. He is thus quite ‘fixed’ in a very specific ‘here and now’.He uses this time to reflect on the course of his life, and he has sufficientleisure to notice some odd things. There are, for instance, the curiousexperiences he has upon waking:> > Lying there, in the almost mindless calm of first waking, I felt as if I> > could remember everything I’d ever done or said or thought since I was a> > baby [my italics]. Only this wasn’t exactly remembering. Memory pieces> > things together gradually, making a chain; this was total instantaneous> > awareness. The thousands of bits of my life seemed to be scattered around> > me, like the furniture of the room, all simultaneously present. I wasn’t> > young; I wasn’t old; I wasn’t any particular age or any particular I …> > Consciousness lay there, anonymous, and looked at the accumulated clutter of> > half a lifetime.35 [index_split_087.html#filepos657210] What first strikes us is that Isherwood’s hero — the aptly named Stephen Monk —seems to be experiencing what Maurice Nicoll called ‘living at all points of thelife,’ which, as I remarked in Chapter 3, is a definition of the Hermetic notionof ‘becoming Aion’, of stepping outside of time. Lying in bed with two brokenlegs, Stephen can nevertheless rise above time and space, and see his life as awhole. This vision leads to a sense of optimism — Proust’s and Haller’s sense ofimmortality — and the determination to rectify the mistakes he has made and to‘do better’. Later in the novel, Stephen re-reads letters from his first wife,who has recently died, and this experience, too, provides some strange insights.As with his ‘becoming Aion’ experience, mornings, he finds, are the best time toread the letters, but even so, he discovers that he must first get ‘in the rightmood’. ‘Sometimes, ‘he says, ‘I’d lie quite still with my eyes closed for asmuch as half an hour, letting myself sink slowly into a state of reverie thatwas almost a trance’ [my italics]. This relaxation seems very similar to thestate Hermes Trismegistus is in before Poimandres appears to him, as we saw inChapter 1, and it is also very similar to the kind of trance states that JeremyNaydler argues were involved when the ancient Egyptian shamans ‘practiseddying’. What emerges from this meditative calm is another remarkable experienceof ‘time travel’:> > When Elizabeth [Stephen’s first wife] mentioned the Schwarzsee, I could> > literally smell the wet lilac-bushes; when she described our trip to> > Khalkis, I felt a sudden intense hunger for fried squid. Now and then, these> > sense-impressions were so vivid that I wondered if this wasn’t something> > more than memory; if I wasn’t, in some way, actually reliving the original> > event.36 [index_split_087.html#filepos657461] [My italics.] If this last line reminds us of the experience of Wilder Penfield’s patient, thenext is even more remarkable:> > That day we had lunch with Rose Macaulay in Carcassonne — did I merely> > remember a bright green snail crawling up the table-leg or was I noticing it> > now for the first time?37 [index_split_087.html#filepos657638] Stephen’s memories are so vivid, it seems, that he is actually picking outdetails that he hadn’t noticed before. But if he hadn’t noticed them, how couldhe ‘remember’ them? Of course this is a novel, so the events aren’t ‘real’, butthe idea is nevertheless startling. Like Wilder Penfield’s patient, Stephen is‘reliving’ a past event, but he is reliving it so intensely that he is able topay more attention to it than he did the first time. This suggests that he isdoing something more than, as it were, playing a video tape of the experience.He is either literally back in it, back there having lunch in Carcassonne, butnow noticing some things for the first time, or some part of him which he wasunaware of remembered more about the event than ‘he’ did, and is now giving upinformation that Stephen had but didn’t know he did."},{"pageContent":"THE CADUCEUS OF THE BRAIN In both cases of Stephen’s ‘time travel’ he is in a state of deep calm, almost atrance, and both occur just as he has woken up; he speaks of ‘the almostmindless calm of first waking’. Earlier I remarked that these sort of Faculty Xmemories seem to belong to Corbin’s Imaginal World. When Isherwood writes that:‘The thousand bits of my life seemed to be scattered around me, like thefurniture of the room’, the impression is that his hero is lying in bed and isin some way actually looking at the ‘bits’ of his life, that they areindependent, objective images, that are in some way ‘out there’ in the same wayas the furniture is. The notion of seeing clear, distinct, independent images asone is waking up is related to the phenomenon of hypnagogic imagery, whichoccurs during a brief, visionary state we all pass through as we fall asleep atnight and as we wake in the morning. It occurs in that twilit intermediary statebetween sleeping and waking, and in different ways, visionary thinkers such asSwedenborg, Rudolf Steiner, and Carl Jung, among others, have explored thisstrange in-between state of consciousness. Hypnagogic imagery, it strikes me,seems closely related to Corbin’s Imaginal World, and elsewhere I have shown howSwedenborg, Steiner, and Jung used it to take their own inner voyages.38[index_split_087.html#filepos657807] It should be pointed out that hypnagogicstates are not exclusively visual. They are often auditory and can be tactileand olfactory as well, and there is a good argument that they are related toprecognition, clairvoyance, synchronicities, and other ‘paranormal’ phenomena.39[index_split_087.html#filepos658152]The most exhaustive study of hypnagogic states is Hypnagogia by AndreasMavromatis, published in 1987, and I have written at length about Mavromatis’work in A Secret History of Consciousness. The simplest way to describehypnagogic states is to say they are a kind of dreaming while awake. Althoughclearly related, they should be distinguished from ‘lucid dreams’, which we candescribe as ‘waking while dreaming’.40 [index_split_087.html#filepos658880] Theyare most closely associated with the intermediary state between sleeping andwaking, but Mavromatis makes clear that hypnagogic states can be inducedvoluntarily, through conscious relaxation. The kind of relaxed states conduciveto hypnagogia are similar, if not practically identical to the kind JeremyNaydler associates with the ‘Egyptian shamans’ releasing the ba and with thestate Hermes Trismegistus was in when he encountered Poimandres, when his‘bodily senses were withdrawn as in sleep’. If both Hermes’ experience and thatof the Egyptian initiate take place in the Imaginal World, there is a goodargument that they entered it via hypnagogic states.Mavromatis argues that hypnagogia is linked to the sub-cortical structures ofthe brain, which are known collectively as the ‘old brain’. During hypnagogicstates, he suggests that the usually dominant neo-cortex — the evolutionarilyrecent and specifically ‘human’ part of the brain — is inhibited, and much olderstructures, such as the reticular brainstem core, hippocampus, medullaoblongata, and thalamus ‘take over’. Cortical brain activity is associated withclear, logical thought and the perception of a well-defined ‘external’ world.When such activity is inhibited during sleep or in states of deep relaxation,the older brain structures dominate. These structures are more attuned to innerexperience and to a ‘pre-logical’ form of thought that uses imagery, symbols,and analogy rather than language and clearly defined concepts. As noted earlier,this is the kind of thought Athanasius Kircher, René Schwaller de Lubicz, andothers associate with ancient Egypt and which Jean Gebser locates in the mythicconsciousness structure.In describing hypnagogic states as ‘dreaming while awake’, Mavromatis associatesthem with the Fourth State of Tantric Yoga, the ‘half-dream state’, in which allof the states of consciousness — waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep —‘intersect’. Curiously, he links this experiential ‘intersection’ with thephysical ‘intersection’ of the brain structures responsible for it. Thethalamus, which Mavromatis suggests is the centre of consciousness and theprobable source of hypnagogic phenomena, is anatomically linked to the‘reptilian brain’, limbic system, and the cerebral hemispheres, the three‘houses’ of the triune human brain (Chapter 1). (I will merely note theimportance of the ‘triune’ theme in relation to Hermes Trismegistus.) Each ofthe three brains, Mavromatis argues, has a consciousness and ‘logic’ of its own,and he suggests that the consciousness of one brain would appear rather strangeto another. What happens in hypnagogia is that the dominance of the cortex —what Schwaller de Lubicz called ‘cerebral consciousness’ — is inhibited, eitherthrough sleep or deep relaxation, allowing the consciousness of the other‘brains’ to emerge. As cortical consciousness ‘shuts off’ fairly quickly as wefall asleep — ‘falling asleep’ is cortical consciousness ‘shutting off’ — wepass into these other forms of consciousness without noticing them. This isbecause ‘we’, our conscious, observing egos, are associated with corticalconsciousness, and if ‘we’ are not there, there is no ‘one’ to observe them.Yet, if a minimal level of cortical arousal can be maintained, then the‘consciousness’ of the old brain can be observed. This is exactly what Tantricexercises concerned with the ‘Fourth State’ aim at, but it is also whatconsciously induced hypnagogic states try to achieve. It is also, if the readerwill allow me to repeat it once again, what is happening to Hermes Trismegistuswhen his ‘bodily senses’ are ‘withdrawn as in sleep’, and why he lateradmonishes Asclepius and his other students to be ‘entirely present’ and toattain a ‘godlike concentration of consciousness’. It is the combination of thetwo that produces the visionary state. As Mavromatis makes clear, in meditativestates the thalamus and other ‘old brain’ structures are active, while enoughattention is maintained to prevent the practitioner from falling asleep. The newbrain, as it were, ‘shuts down’ enough for the old brain to ‘turn on’, but stays‘on’ just enough to observe the old brain’s consciousness. We can say, then,that in hypnagogia, one brain ‘watches’ another.I should point out that Mavromatis sees the thalamus as important for anotherreason as well. This is because the pineal gland is located within it. Thefunction of this tiny organ is still something of a mystery. Famously, thephilosopher Descartes believed it was the physical ‘seat of the soul’, ahypothesis that earned Descartes some criticism. Yet modern neuroscience andancient wisdom suggests that Descartes may not have been far from the mark. Thepineal gland is very old, dating back as far as the Devonian and Silurianperiods, roughly from 450 to 350 million years ago. One of its earliestfunctions was as a kind of eye located in the top of the head of primitivereptiles. In some contemporary vertebrates, including humans, the pineal glandis still photosensitive, and in humans the early ‘pineal eye’ appears in theinitial stages of life. It soon disappears, but the associated gland remains,and it too is sensitive to light.In mammals, the pineal gland produces the amino acid melatonin, which isimportant in the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin. It is alsoinvolved in the maintenance of serotonin in the hypothalamus, and in thedistribution of other neurotransmitters to other parts of the brain. Melatoninis also linked to skin colour, and this function is associated with pinealgland’s sensitivity to light.One curious fact about melatonin is that an excess of light and stress tends toinhibit its production, and this in turn affects the size of the pineal gland,making it smaller. The opposite effect is achieved through darkness andrelaxation; these increase melatonin production and the pineal gland’s overallactivity. As anyone who has taken melatonin as a supplement knows, it can have arelaxing effect on the nervous system, and this suggests a kind of positivefeedback loop between melatonin production and the state most conducive to it.Relaxation increases melatonin production, which in turn produces deeperrelaxation, which results in more melatonin, and so on. This is some hardneurological evidence for the mystic’s appreciation of calm and darkness, andwhy the poets traditionally favour the night.It is also neurological evidence for the ancient Hindu idea of the ‘third eye’.The pineal gland is located exactly where this source of visionary insight issupposed to lie, suggesting that Descartes may have closer to pinpointing the‘seat of the soul’ than his critics believed. Opening the ‘third eye’ results in‘spiritual vision’ and ‘enlightenment’, which may be a way of expressing theconnection between melatonin production and its affect on neurotransmitters.Mavromatis notes the strong link between the pineal gland and the ‘third eye’,but he also suggests that the ‘intersection’ of the old and new brainstructures that he believes is responsible for the visionary states associatedwith hypnagogia, is reminiscent of the symbolism of the Hermetic caduceus.Opening the ‘third eye’ symbolizes the reawakening of an ancient spiritualvision, once available to man, but ‘temporarily (for some millions of years,that is) lost due to an evolutionarily necessary descent into matter, to beregained in due course at a higher level’. Mavromatis goes on to say that:> > In the West, this latter level is often represented by the god Hermes’> > sceptre, the caduceus, depicting two snakes entwined around a central rod> > which culminates in a small sphere or cone flanked by two wings … It is> > worth noting that the snakes represent the two supposedly opposite sides of> > man, whereas the sphere or cone stands for the unity of consciousness.

Asmentioned in the last chapter, this ‘spiral’ motif seems to have strongconnection to Hermetic ideas, linked to the snakes of the caduceus, and also tothe Ouroborus. Another curious ‘spiral/snake’ connection can be found in JeremyNarby’s fascinating book The Cosmic Serpent, an account of his experiences withthe powerful psychoactive drug ayahuasca. After taking the drug, Narby had avision of two giant boa constrictors who spoke to him, imparting ancient wisdom.Narby had been prompted to experiment with ayahuasca after reading an account ofits effects by the anthropologist Michael Harner, who also spoke of giantreptilian creatures ‘resting at the lowest depth of his brain’, a remark thatimmediately suggests the ‘old’ reptilian brain that lies beneath the newcerebral cortex. Harner remarked that these creatures ‘resembled DNA’. Narby wasinterested in how the indigenous people who use ayahuasca in religiousceremonies knew of its properties, and also of the many medicinal properties ofthe thousands of plants in the native jungle, a knowledge they could not haveacquired through trial and error. They told him the plants themselves gave themthis knowledge, which came to them when they took ayahuasca. Narby reflected onthe similarity between the ‘snakes’ and the DNA molecule — which, as mentionedearlier, resembles the entwined serpents of the caduceus — and went on toresearch snake symbolism in world mythology. Narby found innumerable examples ofentwined snake imagery associated with sacred knowledge, and he furtherreflected that the ‘snakes’ of the DNA molecule are connected via ‘rungs’ whichmake it look like a kind of ‘ladder’. The motif of a ‘ladder’ to heaven isstrongly associated with shamanism — as noted in Chapter 2 — and is also closelylinked to the Hermetic idea of the journey through the planetary spheres. In thecontext of hypnagogia, we see that Mavromatis believes that its visions arelinked to a return ‘spiral fashion’ to an older form of consciousness whilesimultaneously maintaining the newer, cerebral consciousness, and that herelates the entwined snakes of the caduceus to the linking of the old and newbrain systems. Ultimately, Narby came to the conclusion that the imagery ofentwined snakes was a symbol of DNA, and that the DNA molecule itself somehowcommunicates with shamans via ayahuasca."},{"pageContent":"THE HERMESIAN SPIRIT It would not be unreasonable for some readers to think that the abovereflections have at best only a tenuous connection to Hermeticism. Yet, as theHermetic scholar Antoine Faivre points out, like Hermes himself, Hermeticismneed not be announced as such to be present, and Hermes, we know, is a tricksterwho turns up in some strange places. ‘The word [Hermeticism],’ Faivre tells us,‘does not always appear where this state of mind, these doctrines, and thesepractices are apparent.’42 Yet Hermes’ presence can be felt.The doctrines and practices Faivre refers to are those I’ve explored in thisbook. What I’d like to do in these closing pages is to focus on what we he callsthe ‘Hermesian’ state of mind. Yet before I do this, I feel I should point outthat as Hermes is the god of crossroads, of pathways, of meetings, and ofmessages, it is perhaps not so great a stretch that I link ideas about the‘intersection’ — our modern term for ‘crossroads’ — of states of consciousnessand the brain systems responsible for them, as well as the associatedneurotransmitters — chemical ‘messengers’ — to the thrice-great one. And thefact that I have linked some Hermetic themes to Jean Gebser’s ideas about theintegral consciousness structure, which again relates to the idea of ‘bringingthings together’ — ‘integrating’ them — suggests, to me at least, that theconnections here are perhaps not as tenuous as one might think. Just ashypnagogia can be understood as a recapitulation of older brain functions whileretaining cerebral consciousness, Gebser’s integral structure ‘integrates’earlier consciousness structures while retaining the independent ego: both areconcerned with the ‘meeting’ of old and new forms of consciousness in order toproduce something more than both, and the integral consciousness structureGebser envisions seems one in which an Hermetic view of the world could bemaintained. And regarding Rilke’s ‘bees of the invisible’ and the kind of memoryassociated with Faculty X, Faivre himself writes: ‘Is not the art of memory …first of all a means of reading the world so as to interiorise it and … rewriteit within the self?’ And ‘it is especially under the inspiration of the CorpusHermeticum … that memory and imagination are associated to the extent ofblending together. After all, a part of the teaching of Hermes Trismegistusconsisted of ‘interiorizing’ the world …’43 So again, perhaps my speculationsare not entirely unfounded.In fact, this kind of ‘bridging’ is the sort of activity Faivre has in mind whenhe writes of an ‘Hermesian spirit’. This spirit, he argues, is essentially oneof syncretism and eclecticism. Whether it is Hermes and Thoth themselves, orheaven and earth — above and below — the Hermetic act seems to be one ofconnecting otherwise apparently disparate ideas, beliefs, and visions, andproducing some new vital current out of the encounter. This is not the same asthe postmodern ethos of ‘anything goes’, which is motivated more by a jaded,often cynical ‘post-belief’ than by any effort to transcend the cul-de-sac atwhich western philosophy has arrived. Quite the contrary. If, Faivre tells us,the Hermeticists ‘see the body as a magical object, mystically linked to theplanets and to the elements of nature, it is because they find sense everywherein things and transcend the illusion of banality’. And this, Faivre remarks, isa ‘supremely poetic task’.44 Postmodern thinking, to me at least, seems tooperate with exactly the opposite mindset: ‘deconstructing’ the great systems ofthought, it arrives at a vision (or lack of it) that finds no sense — no meaning— anywhere. When nihilism first raised its disturbing head in the second half ofthe nineteenth century, it caused a kind of panic in the collectiveconsciousness. Now it is taught at universities and hardly causes a stir. Whenthe notion that the world is meaningless — something science tells us as well —is accepted with as little reaction as a remark about the weather, we can besure that something has gone wrong with our perception of things.At the beginning of the last century G.R.S. Mead contrasted the Hermetic gnosiswith the ‘doubting mind’ whose ‘noise of words’ about the ‘appearance of things’only led to confusion. Some years later Frances Yates suggested that it was theexhaustion of Greek dialectics that led the Egyptian Greeks of Alexandria toseek out new ways of explaining the world through mysticism and the occult.Perhaps now, more than a century after Mead, it is time for Hermes to rise toour aid again.It is this feeling, I think, that leads many today to argue for a return to more‘traditional’ systems of thought, but these have their own drawbacks and I havewritten about them elsewhere.45 In contrast to a return to Tradition, in thesense of a received body of eternal beliefs and revelations, Faivre speaks of a‘traditional spirit, composed of intense and focused curiosity’ in whichTradition would refer ‘less to an immutable deposit than to a perpetualrenewal’.46 This suggests a ‘tradition’ aimed at asking questions, rather thanone of having answers, and this strikes me as an appropriately Hermetic approachto things.This ‘intense and focused curiosity’ is one of the virtues we have inheritedfrom the Renaissance and it is also the drive behind the eclectic character ofthe Hermesian spirit. This is a curiosity that does not reject the modern world— inaugurated by Marin Mersenne’s attack on animism — but tries to synthesizeits insights with those of the past in order to produce some third newpossibility, not immediately given by either (and the parallel with hypnagogia,which brings together the ‘old’ brain with the ‘new’, as well as with Gebser’s‘integral structure’, which integrates ‘outgrown’ forms of consciousness, seemssuggestive). And although this tactic may seem peculiarly modern, it is reallyas old as the Corpus Hermeticum itself, which, as Faivre tells us, was theresult of ‘diverse contributions, of disparate philosophies blended in a meltingpot, the theoretical and doctrinal coherence of which is scarcelyperceptible’.47This ‘openness to modernity’, Faivre argues, allows for what he calls a ‘thirdpath’, different from the ‘purist’ — the Traditional in the strong sense — orthe ‘historical’. In his reading the ‘historical path’ makes up the variousforms of ‘popular’ spirituality and occultism that abound today. In theseapproaches, a wide spectrum of beliefs — generally regarded as ‘New Age’ — offeran ‘alternative’ to the mainstream. Yet while they may address the spiritualhunger many feel, they lack the intellectual and philosophical power to be morethan a kind of well-meaning ‘counter-culture’, and their less than rigorouscharacter allows them to be easily — and often rightly — ignored. Opposed tothese two extremes — the hard core Traditionalists and the flaky New Age —Faivre offers what he calls the ‘Humanist path’. This is a humanism in the senseof Ficino, Pico, Bruno, and Fludd, not that of Erasmus. It is not just anacceptance of some Hermetic ideas, but an effort to acquaint oneself with asmuch of the world of learning as possible. As one of the patron saints of this‘third path’ is Thoth, the god of writing, and as Hermes Trismegistus himself issaid to written some thirty-six thousand books, this shouldn’t be surprising.Because of its ‘expanded field of research’, this ‘erudite Hermeticism’ requires‘a level of culture that must encompass more than the esoteric’.48 For both theTraditionalist and the New Ager, culture in the broad sense that Faivre intendsisn’t necessary. Indeed, more often than not it’s seen as an impediment to‘salvation’ rather than an aid. This is especially true of modern culture, whichboth the Traditionalist and New Ager tend to regard as more or less ‘evil’, aproduct of the Kali Yuga, the ‘Dark Age’ both believe we find ourselves in. Yetone of the most Hermetic works of the twentieth century, the anonymousMeditations on the Tarot, subtitled ‘A Journey into Christian Hermeticism’,combines Hermetic ideas and Roman Catholicism with probing discussions ofpsychology, philosophy, sociology, science, and dozens of other ‘modern’ topicsto form a thought-provoking and often controversial work. Any reader coming tothe Meditations on The Tarot expecting a nice New Age work on telling the futurewill be surprised, and the many references to Bergson, Nietzsche, Goethe, andother giants of western culture, will more than likely put them off. And theHermeticism that comes through in this 600 + page magnum opus is itself anexample of the synthesizing character Faivre sees at the heart of Hermeticphilosophy. For its author, ‘the Hermeticist is … a person who is at one and thesame time a mystic, a gnostic, a magician, and a “realist-idealist” philosopher’who brings together and synthesizes ‘the diverse planes of the macrocosm and themicrocosm’.49 This work of synthesis is achieved through the Hermeticist becausehe himself is a synthesis of a mystical, a gnostic, a magical, and a‘Hermetic-philosophical’ ‘sense’ (again, the theme of integration), and is ableto apply to any object of knowledge the method best suited to it. But althoughit seeks knowledge, it does not proceed as science does. Rather than ‘aspiringto power over the forces of nature … Hermeticism aspires to consciousparticipation with the constructive forces of the world …’ and its means ofachieving this are not ‘univocal concepts and their verbal definitions … butrather arcana and their symbolic expressions’.50 These ‘arcana’, as we’ve seen,can be practically anything, even something as commonplace as an ashtray, anexample of Hermeticism’s ‘concrete’ approach. As the Hermeticist would say, itall depends on how you look at it.The Hermesian spirit, then, is a call to widen our perspectives to include asmuch of the world as possible, and to believe that not only nature, but theman-made world too, has a spiritual character. Rather than hold fast to the ideaof a primordial, inviolate Tradition — as the followers of René Guénon and theTraditionalist school do — or substitute New Age ‘philosophies’ for modern ones,the Hermesian way is to bring together what is of value from both the esotericundercurrent and the exoteric mainstream. And — as Gebser suggests ischaracteristic of our slowly emerging new consciousness structure — to integratethem, so that something new and unforeseen may arise. This is something Ibelieve I have tried to do in this book, and in my others.Again, following this ‘third path’ seems to have been with Hermeticism from thestart. ‘From the first centuries to the present day,’ the Hermetic scholarWouter J. Hanegraaff writes, ‘there has … existed a third current, characterizedby a resistance to … either pure rationality or doctrinal faith.’51 Perhapsbecause we have a deep seated hunger for some all encompassing final answer tolife’s mysteries, the ‘totalizing’ systems of science and religion still seemvery attractive, while the kind of ‘hovering life’ — in the novelist RobertMusil’s phrase — which combines science and mysticism and is able to exist inthe kind of creative uncertainty the Hermesian spirit celebrates, is less so.But there have always been those who know that life’s mysteries are not to beanswered but lived, and the third path of the Hermesian spirit is one in whichthey are lived most intensely.And Hermes Trismegistus himself? Well, we can still learn much from him. Ifnothing else his call for us to be ‘caretakers’ of the Earth is clearly muchneeded today, and if this is all we learn from him, we shall profit from itconsiderably. But while we should certainly fulfil the obligations of one sideof our nature, we should not allow those of our other half to fall into neglect.One way to avoid this is to muster that ‘godlike concentration of consciousness’the thrice-great one required of his students in order to grasp his teaching,lest it ‘comes like a rushing river tumbling in flux’ and ‘outruns any effort wemake’ to understand it. The similarity between this and Faivre’s ‘intense andfocused curiosity’ seems clear. It is through efforts like this that the twobranches of knowledge — gnosis and episteme — with which we began this essay,come together and inform that ‘third path’ upon which, as his sobriquetsuggests, Hermes is our most trusted guide. That path, however, is not straight.It curves and curls and twists, like the serpents of his caduceus, and if wehappen to lose our way — which is altogether possible and in fact to be expected— we may find some unknown treasure, some hermaion that makes the detour morethan worthwhile. Hermes, we remember, is the god of travellers, not ofdestinations or arrivals, and as the world is infinite, so too is the knowledgeof it. In fact, with each new incremental advance of our knowledge, the worlditself increases by so much. And, as Rilke tells us, each act of consciousnessmay indeed create new worlds. So there is much at stake. The prospect iscertainly challenging, daunting even. But it is also powerfully exciting and atremendous lure for that ‘intense and focused curiosity’ that fuels thisnever-ending quest. As P.D. Ouspensky wrote, at the close of a book that emergedfrom his experience with his ashtray, ‘the real, true progress of thought existsonly in the widest possible striving toward knowledge, a striving which does notadmit the possibility of resting on any forms of knowledge already found’. ‘Themeaning of life,’ Ouspensky recognized, ‘lies in eternal seeking, and only byseeking shall we ever find new reality.’52 This is one way to describe theHermetic path. It is a very good way, I think, and it is in this sense, Ibelieve, that we should follow the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus.NOTES 1 [index_split_080.html#filepos569467].

Briefly, aroundthe same time that Rilke was receiving the inspiration for the Duino Elegies,Steiner gave a series of lectures in which he also proposed the idea of a coming‘invisible world’. In 1911, Steiner lectured on The Reappearance of Christ inthe Etheric (Spring Valley: Anthroposophic Press, N.Y.: 1983), and argued thatthe earth was becoming a ‘corpse’ as preparation for its new planetaryincarnation as Jupiter. In order to accomplish this, Steiner said, ‘it isnecessary for the earth to be destroyed; otherwise the spirit will not becomefree’. For Steiner, as for Rilke, the external world was in the process ofpassing away in order to arise in a new spiritual form.30 [index_split_083.html#filepos600493]. P.D. Ouspensky, In Search of theMiraculous, 1983, p. 122.

Gurdjieff prefaced his remarks aboutthe law of seven with the Hermetic statement that ‘the study of man must proceedon parallel lines with the study of the of the world, and the study of the worldmust run parallel with the study of man’. 31 [index_split_083.html#filepos600742].

Auditory hypnagogia is as common as thevisual type. In The Natural Depth in Man (New York: Harper & Row, 1972) thepsychologist Wilson Van Dusen records several ‘auditory hallucinations’ which,although at first seemingly nonsensical, were on reflection found to containprofound insights relating to his current psychological or physical state.Another example of auditory hypnagogia is the automatic writing associated withthe French surrealists of the 1920s. See my article at:http://www.forteantimes.com/features/ articles/227/hypnagogia.html40 [index_split_086.html#filepos619848]. In ‘lucid dreams’ we become consciouswithin a dream and, rather than ‘waking up’ in the usual sense, retainconsciousness while continuing to dream. Basically, we are awake in a dream,know that we are dreaming, can act consciously within it, and can continue inthis state. In hypnagogic states, we are awake but are aware of involuntaryinner imagery — much like the imagery of a dream — which we can observe whilealso being aware of our physical, external surroundings. So in lucid dreaming,we are awake while dreaming, and in hypnagogic states, we are dreaming whileawake. 41 [index_split_086.html#filepos628670].

As with ‘romantic’ and ‘existential,’ ‘gnostic’ has taken on a usage andmeaning that exceeds reference to the religious and spiritual communities andbeliefs that arose in the first centuries following Christ and is now often usedin a broader sense to mean secret, hidden, or occult, as well as the individualswho pursue knowledge of this kind. For the specific historical groups andteachings that make up Gnosticism, I will use Gnostic. For less specificreferences, I will use gnostic.6. C.G. Jung Speaking, ed. William McGuire and R.F.C.

There are several definitions and interpretations of the Greek word Nous,which in English is sometimes used to mean ‘common sense’, and which is theprobable source of the American slang phrase ‘use your noodle’, meaning to ‘useyour head,’ to think something through. For different Greek philosophers —Anaxagoras, Plato, Aristotle — it means intellect, mind, logos, reason, eitherthat of the individual or of God. In terms of experience, as I hope will becomeclear, for the Hermetic thinkers, the sense in which it is understood as asudden godlike cognition is probably the closest.9. Clement Salaman, Introduction to Asclepius The Perfect Discourse of HermesTrismegistus (London: Duckworth, 2007), pp. 11–12. Readers who go on to readSalaman’s excellent translations may note that some of the language used isremarkably similar to that of the Gurdjieffean ‘fourth way’. This is notsurprising, given that Salaman is a member of the School of Economic Science, anoffshoot of P.D. Ouspensky’s London ‘fourth way’ schools of the 1930s and ‘40s.This is not to say that Salaman has imported language from one ‘esoteric school’to another. ‘Wakefulness’ and the struggle against ‘sleep’ that characterizesthe ‘fourth way’ are themes inherent in the Hermetica, as well as in otherspiritual philosophies. Salaman is also the editor of a translation of TheLetters of Marsilio Ficino (1999) prepared by the London Language Department ofthe School of Economic Science.10. Salaman 2001, p. 15.11. For this account I have relied on Clement Salaman’s translation of theAsclepius and, with Dorine van Oyen and William D. Wharton, of the CorpusHermeticum, published as The Way of Hermes, above. Both are highly readable andnot top-heavy with critical apparatus, although the Introduction to the CorpusHermeticum by Gilles Quispel, and Jean-Pierre Mahé’s translation of andIntroduction to The Definitions of Hermes Trismegistus to Asclepius, included inthe book, are essential. I have also consulted Brian Copenhaver’s Hermetica(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992) and G.R.S. Mead’s classic ThriceGreatest Hermes (York Beach, Maine: Samuel Weiser, 2001). Timothy Freke’s andPeter Gandy’s The Hermetica (London: Piatkus Books, 1997) is a very readablepopular re-interpretation and compilation of the Hermetic writings fromdifferent sources.12. Salaman 2001, pp. 131, 126.13. Copenhaver, p. 1. The Way of Hermes has ‘Nous of the Supreme’.14. In his fascinating book The Reflexive Universe (New York: Delacorte Press,1976), the philosopher and inventor Arthur M. Young makes some remarks aboutlight that seem to have an Hermetic cast. ‘Light,’ Young says, ‘is the unitarypurposive principle which engenders the universe,’ and ‘has the nature of afirst cause’. (p. 23) ‘Light, because it is primary, must be unqualified —impossible to describe — because it is antecedent to the contrasts necessary todescription.’ (p. 10) ‘Light is not an objective thing that can be investigatedas can ordinary objects … Light is not seen. It is seeing.’ (Ibid.) The historyof light as a metaphor for vision and knowledge — illumination, enlightenment —is too long to enter here, but seems to warrant a serious study. See also ArthurZajonc, Catching the Light: The Entwined History of Light and Mind (New York:Bantam, 1993).15. Mead 1906, p. 1116. Salaman 2007, p. 58.17. Ibid.18. Ibid. p. 73.19.

One of the examples Bucke gives of previous experiences of cosmicconsciousness is that of the fifteenth century German shoemaker and mystic JacobBoehme. In one account of his experiences, Boehme speaks of it in a wayremarkably similar to Bucke. ‘The gate was opened to me,’ Boehme wrote, ‘that inone quarter of an hour I saw and knew more than if I had been many yearstogether at university.’ Again, the profound cognitive character of theexperience is clear. In an earlier experience, Boehme looked ‘into theprinciples and deepest foundations of things’. Ibid. pp. 182, 180.27.

Naydler remarks that Homer speaks of thumos, located in the chest, as thecentre of man’s emotional life, and says that Homer’s characters ‘conduct aninner dialogue with their thumos, and come to decisions about what to do, andhow best to act’. (p.16), A similar idea was presented in Julian Jaynes TheOrigin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (New York:Houghton Mifflin, 1977). Briefly, Jaynes argues that Homeric man lacked the kindof interior space we possess and did not, as we do, ‘ask ourselves’ what weintend to do about something and come to decisions about it. Rather, Homeric manpossessed two consciousnesses, housed in different sides of the brain (hence,‘bicameral,’ which means ‘two chambered’). He felt the left side of the brain as‘I’ — as we do — and the consciousness on the right side came to him as‘voices’. When Homeric man heard ‘messages’ from the gods, Jaynes argues, he wasreally receiving instructions from the right side of the brain. Jaynes arguesthat a series of catastrophes and upheavals forced Homeric man to fuse the twoconsciousnesses together, to arrive at the kind of ego-consciousness familiar toourselves. The right brain, however, continues to posses a consciousness of itsown, as experiments with split-brain subjects have shown, although for the mostpart it remains ‘unconscious’ for its left brain counterpart.19. This, of course, flies in the face of all modern ideas about consciousnessand its relation to the brain, which can be summed up in the philosopher JohnSearle’s remark that ‘the brain causes consciousness’. Yet how much brain isactually necessary for not only consciousness, but a high level of intelligence,is debatable.

Noexact dates for his birth are given, although in the second RosicrucianManifesto (1615), the year 1378 is mentioned. He was supposed to live for 106years, which would place his death in 1484. As Harran was levelled in 1271 therewould have been nothing but ruins at the time of any possible visit. There hasbeen some suggestion of a possible link between Christian Rosenkreutz — who orwhatever he may have been — and Gemisthos Plethon, although aside from the factthat both were connoisseurs of ancient wisdom, there is nothing concreteconnecting the two.

Essentially, Arius argued against the Trinity, maintaining that Jesus was a‘created being,’ and hence, not co-equal with God.37.

Visitors to Switzerland may notice chemists with the name ‘Paracelsus’, as Idid in the Hauptbahnhof in Zürich.46. The one exception was, as mentioned, the Asclepius, which was well knownthroughout the Middle Ages, but even this has a ‘magical’ aspect more in tunewith alchemy than with the books of the Corpus Hermeticum, although, to be sure,it also speaks of ‘cosmic consciousness’.47. Ebeling, p. 59.48. Faivre 1994, p. 11.CHAPTER 5 1. There is some question about whether Petrarch was the first to do this, orwhether he actually made the ascent at all. Although subsequent historians haveadded to them, Lynn Thorndike’s ‘Renaissance or Prenaissance?’ (Journal of theHistory of Ideas 4, No. 1, January 1943), presents the basic doubts. Others hadof course climbed mountains before Petrarch, but these ascents were motivated bypractical reasons. Petrarch’s is unusual for being driven purely by curiosity.2. Petrarch, ‘The Ascent of Mont Ventoux,’ translated by Hans Nachod, TheRenaissance Philosophy of Man, edited by Ernst Cassirer, Paul Oscar Kristeller,and John Herman Randall, Jr. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1948), p.36.3.

Hans Blumenberg, The Legitimacy of the Modern Age (Cambridge, Mass: MITPress, 1983), p. 341.7. Petrarch, p. 45.8. Ibid. p. 44.9. Petrarch’s synchronicity seems double, in the sense that by definition, asynchronicity is an immediately apparent correspondence between an inner and anouter event. The outer event that paralleled Petrarch’s inner one — the passagefrom Augustine — is itself about the correspondence between the inner and outerworld. Petrarch could have opened another book and read something aboutmountains alone, and that would have been synchronistic enough. But he readsomething about the relationship between mountains and the inner world, whichwas precisely the issue preoccupying him at that moment. Petrarch, of course,did not have the benefit of the notion of synchronicity, which itself offers ananswer to the issue troubling him, the conflict between the demands of his souland the attraction of the outer world. In synchronicities we recognize directlythat both worlds are one, or at least that the membrane separating them ispermeable, which is an Hermetic insight itself. Also, Augustine’s rejection of the Hermetic notion that we can know God byobserving the cosmos, will soon be echoed by the new scientific consciousness,but for a different reason. For Augustine we should ignore the cosmos because contemplating it can leadour attention away from God. Science will tell us that it is pointless to lookfor God in the cosmos because He is not there. Hermeticism rejects both thesepositions.10. Copenhaver, p. xlvii.11. Petrarch, p. 46.12. Ibid. p. 45. Salaman 2001 p. 39. Clearly, the choice of ‘empty parading’ isthe translator’s. In another English version, by James Harvey Robinson(http://history.hanover.edu/ texts/petrarch/pet17.html), we have ‘vain show,’which means roughly the same. The Latin original is spectaculis evanescant. TheCorpus Hermeticum wasn’t translated into Latin until Marsilio Ficino’s editionin 1463, and Petrarch could read no Greek. The similarity may be nothing butcoincidence, but it is striking nonetheless, and there are other oddly Hermeticechoes. Petrarch remarks at one point that he ‘leaped in my winged thoughts fromthings corporeal to what is incorporeal,’ (p. 39) and speaks of ‘the agile andimmortal mind’ which can reach its goal ‘in the twinkling of an eye’. (p. 40)Although instantaneous mental travelling may not be an exclusively Hermeticmotif, these phrases do resonate with the kind of ideas presented in theHermetic books.13.

One hopes that Ficino’s astral prescriptions were more successful than thoseaimed at health, as in On Caring for the Health of Students, or longevity, as inHow to Prolong Your Life, which with On Making Your Life Agree With the Heavens,makes up his Book of Life. As his translator Charles Boer points out,‘Considering some of the substances Ficino recommends for ingestion,’ his advicewas ‘atrocious,’ and he remarks that many of his ‘patients’ ‘spent years oftheir life laid up with gout’. Likewise, many of his close friends died young:Lorenzo de’ Medici at 43, the poet Angelo Ambrogini, known as Il Poliziano, at40, and Pico della Mirandola at 31.

In 1609 Galileo began experiments and observations with his telescope,developed from the earlier spyglass, which led to his book The Starry Messengerpublished in 1610. One of Galileo’s revolutionary observations — in more waysthan one — was of the moons of Jupiter. If, he asked, it was true that Jupiterhad moons, like the Earth’s, orbiting it, then it was possible that the Earthitself could orbit another body, the sun, which was what Copernicus had argued.Along with this remarkable discovery, Galileo was the first to gaze on stars andother celestial bodies, hitherto unseen. Before this, all men could work withwas the naked eye. Galileo had passed beyond this limit. Galileo’s discovery ledto the notion of a cosmos much larger than had been suspected, yet Bruno hadalready ‘discovered’ this years before, through an act of imagination, which hadpresented to him an infinite cosmos, sprinkled with innumerable worlds.58. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_VentouxCHAPTER 6 1.

Ptolemy (90–168 AD) was an Egyptian-Greek living in Roman Alexandria. Hedevised a complicated geocentric solar system that employed the idea of‘epicycles ‘— miniorbits around an imaginary point that the planets performed asthey circled the earth — in order to account for the observed phenomenon of theplanets’ frequent apparent backward (retrograde) motion. It was not untilJohannes Kepler’s discovery in 1609, following Copernicus, of the planets’elliptical orbit around the sun — including the earth’s — that Ptolemy’sepicycles were jettisoned.19.

Briefly, around the same time that Rilke was receivingthe inspiration for the Duino Elegies, Steiner gave a series of lectures inwhich he also proposed the idea of a coming ‘invisible world’. In 1911, Steinerlectured on The Reappearance of Christ in the Etheric (Spring Valley:Anthroposophic Press, N.Y.: 1983), and argued that the earth was becoming a‘corpse’ as preparation for its new planetary incarnation as Jupiter. In orderto accomplish this, Steiner said, ‘it is necessary for the earth to bedestroyed; otherwise the spirit will not become free’. For Steiner, as forRilke, the external world was in the process of passing away in order to arisein a new spiritual form.30. P.D. Ouspensky, In Search of the Miraculous, 1983, p. 122. In speaking ofwhat Gurdjieff calls ‘the law of seven or the law of octaves’ — which I discussin Chapter 3 — Gurdjieff told Ouspensky that ‘in order to understand the meaningof this law it is necessary to regard the universe as consisting of vibrations’.Gurdjieff prefaced his remarks about the law of seven with the Hermeticstatement that ‘the study of man must proceed on parallel lines with the studyof the of the world, and the study of the world must run parallel with the studyof man’.31. Rilke, 1939 pp. 128–29.32. See Rudolf Steiner, Lucifer and Ahriman (North Vancouver: Steiner BookCentre, 1984).33. Marcel Proust, Remembrance of Things Past (New York: Vintage Books, 1982),p. 48.34. Hermann Hesse, Steppenwolf (New York: Henry Holt, 1929), p. 46. That inHesse’s passage we can find more than one Hermetic trope — the world reflectedin miniature (macrocosm/ microcosm), his brain storing a thousand pictures (artof memory), the eternal and the stars (the timeless realm of nous) — was adiscovery for me. I did not realize they were there before deciding to includethis quotation in this chapter. This seems an example of the Greek hermaion, the‘lucky find’ associated with Hermes. That the find itself is about Hermeticthemes suggests it is a kind of double hermaion.35. Christopher Isherwood, The World in The Evening (London: Methuen, 1984), p.109.36. Ibid. p. 116.37. Ibid.38. See Lachman, Discovering Swedenborg, 2009, pp. 94–98; Rudolf Steiner, 2007,pp. 149–51; and Jung the Mystic (New York: Tarcher/Penguin, 2010), pp. 119–20.39. Auditory hypnagogia is as common as the visual type. In The Natural Depth inMan (New York: Harper & Row, 1972) the psychologist Wilson Van Dusen recordsseveral ‘auditory hallucinations’ which, although at first seeminglynonsensical, were on reflection found to contain profound insights relating tohis current psychological or physical state. Another example of auditoryhypnagogia is the automatic writing associated with the French surrealists ofthe 1920s. See my article at: http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/227/hypnagogia.html40. In ‘lucid dreams’ we become conscious within a dream and, rather than‘waking up’ in the usual sense, retain consciousness while continuing to dream.Basically, we are awake in a dream, know that we are dreaming, can actconsciously within it, and can continue in this state. In hypnagogic states, weare awake but are aware of involuntary inner imagery — much like the imagery ofa dream — which we can observe while also being aware of our physical, externalsurroundings. So in lucid dreaming, we are awake while dreaming, and inhypnagogic states, we are dreaming while awake.41. Andreas Mavromatis, Hypnagogia (London: Routledge, 1991), pp. 263–64.42.
