Eliot once criticized Bertrand Russell's essay “A Free Man's Worship” onthe grounds that it was not for people who “hunger and thirst afterrighteousness” so much as for those who are content with a snack at the bar.Whether the thinkers discussed in this book “hunger and thirst afterrighteousness” is a matter for discussion, but one thing is certain: all of themundoubtedly hunger and thirst after something. And this is why I find them sofascinating, and why I read Gary Lachman's book with such deep interest.It should be stated, before I go any further, that Gary Lachman is not—as thereader might suppose from the remarkable breadth of his knowledge—an academic,or even a psychologist. He is already well known to lovers of rock music as theguitarist in a seventies group called Blondie, and his song “I'm Always Touchedby Your Presence Dear” was in the top ten. He tells the story of these years inhis book New York Rocker. But during this period when he was a pop idol, all hisspare time was spent reading philosophy and esoteric literature. And in 1983, heembarked on his own “search for the miraculous,” visiting places likeGurdjieff”s prieuré in Fontainebleau, Chartres Cathedral, Glastonbury,Stonehenge, and other sacred sites. When I met him in the late 1980s, he wasstudying philosophy at California State University and working in the huge“metaphysical” bookshop The Bodhi Tree in Hollywood. He was working on an“occult” novel that I found fascinating. Then, in 1996, he moved to London andembarked on the career of a professional writer, writing Turn off Your Mind: TheMystic Sixties, and then New York Rocker. Readers of the present book will sensethat his interest in the problem of the transformation of consciousness isimmediate and personal.Let me try to define the problem that preoccupies us both.A small number of human beings differ from their fellows in feeling basicallydissatisfied with what living in this world has to offer them. They suffer fromthe same kind of profound discontentment as Bunyan's hero, who could think ofnothing but “What can I do to be saved?”I must emphasize immediately that such people do not necessarily regardthemselves as religious. Perhaps, like myself, they spent too much of theirchildhood bored to tears in church or Sunday school, and automatically reactwith hostility to the kind of bleating that clergymen indulge in. But whetherthey know it or not, they are reacting to the same peculiar dissatisfaction thathas characterized truly religious people throughout the ages. They are revoltedand enraged by the hymn that declares:The trivial round, the common taskShould furnish all we ought to ask.As far as they are concerned, a life devoted to “the trivial round” is not worthliving.Now, although such people strike most of their fellows as rather peculiar, theyalways seem to form a certain small percentage of society, and have done sothroughout the ages. Those who were lucky enough to be born in Europe in, say,the thirteenth century, simply explained to their families that they wished tobecome novices, and went off to the nearest monastery. And although they wereprobably required to milk the cows and grind the corn into flour, they had noobjection to this “trivial round” of everyday chores. For, as they listened tothe chanting of the monks at evensong, or took part in the Easter festival, theyfelt themselves to be part of a world that satisfied a hunger of the spirit.These natural contemplatives experienced disquiet when reformers like Luther andCalvin and Hus denounced the Church as corrupt, for the religious temperament isnaturally conservative, and feels no desire to challenge authority. They werenot even too concerned to learn that Canon Copernicus had propounded a newtheory in which the earth was no longer the center of the universe, forCopernicus admitted that it was no more than a theory. But this was not the endof the matter. Soon Galileo was declaring that Copernicus was right and the Popewas wrong, while the respected philosopher Descartes suggested that the onlyreliable way to arrive at truth was through reason, and that although reasonsupported the existence of God, the first step towards certain knowledge was to“doubt everything.” Then Sir Isaac Newton demonstrated that the universe is agigantic clock, which ticks on for all eternity without any help from God. Andby this time, half of Europe had become Protestant, and the old comfortableworld of the thirteenth century had been lost forever.We can now see that, historically speaking, this had to happen. But it meantthat those natural “misfits” and “outsiders” who had found their natural home inthe Church no longer had anywhere to go. They had, in effect, become refugees,displaced persons. So when, in the 1880s, an Armenian-Greek named GeorgeGurdjieff experienced the familiar dissatisfaction of the spiritual refugee, hehad no idea where to start looking for a way of life that would satisfy thatpeculiar hunger that tormented him. It is true that he was deeply religious and,if he had been born a generation earlier, would almost certainly have enteredthe Orthodox Church, and ended his life with the reputation of a saint. But itwas already too late for that. Instead, Gurdjieff wandered off to Egypt, thenAbyssinia and Syria, then India, searching for a lost knowledge that he felt hadto exist somewhere. And after many years of searching—he claims he was part of agroup called “the Seekers after Truth”—he came to the conclusion that the answerhe was looking for did not lie in some ancient monastery in the Himalayas. Itlay rather “in the sphere of man's unconscious mentation,” that is, in the depthof the unconscious mind.Now—if I may speak personally for a moment—I came across Gurdjieff's name about1950 when, in a bookshop in Kensington Church Street, I saw a squat, bulkyvolume entitled All and Everything. And since, ever since I reached my teens, Ihad been possessed by an absurd desire to know about every important idea of thetwentieth century, I was deeply curious to know what Gurdjieff had to say thatrequired well over a thousand pages. A glance into the book convinced me that hehad no capacity for expressing himself in plain language, and I temporarilyadmitted defeat.Not long after that, I found a volume called In Search of the Miraculous, byP.D. Ouspensky, in the Wimbledon public library, and was delighted to see thatit was about the teaching of Gurdjieff. And since it seemed to be clearlywritten, I took it home and plunged in. But I soon found myself bogged down inobscure passages about “the ray of creation” and “octaves,” and decided that,after all, this was not for me. Fortunately, a few weeks later, I came upon avolume called Venture with Ideas by Kenneth Walker, and realised that this was asimple personal account of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky. And using Kenneth Walker asa key, I was soon making great strides with In Search of the Miraculous, andknew that I had stumbled upon one of the most important books of my life.One of the things that impressed me most about Gurdjieff's teaching was hisassertion that we are little more than machines. This is something I had feltobscurely since my teens, and it had crystallized when I read in T.S. Eliot'sThe Family Reunion the line: “partial observation of one's own automatism.” Iwould have liked to be quite a different kind of person—self-possessed, focused,articulate—but my body and brain seemed to have a will of their own, and Isometimes felt that I was in charge of a shambling Frankenstein monster.Persuading him to do what I wanted was as difficult as driving one of those“dodgem” cars in an amusement park, which refuses to go the way you want it to.But even when I outgrew the sense of clumsiness and awkwardness, I remainedaware of this mechanical element in the human personality that I called “theautomatic pilot”—the part of us that learns to type or drive a car or talk aforeign language. This I eventually came to call “the robot.”This robot is also responsible for something that preoccupied me greatly in myteens—mental illness. So many of those nineteenth-century figures I admired—vanGogh, Nietzsche, Hölderlin—had gone insane. And I could understand themechanism. Every one of us is part “robot,” part living entity, the “real you.”Under normal circumstances, we seem to be about fifty/fifty. When you set outfor work on a spring morning, you are more like 51% “real you” and only 49%“robot.” Yet by the time you come home, you may be so tired that you drive home“automatically” and can hardly remember the drive—your robot has driven youhome.The problem arises when you feel overwhelmed with difficulties andcomplications, and you plod along mechanically, hardly recalling what it waslike when you really enjoyed life. You cease to make the kind of effort thatre-charges your vital batteries. You are now habitually more “robot” than “realyou,” and this is a highly dangerous state. For if we allow ourselves to slipdown to the state of being 55% robot and only 45% real you, it is very hard torecover. Tiredness makes you pessimistic. Pessimism makes you tired. It is avicious circle, in which it seems self-evident that living is bloody hard work,and that no one can be called truly happy. We cease to feel those flashes ofsheer delight, those moments that Chesterton called “absurd good news” andProust “moments bienheureux.” Life takes on the quality of a play by SamuelBeckett. (And it is surely a sign of how many people in our civilization livepermanently in this state that Beckett is vaguely accepted as a “great writer.”)In short, although the robot is the most valuable servant we possess, he is alsoresponsible for most of the things that are wrong with our civilization. And allthese problems depend on the negative feedback mechanism—tiredness leading todepression, depression to more tiredness...This explains why so much “modern thought” is tinged with gloom, from thepsychology of Freud to the philosophy of Heidegger, Sartre, and theirsuccessors.Yet, as Gary Lachman points out, not all serious thinkers end up in thispessimistic cul-de-sac. Abraham Maslow complained that Freud had “sold humannature short” and landed us in a radical underestimation of our own powers. Hepointed out that all healthy and normal people have regular “peak experiences”(a close relative of Proust's moments bienheureux). But he also made anobservation of crucial importance. When his students began to talk to oneanother about their peak experiences, they began having peak experiences all thetime. It is as if reminding yourself of their existence is enough to make themhappen.We have seen the same mechanism in Bucke's experience of “cosmic consciousness,”which occurred after he had spent an evening with friends talking and readingWordsworth, Whitman and Browning. The discussion had made him aware that heought to be happy, and the happiness descended as he relaxed in the cab.This raises an interesting question. If peak experiences are so natural, why domost people experience them so seldom?The answer is fairly obvious. We don't spend most of our lives consideringwhether we are happy or unhappy. We spend them in practicalconsiderations—catching buses, paying bills, watching the news. Happiness tendsto come in moments of relaxation or withdrawal. Maslow describes a young motherwho was getting breakfast for her husband and children when a beam of sunlightcame through the window, and it suddenly struck her how lucky she was, and shewent into the peak experience. Of course, she was lucky before it happened, butit took the sunlight to give her a “lift” that carried her into the peakexperience.The trouble, I concluded long ago, is that “close-upness” deprives us ofmeaning. We spend our lives peering at the present like a watchmaker peering atcogs and springs through his eyeglass. The result is rather like a shortsightedman in a picture gallery, who is forced to study the pictures from two inchesaway and so seldom gets the full impact.The present acts like a bullfighter's cape, which prevents the bull from seeingthe matador. Every time it charges, it is blinded by the cape. This is theperfect example of what Gurdjieff meant by mechanicalness. A really intelligentbull would fix the matador with its mind, ignore the cape, and charge at whereit knows the matador to be. But most bulls are too mechanical to do anything sointelligent.In the moments bienheureux, the matador stands back and drops the cape, and wecan see things as they are, and plunge into the peak experience.Of course, the trouble is not only “close-upness,” but also the negativity thathas somehow crept into our whole outlook on life. And the culprit here isthought itself. This has now been recognized by a school of psychiatry inAmerica, of whom the leading exponent is a professor called George Pransky. Herefers to it as the Psychology of Mind. In his book The Renaissance ofPsychology, Pranksy describes how he was persuaded to attend a session at SaltSpring Island, off the coast of British Columbia. He was struck by the sheercheerfulness and wellbeing of the participants. But what really impressed himwas that the person at the center of this revival was an ordinary man named SydBanks, not a psychologist or an academic, or even a minister. And Banks'sinsight had come upon him with absurd simplicity. He had been remarking to afriend that he felt unhappy, and the friend had replied, “You're not unhappy,Syd—you only think you are.” And Banks stared at him with amazement and said,“What did you say?” as the incredible implications sank in. He suddenly saw thatall our mental states are things we happen to “think” are so.When George Pransky told me this story, I told him one of my own favorites. Aman is on his way to borrow a neighbor's lawnmower for the tenth time. Heimagines the neighbor saying, “But why don't you buy one of your own?” and hereplies, “It just isn't worth it.” And his neighbor says, “Yes, but surely...”At this moment, he knocks on the neighbor's door, and as the man opens it, heshouts, “Oh keep your bloody lawnmower” and strides off.This is an example of the kind of thing Banks means. It is our minds that createproblems and inflate them.But if we practise Gurdjieff's self-observation, we soon recognise that most ofthe things we think we see and understand are patterns created by our own minds,like faces seen in the clouds. And the cinema screen on which we project theseshapes is the bullfighter's cape, the present moment. If we could learn to brushthe cape aside, everything would be different. For, as Blake realized, if thedoors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear as it really is,infinite.That is why, on the whole, I tend to be an optimist. As I study modernphilosophy, from Heidegger and Sartre to Derrida and Lyotard, as I study modernliterature, from Eliot's Waste Land to Beckett and Golding's Lord of the Flies,I see men who have convinced themselves that the faces they see in theclouds—and make the rest of us see—are objectively real.Buckminster Fuller went straight to the heart of the matter with his comment, “Iseem to be a verb.” We come closest to understanding our own mystery when wegrasp the meaning of this comment. If everyday consciousness shares the natureof sleep, then the problem is to “shake the mind awake.”Here, I would suggest, we have a fruitful starting point for this problem. InCrime and Punishment, Raskolnikov remarks that if he had to stand on a narrowledge forever, in eternal rain and darkness, he would still prefer to do thisrather than die at once. We can all understand just what he meant—that ifsomeone put a gun to our heads and said, “Which is it to be? Do I blow yourbrains out, or will you choose the narrow ledge?” we would all cry, “Narrowledge!” But what would we actually do on that narrow ledge?The director of BBC music, Hans Keller, once described how he had been inGermany before the Second World War, when so many of his acquaintances weredisappearing into concentration camps, and had prayed, “Only let me get out ofGermany, and I swear I will never be unhappy for the rest of my life.” Andagain, we can all see what he meant. But how could he actually set about keepinghis promise?Gary Lachman mentions in this book the story of how Graham Greene hadtemporarily escaped his own boredom by playing Russian roulette with a loadedrevolver, and how, when the hammer fell on an empty chamber, he felt anoverwhelming sense of delight, of relief. In that moment, he had actually becomea verb.But how do we set about “becoming a verb”? Shaw embodied his own answer to theproblem in Heartbreak House, in Captain Shotover's phrase “The seventh degree ofconcentration.” And we can see that a hammer clicking on the empty chamber of aloaded revolver would, indeed, bring about something very like the seventhdegree of concentration.In this remarkable book, Gary Lachman has approached this problem from manydifferent angles. What all have in common is that they embody the idea thathuman consciousness is now evolving toward a new level. This is the basis of theteachings of Madame Blavatsky and Rudolf Steiner, and it reappears in Bucke,Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, Owen Barfield, Maslow, Schwaller de Lubicz, and JeanGebser. And it also seems to me obvious that, as in the case of Maslow'sstudents, we can only deepen our awareness of this step in evolution by talkingand thinking about it. That is to say, a book like this is in itself animportant step toward the evolution it discusses.I stumbled upon an interesting insight several years ago—in fact, to bespecific, in March 1987—after an accident involving a ferry called The Herald ofFree Enterprise. Its captain made the mistake of allowing it to leave port withthe car doors open, which was strictly illegal. A wave rolled into the ship,causing it to capsize with great loss of life. And as I thought about this, Ifound myself reflecting how easy it would have been to avert this tragedy, ifonly someone had walked up to the captain and threatened to report him if he didnot order the doors closed before leaving port.But then I became aware of the paradox. If the tragedy had been averted, no onewould have known, and so no one would have felt happiness and relief. We caneven imagine that, if one of the passengers had been a depressive, he might havethrown himself overboard on the return journey.Reflecting on this makes me aware of what Gurdjieff meant when he said that whatman needs to save him from the state of illusion in which he lives is an organthat would permit him to see the exact time of his own death. Let me add to thatanother reflection: that what we now need is an organ by which we can perceivethe tragedies and miseries we might well encounter every day of our lives, butwhich we normally succeed in avoiding.It may sound as if I am suggesting that we should spend our lives in a state ofanxiety about possible disasters. But that is not at all what I mean. On thecontrary, I am suggesting using the imagination actively—like Maslow'shousewife—to grasp how lucky we are.Forty years ago I compiled the first-ever “encyclopedia of murder.” I tried toexplain in the Introduction why I did not regard the study of murder as somehowmorbid or sensational, because when you contemplate the idea of a criminal whohas thrown away his freedom, you are galvanized into a recognition of the valueof your own freedom.For example, at the time I write this, a friend named Ira Einhorn has just beensentenced to life imprisonment on a murder charge. I am not now raising thequestion of whether he is guilty or not: only the fact that he is an intelligentman, who would certainly have better things to do with his life than spend itbehind bars. And if I happen to be tired, or worried about some relativelytrivial problem, and then I remember Ira's present predicament, I am instantlyrestored to an objective view of my situation. My own problems are reduced to asize that makes them almost invisible.Gary Lachman believes, and I concur, that some basic changes have happened inhuman consciousness over the past four thousand years: the change to reflectiveself-awareness that occurred with what Julian Jaynes calls “the breakdown of thebicameral mind” around 1250 B.C., the change to “perspectival consciousness” atsome time around 1336, when Petrarch climbed Mount Ventoux, and the astonishingchange that occurred around 1750 with the birth of Romanticism.If Gebser is correct, the greatest change is yet to occur. This is the change to“integral consciousness,” defined by Georg Feuerstein as “consciousness thatdoes not seek escape from the present.”That is why it seems to me that it is wholly appropriate that Gebser shouldoccupy the place he does, at the end of this book, where the reader will be in aposition to judge the remarkable extent of his contribution. For to grasp whatis meant by integral consciousness is to have taken the most important steptoward achieving it."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]CONSCIOUSNESS EXPLAINEDIn 1994 Francis Crick, who with James Watson and Maurice Wilkins won the NobelPrize for discovering the structure of the DNA molecule, published a book withthe intriguing title The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for theSoul. That hypothesis, to quote from Crick, runs as follows:You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and ambitions, your sense ofpersonal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behaviour of avast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.1[../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-1]The average reader, awed by Crick's scientific credentials, may indeed have beenastonished by this pronouncement and may have absorbed Crick's ambitiousstatement with little difficulty. After all, Crick had discovered DNA, and ifthe proteins locked into the spiral staircase of the DNA molecule can beresponsible for life itself, then surely it is no great step to map out howother molecules could be the source of “personal identity” and “freewill”—could, in fact, be the building blocks of “you” and “me.” Indeed, foranyone aware of the history of science, Crick's hypothesis would not seemastonishing at all. For the past four hundred years, science has been trying toaccount for everything—including ourselves—in terms of atoms or molecules andthe laws they adhere to, and Crick's “astonishing hypothesis” is merely part ofa long attempt to excise all that is “merely subjective” from our account of theworld.But for some other readers, what may have been astonishing about Crick'shypothesis is that he expected anyone to believe it at all. For this group, “TheIncredible Hypothesis” would have been a better title. Their immediate responseto Crick's hypothesis, like my own, was probably a gut feeling that, for all hisundoubted knowledge about molecular biology, when it came to explaining you orme he was no more qualified than anyone else. My joys and sorrows, memories andambitions, sense of identity and feeling of free will are nothing but theproducts of nerve cells and molecules? Somehow, I just can't accept that. Andeven if it were true, wouldn't Crick's ideas about these things themselves benothing more than the behavior of his nerve cells and molecules? And if thatwere true, why should I or anyone else pay any special attention to them? Afterall, nerve cells are nerve cells, and molecules are molecules, no?Yet, as anyone familiar with the subject knows, “explaining consciousness” isprobably the hottest item on philosophical and scientific agendas today, asurprising turnaround if you look at the history of academic psychology in thelast century. For years the idea of discussing consciousness “scientifically”was unheard of. For most scientists, consciousness was, at best, anepiphenomenon, like the steam given off by boiling water. But today all that haschanged. According to one biologist and neuroscientist, the 1990s were thedecade of the brain, with the 2000s set to be the decade of consciousness.2[../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-2] Hundreds of journals and Web sites devoted tosome aspect of “brain studies” publish thousands of research papers each year.Enter the keyword “consciousness” into the computer catalog at the BritishLibrary in London, where I am writing this, and you receive a list of more thanone thousand titles, many of them published in the last five years. There arebooks arguing that consciousness can best be described as a kind of computer,books arguing that computers themselves will soon be conscious, and some, likeMarvin Minsky's The Society of Mind, even arguing that they already are. Someneuroscientists argue that free will is located in a specific area of the brain(for Crick it is in a deep fold of the cerebral cortex called the anteriorcingulate sulcus). Some, like Gerald Edelman, another Nobel Prize winner, denythat consciousness or the brain is anything like a computer, arguing that it ismuch more like a cerebral jungle in which different “neuronal ensembles” fightit out Darwinian style, the survivors being selected as members of “neuronalnets,” one function of which is consciousness. Others, like Roger Penrose, agreethat the brain isn't a computer and argue that no computer can ever beconscious, emphasizing that consciousness is deeply involved in both quantummechanics and the intricacies of Gödel's theorem. There is even, as in the workof one influential philosopher of mind, a desire to “eliminate” consciousnessaltogether—a project that harkens back to the 1920s and the behaviorism of thepsychologist J. B. Watson. Watson argued that he never saw any evidence forconsciousness and hence concluded that it therefore did not exist—at least notin any scientific sense. This hard-to-swallow notion is the central thesis ofConsciousness Explained (1992) by the philosopher Daniel Dennett, probably themost influential and certainly the strangest book in the “reducingconsciousness” genre; its five hundred dense pages are devoted to the oddproposition that consciousness doesn't really exist. What does exist for Dennettare robot zombies—ourselves—who only think they are conscious and havesubjective experiences ... but then whom does he want to explain consciousnessto, if, like himself, his readers are not really conscious?Exactly why Dennett wants to eliminate consciousness is unclear. Perhaps heshares the sensibility of Nicholas Humphrey, another thinker attempting to putthe ghost of consciousness to rest (Soul Searching, 1995). Eager to jettisonanything reminiscent of the “supernatural,” Humphrey once remarked, “Unexplainedsubjective experience arouses an irritation in me.”3[../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-3] Even after making allowances for scientificzeal, there is something disquieting about this statement. Curiosity, yes,wonder too. Awe, and even a nerdish desire to “know how it works.” Butirritation? Why should my enjoyment of a Beethoven string quartet—which, atheart, strikes me as a delightful mystery—bother Nicholas Humphrey? Why shouldsubjective experience irritate anyone? Clearly such an attitude would not havemuch use for love if it had to explain the emotions of the person professing it.Why this troubling itch to explain our interior world, which ultimately means toreduce it to something wieldy, controllable—in short, to have power over it?In The Mystery of Consciousness John Searle, a critic of Dennett and one of theleading academic thinkers on consciousness, remarks, “Future generations, Isuspect, will wonder why it took us so long in the twentieth century to see thecentrality of consciousness in the understanding of our very existence as humanbeings.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-4] But any reader of the variouswisdom traditions of the West and East, or of the large literature onconsciousness that has emerged from the different “alternative schools” thathave risen since the 1960s, will wonder why Searle believes we are just nowfinding out about “the centrality of consciousness.” Ideas about consciousnessand “altered states” have formed an underground current in Western thought sincewell before the nineteenth century. Only for academics like Searle isconsciousness a new problem, and perhaps only for thinkers like him is it a“problem” at all. Although Searle thinks the idea of eliminating mental statesis a mistake, his own thinking about consciousness has no hesitations aboutmaking sweeping statements that seem to reduce its stature. “We have to . . .start,” he tells us, “with the assumption that consciousness is an ordinarybiological phenomenon comparable with growth, digestion, or the secretion ofbile,”5 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-5] an analogy first proposed by theeighteenth-century French physiologist Pierre Cabanis. Searle has also likenedconsciousness to the process of photosynthesis,6[../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-6] an analogy he shares with Daniel Dennett. Andin possibly the only thought on which he agrees with Dennett, Searle toobelieves that the sense of mystery is absent from our account ofphotosynthesis.7 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-7] Soon, he believes, it willbe gone from consciousness too.How strongly Searle believes that we are on the brink of demystifyingconsciousness—and, again, by extension, ourselves—can be seen in the concludingchapter of The Mystery of Consciousness: “How to Transform the Mystery ofConsciousness into the Problem of Consciousness.” Throughout the book, Searlefrequently repeats statements like “It is just a plain fact about nature thatbrains cause consciousness.” “The problem of consciousness is the problem ofexplaining exactly how neurobiological processes in the brain cause oursubjective states of awareness.” “We know in fact that brain processes causeconsciousness.”8 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-8] In fact, as David Chalmersof the University of Arizona, one of the few philosophers of mind who is notinterested in “explaining” consciousness—and whom Searle singles out for aparticularly hostile treatment—remarks, Searle repeats the dictum “The braincauses consciousness” like a kind of mantra.But exactly how much brain we need for consciousness is itself an open question.In After Life: In Search of Cosmic Consciousness, a critical account of thenear-death experience, science writer David Darling writes of some now largelyforgotten but clearly remarkable cases of hydrocephalus, the condition known aswater on the brain. In the cases he recounts, however, the people involved didnot have water on the brain, but apparently had water instead of a brain.Nevertheless they functioned as perfectly normal, intelligent human beings.Darling speaks of two children born in the 1960s who “had fluid where theircerebrums should have been. . . . Although neither child showed any evidence ofhaving a cerebral cortex, the mental development of each appeared perfectlynormal.”9 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-9] In another case, a man with an IQof 126, a graduate of the University of Sheffield with a first-class honorsdegree in mathematics, and by all accounts bright and perfectly ordinary, had nodetectable brain. Identical twin girls with advanced hydrocephalus enjoyed aboveaverage IQs. In one case, an autopsy performed on a young man who had diedsuddenly revealed “only the most paltry rind of brain tissue.” When the coronerexpressed sympathy for the parents' loss, but offered that at least now theirseverely retarded son had found peace, the parents were dumbfounded, informinghim that their bright son had been at his job only days before.10[../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-10] Although the paper reporting these casesreceived some attention at the time, it was subsequently forgotten, its findingsjust too contrary to the reigning scientific orthodoxy. Yet such cases at thevery least suggest that the mantra “The brain causes consciousness” is perhapsnot as incontrovertible as its adherents believe, and that, to put it crudely,the possibility of consciousness existing without a brain should not becompletely ruled out.11 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-11]Searle, however, is adamant, believing that our sense of mystery aboutconsciousness is a “genuine obstacle” to answering the “causal question” aboutit and that this sense of mystery will evaporate once we have a reasonablyplausible explanation about how the brain causes consciousness. This hurdle isknown as “the hard problem.” How do firing neurons become subjective experience?How do Crick's physical molecules become curiously meaningful but intangible“things” like the scent of a rose, a nightingale's song, or the feel of yourlover's touch? No one really knows, and as long as the slightest atmosphere ofmystery remains about our subjective experience, there will always beindividuals like me who believe that the entire scientific project of explainingconsciousness is misguided. To us, explaining consciousness would be the same as“explaining” a Bach cantata or van Gogh's sunflowers. Who would want to? And, inany case, how could they be explained, and how would any such explanation beuseful?Not all contemporary explorers of consciousness share this vision of ademystified consciousness. There are a handful who don't believe that sciencecan ever solve the “hard problem.” Thinkers of this persuasion have beenchristened “mysterians” by their more optimistic brethren. David Chalmers, forexample, insists that no matter how much we may learn about the brain, an“explanatory gap” still stretches between the various physical processes and oursubjective experience. Purely physicalistic theories, Chalmers argues, cannotbridge the gap, and his own approach in many ways harkens back to ancient ideasof panpsychism, the notion, shared by premodern thinkers and by sometwentieth-century philosophers like Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead,that in some way everything participates in consciousness. Such views do awaywith the dreaded mind-body dualism by arguing that consciousness is not simply aproperty of brains, but exists in some form throughout creation. Most scientistsand philosophers find this idea repellent, yet it is simply the opposite side ofthe coin of views like Dennett's that would do away with consciousnessaltogether. Strangely, for them it is more repellent to think that everything isconscious than to think that nothing is.What really bothers “explainers” is that at bottom one can never “know,” withthe kind of certainty one can know a physical fact, that anyone other thanoneself actually is conscious. We cannot see, touch, hear, smell, taste, or feelsomeone else's consciousness—nor our own for that matter. It is conceivable thatan android could be designed that would, for all intents and purposes, appearconscious, yet have no subjective experience at all. There would be no way ofknowing through the senses alone that this android was not conscious. All of itsactions could be programmed in such a way that it would appear to be just likeyourself, an individual with some kind of subjective experience takingplace—metaphorically at least—inside its head. But there wouldn't be. Such apossibility, planted in a suggestible mind, can easily lead to a nasty case ofparanoia. Yet some scientists skate fairly close to this edge. To my mind, thissays more about the peculiarities of a particular “scientific” sensibility,hungry for absolute certainty, than it does about any “problem ofconsciousness.”Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]This book is not about “explaining consciousness,” nor is it in any way a“scientific” account of the brain or our interior world. There are many ofthese, excellent ones written by abler hands than mine. On the contrary, one ofmy motives in writing this book is to argue that the current monopoly onconsciousness by scientists and academic philosophers is unfounded, and that awhole history of thought about consciousness and its possible evolution is leftout of their “official” accounts. There is what I call a “secret history ofconsciousness,” and in what follows I will try to bring some of this secrethistory to light. This is not to say that the scientific study of consciousnessshould be abandoned. That would be absurd and as reductive as the approaches toconsciousness I have mentioned. What is important is to integrate what sciencetells us about the brain and mind into a wider perspective, a larger image ofhumanity's history and a broader vision of its future.In this book I focus on what we can broadly call the esoteric, spiritual, ormetaphysical tradition, although not all of the thinkers discussed would placethemselves within this camp. I have done this because in that traditionconsciousness, far from being explained, is instead the central player in thedrama. To put it simply, if in current scientific accounts consciousness isexplained in terms of molecules and neurons, in the countertraditionconsciousness itself is responsible for those neurons and molecules. For thematerialist, matter comes first, consciousness second; for the countertradition,consciousness comes first. And what is more, for the countertraditionconsciousness is not a static “product” of the brain, but a living, evolvingpresence whose development can be traced through different historical periods.No one speaks of an evolution of bile, in the sense that within it remainpotentials and possibilities yet to be discovered. For the secret history ofconsciousness, however, the paramount idea is that human beings as they are, arenot an end point of evolution and their consciousness as it is, is not a final,randomly achieved state. For the secret history of consciousness the possibilityremains that human beings may evolve into something very different and that theform that difference will take may be a new, broader, more expansiveconsciousness, manifestations of which have appeared in the past and continue toappear in the present. What exactly that consciousness may be like and how itmay be achieved are some of the questions this book will discuss.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]The characteristics of this new consciousness have been known for centuries.Mystics have spoken of them, and since at least the 1960s ideas of “higherconsciousness” or “altered states of consciousness” have been part of our commonlanguage. Recently, science too seems to support their existence. In her bookSQ: Spiritual Intelligence, The Ultimate Intelligence, the physicist Danah Zoharspeaks of the work of the Austrian neuroscientist Wolf Singer, whose specialtyis what is known as “the binding problem.” How does the brain fuse the disparateinformation coming from the senses into a comprehensible whole? Singer and hiscolleagues in Frankfurt studied visual perception and suggested that theneurological aspect of “binding” may lie in the synchronized firing of neuronsin separate areas of the brain. Singer found that separate neurons located indifferent parts of the brain responsive to color, shape, and movement firesimultaneously at forty hertz, i.e., forty firings per second. Although manyresearchers doubt the importance of the finding, this neural oscillation atforty hertz seems to be associated with consciousness. Singer's work suggeststhere is a process in the brain that is itself antireductionist and is concernedwith creating wholes out of parts, and hence with giving meaning to ourexperience. Without it the world would appear a random eruption of information:in other words, chaos. “Meaning” then is not something we import into the world,as some scientists and philosophers have argued.12[../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-12] There literally would be no “world” withoutit. Zohar further suggests the state of inner and outer unity experienced bypractitioners of meditation is paralleled by the “unity” of oscillatingneurons.13 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-13] During meditation, brain wavesbecome more coherent and are accompanied by the forty-hertz oscillations. Thesubjective experience of unity, Zohar points out, is accompanied by a physicalunity in the brain. This simultaneous processing of information, she suggests,is an indication of a “third kind of thinking,” what she calls our “SQ,” orspiritual quotient, to differentiate it from IQ and recent ideas of an“emotional quotient.” Rather than reducing our inner states to the behavior ofmolecules and neurons, or eliminating them altogether, Singer's work onsynchronized neural oscillations lends a neurological support to perhaps ourmost valued inner state of all, the mystical sensation of unity.Other researchers point in similar directions. The neuroscientists Denis Pareand Rodolfo Llinas have argued that consciousness, rather than being anepiphenomenon given off by firing neurons, seems to be an inherent property ofthe brain itself. Their research supports a view of consciousness and the mindheld by mystics throughout the ages: that the world we perceive is actuallyshaped by our consciousness. Recognizing that the forty-hertz oscillationsassociated with consciousness occur during REM sleep, Llinas concluded that theonly difference between our dreaming and waking states is that in waking states,the “closed system that generates oscillatory states” is modulated by incomingstimuli from the outside world. Consciousness, then, is not “caused” by sensorystimuli “writing” on the blank slate of the mind, as philosophers like JohnLocke supposed. It is an irreducible process in the brain itself. Althoughmaterialist scientists think a hard, unyielding reality pulls the strings ofconsciousness, the external world we perceive through our senses may really be akind of waking dream, formed by a consciousness that happens to be aware ofit.14 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-14]Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]A very similar idea was proposed by a philosopher that probably very fewstudents of consciousness are aware of. In his little read Essay on the Originof Thought (1974), which I discuss in Part Four of this book, the Danishphilosopher Jurij Moskvitin proposed a theory of consciousness that is veryclose to Llinas and Pare's, and echoes the intuitions of dozens of mysticalthinkers. For Moskvitin our consciousness of the outside world is a kind ofhallucination, but one, as Llinas and Pare suggest, shaped by stimuli from thesenses. Moskvitin was led to this conclusion not through studying the brain, butby becoming aware of unconscious processes in perception. Sitting in the sun ona spring day, he drifted into a dreamy, yet alert state of relaxation. With hiseyelids almost closed, he became interested in the play of sunlight on hiseyelashes and in the curious movement of what are called “floaters” on hisretina, little “bubbles” on the surface of the eye, reminiscent of raindropsrolling down a windowpane. Focusing on these, Moskvitin became aware that theprismatic display caused by the sunlight passing through his eyelashes was notrandom, but formed geometric patterns, crosses, squares, and triangles. Watchingthe “strange and beautiful patterns” gave him “the feeling of watching somethingparticularly significant”; he then realized that the patterns were not limitedto the surface of his eye, but seemed to extend from his eye and to be projectedby it to the outside world in the form of “sparks” and “cobwebs.” He writes ofseeing these “selective forms” taking shape as the external world, comparing itto the effect of a pointillist painting.Moskvitin spent many hours studying these patterns, commenting on the curiousstates of mind that accompanied extended observation of the selective forms. Hesoon noticed that the attention required to observe the forms “was inseparablefrom a very particular mood . . . and gave rise to a sensation of pleasure andoutbursts of the most remarkable thoughts.” He also realized that “the patternsto which I had gained access were so similar to certain patterns in art,especially in religious art, or art . . . created by civilizations dominated bymystical experience, that I could not doubt that my experience was a very oldone and widely known.”15 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-15]Moskvitin believes that his selective forms are the work of the human mind andthat they extend from “creating” the world we perceive through our senses to thecreative insights of artists and scientists. They are, he argues, responsiblefor language, civilization, and human evolution itself. They are alsoresponsible for dreams and hallucinations. Like Llinas and Pare, Moskvitinargues that in dreams, visions, hallucinations, and other altered states, theselective forms are, as it were, free, and it is through their unrestrictedexpression that novelty enters the world. He further concludes that all attemptsto find our origin in the outside world must fail, since the opposite seems tobe the case: the world has its origin in us. Human consciousness, he argues, isa kind of blind spot in the universe, a black hole at whose center we will findthe mind. One of the aims of this book is to see if Moskvitin is right.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]The study and exploration of consciousness, as opposed to the attempt to explainit, has a long and fascinating history. In the form of religious and spiritualpractices it reaches back thousands of years—Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity,Islam, and Judaism all have traditions centered on the investigation of interiorstates. But as a philosophical and scientific pursuit linked to the idea ofevolution, its roots go back only to the late nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies. Since the 1960s, ideas about “higher” and “expanded” consciousnesshave made many inroads into mainstream culture; yet few people who practicevarious forms of “consciousness technology” today are aware, I think, of thebackground to their interests nor know that some of the most influential peoplein academic and intellectual circles in the early part of the last century—likethe philosopher Henri Bergson and the psychologist William James—were deeplyinvolved in the study of mysticism and altered states of consciousness. In PartOne, “The Search for Cosmic Consciousness,” I go into some detail about theideas and cultural milieu involved in these early journeys into the mind. Theideas about consciousness discussed at that time, like those discussed today,were not limited to a closed, restricted study; they broke out of the academy totouch on vital issues in social theory, the arts, anthropology, philosophy,psychology, and other important areas. At the beginning of the twentiethcentury, consciousness and its possibilities seemed to present humanity with anew future, with new potentialities, and—in a phrase that has come to meansomething quite different for us—with a “new age.”During the same period, esotericism entered the main currents of modern thought.To be sure, for centuries the “esoteric tradition” had been a powerful source ofideas and inspiration, influencing many of the greatest thinkers of the West—asI note in the book, even as “modern” and “rational” a figure as Isaac Newton wasas devoted to alchemy and other “occult” studies as he was to the scientificpursuits he is known for today. But I think it can be said that, withinrelatively modern times, until the appearance of Madame Blavatsky and Theosophy,esoteric thought functioned primarily as an underground current. By the earlytwentieth century this was no longer true, and as I try to make clear, it wasprecisely in reaction to the rise of modern ideas of evolution that thatformidable Russian lady presented her remarkable teachings on humanity's cosmicdestiny. For a brief period in the early twentieth century, scientific,philosophical, and esoteric ideas about the human being's possible evolution metin a heady mélange of insight and speculation. P. D. Ouspensky, who straddledthe scientific and esoteric worlds, has a prominent role in Part One.Another figure who straddled both worlds was Rudolf Steiner. In Part Two,“Esoteric Evolution,” I examine some aspects of Steiner's ideas aboutconsciousness in light of the influence on his thought of Goethe'sphenomenology, as well as from the perspective of recent investigations into thecurious condition of mind known as the “hypnagogic state.” “Hypnagogia,” sochristened by its most thorough investigator, Andreas Mavromatis, is a uniquestate of consciousness, in between sleeping and waking. As I try to show,Mavromatis argues persuasively that in hypnagogia distinctions between theunconscious and the conscious, between dreaming and waking, break down, and thatin the not-too-distant future, human beings may be able to experience bothstates simultaneously, in a kind of “duo-consciousness.” That Steiner himselfsuggested something very similar, and that Mavromatis's work is based on ananalysis of the structure of the brain itself, offers, I think, good evidencethat such ideas are grounded in something more than mere speculation. Mavromatisargues that hypnagogic states are linked to the brain's “pre-cortical”structures, known collectively as the “old brain,” and suggests that at anearlier time human consciousness may not have been the clear, distinct “wakingstate” it is today—an idea he shares with Rudolf Steiner.In Part Three, “The Archaeology of Consciousness,” I examine the evidence forthe kind of consciousness our ancient and prehistoric ancestors might haveexperienced. If consciousness has evolved—a central theme of this book—then wehave gotten to where we are today by passing through earlier stages. That theseearlier stages are recapitulated in the consciousness of children—as ErichNeumann and other psychologists have argued—suggests that they are still a partof our “mature” psyches. By looking into our personal “prehistory,” we may gainsome insight into how consciousness might have felt in the past. The acceptedview is that civilization and history began in 3100 B.C. with the unification ofUpper and Lower Egypt. But there is much evidence to suggest that civilizationsexisted prior to this date, and that at some point a split occurred in humanconsciousness, precipitating the development of the ego and the world that weexperience today.What consciousness may have been like before this split, and what it may be likein the future, is the subject of Part Four, “Participatory Epistemology.” Here Ifocus on the work of three thinkers whose ideas center around the latentpotentials of the imagination. Owen Barfield shows that the history of languagecan tell us much about the evolution of consciousness. As he wrote in his lastbook, History, Guilt, and Habit, “Language contemplated is a mirror of myconsciousness and its evolution.”16 [../Text/part0040.html#intro-FN-16] Just asthe external world of mountains and cities is made up of layers and layers oftime, geological and historical, Barfield demonstrates how the language weinhabit—as fish inhabit water—is made up of different strata of consciousness.(And just as fish do not notice the water they move through, we, Barfieldsuggests, are hardly aware of the meaning of the language we use.) JurijMoskvitin discovered something similar about our mechanisms of perception andthe relationship of consciousness to the external world as a whole. As his workis practically unknown outside of a few readers, I discuss some of its basicthemes at great length, particularly his, to my mind, convincing argumentsagainst the intelligibility of any attempt to explain consciousness in purelymaterialist, scientific rationalist terms. One of the few thinkers to appreciateMoskvitin's insights was Colin Wilson, who has grappled with the problem ofconsciousness for nearly half a century. In his ideas about “Faculty X” and ourability to escape the limits of the present and experience “other times andplaces,” we get a glimpse of some of the powers, now dormant but possibly soonactive, latent in the human mind.Part Five, “The Presence of Origin,” focuses solely on the work of one thinker,the cultural philosopher Jean Gebser. Although in recent years Gebser's work hasgained a wider readership, he is still relatively unknown to many peopleinterested in ideas about the evolution and history of consciousness. Gebser isbest known to English-speaking readers for his mammoth work The Ever-PresentOrigin, first published in 1949 but translated into English only as recently as1984. It is a demanding, daunting work that I discuss at some length, firstbecause his ideas deserve to be better known; and second because they seem to meto be perhaps the most thoroughly argued and impressively documented caseavailable for the evolution—or, as Gebser calls it, the “mutation”—ofconsciousness. (This is not to say that I think Gebser's account is “right,”only that he presents highly persuasive and convincing evidence.) Throughout thebook, where it seemed helpful, I have included some brief biographical material;in Gebser's case I have done so more than in others. His life is an inspiringand exciting embodiment of an idea too often ignored in our less naïve (readcynical) times: that philosophy is to be lived, not merely thought. That manymore of us may be faced with this ennobling obligation, and how we may fulfillit, is the subject of the concluding words.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]It may not be redundant to remark that the ideas about consciousness I discussin this book are only a fraction of the many that have been thought, and whoseimplications and possibilities enrich our lives. Were I to include everythingargued about consciousness, even beginning as recently as the consciousnessexplosion of the 1960s and '70s, this book would become either an encyclopediaor a lengthy but shallow survey. As with most things, personal preference andinterest has guided me. The virtue of this is, I hope, a certain depth andpassion; the vice is exclusion. The secret history of consciousness presentedhere is, of course, only one. There are many others. I look forward to as manyas possible being brought into the light of day."},{"pageContent":"PART ONEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE SEARCH FOR COSMIC CONSCIOUSNESS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]R. M. BUCKE AND THE FUTURE OF HUMANITYIn 1901 a book with the intriguing title Cosmic Consciousness appeared inPhiladelphia in a limited edition of five hundred copies. Its author was RichardMaurice Bucke, a doctor and former medical superintendent of the asylum for theinsane in London, Ontario. Although at first the book made little impression onthe reading public, interest in its remarkable claim—that humanity was slowlyevolving into a new, higher level of consciousness—attracted attention, and soonits readers included the psychologist William James and the esoteric philosopherP. D. Ouspensky. More than half a century later it had acquired even greaterpopularity. By 1966 Cosmic Consciousness had gone through twenty-six printingsand had become, along with Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha, Aldous Huxley's The Doorsof Perception, and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of The Rings, part of the canonof works firing the imagination of a burgeoning counterculture.Bucke's background was not what one might expect for the head of an insaneasylum, nor, for that matter, the author of a book arguing that the human racewas moving into a higher state of consciousness. Born in 1837 to English parentswho soon after emigrated to Canada, Bucke left home at seventeen after the deathof his stepmother and spent the next four years piling up enough adventures fora dozen enterprising young men. Crossing the border into the United States, hetravelled across the country, working at a variety of jobs. He was a gardener inOhio, a railway man in Cincinnati, and a deckhand on a Mississippi steamboat,before finally signing on as a driver on a wagon train heading across the GreatPlains to the edge of Mormon territory, today part of Nevada. The journey toSalt Lake took five months, and in the 1850s it was a dangerous business. Forthe last twelve hundred miles there were no white settlements and the Indians,resentful of the white man's incursion, were not particularly friendly. Afterthis Bucke crossed the Rockies, was attacked by Shoshone Indians, and nearlystarved, living for a time on flour and hot water. He then settled down as agold miner. During an attempt to cross a mountain chain in winter, his partnerdied, and Bucke himself was about to follow when he was discovered by a miningparty. Both of his feet were frozen, and all of one foot and part of the otherhad to be amputated. Bucke was twenty-one, and for the rest of his life onlyoccasionally would he be free from physical pain.Yet Bucke had the optimism and determination associated with the expandingUnited States in the nineteenth century, and this same optimism led him to hismaster thought, the notion that humanity was evolving into a higher form ofconsciousness. An inheritance paid his way through medical school andpostgraduate work in England, France, and Germany. In 1864 he settled in Canadaand set up shop. By 1876 he had been appointed superintendent of an asylum forthe insane in Hamilton, Ontario; the next year he moved to London. He wasappointed professor of mental and nervous diseases at Western University. In1888 he was elected president of the Psychological Section of the BritishMedical Association, and in 1890 was given a similar honor by the AmericanMedico-Psychological Association. By the end of the century, Bucke wasconsidered one of North America's foremost “alienists”—the term used for doctorsof the mind before “psychologist” came into use—and this standing amongprofessionals helped his extraordinary ideas about human evolution gain ahearing they might otherwise have lacked.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-1]Bucke's tenacity and application give the impression of a highly practical man,down-to-earth with an eye to business, suggesting that the picture of him as aphilosopher of a radical shift in human consciousness is somewhatincongruous—although the portrait of him in Cosmic Consciousness, with hisflowing white beard and longish hair, does suggest the air of a prophet. Yetthere was another side to Bucke. Growing up on a backwoods Canadian farm, hedeveloped a sensitivity to nature and experienced a powerful curiosity about thebasic mysteries of life. At about the age of ten he felt a strange ecstasy andlonging about the notion of death, and was eager to discover if he could findanswers to questions about “the beyond.” Although for the most part uneducatedat this time, he was a voracious reader of poetry and in later life was known tohave memorized whole volumes of it. Bucke's father, a graduate of TrinityCollege, Cambridge, had himself mastered seven languages, and when he moved theyoung family from England to the wilds of Ontario he brought a library of somethousand volumes. Bucke grew up in an atmosphere of rugged hands-on experiencesoftened by literary discussion; more than likely it was this that prepared himfor his later work as a visionary and prophet.The first sign of that vocation appeared in 1867 when a visitor to Bucke's homequoted some of the poetry of Walt Whitman. The effect was immediate. We do notknow which of Whitman's expansive verses was recited, but Bucke was bowled overby it and from that moment considered himself the poet's disciple. The encounterprompted a wide reading in history, philosophy, and science, and for yearsafterward Bucke suffered “an unappeasable hunger for enlightenment on the basicproblems.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-2] Ten years later Bucke met Whitmanand became a central figure in the circle around the poet, even treating him inhis medical capacity, successfully, as Whitman later claimed the doctor savedhis life. One of the volumes of poetry Bucke was reported to know by heart wasWhitman's Leaves of Grass, a remarkable achievement by any standard.Five years after his introduction to Whitman's poetry, Bucke had the experiencethat set him on his life's work and contributed to the language a phrase mostpeople use without the slightest idea of its origin. In his thirty-fifth year,during a visit to England, he had his illumination. After an evening spentreading Wordsworth, Shelly, Keats, Browning, and, of course, Whitman, Bucke lefthis friends around midnight and settled into his hansom cab for the drive to hishotel. The night of poetry had left him calm, and his mind was full of the ideasand feelings stimulated by the evening's discussion. He felt himself in a stateof “quiet, almost passive, enjoyment.”And then it happened:All at once, without warning of any kind, he [Bucke wrote his account in thethird person] found himself wrapped around, as it were, by a flame-coloredcloud. For an instant he thought of fire—some sudden conflagration in the greatcity. The next instant he knew that the light was within himself.Directly after there came upon him a sense of exaltation, of immense joyousness,accompanied or immediately followed by an intellectual illumination quiteimpossible to describe. Into his brain streamed one momentary lightning-flash ofthe Brahmic Splendour which ever since lightened his life. Upon his heart fellone drop of the Brahmic Bliss, leaving thenceforward for always an aftertaste ofHeaven. Among other things he did not come to believe, he saw and knew that theCosmos is not dead matter but a living Presence, that the soul of man isimmortal, that the universe is so built and ordered that without peradventureall things work together for the good of each and all, that the foundationprinciple of the world is what we call love and that the happiness of every oneis in the long run absolutely certain.“The supreme occurrence of that night,” Bucke said, was his “initiation to thenew and higher order of ideas.” Within the few seconds that his illuminationlasted, as his cab carried him across a sleeping London, Bucke learned more than“in previous months or years of study,” as well as “much that no study couldever have taught.”3 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-3]Nowadays Bucke's experience would be chalked up to the brain's reported “Godspot” or, less generously, to temporal lobe epilepsy.4[../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-4] For Bucke it was the first glimpse of the futureof humanity.We can assume Bucke discussed his experience among friends, certainly among thepeople who gathered around his mentor Whitman. But more than twenty years passedbefore he presented a version of it to his peers. In May of 1894, Bucke read apaper on “Cosmic Consciousness” at the annual meeting of the AmericanMedico-Psychological Association. Later, in August of that year, in hispresidential address to the British Medical Association in Montreal, heelaborated on his theme that a new consciousness had appeared sporadicallythroughout human history, and that its characteristics were becomingincreasingly more common. These were signs, he believed, of a mental evolutionthat would eventually embrace all of humankind, transforming the species andlifting it onto an almost unimaginably higher plane. “Cosmic consciousness,”Bucke believed, would one day be as common as our own self-consciousness is now.And just as the appearance of self-consciousness raised humankind out of thelevel of the brutes, so too cosmic consciousness would raise us incomparablyhigher than the human. Just how high cosmic consciousness would lift the racewould be made clear seven years later, when the fruit of Bucke's extensivelabors was made available to a reading public taking its first steps into thetwentieth century.Although the phrase “cosmic consciousness”—or its shortened version, just plain“cosmic”—would become an all-purpose password for members of the Age ofAquarius, it is interesting and salutary to see what exactly its originatormeant by it. Bucke's account of his “illumination” was to become a classicexample of what was later called “higher consciousness.” Within it were thebasic themes that would recur throughout a century-long discussion of the“evolution of consciousness”: the conviction that “all is good,” that theuniverse is not dead but living, that the human soul is immortal, and, mostimportantly, that the source of the illumination was not outside Bucke, but camefrom within himself. His vision of a living universe was brief, but it hadlasting effect. Among other things, it later helped reconcile him to the earlydeath of his son. In the dedication of Cosmic Consciousness, Bucke wrote,“Through the experiences which underlie this volume I have been taught, that inspite of death and the grave . . . you are not dead and not really absent, butalive and well and not far from me this moment.”The immortality of the human soul, though without doubt high on the list, wasnot the only thing Bucke's first taste of cosmic consciousness convinced him of.He saw the development of consciousness as a gradual ascent from simple senseperception to a broader vision encompassing the entire cosmos. From the bottomup there was, Bucke argued, a kind of inverted pyramid, beginning with thesimplest awareness and broadening with each higher level. There is first what hecalled the perceptual mind, open only to sense impressions, at the level of whathe called the lower animals. Next comes the “receptual mind” of the higheranimals, resulting in simple awareness, the kind of consciousness a dog or catmay enjoy. Above this is the conceptual mind, which only human beings have andwhich produces our unique sense of self-consciousness, our awareness ofourselves, our egos, as separate entities in the world. One of the products ofthis form of consciousness is language, and, in a phrase that presages adiscussion of language and consciousness later in his book, Bucke remarks,“Language is the objective of which self-consciousness is the subjective.”5[../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-5] Possession of language, he argues, opens anunbridgeable chasm between ourselves and the animals, and a similar chasmseparates the few who now experience flashes of the new consciousness fromordinary human beings.Cosmic consciousness, the next level on the pyramid of awareness, “is a higherform of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man.” It is a“consciousness of the cosmos . . . of the life and order of the universe,” whichincludes an “intellectual enlightenment or illumination which alone would placethe individual on a new plane of existence—would make him almost a member of anew species.” And although its appearance then was still a rarity—indeed, in thelast three thousand years Bucke was certain of only fourteen bona fide cases,although there were many more of what he termed “imperfect” examples—“ourdescendants will sooner or later reach, as a race, the conditions of cosmicconsciousness, just as, long ago, our ancestors passed from simple toself-consciousness.”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-6]The result of this, Bucke believed, would be an unalloyed utopia, a veritableheaven on earth. Bucke's visionary streak was not limited to his interest inmystical awareness. Along with cosmic consciousness, he predicted otherrevolutionary changes for the new century. “The immediate future of our race isindescribably hopeful.”7 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-7] The two lesser radicalshifts in human existence that would accompany cosmic consciousness might notmatch it for scope and effect, but they would nevertheless be tremendous. Theestablishment of aerial navigation (just getting off the ground with the WrightBrothers) would abolish national boundaries and make large cities obsolete,allowing many to make their homes in the mountains and on the seashore. Andpeople would be able to enjoy the benefits of the conquest of the air becausethe twentieth century, in Bucke's eyes, would see the rise and triumph ofsocialism. Gone would be crushing toil, and the inequitable distribution ofwealth, and in its place would come a new economic prosperity and social order.Such were the material conditions in which the rise of cosmic consciousnesswould take place.Aware of Bucke's millenarian dream, and of the realities of the last century andof our own, we may feel it almost a blessing that he did not live to see whatthe future actually had in store. His utopianism was not unusual at the end ofthe nineteenth century. At the tail end of the long innings of progress, themixture of science and visionary prophecy that imbued the novels of Jules Verne(soon to find a new voice in H. G. Wells) was taken up by writers not only offiction, but of sociology, science, and politics. The beginning of the twentiethcentury saw a fantastic smorgasbord of new ideas, an exciting, optimistic blendof radical politics, social reform, occult beliefs, and evolutionary vision,which in the years before World War One produced a heady, effervescentatmosphere in which almost anything seemed possible. Bucke's own book was one ofmany arguing, in one way or another, that humanity was maturing and was now ableto take responsibility for its own destiny.Such sentiments were welcomed. In the last years of the nineteenth century, manywere concerned about the deleterious atmosphere of the decadent fin de siècle. Adecade before Bucke, the doctor, journalist, and later Zionist Max Nordau hadrisen to worldwide fame through his book Degeneration (1892), which argued thatthe spirit of the age was rife with exhaustion, hysteria, enervation, andnarcissism, evident in work of obvious “degenerates” like Nietzsche, Ibsen,Wagner, and Baudelaire. Earlier in the century, the book's dedicatee, ProfessorCesare Lombroso (later an advocate of what would come to be calledparapsychology), had advanced a theory about the “criminal type” and itsphysiognomy, and this Nordau applied to the art and literature of his time. Along section of his book is dedicated to mysticism, and he would have surelyclassified Bucke's experience as evidence of degeneration. His attack wasshallow and hysterical and prompted return fire, most effectively in BernardShaw's brilliant essay “The Sanity of Art” (1895). Yet concern about the“devolution” of the white race and the threat to it from foreign influence,whether blacks or the “Yellow Peril,” informed much cultured discussion, and theattraction of a science of human betterment, in the form of eugenics, wasstrong. Bucke's book, with its emphasis on an inspiring, optimistic future, wasembraced by a generation who felt that the cosmos itself was pulling humankindup to a higher level of achievement.Yet the new dawn was brief. By 1914 and the start of the Great War, the beliefin progress, advance, and the perfectibility of humankind that had fueled theEnlightenment as well as more eccentric doctrines like Madame Blavatsky'sTheosophy, had collapsed. Bucke himself died less than a year after thepublication of his book. In February 1902, after an evening discussing thetheory that Francis Bacon was the real author of the Shakespeare plays—Buckefirmly believed he was—he slipped on some ice while gazing at the night sky fromhis veranda; he fell, hitting his head violently against a pillar, and diedalmost immediately. The stars that evening were exceptionally bright in the coldwinter air, and one hopes it was not a momentary flash of cosmic consciousnessthat made Bucke lose his footing.The argument of Cosmic Consciousness is simple. Having himself experienced thereality of this new form of consciousness, Bucke looked back through history tosee if there were other examples of it. As already mentioned, he could, hebelieved, argue successfully that there had been at least fourteen cases of it,ranging from ancient times to his present, with several other near hits, as itwere. Many of the names he includes in his list will be repeated in similaraccounts of a kind of hereditary “chain of illumination,” stretching down thecenturies. Gautama the Buddha, Jesus, St. Paul, the Neoplatonic philosopherPlotinus, Jacob Boehme, William Blake, and, of course, Walt Whitman are allclear examples of full and complete cosmic consciousness. Some readers may notagree with Bucke's choices. Why, for example, is the novelist Honoré de Balzac acase of complete cosmic consciousness, while Emmanuel Swedenborg is classed withthe “Lesser, Imperfect and Doubtful Instances”? Some of Bucke's other choicesalso seem questionable, as do some of his remarks about “primitive” and“backward” races, and his assumption that the Aryans form a recognized “highertype.” But these shouldn't prevent us from grasping his basic thought that adifferent kind of consciousness has appeared in human beings throughout history,nor stop us from appreciating his efforts to provide us with examples. The term“Aryan” was around long before the Nazis appropriated it, and none of Bucke'sexamples of bearers of the new consciousness would have appealed to them asincidences of the “master race.”Although cosmic consciousness denies that life is a chance process occurring ina meaningless universe, Bucke's approach is basically Darwinian. A kind ofsurvival of the fittest provides the physical and mental changes forming thefoundation of cosmic consciousness. Just as the purely perceptual mind evolvedinto the simple consciousness of animals, and that consciousness was transformedinto our self-consciousness, so our self-consciousness is now slowly evolvinginto a wider, more intuitive awareness. The trajectory is that of the simplestsensory awareness slowly widening to include the entire cosmos. Bucke arguesthat as we look back in history the instances of cosmic consciousness seem rare,but in more recent years have increased, and will continue to increase, just asour own self-consciousness was once the property of a few and is now thestandard by which we gauge normality. He points to the development of the colorsense and our appreciation of music as other examples of faculties once absentfrom humankind that we now take for granted. In an example that will be oftenrepeated by other students of the evolution of consciousness, Bucke points outthat the ancient Greeks knew of only three colors, that in both Homer and theBible there is no mention of the blue sky, and that a similar lack of colorwords can be found in ancient texts like the Rig Veda and Zend Avesta. Acomparable situation exists with the appreciation of fragrance.8[../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-8] Bucke's basic scheme is that the history ofconsciousness in the race is paralleled by that in the individual, so thatfaculties like color sense and musical sense appear in the individual at an ageroughly analogous to their appearance in humanity as a whole. A chart on the“Psychogenesis of Man—Illustrated by a Few Faculties” provides the parallels.We may find the chart simplistic and not entirely accurate. The idea that the“musical sense” appears at the age of eighteen seems unsubstantiated by thelarge number of child prodigies, and in my own experience my son had perfectpitch at age two and could carry several tunes. But the basic idea is clear.Cosmic consciousness is not a supernatural power bestowed on the elect few bythe gods. It is a natural outgrowth of the evolutionary process. The individualswho could first discern brighter shades and finer hues must have stood out asfreaks among their fellows, who saw the world in a drab monotone. As it is now,the individuals who today experience cosmic consciousness are a “family sprungfrom, living among, but scarcely forming a part of ordinary humanity, whosemembers are spread abroad throughout the advanced races of mankind.”9[../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-9] The idea that a new race of human beings existstoday side by side with the old humanity is one that we will find in otherwriters as the twentieth century progresses.In individuals, the onset of cosmic consciousness occurs around the thirty-fifthyear, an age that Dante, and later thinkers like C. G. Jung and Rudolf Steiner,thought particularly important. Other factors are necessary, and in spellingthem out Bucke's rhetoric is, we must admit, flowery and sometimes off-putting.Allowances must be made for the “copper-plated” style of the book as a whole,but Bucke's talk of the necessity for an “exalted human personality,” “thesingular perfection of the intellectual and moral faculties,” and an“exceptional physique—exceptional beauty of the build and carriage,exceptionally handsome features, exceptional health, exceptional sweetness oftemper, exceptional magnetism,” strike us as the worst kind of spiritualsnobbery.10 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-10] Likewise his emphasis on the“necessary heredity.” Bucke's earnestness is naïve and innocent of racialprejudice and stems, I think, from a simplistic association between physicalhealth and spiritual advancement that is still common to much New Age thinking.(It is also merely the other side of the coin of Lombroso's belief that the“criminal mentality” could be detected by a recognizably “criminal physique.”)Bucke often gives the impression that a likely candidate for cosmicconsciousness would be a God-fearing, golden-haired bodybuilder, and in the faceof such tedious perfection one often comes away hungry for a degenerate or twoto liven things up.Yet Bucke had certainly tapped into a powerful theme at the right time. Interestin what we call altered states of consciousness had indeed been strongthroughout the nineteenth century. At the time Bucke published his book, one ofthe most popular writers on the subject was Edward Carpenter, who appears inBucke's book as the most recent example of a full instance of cosmicconsciousness. Carpenter was an interesting figure; influential in his own time,he is little read and less discussed today. He is a perfect example of thestimulating blend of progressive ideas, evolutionary vision, mystical doctrines,and radical lifestyle that characterized the pre–World War I version of the NewAge. The author of Whitmanesque verse—Bucke points to his long poem “TowardsDemocracy” as a work in which “the Cosmic Sense speaks”—Carpenter was alsohomosexual and an outspoken advocate of what we would call today “gay rights”(Carpenter's own term was “homogenic love”).11 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-11]In From Adam's Peak to Elephanta (1892), an account of his travels in India,Carpenter gives an extended description of what he calls “consciousness withoutthought.” He speaks of this “higher form of consciousness” in terms similar toBucke's. If it does exist, Carpenter suggests, it is evolving and will evolveslowly over many generations, and its appearance will be just as miraculous asthat of the first incidences of simple sense awareness and self-consciousness.In this new consciousness, the familiar difference between subject and objectfalls away, and Carpenter relates it to several themes that will be picked uplater by the Russian philosopher P. D. Ouspensky, such as the “fourthdimension.” And in another work he speaks of the new consciousness enabling himto see “the interior surfaces of all objects and things and persons.” In thisnew consciousness he is the objects he perceives, and he perceives them in a newsense that is in effect all the senses combined into one, an intimation of the“intuition” that soon would be associated with the work of the philosopher HenriBergson.12 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-12]Carpenter's speculations on “higher consciousness” were not a rarity. AlthoughBucke would probably have rejected them from his canon, accounts of drug use andtheir effect on consciousness became a popular literary form in the nineteenthcentury, most notably in Thomas De Quincey's classic Confessions of an EnglishOpium Eater (1821).13 [../Text/part0040.html#c1-FN-13]De Quincey's narrative of opium addiction, its visionary pleasures and hellishpains, became a much emulated investigation of the unfrequented avenues of humanconsciousness. In 1846 the French poet and novelist Théophile Gautier publishedan account of his experiences as a member of the celebrated Club desHaschischins, inaugurated in Paris by the physician and psychiatristJacques-Joseph Moreau de Tours. Modeled on a romantic version of the medievalIslamic sect known as the Assassins, who were believed to have used hashish intheir initiation ceremonies, the club included among its members CharlesBaudelaire, Gérard de Nerval, Alexandre Dumas, and Honoré de Balzac. (As Balzacwas one of Bucke's fourteen “perfect” cases of cosmic consciousness, it isinteresting to speculate whether Bucke was aware of Balzac's interest inhashish, as it would surely cast doubt on his possession of a singularly perfectmoral faculty and exceptional health.) Most of the people involved in the clubproduced accounts of the resinous herb's effects, Baudelaire's classic essayArtificial Paradise (1851–60) rising above the rest for precision and scientificobjectivity.In 1857 a twenty-one-year-old poet and essayist from Poughkeepsie, New York,named Fitz Hugh Ludlow published, to much acclaim, his unabashedly derivativeThe Hasheesh Eater, being Passages from the Life of a Pythagorean. Ludlow wasclearly aiming at becoming the New World's De Quincey, to whose opium-inspiredphantasies he added philosophical insights originating in Emerson but enlargedby the effects of a large dose of the drug. And hashish was not the onlysubstance offering metaphysical illumination. In 1874 Benjamin Paul Blood, a NewYork farmer, bodybuilder, and calculating prodigy privately published a highlyeccentric account of his experiences under the gas nitrous oxide. In “TheAnesthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy,” Blood claimed that inhalationof laughing gas revealed to him “the Open Secret . . . the primordial, Adamicsurprise of Life.” The philosophical implications of breathing nitrous oxidewere first discovered by Sir Humphrey Davy in 1799 when, after inhaling fourquarts of the gas, he experienced a sense of cosmic expansion, later distilledinto the gnomic revelation, “Nothing exists but thoughts!” But since then, thegas's powers as a spiritual agent had been eclipsed by its efficacy in obviatingthe pain of a still-rudimentary dental procedure. Blood's vision returned thegas to its higher calling, and made the history of metaphysics obsolete, as itprovided an immediate, intense, and unmistakable insight into the true nature ofreality.Blood sent copies of his pamphlet to as many influential people as he couldthink of, and although its message did not reach the world at large, it did fallinto some appreciative hands. Some of these belonged to members of the newlyformed Society for Psychical Research in England, who saw in Blood's ten-yearself-experiment with nitrous oxide a possible means of exploring unusual statesof consciousness with some scientific rigor. Another individual also interestedin psychic phenomena and unusual states of being came upon Blood's revelation ina version of his account published in The Atlantic Monthly. The reader was soimpressed by Blood's experience that he included an excerpt from “The AnestheticRevelation” in his major work, which also discussed the remarkable theory of Dr.R. M. Bucke. The work was entitled The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902),and its author was William James."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]WILLIAM JAMES AND THE ANESTHETIC REVELATIONWilliam James was a philosopher, psychologist, and scientist who appreciated thevalue of modern scientific method but deplored its tendency to declare types ofexperience and phenomena that eluded its methodology “unreal”—a prejudice thatcontinues today in the work of “eliminative materialist” philosophers likeDaniel Dennett. The types of experience and phenomena James had in mind could beroughly characterized as “mystical” or “supernatural.” He was possessed of asingularly curious mind, and was as interested in the mechanisms ofhabit-formation as he was in the possibility of life after death. One of hiscore fascinations was the untapped potentiality of life. In an essay called “TheEnergies of Men” he examined the phenomenon of “second wind” and came to theconclusion that “we live subject to arrest by degrees of fatigue which we havecome only from habit to obey.” James argued that many people may soon learn tolive at a higher level of energy and enthusiasm. Mind cures, positive thinking,hypnosis, telepathy: all found a curious investigator in James. Along with hisfriend and fellow philosopher Henri Bergson, James was committed to a seriousinvestigation of psychic phenomena, and he was anxious to salvage convincingevidence of life's deeper meaning from a scientistic frame of mind determined toreduce it to the effect of molecules in motion. For science to be a true scienceand not a mere prejudice, it had to encompass all experience within its domain,not only what accommodated its methods.James had a more-than-philosophical interest in limiting a reductive science'sencroachment on religious territory, which, among other things, allowed for thepossibility of free will. During a severe bout of depression, he gained controlover his life and renewed his motivation through accepting the possibility offree will, his first act of which was to believe in it. Success in this endeavorprompted his notion of the “will to believe,” which argued that theeffectiveness of a belief is a good gauge of its value as “truth”—the essence ofhis “pragmatism.” The core idea behind James's classic work The Varieties ofReligious Experience (1902) is that “experience” is a more fruitful and solidfoundation for religious belief than metaphysical systems or theologicalarguments, and that the experiences of visionaries and mystics, howeverirrational they may appear, cannot be dismissed in any account of realitypurporting to be “total.”James recognized the need to develop a language that could accommodate theseemingly mutually exclusive claims of materialist science and immaterialreligion. One philosopher, he knew, had done just that—the Germanarch-metaphysician Georg Friedrich Hegel, whose influence stretched across thenineteenth century and whose central work, The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807),is a massive narrative depicting the evolution of consciousness. Yet James'sbasic empirical bent prevented him from accepting Hegel's grand rationalism, andhe was also unable to accept the Hegelian juggling act of maintainingcontradictory assertions simultaneously. Yet this is precisely what heencountered in Blood's anesthetic revelation, which is rife with contradictorystatements that in any normal discourse would cancel each other out. In Blood'svision, however, they act as a kind of propositional ladder, reaching to ahigher, encompassing, all-inclusive reconciliation.Never the armchair traveller, James decided to find out for himself. He madearrangements to inhale the gas. His account of his nitrous oxide experience isone of the classic mystical texts of modern times. It is also one of thefunniest. One of its first benefits was to win him over to the Hegelian point ofview. In his essay “On Some Hegelisms,” James remarks, “I have made someobservations of the effects of nitrous-oxide-gas-intoxication which have made meunderstand better than ever before both the strengths and the weakness ofHegel's philosophy. I strongly urge others to repeat the experiment.”1[../Text/part0040.html#c2-FN-1] The rest of the short essay is an account of howunder the effects of the gas James experienced the reconciliation of oppositesthat Blood described as the essence of the anesthetic revelation. “I have sheetafter sheet of phrases dictated or written during the intoxication,” Jameswrote, “which to the sober reader seem meaningless drivel, but which at themoment of transcribing were fused in the fire of infinite rationality. God anddevil, good and evil, life and death, I and thou, sober and drunk, matter andform, black and white, quality and quantity, shiver of ecstasy and shudder ofhorror, vomiting and swallowing, inspiration and expiration, fate and reason,great and small, extent and intent, joke and earnest, tragic and comic, andfifty other contrasts figure in these pages in the same monotonous way.” Asample of his notes gives an idea of what went racing through his mind as thegas took effect:What's a mistake but a kind of take?What's nausea but a kind of—ausea?2 [../Text/part0040.html#c2-FN-2]To the logical mind, such musings seem errant nonsense, and such was James's ownfeeling when he read back his notes in cold sobriety. What had seemed to himindubitable insights while under the gas were now mute, senseless maunderings.To a more pedestrian mind, this would have been enough to suggest that the senseof utter incontrovertible significance that accompanied inhaling nitrous oxidewas merely an enlarged version of the sentimentality that washes over everydrunkard. But James could not deny that what he saw during his own anestheticrevelation was in some important way true. Indeed, he knew himself that the“sway of alcohol over mankind is unquestionably due to its power to stimulatethe mystical faculties,”3 [../Text/part0040.html#c2-FN-3] that it was the greatexciter of the “Yea-saying” spirit, the emotional reconciliation that was thefirst stage of the stratospheric flights of logical leapfrog to which nitrousoxide had introduced him. “The keynote of the experience,” he wrote, “is thetremendously exciting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination. Truth liesopen to the view in depth beneath depth of almost blinding evidence.”4[../Text/part0040.html#c2-FN-4]Ordinary consciousness, the logical, rational world that we take for granted andaccept as a fundamental reality, was, James discovered, really only a provincialbackwater. Through a slight adjustment, a bit of fine-tuning, a completely“other” kind of consciousness, claiming equal if not more reality, could beexperienced. The import of his intoxicated jottings may have later faded, butone conclusion seemed inescapable. As he wrote in what became an often-quotedprecedent for future explorers of the hidden mind, his nitrous oxide experimentsconvinced him that “our normal waking consciousness, rational consciousness aswe call it, is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about it,parted from it by the flimsiest of screens, there lie potential forms ofconsciousness entirely different.” To the tough-minded reductionist scientistswho wished to reduce consciousness to a negligible by-product—or, worse still,deny it altogether—James retorted, “No account of the universe in its totalitycan be final which leaves these other forms of consciousness quitedisregarded.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c2-FN-5] The experience convinced Jamesthat the conscious person is continuous with a wider, fuller “self” of which oneis usually unaware, but which is made present in moments of crisis, mysticalillumination, or religious conversion; moreover, that “wider self” is itselfconterminous with a “something more” that is active in the universe at large.The similarity of James's thought to Bucke's conclusions is clear. What Jamesbrought to the discussion was an inkling of why “cosmic consciousness” is rare.He argued that one function of consciousness is to carve out of the vast sensoryenvironment—what he called the “blooming, buzzing confusion”—a manageable,edited-down version. Only a limited amount of information reaches our consciousawareness, and for the very good reason that the majority of it is irrelevant.In a fashion similar to the philosopher Edmund Husserl, who argued thatconsciousness is “intentional,” James argued that consciousness selects from theworld at large elements that are of particular value and interest to it. Ourminds are not, as the René Descartes believed, a mirror reflecting the externalworld, nor are they, as John Locke argued, “blank slates” passively written onby experience. Consciousness instead actively chooses from the mass of sensoryinformation what it will attend to, rather as a radio receiver locks onto aparticular broadcast and ignores the dozens of other signals washing over it. Weneed only observe the development of a child's awareness of the world to seethat James is right. We do not come into the world with an interior mirror thataccurately “reflects” the world outside. Our grasp of things is built upgradually, with much practice, and we can all remember when the world we nowmaneuver through with ease was once a frightening, bewildering mystery. One ofthe consequences of acquiring a mastery of our environment is that in theprocess of editing down the barrage of information, we also lose the feeling ofthe freshness of things that we associate with childhood. As the novelist JohnCowper Powys wrote, “How magically sagacious is childhood in its power ofarriving at boundless effects through insignificant means . . . how often thewhole course of one's subsequent history becomes an attempt to regain thissorcery. . . . It is a criminal blunder of our maturer years that we so tamely,without frantic and habitual struggles to retain it, allow the ecstasy of theunbounded to slip out of our lives.”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c2-FN-6] Hence theromantic nostalgia for lost youth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]HENRI BERGSON AND THE ÉLAN VITALThe notion that the function of the brain is essentially eliminative is alsoassociated with James's friend, the French philosopher Henri Bergson. Bergsonhimself was deeply interested in questions of consciousness, evolution, andaltered states of being, and was for a time president of the Society forPsychical Research. It says much for the adventurous spirit of the earlytwentieth century that a public figure of Bergson's stature—he was aworld-renowned philosopher and a national hero in his home country—could devotehimself to pursuits our more narrow and intolerant climate considers laughable.Bergson wrote on dreams, “phantasms of the living,” and in his last book, TwoSources of Morality and Religion (1932), capped off a career arguing for a“creative evolution” by stating bluntly that the universe was a “machine formaking gods.”Bergson came to prominence with his first book, Time and Free Will (1889), inwhich he argued against the “spatialization” or “quantification” of time as itwas perceived in Newtonian science and in our workaday “clock time.” This kindof time, measured in discrete instants, is a product of the intellect, and forBergson it falsified time's true nature, which, he argued, is a seamless,continuous process. Against spatialized clock time, Bergson wrote of what hecalled “duration,” our immediate awareness of inner states. This immediate innerawareness, which we all experience, was, he believed, evidence of life'suniqueness. Psychological “facts,” Bergson argued, are qualitatively differentfrom physical ones, and hence consciousness is an irreducible given, notamenable to scientific determinism.Like James, Bergson was concerned about the shallow scientistic vision thateither treated inner realities as by-products of material processes or deniedthem altogether. He was not, however, antiscience; like James, he absorbed themost recent scientific developments and incorporated them into his work, whichgave it a distinct character of grappling with concrete questions and problems,unlike the abstract Idealism left over from Hegel's heyday. Again like James,Bergson was a “philosopher of life,” both in his absorption in biologicalquestions and in his belief that for philosophy to have value, it must have somereal effect upon our actions. In Matter and Memory (1896), Bergson took on themind-body problem, arguing against the idea of “psychophysiologicalparallelism,” which maintained that every psychological fact is determined bythe physical fact that accompanies it. For instance, he argued that aphasia wasnot loss of memory per se caused by a physical lesion in the brain, but ratherthat the organic damage simply prevented the memory, an immaterial “fact,” frombeing expressed, much as a broken television set prevents a program from beingseen but does not affect the program itself. Hence Bergson came to theconclusion that consciousness uses the brain and is not, as contemporaryphilosophers of mind like John Searle assert, produced by it. It was insightssuch as this that drew Bergson into an interest in the paranormal and the “nightside of nature.”Bergson developed his radical ideas about the role of consciousness and thebrain into a complete evolutionary theory, presented in Creative Evolution(1907), his most widely known work. He accepted Darwin's by-then triumphant ideathat the organic forms of the present had evolved out of much earlier forms overlong periods of time. But like many other thinkers, Bergson was unsympathetic tothe strict determinist interpretation of evolution that had gained scientificsupport and popular credence.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-1] In its place heoffered a vision of a creative impulse, the élan vital or life force,penetrating matter and driving evolution to higher forms of complexity andfreedom. Bergson did, however, borrow one idea from Darwin's later interpreters.For Darwin, evolution proceeds through chance mutations that prove successful inthe struggle to survive; such beneficial adaptations give an organism anadvantage over its competitors. For Darwin's followers, the mind itself was justsuch an adaptation and evolved as a useful tool for dealing with the demands ofthe environment. The intellect, then, was a strictly practical device, and itsuse was solely limited to dealing with the necessities of staying alive. Oneimminently useful way of doing this was to “carve” out of the seamless flow ofexperience, seemingly solid, discrete, and stable objects occupying an extendedspace. It would be most helpful in the struggle for survival to recognize out ofthe “blooming, buzzing confusion” the tiger about to pounce on you, or theantelope you wish to eat. The difference between this kind of consciousness anda cosmic consciousness, open to the influx of the whole, is evident. The brain'sfunction then, for Bergson, was to act as a kind of “reducing valve,” limitingthe amount of “reality” entering consciousness.2 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-2]As he wrote in 1911, “The brain is the organ of attention to life,” and the partit plays is that of “shutting out from consciousness all that is of no practicalinterest to us.”3 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-3]Cosmic consciousness, then, can be seen as a perception of the world not limitedby or filtered through the brain. And as most of us are compelled to “deal with”the world most of the time, it is clear why incidences of cosmic consciousnessare rare. Yet one drawback to the brain's highly efficient ability to focus onnecessities is that it “falsifies” reality, which, as Bergson earlier argued, isin truth a continuous flow of experience. The mind constantly takes snapshots,as it were, of reality, which enables it to orient itself amidst the flux. Theproblem is that science, which takes the most comprehensive snapshots, makes themistake of confusing the photographs with reality itself.We would, it seems, be left in a situation in which we are highly successful atdealing with the world, at the cost of losing contact with its reality. But, asBergson argued in his essay “An Introduction to Metaphysics” (1903), the mindhas another means of “knowing,” aside from the rational intellect. This, heargued, was intuition. Just as we have an immediate, irreducible awareness ofour own inner states, through intuition we have access to the “inside” of theworld. And that inside, Bergson argued, was the élan vital. Through drawing backfrom our habitual gesture of “dealing” with the world, we can, as EdwardCarpenter experienced, discover a kind of consciousness in which subject andobject—we and the world—are “one.” This consciousness, Bergson argues is notnecessarily associated with the brain. He argues that we perceive “virtually”much more than what actually reaches our conscious awareness. This would makesense, since that awareness is subject to the highly efficient editingprocedures of the brain, which limits the amount of input coming to it throughthe senses. The whole past, for example, Bergson believed “still exists, . . .is still present to consciousness in such a manner that, to have the revelationof it, consciousness has no need to go out of itself. . . . It has but to removean obstacle, to withdraw a veil.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-4] Such insightsare the foundation for Marcel Proust's immense novel Remembrance of Things Past,perhaps the most determined effort to put Bergson's ideas into practice. Thenovel begins with the narrator “regaining” the past through the chance taste ofa little cake dipped in tea. Suddenly he is flooded with a rich torrent ofsensation, the memories of his childhood spent in the town of Combray. The“virtual” perceptions, held in check by the brain's reducing valve and nowreleased by the memory that he had tasted such a cake in his youth, come washingover him, filling him with the vivid awareness of, in Colin Wilson's phrase,“other times and places.” The narrator is swept into a version of Bucke's cosmicconsciousness, aware that the stubborn, implacable, poker face of the present isa lie, and that his consciousness has access to a much wider range of time thanhe believed. This notion, of the perpetual “presence of the past,” has widerimplications for the evolution of consciousness, as we will see in ourdiscussions of Madame Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and, later, Colin Wilson's ownwork.For Bergson, “the mental activity of man overflows his cerebral activity.” A“close examination of the life of the mind,” he argues, shows that “there isinfinitely more in a human consciousness than in a corresponding brain.”5[../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-5] Such a psychic overflow, he suggests, could beresponsible for various paranormal phenomena. But as is the case with WilliamJames, Bergson's interest in psychical research, though sincere, was notcentral, and his real concern was with the meaning of human evolution. Bergsonvoiced a question that has been repeated by scores of other thinkers similarlydissatisfied with the strict materialist-mechanistic interpretation ofevolution. If the “aim” of life is to successfully “adapt” to its environment,why did it ever go beyond the amoeba, which is practically immortal and hasproved the successful adapter par excellence? Why has life gone on not only toadapt, which implies an essentially passive, reactive character, but tocomplicate itself more and more dangerously? An Einstein or a Beethoven is a fargreater risk than a colony of single-cell eukaryotes floating in a warm,primeval soup. And why, if the brain is solely an “organ of attention to life,”does it seem to possess a surplus of psychic energy and a multiplicity ofstates, far beyond the needs of simply dealing with the vicissitudes of ahazardous environment? Bergson argued that the defining characteristic of mindis that “it has the faculty of drawing from itself more than it contains.”6[../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-6] This, for the materialist-mechanistic sciencethat wishes to explain consciousness, is an impossibility. A machine only has asmuch energy as is put into it; when my car runs out of gasoline, it doesn'tsuddenly discover a fresh tank hidden away somewhere. Yet we all know from ourown experience that there are moments in our lives when we seem able to callupon energies and resources we were hitherto unaware of; in his essay “TheEnergies of Men,” William James cites several extraordinary examples of thisphenomenon. From a strictly “adaptive” point of view, this is inexplicable.For Bergson, the answer is that “life” is not simply concerned with humbleadaptation, although, of course, adaptation is clearly a useful and profitablemeans of achieving its higher end. And that end, for Bergson, is a continualincrease of freedom and a continual production of novelty. Bergson saw life asan immense current of consciousness, a spiritual force, brimming withpotentialities, penetrating matter and organizing it, “colonizing” it, as itwere, in the service of increasing its own freedom. Matter, resistant to life'simpulses, impedes its advance and scatters its energies. Yet, as he argues inCreative Evolution, this current of consciousness seems to have been successfulin at least three attempts to gain a foothold on matter: in the plant world; inthe world of the insects; and in the vertebrates, who have so far culminated inourselves.For a complete explication of Bergson's theory, the reader will have to go toCreative Evolution itself. Suffice it to say that, for Bergson, in the plantworld what life gained in its ability to transform available, constant energiesinto food—photosynthesis—it lost in its capacity for movement. The vegetableworld has “fallen asleep in immobility,”7 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-7] anidea, as we shall see, that Bergson shares with Rudolf Steiner. In the world ofthe insects, specifically in the ants, what life gained in social organizationand cooperation, it lost in initiative and independence; here instinct rulessupreme, and in as determinant a fashion as the so-called “laws” of physicalscience. The individual counts as nothing. Bergson points out that a speciesthat can claim the entire Earth as its domain must be considered a successful,even “superior” species. This can be said of ourselves, but it can also be saidof the ant. Yet, the ant shows little in the way of intelligence, beingcompletely dominated by instinct; it is robotlike in the relentless carrying outof its routine. There seems little evidence of any possibility of the ant“evolving” into a new level of freedom, and any stray that might feel a spark ofinitiative would be ruthlessly eliminated by its fellows. It is not surprisingthat writers concerned about the increasing collectivization of human societyhave looked to the insects as living metaphors of their fears.But if in both the plant and insect world life's initial impulse has congealed,in the vertebrates Bergson sees at least one channel of life's energy flowing innew directions. If in plants and insects life has “stalled,” in the vertebratesthere still remains the possibility of setting free “something which in theanimal still remains imprisoned and is only finally released when we reachman.”8 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-8] For Bergson, humankind is the front lineof evolution, the tip of the élan vital's advance, the being in which the lifeforce has most successfully organized matter to its own end of increasing itsknowledge of itself and its freedom. Bergson does not say that humankind per seis the “goal” of evolution. His view is not teleological and posits no finalend, which for him would deny life's essentially creative character and reduceevolution to the simple carrying out of a prearranged plan. But he does believethat in human beings the impulse to freedom, novelty, and self-direction hasbroken loose of the weight and restrictions of matter. Sporadically, perhaps,and with many setbacks and retrogressions, but it is in humankind that the forceof life has achieved its greatest inroad into matter. That this is not a “onceand for all” victory, and that the individual and society as a whole are subjectto the automatism that plagues life's earlier expeditions, Bergson was wellaware, and such concerns form the focus of his last book, Two Sources ofMorality and Religion, in which he explores the antagonism between the static,closed society, and the open, dynamic one.9 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-9]That Bergson believed that human beings as they are are not the “end” ofevolution is clear in his notion of a “creative evolution.” What is achieved inhumankind is a release of life's creative impulse, substantially free of therestrictions of the medium of its expression, namely matter. Life needs a securefoothold in matter so that it can concentrate on the real business of evolution:understanding and developing the mind. As long as the necessities of simplystaying alive are paramount, life's advance is stalled: it's hard to writepoetry on an empty stomach, and until it's filled the brain will focus ondealing with things, to the detriment of its perceiving of life's complexity.But when necessities are taken care of, then for Bergson the next phase begins.And that, he argues, is where we are today—or have been since, let us say, therise of civilization.10 [../Text/part0040.html#c3-FN-10] Hence for Bergson,consciousness invaded matter to harness it to its own purpose, which is toincrease consciousness, and the greatest expression of this is in the artist,the thinker, the mystic, and the saint."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE SUPERMANBergson did not write of a “superman.” The examples he gives as expressions ofthe élan vital's creative advance are familiar figures in history and althoughexceptional, are still within the bounds of the “human.” But some twenty yearsbefore Creative Evolution, another thinker was brooding on the possibility oflife “throwing up” a being that would be a step beyond its last creation. LikeBergson, Friedrich Nietzsche was a “philosopher of life.” He also shared withBergson the distinction of being a philosopher who could write eloquently,forcefully, and persuasively. But unlike Bergson, he was a more abrasive,destructive, and explosive thinker. And although they both shared the misfortuneof having their ideas appropriated by fascism, the taint has since been washedout of Bergson's reputation, while for many Nietzsche is still mistakenly seenas a precursor and prophet of the Nazis.Nietzsche did not see his Übermensch, or “superman,” in terms of an evolution ofconsciousness; or at least he did not specifically write of him as such. For onething, Nietzsche did not believe in a “spiritual reality,” although his writingon “eternal recurrence” and the “will to power,” with its indebtedness toSchopenhauer, suggest a mystical element often missed by his interpreters.1[../Text/part0040.html#c4-FN-1] Nietzsche, however, did believe, as R. M. Buckedid, that the human race was giving birth to a “new” kind of human being,although he differs from Bucke in not seeing this as a “natural” outcome ofDarwinian evolution. Like Bergson, Nietzsche did not see mere survival andadaptation as life's central concerns. He argued that only a distressed organismis worried about survival. A healthy organism wants above all to express itshealth, use its powers, and actualize its potential. Nietzsche condemnedChristianity because he believed it valued weakness and timidity over strengthand adventure. It was poisonous because its source was an active “hatred” oflife, which posited a higher world in which those unable to meet life'schallenge—the weak and timid—would find eternal peace, and a hell in which thosewho used their energies would find everlasting torment. Understandably, aChristian Europe found Nietzsche's ideas mad and was only too happy to chalkthem up to the syphilis that eventually killed him. Sadly, although less than acentury earlier people like William Blake had said pretty much the same thing,Nietzsche's own rhetorical brilliance worked against him, and his remarks aboutthe “blonde beast” and the “good war that hallows any cause” were easily pickedup by shallow thinkers and used to justify beliefs and ideologies that wouldhave turned his stomach.Nietzsche's conception of the superman was of an individual of such health,vitality, and zest for life that he would be able to affirm life as it is,joyfully, even in the face of its apparent absurdity and cruelty. And affirm itnot only once, but eternally, as his doctrine of the “eternal recurrence of allthings” implies.2 [../Text/part0040.html#c4-FN-2] Nietzsche imagined anindividual so full of curiosity, expectancy, and a sense of adventure that he orshe could do without the props that had hitherto supported humankind—religion,metaphysics, “the search for truth,” the warm campfires of the herd—and couldcast off into uncharted seas for unknown regions of experience. Nietzsche calledfor a “transvaluation of all values.” That he himself often failed to meet thestandards he set for his “free spirits” and “new philosophers” only says that hewas, unavoidably, only “human, all too human,” and not that those standards arefalse. His doctrine of self-creation, of finding a higher, deeper morality“beyond good and evil,” and, above all, of affirming life in the face of histortured, miserable existence, was to influence practically every major thinkerand artist for decades after his death.Nietzsche's notion of the superman would have the most immediate effect. Ageneration weary of Victorian restraint and prudery was eager for a doctrinethat told them to cast off an obsolete morality and to think and live forthemselves. His philosophy argued for a “higher morality” and a more severeself-discipline than that professed by the hypocritical Christians of his time.That this was often overlooked by individuals anxious to, as a laterappropriator of some of his thought would put it, “do what they wilt,”3[../Text/part0040.html#c4-FN-3] is unfortunate. But it is not an argumentagainst his ideas, merely the recognition that they were used by shallow peopleto justify their appetites. Another reason for the popularity of the supermanidea was the widespread success of Darwinism and the attendant notion of“progress.” These suggested that the “march of life” had not come to a halt withourselves and that before us lay a future pregnant with the possibility of some“higher” type, who would look back with a mixture of pity and disdain at theirnineteenth-century ancestors, as they themselves looked back at the hairy ape.The idea soon seeped into the popular consciousness, enriching an emergingscience fiction, fueling biological speculation (Bucke's, for example) andinfecting sociological and political thought with often unappealing effect.One area in which the biological doctrine of evolution, the visionary figure ofthe superman, and the notion that humankind was entering a new form ofconsciousness met was occultism. Here indeed was a heady and evocative brew.“The occult” had experienced a revival since the last quarter of the nineteenthcentury, but to say that it had experienced a revival is not to say that it hadhitherto been absent. As scholars like James Webb and Joscelyn Godwin makeclear, a current of occult interest ran through the Enlightenment, the Romanticrevolution, and other cultural and political movements of the eighteenth,nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.4 [../Text/part0040.html#c4-FN-4] Prior tothe rise of modern science in the seventeenth century, occultism formed acentral part of the European intellectual curriculum; figures like Sir IsaacNewton, today seen as an archetype of the modern scientist, were as deeply—ifnot more—involved in occult studies like astrology and alchemy as they were inastronomy and physics. But with the rise of the Age of Reason, occultism wentunderground and became a subterranean stream, nourishing small enclaves andsecret societies.All this changed in March 1848, when strange phenomena began to occur in afarmhouse in Hydesville, upstate New York. Previous occupants of the house hadbeen disturbed by strange sounds, and when the new tenants—the Fox family—movedin, the noises increased. They became so regular that the family grew accustomedto them, inviting neighbors in to listen. Eventually one of the young Foxdaughters christened the “ghost” Mr. Splitfoot, and decided to see if she couldcommunicate with “him.” When the ghost replied, Katie and her sister developed amethod of questioning him. They discovered he had been a travelling salesman whohad been murdered in the house several years earlier, his body buried in thecellar. Subsequent excavation did indeed unearth the remains of a man. The ageof spiritualism had begun. Soon after Mr. Splitfoot's debut, spiritualism sweptacross the United States, and not longer after that it crossed the Atlantic.Katie and her sister went on to become “mediums,” “channels” for the spirits whoseemed willing to answer questions about the afterlife, the future, religion,or, more prosaically, the whereabouts of missing items. Other mediums appeared,and soon after the “raps” at Hydesville were first heard it seemed that thedaylight world of common sense and cold, hard facts was facing a veritableinvasion from another dimension. The spirits seemed to clamor for attention.Table turning and séances became popular pastimes among the Victorians. One ofthe most celebrated and well-documented mediums of the age was Daniel DunglasHome, who was known to levitate, produce terrific crescendos, and hold livecoals with no apparent effect, as well as perform dozens of other extraordinaryfeats as a matter of course. The new religion of spiritualism spread and gainedadherents at such a rate that in 1898 the Roman Catholic Church condemned thepopular practice of séances and mediumship, although it still allowed for thekind of “controlled” scientific investigation of the phenomena carried on byorganizations like the Society for Psychical Research, founded by FredrickMyers, Frank Podmore, and Edmund Gurney in 1882.It was in this atmosphere of communication with the dead, remarkable powers, andfantastic but seemingly verifiable claims that a woman appeared who was to havetremendous influence, not only in the occult world, but in wider cultural andintellectual spheres as well. She was a flamboyant Russian, with a mysterious,colorful past. Her name was Helena Petrovna Blavatsky. We will have more to sayabout her further on. Here it is enough to say that the Theosophical Society,which she founded with Colonel Henry Steel Olcott in New York City in the summerof 1875, was responsible for giving spiritualism, as well as other occultbeliefs and practices, an attractive intellectual cachet, linking them tonotions of “ancient wisdom” and “secret teachings” lost to the materialisticWest, but now regained and open to all who could see beyond the prejudices ofmodern thought.Many accepted Madame Blavatsky's invitation. Probably the most famous was thepoet W. B. Yeats, later a member of the most well known magical society of thenineteenth century, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. But other, lesscelebrated individuals were attracted to the appealing blend of spiritualexoticism and mystic wisdom offered by Theosophy. One such was a young,overworked schoolteacher from Leeds, Alfred Richard Orage, later known to thereaders of the influential journal The New Age as the editor of genius A. R.Orage."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]A. R. ORAGE AND THE NEW AGEOrage is best known today to historians and students of the esoteric schoolknown as the Fourth Way, whose central figure is the enigmatic Armenian teacherG. I. Gurdjieff. Orage came into Gurdjieff's circle in France in the early1920s, after being introduced to his “system” through the lectures of P. D.Ouspensky. Later, after Ouspensky parted from Gurdjieff, Orage becameGurdjieff's chief lieutenant and emissary, particularly in the United States.Ouspensky had worked with Gurdjieff in Russia and Turkey from 1915 to 1918, andalthough contact between them continued into the twenties, Ouspensky had by theneffectively broken with Gurdjieff and followed his own path. In 1921 he arrivedin London, feted as the best-selling author of a remarkable work of metaphysics,Tertium Organum (1912, American edition 1920), which we will be discussingshortly.Ouspensky quickly established himself as a potent source of new andextraordinary ideas about the nature of human consciousness, and the audience athis lectures included such figures as T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard,and the occultist A. E. Waite. Orage had met Ouspensky some years before whenthe philosopher passed through London during his “search for the miraculous”;later, Orage published Ouspensky's “Letters from Russia” in The New Age,depicting the collapse of civilized life in Tsarist Russia in the throes of theBolshevik Revolution. To many readers sympathetic to the Marxist “experiment,”Ouspensky's account of famine, looting, murder, and widespread chaos wassobering.Devoted to a dizzying variety of literary, philosophical, mystical, andpolitical writing, the pages of The New Age introduced the work of the writerKatharine Mansfield, and counted among its contributors George Bernard Shaw, G.K. Chesterton and H. G. Wells. It was also clearly attuned to the coming “newman.” In the first issue, Orage and his coeditor Holbrook Jackson announcedtheir credo:Believing that the darling object and purpose of the universal will of life isthe creation of a race of supremely and progressively intelligent beings, TheNew Age will devote itself to the serious endeavour to co-operate with thepurposes of life and to enlist in that noble service the help of seriousstudents of the new contemplative and imaginative order.1[../Text/part0040.html#c5-FN-1]Few advocates of the contemporary “New Age Movement” are aware of theirdistinguished predecessor.Orage came into contact with Theosophy through his interest in Platonism and ahunger to escape the numbing dullness of his life as a schoolteacher. He wasalso a deep reader of Nietzsche. The story is that Orage was introduced toNietzsche's work by a friend to whom he had given a copy of the Bhagavad Gita;the friend returned the gesture with an edition of Thus Spake Zarathustra. Oragespent the night reading the book and returned to his friend's door the nextmorning brimming over with Nietzsche's gospel.All his life Orage had a taste for the mystical, esoteric, and “hidden”; it wasnatural that works like Blavatsky's Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine, withtheir talk of ancient wisdom, secret knowledge, and hidden masters secure intheir Himalayan monasteries, would appeal to him. For all their chaos and sheerimprobability, which Orage was quick to comment on, Blavatsky's dauntingtomes—together the two books contain more than 2,500 pages—offered readers likeOrage a magnificent counterblast to the prevailing scientific positivism withits cramped view of philosophy and reductive picture of human beings and theirplace in the cosmos. If nothing else, Orage and thousands of other readers likehim benefited from Blavatsky's work by being introduced through it to spiritualclassics like the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata, and other masterpieces ofIndian thought. (It may seem odd that as the editor of an influential Londonliterary journal and a critic of English literature, Orage referred to theMahabharata more than any other work as a touchstone of literary style andquality.)Orage also gleaned from his contact with Theosophy the conviction that ournormal everyday consciousness was not the only consciousness available to us,and that humanity as a whole was slowly evolving into a new kind of being. LikeR. M. Bucke, William James, and Henri Bergson, Orage believed that human beingshad potential “other” forms of consciousness lying dormant within them, waitingto be explored. And like Nietzsche, he believed that those who managed toactualize these new forms would, in effect, become something more than human.Orage's Nietzschean take on Theosophical ideas soon set him apart from the rankand file members, and his innate scepticism made him critical of a slavishacceptance of some of Blavatsky's more outlandish notions. In a series oflectures given in 1904 to branches of the Theosophical Society in Manchester andLeeds, Orage brought Nietzschean inspiration and Theosophical doctrine togetherunder the title “Consciousness: Animal, Human and Superhuman.” When the lectureswere published in book form in 1907, they established Orage as an important andinsightful thinker on the possibilities of an evolution of consciousness.Orage begins his investigation with a remark that in some form or other mustoccur to anyone who decides to seriously study consciousness beginning with theconsciousness most available, one's own: “The difficulty of discussingconsciousness and its modes is the difficulty of discussing ourselves.”2[../Text/part0040.html#c5-FN-2] In introspection, in observing and analyzingconsciousness, there is the consciousness we observe and the consciousness thatdoes the observing. The two are not the same, and the possibilities of anendless regression of observers and observed, of an infinite hall of mirrorsreceding into our inner depths, are at once intriguing and paralyzing. Oragerecognizes this danger and admits at the outset that he knows that what he willbe speaking of will be only one part or aspect of consciousness. Just as our ownselves perpetually escape complete analysis, there will always be some part ofconsciousness lying outside the scope of observation. Definitions, too, will nothelp. As Bergson later remarked, there is no need to define something we allexperience immediately and clearly, and in any case any definition would be moreobscure than the thing itself.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c5-FN-3]For Orage the act of turning the mind in on itself, however incomplete, isnevertheless salutary—something he will later return to in his work on“self-observation” with Gurdjieff. The first thing anyone interested inunderstanding the nature of consciousness must do, he argues, is to develop thehabit of withdrawing attention from the outer world, whose activities andobjects draw awareness like magnets. He must learn instead how to focus it onthe mind itself—an approach the phenomenologist Edmund Husserl was developing ina different context around the same time. Orage argues that we must abandon theprejudice that our consciousness is consciousness in itself, and try to imaginewhat a consciousness undifferentiated into either human or animal or anythingelse would be like. Striking images lead us in the right direction: “The eyeopening in darkness, the ear alert in silence”4[../Text/part0040.html#c5-FN-4]—the possibility of perception without theperception itself. Not “this” consciousness or “that” consciousness, butconsciousness with neither a subject nor an object—the “consciousness withoutthought,” perhaps, that Edward Carpenter spoke of earlier. Stripping away thesenses and our habitual inclination to act on their stimulus, one digs throughlayers of awareness to a kind of bedrock of “pure consciousness.” What one thenencounters is “a power of attention, a state of complete preparedness, auniversal awareness, which only by the particularised activities of beingsbecomes defined and limited into specifically human, animal or vegetablemodes.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c5-FN-5] This is Bergson's “life force” orSchopenhauer's “will” before it actualizes itself in any particular livingbeing. Thus Orage argues that our own consciousness is but one form ormanifestation of a “universal consciousness,” which expresses itself in avariety of agents.Orage's rigorous analysis of consciousness may have seemed austere fare toTheosophists used to talk of hidden masters, past lives, and karma, and his“dangerous” Nietzschean ethos of self-creation was soon to lead him away fromthe more earnest and idealistic Theosophical campfires. By the time of hislectures, Orage had found himself increasingly disenchanted with the occultideas and practices that had once thrilled him, and more fascinated with thepotentials of the mind itself. In an article written for the Theosophical Reviewin the same year as the lectures, Orage contrasted what he called the “occultarts” with “occult faculties,” arguing that while the former obsess and “devour”people, resulting in “cranks,” “occult faculties” free the mind, allowing it tosoar into new dimensions. Intuition, insight, and imagination—the faculties inquestion—were, Orage said, “winged thought,” “winged judgment,” and “wingedsympathy.” These were preferable because unlike arts or knowledge, which can beforgotten, faculties, once acquired, are difficult to lose. What all three shareis that each is a normal, everyday faculty raised to a higher power, and eachpartakes of what Orage sees as the kind of consciousness peculiar to the“superman,” what he calls “ecstasy.” This notion of a familiar “power” raised toa higher level forms the basis of Orage's thoughts on the evolution ofconsciousness.In examining consciousness, Orage follows a three-tiered approach that in manyways is similar to Bucke's; in its essentials it also anticipates the moreextended treatment that P. D. Ouspensky would provide in Tertium Organum. Orageargues that animal consciousness, like Bucke's “perceptual mind,” is a kind ofsimple sensory awareness. Like a photographic plate, it receives impressions andretains images, but there is no consciousness of this, no awareness ofawareness. Orage uses the analogy of a sheet of sensitive paper. Laid flat, thisis a “one-dimensional” consciousness, “plane consciousness.” It can pick upsensory impressions, even retain and store them, but it has no memory of them.Fold the paper once, and we arrive at human consciousness, which has memory andis aware of its awareness. It is, as it were, the paper photographing itself.This may occur with some continuity or only sporadically; we all fall intostates of simple animal consciousness when our presiding ego seems to havedisappeared, and the loss of this sense of “I” forms the basis of Gurdjieff'sideas of “self-remembering.” Orage suggests that with a strong ego it is ratheras if the paper were curved in on itself like a sphere, in which our awarenessof our awareness achieves a kind of stability.Now, just as human consciousness is animal consciousness raised to a higherlevel, superhuman or “cosmic” consciousness is human consciousness raised again.If animal consciousness is reflection and human consciousness the reflection ofthat reflection, then superhuman consciousness is a higher reflectionstill—consciousness of the ego by a higher “self.” Again, the idea is that themystical state, what Orage calls “ecstasy,” is not something supernatural, noris it a freak accident without significance for consciousness at large. Itemerges out of a development of ordinary consciousness, which, as William Jameshad said and Orage, in a different way, reiterates, is not “consciousness perse,” but only one form of consciousness. And again as Bucke argued, theconsciousness of the superhuman should differ from that of the ordinary human,as the human's differs from the animal's. For Orage “human consciousness isinferior to superman consciousness, just as an embryo in an egg is inferior tothe bird flying in the air.” Where for the animal the focus of consciousness issense impressions and for the human is the awareness of these impressions in anego, for the superhuman the focus is in an observation of that ego. “As thespectator of human consciousness, the superman would have our interior world forhis object.”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c5-FN-6] This argues for an increasing“interiorizing” of consciousness, a deepening of our inner world. Orage believedthat such a change was happening in his own time. “Doubtless, in evolved minds,”he wrote, “the activity of the inner senses is beginning slowly to predominateover the outer senses. People do live more by their inner appreciations andperceptions and ideas than by their outer perceptions.” Trust and confidence inour own ideas and perceptions leads to new powers and faculties, and this senseof growth is the hallmark of human consciousness itself, which is the embryo ofthe higher consciousness growing within us. That this process is in part atleast directed by our own efforts is clear in Orage's Nietzschean remark that“evolution is altogether an imaginative process. You become what you have beenled to imagine yourselves to be.”7 [../Text/part0040.html#c5-FN-7] For Orage andmany readers of The New Age, what they imagined themselves to be was thesuperman.Who exactly the superman was, and how best to encourage his appearance, wassomething Orage left up to his readers. In this he was acting in a Nietzscheanway. For him the imagination is the main faculty whereby the superhuman relatesto the world, and where Bucke saw a change in human consciousness as the resultof powers outside human control, Orage called for a more active participation inthe process. Like Bergson, he decried the emphasis on the passivity of lifefostered by Darwinian biology; and, like Nietzsche, he believed that the “newconsciousness” would emerge out of the masses only in exceptional individuals,who were even then forming a kind of secret fraternity, recognizing each otherthrough common ideals, passions, and beliefs. The “new consciousness” wouldstand outside human consciousness: such “standing outside” is the essence ofecstasy.The superman, too, would stand outside the society around him, and would oftenbe perceived as a freak, a criminal, a dangerous character, a threat. Oragemakes the Nietzschean point that as the bearer of a new culture the supermanwould act as a kind of “shepherd of minds,” and this arrangement doesn'tnecessitate benevolence toward his flock. At the same time the popular image ofa “master race” lording it over the rest of us is a myth, and the superman hasmore important things to concern himself with than exerting political or socialpower—such as exploring the new faculties and perceptions that emerge in hissuperconscious state. Central among these is a new, liberating relation to timeand space. Sometimes, under the influence of art, love, or nature, people todaycan feel the ecstasy that is the birthright of the superman, an overpoweringfeeling of being above the normal limits of existence. In such moments, time andspace seem to be beneath us, and we seem to exist in a different, higherdimension. Such a state would be a permanent condition for the superman;although we today have only fleeting glimpses of it, the possibility exists thatthe breakthrough can be made. There are no sure guidelines, and the way isdangerous. But for the “new man” that Orage recognized around him, the treasureis worth the risk."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]OUSPENSKY'S FOURTH DIMENSIONOne such “new man” was the Russian journalist, novelist, and philosopher P. D.Ouspensky. Born in Moscow in 1878, three years after Orage, Ouspensky is thearchetypal seeker of wisdom; by the end of his life in 1947, he had become formany the dispenser of it. Ouspensky came of age in a remarkable period inRussian history, the so-called Silver Age of the fin de siècle, when mysticism,occultism, progressive ideas, and revolutions in art, politics, and life werethe norm. The same period brought forth Madame Blavatsky and Gurdjieff, as wellas controversial figures like Grigory Rasputin, poets like Andrey Biely andValery Bryusov, philosophers like Vladimir Soloviev and Nicholai Berdyaev (bothof whom wrote of the coming “God-Man”), musicians like the Theosophical composerAleksandr Scriabin, and painters like Kazimir Malevich, whose Suprematism washeavily influenced by Ouspensky's ideas.In the years after his tutelage under Gurdjieff, Ouspensky struck many as arigid, taciturn ideologue, doggedly sticking to the letter of Gurdjieff's law.Few knew him as the romantic, convivial artist who frequented St. Petersburg'sStray Dog Café, hobnobbing with Anna Akhmatova or Aleksandr Blok, drinking vodkatill dawn, immersed in the allusive world of Symbolist poetry. Ouspensky's laterwork, like A New Model of the Universe (published in 1931, though parts werewritten as early as 1905), the brief The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution(1947), and his masterpiece, In Search of the Miraculous (1949), an account ofhis time with Gurdjieff, have a pessimistic air, a sense of the intense struggleand grim persistence Gurdjieff believed was needed in order to “awaken.” But thebook we will examine here, Tertium Organum, is altogether different. A youngman's work, written during a time of intense inspiration and creative discovery,it is a fireworks display of metaphysical speculation, intellectual excitement,poetic insight, and evolutionary optimism. Like Orage, Ouspensky had steepedhimself in Theosophical literature and had devoured Nietzsche. Also like Orage,the Ouspensky who wrote Tertium Organum is a man bitten by the superman bug.Two obsessions directed and absorbed Ouspensky's life from his earliest yearsonward. One was the mysterious sensation of déjà vu, the strange feeling that “Ihave been here before.” As early as the age of six, Ouspensky experienced withunsettling vividness “memories” of places he had not yet seen—at least in hispresent life. Later, after reading Nietzsche, the extraordinary clarity of hisearliest memories became associated with the notion of “eternal recurrence,”Nietzsche's idea that events in time repeat themselves over and over.1[../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-1] Obscure, difficult, and seeminglymasochistic—one's defeats, embarrassments, and disappointments eternallyrepeated?—the idea was no mere hobby for Ouspensky, and in his last days hisstudents watched as the tired, sick man dragged himself to favorite sites inorder to impress the memory of them on himself so that next time he would notforget. This obsession with time also led him into other unusual areas, like the“fourth dimension,” speculation about which was a popular pastime at thebeginning of the twentieth century, much like our own recent craze about “chaostheory” and “complexity.”The other obsession that haunted Ouspensky was his conviction that the everydayworld was a fraud. In the introduction to In Search of the Miraculous, heremarks that as a child he and his beloved younger sister2[../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-2] had a favorite book called Obvious Absurdities.In it were surreal pictures: a man with a house on his back, a cart with blocksfor wheels. Ouspensky later said that he never understood why these wereconsidered more absurd than the rest of “ordinary life,” which always struck himas false, and equally mad. Early on the conviction was built up in him thatnothing could come of following the paths already laid down in life, and thatthe only possible way forward was of discovering some new path, a new roadhitherto undiscovered, that would lead out of the false world of compromise,repetition, and security—what he came to call by the Russian word byt, “deeplyrooted, petrified routine life.” In this rejection of the narrow horizons of thecommonplace and everyday, Ouspensky resembles practically every romantic soulwho preceded him. But unlike many, he actually did something about it. Like theGerman writer Hermann Hesse, with whom Ouspensky shared a recognition of the“new race” sprouting on the fertilized soil of a dying Europe, Ouspensky set outto find an alternative to byt.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-3] And like Hesse,for him this meant a journey to the East.Between 1907 and 1909 Ouspensky set off on the first leg of his “search for themiraculous.” Gurdjieff came across his writing in 1913–14 and set his pupils thetask of studying Ouspensky, with the intention of drawing him into what wasslowly becoming “the work.” But that was still in the future. Even before he hadthat fateful meeting in a seedy Moscow café with the remarkable man Gurdjieff,Ouspensky had embarked on a series of experiments that to this day remain someof the most adventurous, fruitful, and thrilling attempts to break through theartificial limits of human consciousness and enter the worlds beyond.Ouspensky's journeys to the East would in the end prove unsuccessful. Althoughthrough them he saw many remarkable sights—the Sphinx, the Taj Mahal, thepiercing sapphire eyes of a statue of the Buddha in Ceylon—he returned to Russiaskeptical of the romanticism that had fueled his wanderlust and aware that hehad, after all, come back to square one. But if he did not find what he waslooking for, one thing was given him: a taste of the expanded consciousness thathe believed some men and women, scattered across the globe, were even thenevolving into. In 1908, as he stood on the deck of a steamer crossing the Sea ofMarmora in Turkey, Ouspensky had a sudden, fleeting experience of the higherconsciousness he would spend the rest of life trying to achieve. He recorded theevent in his notebook.It was in the sea of Marmora, on a rainy winter day. In the distance, the highrocky shores were of all shades of violet, down to the palest, fading into greyand merging with the grey sky. . . . I was standing by the rail and looking atthe waves. The white crests were running toward us from afar. A wave would comeup, rear itself as though wanting to hurl its crest on the deck, then with aroar would throw itself under the ship. . . . I was watching this play of thewaves with the ship and feeling the waves drawing me to themselves . . . drawingmy soul to themselves. Suddenly I felt it go to them. It was only a moment,maybe less than a moment. But I entered the waves and, with them, with a roar,attacked the ship. And at that moment I became all. The waves—they were myself.The violet mountains in the distance—they were myself. The wind—it was myself.The clouds, hurrying from the north, the rain—were myself. The huge ship,rolling indomitably forward—was myself. . . . The mate on duty on the bridge wasI; and two sailors . . . and the black smoke, billowing from the funnel . . .everything. It was a moment of extraordinary liberation, joy and expansion. Asecond—and the spell was broken.4 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-4]Ouspensky records that two years later the yellowish waves of the Gulf ofFinland briefly brought the feeling back, but that it vanished almost as soon asit appeared.It was, however, enough. His travels, as well as his wide reading in occult andesoteric literature—Eliphas Levi, A. P. Sinnett, Rudolf Steiner (who at the timewas drawing a different Russian, the novelist and poet Andrey Biely, into hisfold)—had convinced him that behind the façade of the everyday world lay anotherreality, the world, he believed, of “causes.” It was the noumenal world of whichnewspapers, articles, politicians, and wars were only the effects, fleetingphenomena thrown up by the shifting face of time. But Ouspensky sought somethingmore. He sought the infinite. And he was determined to find it.Included in the library of esoteric books to which Ouspensky turned when hiswork as a journalist grew too tedious may have been Bucke's CosmicConsciousness—certainly it would be a central text for Tertium Organum. WilliamJames may have been there as well. It is clear that Ouspensky read James, and itis also clear that the self-experiments he was about to undertake were at leastin part influenced and inspired by James's own self-experiments with nitrousoxide. Although Ouspensky is never explicit about the use of drugs, from hisaccount of his experiments it is almost certain they formed a central part ofhis undertaking. The descriptions of what he experienced suggest that for him,too, nitrous oxide was an entrance ticket into the potential “other” forms ofconsciousness. It is also possible he employed hashish. We must remember that atthis time these substances were not illegal—indeed, nitrous oxide has neverbeen—and that their use as a means of stimulating “altered states ofconsciousness,” as well as the tradition of “self-experiment” in science, havelong and respected pedigrees, whatever our own opinion of such expedients.Ouspensky was no drug addict, any more than William James was. He was a seriousseeker of a greater reality than that perceived through the senses. In hislittle apartment in St. Petersburg, sometime between 1910 and 1911, he found it.Ouspenky's experiments in charting the geography of higher consciousness arerecorded in the extraordinary chapter “Experimental Mysticism” in A New Model ofthe Universe and in his first major work, Tertium Organum. He had by this timealready written a few books, notably his novel of eternal recurrence, StrangeLife of Ivan Osokin; but it was Tertium Organum that established him as a writerof brilliance and as a profound thinker. It is unclear if Ouspensky readBergson. He was fluent in French and for a time in his youth had travelled aloneto Paris, which he loved, and it is possible that there he came into contactwith Bergson's writings.5 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-5] He may have known ofOrage's short book, yet although both moved in Theosophical circles, and had metduring the start of Ouspensky's “search,” it was as a literary editor and not asa philosopher of the evolution of consciousness that Ouspensky knew of andrespected Orage. To search for direct linkages between Tertium Organum and theworks that preceded it may be an entertaining historical pastime, but it wouldtell us nothing we did not already know. Ouspensky did not have to be directlyinfluenced by these works to have been obsessed with higher consciousness. TheZeitgeist was full of it; the idea was in the air. Ouspensky brought its variousstrands together and, in a season of novalike inspiration, produced perhaps thesingle most effective counterblast to the desiccating doctrine of positivism,whose stranglehold held fast the progress of thought.The basic theme of Tertium Organum is the need to pass beyond the artificiallimits to knowledge erected by the inadequate logic of positivist science. Tothis day that science asserts that there is no greater significance or deepermeaning to life than that provided by its material explanation—which in effectmeans that there is no meaning or significance to it at all—and it was againstthis numbing assessment that Ouspensky brought his considerable talents andincisive intellect to bear. To recognize that our normal everyday consciousnessis only one mode of consciousness and that the physical world we perceivethrough it is its product, to grasp that behind this world lies another world,totally different from our own, a world, as Ouspensky called it, of the“miraculous”—such was the aim of Tertium Organum. The book's title means the“third organ of thought,” beyond Aristotle's and Francis Bacon's, although, asOuspensky points out, this “third organ” was known to the ancients who precededthem. As witnesses for this revelation Ouspensky called on the fruits of histravels, his many years of study, and his own recent attempts to scale theheights of higher consciousness. Art, nature, Theosophy, higher space, infinity,non-Euclidean mathematics, Kantian philosophy, reflections on animal psychology,sex, the anesthetic revelation, Nietzsche, mysticism, poetry, and much, muchmore are marshalled in order to support Ouspensky's central insight:There is no side of life which does not reveal to us an infinity of the new andthe unexpected if we approach it with the knowledge that it is not exhausted byits visible side, that behind this visible side there lies a whole world of the“invisible,” a whole world of new and incomprehensible forces and relations.6[../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-6]Ouspensky came to understand that this world was a gigantic hieroglyph, a symbolfor a higher, more intensely meaningful world that lay beyond it but radiatedits significance through the most mundane items. Of this insight Ouspensky hadpersonal experience. During his experiments, he took a break from probing theedges of the comprehensible and sat on his sofa, smoking a cigarette. Flickingthe ash, he looked with wonder at his ashtray. Suddenly he saw this humbleobject as the center of a vast radiating web of meanings and relations. In arush of recognition, everything to do with the ashtray flooded hisconsciousness. Who had made it, its use, the material from which it was made,the history of tobacco, the whole long development of humankind's ability tomold its environment. Fire, flame, and the match he had just struck: each seemeda hitherto unopened window on the world, through which he now looked with wonderand amazement. So great was the truth now washing over him that Ouspensky knewhe had to capture it. Later, when he returned to the world of everydayawareness, he looked at the note he had written. It read, “A man can go mad fromone ashtray.” Like “Think in other categories,” the other one-liner he salvagedfrom his metaphysical forays, it shares with William James's nitrous oxidejottings the exasperating inability to translate more than a hint of the depthsof understanding that loomed before him.One of the metaphors Ouspensky used to convey the import of his experience was“the fourth dimension.” Einstein and the mathematician Hermann Minkowsky arecalled on for support, but the central inspiration here is the work of theEnglish mathematician C. H. Hinton. In the 1880s and 1890s, Hinton wrote aseries of books in which he speculated on the existence of dimensions beyond ourfamiliar three of length, height, and depth.7 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-7]His work influenced writers like E. A. Abbot, whose Flatland (1884) depicts avisit by a being of three dimensions to an inhabitant of only two, and H. G.Wells, whose The Time Machine (1895) is heavily indebted to Hinton's ScientificRomances (1884–1885).In Abbot's book, the two-dimensional square perceives its three-dimensionalvisitor, a sphere, in the only way it can, as a circle, flat like itself.Ouspensky adopts this as his analogy for how a devotee of positivist sciencemust perceive any manifestation of the “miraculous.” Just as the square cannotconceive of any dimensions greater than those it possesses, and so finds thesphere's remarks about a third dimension incomprehensible, so too the positivistscientist—or, for that matter, the average person of “common sense”—cannot graspthe possibility of any meaning or significance to the phenomena of the worldbeyond those already accepted. Things are as they are: a rose is a rose is arose, and any suggestion that there is anything more to it is simply nonsense.Abbot's book is mainly a satire, but Hinton had a more positive aim. He believedit was possible to train the mind to perceive the higher dimensions hespeculated on. One method of doing this was to imagine a four-dimensional cube,what Hinton called a “hypercube” or tesseract—it is even possible he coined theword.8 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-8] Hinton even designed an actual“hypercube” to be sold along with his books. It was made up of eighty-oneindividual cubes, each painted a different color. The idea was to alternate theorder of the individual cubes and to memorize each arrangement. Eventually theentire construction could be visualized, in each of its different orders. Thepractice is reminiscent of the Renaissance “art of memory,” as well as ofvarious exercises in perceiving the aura or astral plane popular at the time.Along with these, Hinton's “cubes” were a favorite pastime of the late-Victorianoccult demimonde.9 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-9]In A New Era of Thought, from which Ouspensky drew heavily, Hinton wrote, “Spaceis the instrument of the mind.” This was in 1888, a year before Bergson wouldmake the same argument in Time and Free Will. Hinton based his idea on the workof the philosopher Kant, who argued that space and time were categories throughwhich the mind perceived reality—with the corollary that there is no reason tobelieve that they have any real existence outside of the mind. The world “inreality” might be spaceless and timeless—a condition referred to by many mysticsand in more recent years argued for by many scientists. For Kant, space and timeare, as it were, the pincers with which we grasp the world, and they leave theirindelible mark on it—so much so that we can never know what the world is likewhen we are not grasping it with our tools. For Kant and for most of thephilosophers that followed him, the Ding-an-sich, or thing-in-itself—the world,that is, when it is not perceived by us—remains forever unavailable. We cannever see what things look like when we are not seeing them, for to do so wouldbe to see them, and this would create the very condition we wish to avoid. Forthe sensitive-minded, the idea that we can never know what reality is “really”like is shattering. One such was the German writer Heinrich von Kleist. Afterreading Kant, Kleist lost all faith in knowledge, adopted a radical scepticism,and sunk into a profound depression, eventually killing himself as part of asuicide pact with an incurably sick woman. Aside from a few exceptions—Hegel,Alfred North Whitehead—this radical epistemological scepticism remains thecentral assumption of modern philosophy.Yet Hinton believed that the reaction Kleist had to Kant was unnecessary. Mostcommentators on Kant have assumed that his assertion that space and time are themeans by which we perceive the world argues that they in some way falsify theworld, that they are barriers to our ever really “getting at it.” But there isno reason to assume this, and the pessimism that follows from it is unjustified.If space and time are the means by which we perceive the world, then it followsthat if we can somehow increase or amplify our use of them, our perception ofthe world will also be increased, just as the landscape I perceive through atelescope is made clearer when I adjust the focus. I would not say that thetelescope “falsifies” the landscape. Indeed, there is good reason to believethat without such means of perception, there is no “world,” only the rawmaterial for one, a notion we will return to in our chapter on participatoryepistemology. The world of space and time is not, then, an illusion; it ismerely a limited perception, something altogether different. If we assume thatwhat we see of the world is limited by our understanding of space and time, andthat these limits are not necessarily fixed, we can use our existing perceptionsas starting points for deeper, more inclusive ones. Rather than bemoan ourseparation from a reality we can never know, and hence make no efforts to knowit, we can begin to develop our powers of perception, and try our best to graspsomething of the mystery of the world.Such, in any case, was Ouspensky's belief, and to my mind his argument is veryconvincing. Ouspensky's chapters on the mathematics of the “fourth dimension”may be doubtful—he was not, after all, the mathematician he is described asbeing on the dust jackets of his books; this was an early mistake by his firstEnglish translators, subsequently repeated. Nor do his chapters on animalperception hold up.10 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-10] But this is unimportant.What remains is his central insight. As William Blake had before him, in hisstate of expanded consciousness Ouspensky saw the world in a grain of sand, andheaven in a wild flower.It seems to us that we see something and understand something. But in actualfact we have but a dim sense of all that is happening around us, just as a snailhas a dim sense of the sunlight, the rain, the darkness.11[../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-11]A horse on the Nevsky Prospect was an “atom” of a “great horse,” a dog an “atom”of a “great dog,” and human beings “atoms” of the “great man.” Although theywere in a material sense the same, in his heightened state Ouspensky saw that inthe “fourth dimension”—in the world, that is, of meanings—the wood of a gallows,of a cross, and of a ship's mast were different. He saw differences everywhere.The stones of a prison were not the same as those of a factory, nor those thesame as ones of a church, although a chemical analysis would detect nodifference. Calling on a Platonic analogy, Ouspensky pointed out that theshadows of a hangman, a sailor, and a saint may look identical; no physicalanalysis of the shadows could detect a difference between them. Yet theseshadows are formed by radically different men, completely different objects. Itis only the shadows that are alike. And, he pointed out, positivist science isconcerned only with shadows, mistaking them for reality. Ouspensky walked thestreets of St. Petersburg filled with a sense of the numinous. It was as if somefourth-dimensional Dutch boy had pulled his finger from the dike, and the watersof significance came forth in a torrent. And what Ouspensky saw most was thatthere was something wrong with our ideas of time.In one of his expanded states, Ouspensky had a vision of the Linga Sharira, ourfour-dimensional “time-body,” the “long body of life.” The term comes fromIndian philosophy by way of Madame Blavatsky. Ouspensky realized that at anytime our picture of ourselves or of others is limited by the moment in which wesee it, but that the “real” individual is one's life extended through time. LikeBergson, Ouspensky was aware that all we can study at any separate moment is a“snapshot” of a person's life, never the whole of it, which, like the rest ofthe world, is a constant process. And, of course, each snapshot is different.From birth to death, we are in a condition of constant change. (I see this in mychildren, and already miss the one-year-old in my son who is now three.) Yetbeneath the visible alteration to our physical body, there remains somethingthat endures: the image, the form of the person. That image and form is theLinga Sharira, which, Ouspensky believed, exists in a kind of Eternal Now. Thekey to higher consciousness, Ouspensky understood, lay in a changed perceptionof time, in an ability to escape the limitations of the present moment and seedeeper into the past and future. Just as what is “behind” us or “before” us isstill “there” although we no longer occupy its space, in his heightened stateOuspensky could see that the past, which we believe to be obliterated, stillexists, and that the future, which in our “normal” state we believe has not yethappened, is already taking place. We are so used to the idea of “now” being theonly time we can be aware of that the idea that the past and the future are insome way “with us” seems absurd. Yet for Ouspensky this awareness was the sameas being able to see ahead of or behind himself. Clearly this is an extendedversion of Orage's “ecstasy,” the powerful sense of being above space and time.Like Orage, Ouspensky believed that this kind of awareness, although stillexceptional, was becoming less and less rare. And also like Orage, Ouspenskythought the people in whom this new perception was emerging formed a “new race.”In short, superhumans.Ouspensky's ideas on the “superman” and the “new race” are collected in hisremarkable chapter “Superman” in A New Model of the Universe and in the finalchapter of Tertium Organum, where he engages in an extended discussion ofBucke's theories. Here there is talk of “cosmic consciousness” and othermystical states. But with Ouspensky's superman, a new perception on theevolution of consciousness enters the picture. Like Orage, Ouspensky was aNietzschean; and, like Bergson, he has many doubts about the adequacy of theDarwinian version of evolution. His Nietzscheanism appears in his denial ofBucke's democratic vision that cosmic consciousness is a natural, more or lessautomatic or inevitable outcome of the evolutionary process and that over timeit will produce an entire humanity possessing the new consciousness in the wayit now possesses self-consciousness. In contrast, Ouspensky argues that theappearance of the new consciousness is not part of the general “development” ofhumanity. It is limited to individuals—not, it must be made clear, by anyoutside authority, but by their own interests and values. Any evolution ofconsciousness must be achieved through our own efforts, chiefly through thedevelopment of a culture that encourages and nourishes the new consciousness, incontrast to what Ouspensky saw as the philistinism and barbarism then prevalentin Western civilization. Ouspensky had none of Bucke's ebullient optimism aboutthe immediate future, and, as his “Letters From Russia” show, he viewedsocialism as a central evil, a levelling of all values to the lowest commondenominator, more or less sanctioning philistinism as the norm. By today'sstandards, Ouspensky was definitely not politically correct.The other criticism he makes of Bucke is that he leaves out the possibility thatevolution may operate through several independent streams or strainssimultaneously. For Ouspensky, evolution may make many detours, sudden startsand stops, and changes of direction. He argues that the paleontological recorddoes not reveal a neat, orderly progression from “primitive” forms to us; ratherit tells a story of abrupt jumps, leaps, and “sports.” It portrays the rapidappearance and disappearance of forms and cannot be understood as depicting astately “ascent” from earlier organisms to twentieth-century humanity. ForOuspensky, evolution is not the single, orderly, unbroken process of developmentit is usually understood to be. It is rather a series of different, varyingexperiments carried out by what he calls the Great Laboratory.12[../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-12]Each of these experiments aims at creating abeing that can be self-evolving, no longer dependent on the submergedconsciousness of the species or race for its direction, but capable ofindependent action and thought. So far, the only experiment that can beconsidered in any way successful in this direction is the human being. As withBergson, it is the human being that carries within itself the greatest potentialfor freedom and novelty. That potential, however, will not be actualizedautomatically.In the chapter “Esotericism and Modern Thought” of A New Model of the Universe,Ouspensky discusses many ideas that have today gained a new currency, such asthe possibility that civilization appeared much earlier than we have hithertobelieved, as well as the idea that there have been several civilizations beforeour own.13 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-13] One of the central themes of thisand other chapters is the idea that there is no such thing as a “natural” or“mechanical” evolution—that is, what is generally considered evolution, theDarwinian notion of chance mutations, adaptation, and “survival of the fittest.”Again, by definition all evolution is guided, has aim and purpose, otherwise itis mere “change.” In animals it is nature, the Great Laboratory, at work. Inhuman evolution, Ouspensky saw signs of what he called the Inner Circle, anesoteric center, from which the ideas, tools, and knowledge of civilizationemerge. As he writes, “There exists no evolution which begins accidentally andproceeds mechanically. Only degeneration and decay can proceed mechanically.Civilization never starts by natural growth, but only through artificialcultivation.”14 [../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-14]This idea of an Inner Circle strikes us as particularly dubious today, smackingof conspiracy theories and dictatorial demigods, even though neither of these,in fact, applies to what Ouspensky is talking about. At a time when the majorityof thinkers smugly believed that the civilization and culture ofnineteenth-century Europe was the “aim” of evolution—this meant capitalism andmechanistic science—Ouspensky was one of a few voices arguing against thiscomplacency, and offering instead the humbling thought that civilizations muchhigher than our own may have already risen and fallen in the past. The idea of a“secret society” guiding human affairs may be hard to swallow, but recent yearshave seen a resurgence of the notion that the civilization of ancientEgypt—which orthodox archaeologists argue had no precedent—may possibly havebeen inherited from a previous civilization, which some have suggested wasAtlantis. And again, Ouspensky is in no way Eurocentric in his discussion ofcivilization and its evolution. He makes clear that during periods of barbarismin European history, civilization may have flourished in South America, Africa,Asia, or Polynesia. Likewise, his conception of a “new race,” however awkwardthe phrase seems to us, is not to be understood in racial terms. He recognizedsigns of the emerging new consciousness in all the peoples he came across in histravels in Europe, North America, India, the Near and Far East.15[../Text/part0040.html#c6-FN-15] (It was in fact in the Europeans of his timethat this idea met with the greatest resistance.) What is crucial for Ouspenskyis not race—not in fact “nature”—but “nurture,” cultivation, the root of our ownidea of “culture.” The new consciousness, if it is to occur, must be cultivated.The cultivation he argued for would not, he knew, come from the intelligentsiaof his time. As far as he was concerned, they were little more thansophisticated barbarians. If the new consciousness was to be nurtured, and ifcivilization was to be saved, help would have to come from somewhere else. That“somewhere else” was esotericism. And it is to this we must turn in our nextsection."},{"pageContent":"PART TWOImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]ESOTERIC EVOLUTION"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE BISHOP AND THE BULLDOGIn 1860 a debate took place at Oxford University between Bishop SamuelWilberforce and the biologist T. H. Huxley. The subject was evolution. It wasonly a year since Charles Darwin had published The Origin of the Species, andthe bishop intended to squash the controversial idea once and for all. As hardlyneeds pointing out, he was not successful. It was not for nothing that Huxleywas known as Darwin's “bulldog.”Bishop Wilberforce was an orthodox, conservative man, and his blustery rhetoricexpressed the anxiety, fear, and sheer incomprehension that affected ageneration whose world had been turned upside down. Darwin had proposed anexplanation radically different from the one most people accepted for theappearance of the variety of life-forms on the planet. Until then it wasgenerally agreed, at least in the Western world, that God had created theheavens and the earth at some definite point in the not-too-distant past. Theexact year Creation had taken place had even been worked out: In the seventeenthcentury, based on the chronology in the Bible, Archbishop Ussher had calculatedthat it must have happened in 4004 B.C. Darwin changed all that.That Bishop Wilberforce, Huxley, and everyone else had descended from apes was,of course, a difficult notion to accept. But what was equally disturbing wasthat Darwin's idea of evolution called for a universe very different from theone people of that time had grown up with. Darwin's idea called for a gradualchange from one species to another over vast spans of time, much more than themere five or six thousand years Archbishop Ussher would allow. The kind ofchanges Darwin spoke of required millions of years, great gulfs of time thatwere beyond most people's imagination, and still are even today.That these changes took place without aim or purpose was bad enough; as SamuelButler would soon point out, Darwin had “banished mind from the universe.” Buthe had also done something else. He had made the universe a very strange place.Science is about acquiring more and more knowledge about the world, and in“explaining” our appearance by way of our simian ancestors, Darwin had perhapsprovided some deeper insight into ourselves. But he did so by making the rest ofthe universe more un-known.Although today evolution is associated with his name, Darwin's “idea” was notreally new. In 1721 the French philosopher Montesquieu, famous for his PersianLetters, had proposed that a few early species had multiplied into the presentones and that the differences between species could increase or decrease overtime, a process he called “transmutation.” One of his contemporaries, thenaturalist Georges Buffon, suggested that the horse was related to the ass. By1760 the great Swedish taxonomist Linnaeus had come to the conclusion thatspecies could vary. In 1790 the poet Goethe—who considered his scientificwritings more important than his poetry—had published his Metamorphosis ofPlants, in which he argued that all existing plants had derived from a commonancestor.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c7-FN-1] And in 1809 Jean-Baptiste Lamarck haddesigned a kind of “evolutionary tree,” beginning with tiny animals andcontinuing on to ourselves; he had also suggested a means by which changes inspecies took place, proposing that giraffes, for example, had “evolved” theirlong necks by what he called “the inheritance of acquired characteristics.” Inthe past some giraffes wanted to reach the leaves higher up in trees and madethe effort to do so. What they gained in size by stretching was passed on totheir offspring, who in turn made similar efforts and also bequeathed to theiroffspring similar benefits, and so on, until we arrive at the long-neckedgiraffes of today.For a long time Darwin's ideas and Lamarck's ideas seemed equally possible, andas no one ever saw “evolution in action,” there seemed no way to prove who wasright. But at the end of the nineteenth century when the German zoologist AugustWeismann showed that the genes passed on from parent to offspring wereunaffected by characteristics acquired by the parent—a doctrine known as “thecontinuity and unalterability of the germ-tract”—Darwin's version won out.2[../Text/part0040.html#c7-FN-2] Strangely, at the same time that Darwin wasmeditating on the “survival of the fittest”—a phrase the philosopher HerbertSpencer had coined a decade earlier—the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace had hitupon the idea of “natural selection” independently, through a reading of theeconomist Thomas Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population. Wallacemagnanimously allowed Darwin to reap the glory of their “discovery,” although insome key respects, Wallace could not accept all of Darwin's conclusions. Herejected, for example, the idea that our higher mental and spiritual facultiescould be explained in terms of natural selection, believing that somenonphysical agency had to be involved. It is perhaps for this reason, as well asthe fact that Wallace was an ardent spiritualist, that he has been gentlyairbrushed out of most discussions on evolution.Although many minds fought a rearguard action against the rising idea, evolutionseemed destined for success. For years the notion that change was central to theworld had been making headway. Less than a century before Darwin published hisfindings, the American and French Revolutions had altered societies irrevocably.The philosopher Georg Friedrich Hegel, who believed that history is the work ofthe unfolding of Spirit, emphasized “becoming” rather than “being” and wasprofoundly influential; for one thing, his work had a deep effect on Karl Marx,whose own ideas would lead to massive social and political changes in thetwentieth century. And the Industrial Revolution, which had changed not onlypeople's lives but the landscape, had contributed the notion of “progress” tothe collective consciousness.What was different about Darwin's idea was his explanation for how the changeshe spoke of came about. He had indeed “banished mind from the universe.” Therewas no need for it. The mechanisms of supply and demand could account foreverything. No will was necessary, no effort, and, most disturbingly, no God.Only three things: the relentless pressure of survival; the possibility ofrandom mutations which occasionally produced an organism better suited tosurvive and hence more able to leave offspring; and time.The time Darwin needed came from his friend and mentor Charles Lyell, the fatherof modern geology. In 1830 Lyell, a Scotsman, had published his Principles ofGeology, in which he argued that all the features of the Earth's surface hadbeen produced by physical, chemical, and biological processes taking place overvast periods of time. The processes Lyell spoke of could not have operatedwithin the span allowed by Archbishop Ussher. Or rather, they could, and in factwere operating, but they did so at such a slow tempo that five or six thousandyears would account for little visible change.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c7-FN-3]To arrive at the Earth as Lyell knew it required millions of years: “deep time.”Deep time gave Darwinian evolution the leeway it needed to work. Given thesevast aeons, it was possible that small, chance changes, building up overmillennia, could account for the variety of organisms scattered across theplanet. They could even account for the rise of one organism in particular, theonly one, it seemed, that was concerned about its origin: the human being."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]ENTER THE MADAMEDarwin was not the only one interested in human origins, or in the possibilitiesopened up by the vast prospects of time revealed by Charles Lyell. At the sametime that T. H. Huxley was decimating Bishop Wilberforce at the Oxford debate, awoman who would present the first full-scale attack on Darwinian evolution—aswell as on the whole edifice of scientific materialism—was travelling throughthe Caucasus, living among native tribes, and developing control over herstrange paranormal powers. Fifteen years later, and on the other side of theworld, she was the head of a new mystical movement. Two years after that, shemade her literary debut, which, if sheer size and sales are any indication, hada great impact. In two volumes, the book's densely packed 1,270 pages covered animmense range of material, from magic, kabbalah, and psychic powers to ancientraces, secret teachings, and Hindu philosophy. It spoke of Christ, Buddha, andthe mysterious Comte de St. Germain. Its basic premise was that magic, or “theoccult,” is not hocus-pocus but a true science, based on profound knowledge ofthe secrets of nature, lost to modern humanity but known to the ancients and toa few highly evolved human beings—adepts—then existing on the planet. It alsopresented an outline of cosmic and human evolution vastly different than thatoffered by modern science. The first printing of one thousand copies sold out inten days. A review in the New York Herald called it “one of the most remarkableproductions of the century.” The book's title was Isis Unveiled (1877), and itsauthor was the inimitable Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.1[../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-1]A century after the publication of Isis Unveiled, Theodore Roszak, the historianof the 1960s counterculture, remarked, “In the years following publication ofThe Origin of the Species, HPB [as she was known to her followers] was the firstperson to aggressively argue the case for a transphysical element inevolution.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-2] This accomplishment is easilyforgotten when we look at the book today, as well as at her later and evenlarger work The Secret Doctrine (1888). Both seem enormous heaps of disorganizederudition, full of startling insights, but riddled with plagiarisms, crankideas, and unsavory notions on race. It takes an effort of historicalimagination to grasp the electrifying effect they had on a generation that hadhad the wind taken out of it by the revelations of Darwin. Blavatsky's eccentricbooks fed a hunger gnawing at the nineteenth-century soul.Darwin was not the century's only dark prophet, for a decade before The Originof the Species the physicist Rudolf Clausius had cast a pall over the age withhis formulation of the second law of thermodynamics. Summed up in the notion of“entropy”—the increase of disorder or “waste” in a closed system—Clausius's“law” led to the doleful recognition that the universe would eventually run downinto what was then called its “heat death.” All of its highly organized energywould dissolve into a featureless cosmic soup. This outcome was inevitable,given the “facts” uncovered by science. Physicists even predicted when the Sunwould burn out. Minds sensitive to this were prompted to reflect on the purposeof existence. If the end was certain chaos, what was the point? It was in thisclimate of cosmic pessimism that spiritualism came to prominence, and along withit Madame Blavatsky.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-3]Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]In the years before she appeared as a voluble critic of scientific materialism,Blavatsky led what is commonly called a colorful life. Before she founded theTheosophical Society with Colonel Henry Steel Olcott in 1875, she had been,among other things, a piano teacher, the manager of an artificial flowerfactory, a circus bareback rider, a journalist, a world traveller, and a medium.It was in this last capacity that she first met Colonel Olcott when both wereinvestigating the reports of a series of “materializations” at a farmhouse inVermont. Olcott was struck by the Madame's bearing—particularly her blazing redGaribaldian shirt. He introduced himself, and less than a year later theyfounded the Theosophical Society in New York City.Although originally centered on the by-now familiar spiritualist routine, thesociety soon moved in another direction. Blavatsky herself was bored with thespiritualist business and could casually toss off “apports” and “manifestations”other mediums labored at. These, she felt, were ultimately unimportant. Hercalling lay elsewhere. It was not the message of the spirits that she wasdestined to proclaim, but the hidden wisdom of the ages. Lost for centuries,obscured by the false doctrines of materialism and an incomplete science, it wasnow revealed to her in copious detail by an incontrovertible source.She was, she told Colonel Olcott, in contact with higher intelligences. Thesewere the Hidden Masters, adepts who guide the evolution of humankind from secretmonasteries secure in the forbidding heights of the Himalayas. They had chosenher as their spokeswoman to bring their teachings to the masses, in order toprevent the modern world from sinking deeper into the spiritless doctrines ofmatter. Proof of this claim came in the form of the famous Mahatma letters,which the Madame would materialize out of thin air, to the amazement of ColonelOlcott—and the contemptuous remarks of others.In her own day Madame Blavatsky was a formidable figure and often in the news,but today, outside of occult, Theosophical and New Age circles, she isremembered, if at all, as one of the many mediums who preyed upon the gullibleand bored in the last years of the nineteenth century, and as the founder of adotty religious cult. Her “exposure” by Richard Hodgson, a member of the Societyfor Psychical Research, showed her up as a fraud, and although this exposureitself has been questioned repeatedly, Blavatsky has gone down in most of thehistory books as a colorful, eccentric crank. Peter Washington's astringent andentertaining Madame Blavatsky's Baboon (1993) is a good example of themainstream view of her and Theosophy.Yet Blavatsky's contribution to esoteric thought is considerable, and perhaps sofundamental that it is difficult to recognize it. It is true that works likeIsis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine are great hodgepodges and that, as manyhave pointed out, there is less a definable “Theosophical philosophy” than acollection of beliefs and ideas brought together under the term. Neverthelesssome of those beliefs and ideas are so central to the various strains ofmystical thought forming a countertradition to mainstream scientific materialismthat it is important to remember just what they are.Perhaps the central idea of Theosophy is that of the fundamental unity of allexistence, an idea, certainly, that modern science itself adheres to, but withone important distinction. Whereas science grounds this unity in “matter,” orsome form of physical “stuff”—atoms or some subatomic particle—for Blavatsky,this unity of being is predicated on consciousness. One basic, primal being,preceding any of its manifestations, is shared by everything, from atoms to God.In its “positive” aspect, this being is consciousness; in its “negative” aspect,it is substance, which forms the subject of consciousness, that whichconsciousness is conscious of. (In this formulation, Blavatsky's metaphysics arevery similar to Hegel's.) This being so, each individual thing is at the sametime all things as well as absolute being—an idea we find in philosophers likeAlfred North Whitehead and physicists like David Bohm. This idea of thefundamental “oneness” of things is so basic to mystical thought that it wouldneed a separate book to trace all its appearances in all its varieties sinceBlavatsky popularized it more than a century ago. Needless to say, she absorbedit from Indian philosophy, although the idea had been percolating in Westernthought for some time—we find it in Schopenhauer, Hegel, and theTranscendentalists. But Blavatsky got it across to thousands of readers whomight not otherwise have bothered with metaphysics.A corollary of this idea is that the universe, as R. M. Bucke recognized, isalive. There is no such thing as “dead matter.” The picture of the universe as avast space peppered here and there with blind, inert matter, which just bychance has “evolved” on our planet into what we call “life,” is the completeopposite of the truth. Life is not the exception; it's the rule. That theuniverse is one conscious, living being is a grand elaboration of JamesLovelock's Gaia hypothesis, yet Blavatsky predated his popularizing of the ideaby more than a century.4 [../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-4]Another central theosophical thought is that the human being, the highest formof life that we know, is a microcosm that encompasses in its being all theforces operating in the universe. The human being is not, as we are told againand again, merely one “thing” among others, but is in truth a “little universe.”In contrast to modern science which sees them as passive, accidental creaturesacted upon by physical forces beyond their control, human beings for Blavatskyhouse within themselves all of the energies available in the universe, and arecapable of using these at will. Magic is the knowledge of these energies and theability to use them, a discipline known and employed by the ancients, but lostto us with the rise of modern science.The cosmos itself, for Blavatsky, is not a static, once-and-for-all event, butis ever changing. For a generation anticipating the “heat death” of theuniverse, Blavatsky held out the idea that the universe had been created anddestroyed countless times, in an unending cycle of birth and death—an idea weourselves can draw on for comfort when we contemplate the Big Bang thatsupposedly started it all and the possible Big Crunch we may be heading toward.She also postulated that our universe is only one of an infinite number ofuniverses, another idea that has gained some scientific currency, mostly throughthe work of the physicist John Wheeler, but that found its way into sciencefiction books and films decades before he made it “scientifically acceptable.”Eternity for Blavatsky is “the playground of numberless Universes incessantlymanifesting and disappearing,”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-5] and the humansoul itself is involved in this ceaseless ebb and flow, incarnating and evolvingthrough all forms of manifestation, from the smallest atom to the Godhead.With her belief that “our universe is only one of an infinite number ofuniverses,”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-6] Blavatsky countered the deadeninginfluence of the second law of thermodynamics and its frightful prospects of thedeath of the cosmos. And with her ideas on cosmic evolution, she took on Darwin,and advanced an idea that would echo in popular culture in various formsthroughout the next century. Contra Darwin, Blavatsky declared that we were notdescended from the animals, but were in fact created by higher beings thatincarnate on our planet for the express purpose of guiding human evolution. Inthe early days of humankind, a “Great Being” appeared and, with a group of“semidivine” beings, formed a kind of nursery for future human adepts. Humandevelopment began, Blavatsky declared in The Secret Doctrine, not through thevagaries of chance and the pressures of survival, but through the agency of thehighest and best from other worlds. Almost a century later this idea wouldreappear in various forms in the late 1960s, in the best selling but absurdfantastications of Erich von Daniken and in the film collaboration betweenStanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both shared withBlavatsky a desire to bring mind in some form back into the origin of humankind.Far from feeling any debilitating mea culpa over being human, as some current“spiritually correct” teachings suggest, Blavatsky prophesied that all planets“are, were, or will be man-bearing,” an idea that in a different form was putforward recently by the physicist Frank Tippler.Blavatsky's account of the creation and evolution of humankind and the universewas based on several sources: knowledge given her by her Hidden Masters, theMahatmas; an ancient work called The Book of Dyzan, written in the secretlanguage called Senzar; and the Akashic Record, a kind of spiritual videotaperecord of the entire history of the universe. The Mahatmas have beenquestionable ever since Richard Hodgson's “exposé,” and the kabbalist scholarGershom Scholem argued that the stanzas from The Book Of Dyzan were based on anobscure seventeenth-century kabbalistic work. But the Akashic Record has faredbetter since Blavatsky first made public some of its revelations. The Sanskritword akasa, on which it is based, means “ether” or “space,” and the idea of someimmaterial medium housing otherwise inaccessible memories—memories notimmediately available to consciousness—has surfaced in different ways sinceBlavatsky's day. Jung's “collective unconscious” seems a variant of it, as doesRupert Sheldrake's “morphogenetic fields,” and the idea has resemblances toBergson's notion that we perceive more “virtually” than we are “actually”conscious of, as well as his belief that there is more in human consciousnessthan what is stored in the brain. It is also, of course, in line withOuspensky's realization that the “present” we perceive is only a section of afuller time dimension including the past and the future. As Blavatsky herselfremarked, “Time is only an illusion produced by the succession of our states ofconsciousness as we travel through eternal duration.”7[../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-7]Regardless of our reservations about its validity, Blavatsky's vision of humanand cosmic evolution is thrilling, and in many ways resembles a later vision offuture ages, the evolutionary science fiction epics of Olaf Stapledon.8[../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-8] Existence oscillates between two phases, thedays and nights of Brahma, manvantaras being the cosmic days and pralayas thecosmic nights. In the beginning—or at least in the most recent beginning—therewas, as in most accounts of creation, chaos, formless and void, an absolutenothing, something very much like the stage of nonexistence that present-daycosmologists postulate “existed before” the Big Bang. Then the vibrations ofeternity awaken to new life and a new manvantara is entered upon. The primordialessence separates itself into seven Rays that shape the created universe. TheseRays are in reality intelligent beings, the Dhyan Chohans, and, through the useof Fohat—a kind of universal energy—they fashion a new cosmos. Our own world isthe result of a kind of cosmic condensation, with stellar matter passing througha kind of whirlwind, which eventually collects into the nebula that will becomeour solar system and the Earth itself. The Earth is destined to progress throughseven “Rounds,” or periods of cosmic evolution. Seven is a central number forBlavatsky, as it is for a later reader of the Akashic Record, Rudolf Steiner.Not only does the Earth work through its sevenfold evolution—we are currently inthe fourth Round, a placement that Steiner will adopt as well—but the human racealso passes through a series of seven “Root Races.” In both cases the trajectoryis from an initial spiritual condition, through increasing solidification, to agrowing and eventually liberating etherealization.It is in the fourth Round that human beings appear on Earth. Four of the seven“Root Races” have appeared before our own, and two will follow. The first RootRace, which would scarcely appear human to us, inhabited a continent called the“Imperishable Sacred Land.” This first race were in fact pure spirit, beingwithout bodies, a condition shared by the second Root Race, the Hyperboreans.After the “Imperishable Sacred Land” was destroyed by a cataclysm—promptingcuriosity about the aptness of its name—the second race inhabited a land nearthe North Pole. In those days—several hundred million years ago—the axis of theEarth was not tilted as it is today, and the climate of the Pole was mild.9[../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-9] The third Root Race had its home on thecontinent of Lemuria—fragments of which remain today as Australia and EasterIsland. Not until eighteen million years ago, a comparatively short time inBlavatsky's cosmic history, did beings resembling us appear. It was during thebeginning of the fourth Round that the Higher Beings descended to the Earth.Their descent into physical bodies and the pleasures of material existence gaverise to the legend of the Fall. It was during this time that separation of thesexes took place; previously the first and second Root Races reproduced throughforms of parthenogenesis. It was during the later half of the third Root Racethat sex as we know it developed. This race met its end when the continent ofLemuria, which spanned what is now the Pacific, sank after a catastrophic fire.The next race to emerge did so on Atlantis. Eight hundred and fifty thousandyears ago, the fourth Root Race appeared on the fabled island continent, firstspoken of by Plato in the Timaeus and subsequently the subject of hundreds ofbooks. Possessing bodies, four senses (sight, hearing, touch, and smell; tastewould appear with the fifth Root Race), the Atlanteans were the most “humanlike” race so far. Masters of psychic powers and technology, they were in manyways more advanced than us; they had airships and could manipulate electricityand other forces. The Atlanteans, however, had a taste for black magic, as wellas for some unsavory sexual practices. According to Blavatsky, gorillas andchimpanzees, rather than being the forebears of humanity, were the product ofthe unwholesome union between decadent Atlanteans and certain “she animals.” Theidea that apes and other animals are not the “raw material” out of which homosapiens emerged, but are instead evolutionary cul-de-sacs stemming off from themain branch of human development, is one that would be picked up by severalesoteric thinkers who followed. (Tragically, in the hands of some fanaticalracial theorists it would be applied to various “inferior races,” with inhumanresults.)Some of the Atlanteans were giants, which explains the colossal scale of someancient architecture like Stonehenge and the pyramids. The Atlanteans, however,abused their power and knowledge, and the race sank into decadence as thecontinent itself began to sink below the waves. A last lingering portion,Poseidonis, remained to the very end, disappearing a mere eleven thousand yearsago. It was these final days of Atlantis that gave rise to the legends of theGreat Flood.Not all the Atlanteans met their doom; some travelled to what would becomeEgypt, some to the Americas. But they were soon overshadowed by the rise of thefifth Root Race, the Aryans, who, until the close of the nineteenth century,remained a kind of evolutionary avant-garde. Each Root Race breaks down intoseven Sub-Races—it would be too complicated and repetitious to follow all ofthem—and the fifth Sub-Race of the Aryans are the Anglo-Saxons. Blavatskybelieved that the sixth Sub-Race was being born on the western shores of theUnited States in the last decade of the nineteenth century. Two more races willappear after the Aryans perish—as Lemuria burned, and Atlantis sank, the Aryansare due to meet their end through some sort of gigantic earthquake, a shiftingof the planet's crust.10 [../Text/part0040.html#c8-FN-10] Exactly what willhappen after that is anyone's guess, but as Blavatsky told her followers, theadepts who had appointed her as their spokeswoman were working to guidehumankind through its cosmic maturity.However, not all the recipients of Blavatsky's cosmic wisdom were willing towait patiently for developments."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]DOCTOR STEINER, I PRESUME?In the same year that Madame Blavatsky published The Secret Doctrine, 1888, anunprepossessing young scholar gave a lecture to the Vienna Goethe Society on“Goethe as Father of a New Aesthetic.” The scholar had made a modest name forhimself a few years earlier as the editor of the great German poet's scientificwritings for an immense compilation of his work in the German NationalLiterature series. The young man had been twenty-one at the time, and the jobhad given him entrée into the literary and intellectual circles he had longwished to penetrate. It may seem surprising that the responsibility for editingGoethe's scientific work—which ran to several volumes—would have been entrustedto a young student, but the general opinion among the intelligentsia was thatGoethe's scientific forays were both worthless as science and dreary asliterature, and it is more than likely that no one of any higher standing wantedthe job. The young scholar, however, snapped at it. In Goethe he had foundconfirmation of the insights into the relation between the human mind andexternal reality that had come to him often as he contemplated nature. Not longafter editing Goethe's writings, he wrote his first book, Theory and Knowledgein Light of Goethe's Worldview (1886). It did not catapult him into fame, but itdid establish him as a serious thinker on the curious problems of epistemology,the difficult study of how we know what we know. It also led to other work.Earlier in 1888, the young man had taken up the post as editor of a weeklypolitical newspaper, the Deutsche Wochenshrift, but his tenure there did notlast long. Politics was not his forte, and, in any case, the romantic idealismthat inspired him was not quite what the Viennese reading public had in mind.Unabashed, he left the journal after six months. But his interest in Goetheremained, as did his enthusiasm. Both were to stay with him as the heart of aphilosophy that would reach from the hallowed halls of Weimar to the lostsecrets of Atlantis and the visionary future of the human race. The youngscholar's name was Rudolf Steiner.Rudolf Steiner was born in 1861 in Kraljevec, in what was then part ofAustria-Hungary, and is now Croatia. Given his contemplative nature, there couldhardly have been a more suitable environment for him to spend his early years.Mountains and green expanses were his playgrounds, with long walks in the nearbyforests providing ample time to study nature and her creations. The youngSteiner was also drawn to the electric telegraph that his father operated forthe Southern Austrian Railway, and to the trains that ran on the line. At thattime the telegraph was the cutting edge of technology, and train travel itselfwas still in its infancy.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c9-FN-1] The inquisitive youngboy could turn from the inspiring heights of the nearby Alps to the complexworkings of modern electronic communication. Rudolf Steiner started life at ameeting point between science and the beauties of nature, and the need tobalance this polarity remained with him throughout his career.Early intellectual influences came from mathematics and reading Euclid, and afascination with practical mysteries, such as how the raw material delivered toa nearby textile factory was transformed into the finished product, instilled adeep hunger for down-to-earth, hands-on experience in the young boy. Suchpractical matters played a central part in Steiner's later career—as architect,agriculturalist, educator, and homeopath—and need to be kept in mind whenconsidering his other talents as a seer and visionary.2[../Text/part0040.html#c9-FN-2] An early reading of Kant prepared him for hislater philosophical struggles. But there were other experiences as well, onesnot altogether common for growing boys. Like Madame Blavatsky, early on Steinershowed a propensity for peculiar psychic powers. Once, while sitting in a roomat his father's train station, the young Steiner saw a strange woman open thedoor and come in. She looked, he thought, like other members of his family.Standing in the middle of the room the woman looked at young Rudolf and said,“Try to help me as much as you can—now as well as in later life.” Then shewalked toward the stove and vanished. Steiner hesitated to tell his parents ofthe strange woman, fearing they would not believe him. But the next day he sawthat his father was upset and discovered that a female relative had killedherself; the suicide had taken place at the same time that Steiner had seen thestrange woman.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c9-FN-3]There were few Steiner could speak with about this strange experience, and itwas not until he was eighteen that he met someone with whom he could share hisinsights into the spiritual world. Although Steiner does not tell us in hisautobiography, his student Emil Bock later discovered that the humble, poor herbgatherer Steiner had come to know was named Felix Koguzki. Koguzki was not avery articulate man, but he shared the young Steiner's spiritual sensitivity. Ona train they shared once a week to Vienna—where Steiner by then was studying andKoguzki took his herbs to sell—the herb gatherer listened with sympathy to theyoung man's talk about the spirit world, and from his own simple but intensepiety he could answer him. It was the beginning of the long development ofspiritual self-confidence that preceded Steiner's first public expression of hisinsights in his fortieth year.There was one more fateful encounter. Not long after meeting Koguzki, Steinerhad conversations with someone who to this day remains unknown. All we know ofhim comes through the few references Steiner makes to him in his autobiography.He had as humble a position as the herb gatherer, but his influence on Steinerwas more intellectual. Steiner's conversations with this strange man helpedplant the seeds of what would later flower as one of the most successful andinfluential alternative teachings in the world today.But one more ingredient was needed. It is unclear exactly when Steiner firstbecame interested in Theosophy. He joined the Theosophical Society in 1902, andsoon after became the head of its German branch, as well as the editor of anesoteric journal, Lucifer, later called Lucifer-Gnosis. But his interest inTheosophy more than likely began several years earlier, in 1888, when he becameacquainted with Friedrich Eckstein at the Griensteidl Kaffe in Vienna. Eckstein,a wealthy patron of the arts, was Blavatsky's most important Viennese follower,and it is more than likely that he spoke of her and Theosophy to the earnestyoung scholar—Eckstein even records that at one point the young Goethean askedhim to explain exactly what Theosophy was about. Eckstein had brought a copy ofA. P. Sinnett's Esoteric Buddhism (1884) back with him from a trip to England,and soon after Steiner read it in its German translation. Around the same time,Steiner frequented the salon of the feminist Marie Lang. She and her husbandwere both ardent Theosophists, and conversations with them eventually convincedSteiner that, although the talk of Hidden Masters was too simplistic, there wasa core spiritual knowledge in Theosophy that warranted serious study.4[../Text/part0040.html#c9-FN-4]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]FROM GOETHEAN SCIENCE TO THE WISDOM OF THE HUMAN BEINGBy 1913 Rudolf Steiner had broken with the Theosophical Society, ostensibly overAnnie Besant's attempt to promote Jiddu Krishnamurti as the latest incarnationof the master Maitreya. Steiner combined his psychic sensitivity, his insightsinto Goethe's worldview, and the evolutionary framework of The Secret Doctrineinto a remarkable account of human and cosmic evolution. He named his newteaching Anthroposophy, the wisdom of the human being.It may seem that Goethe and Atlantis are the unlikeliest of bed fellows. Butwhat Steiner discovered in Goethe was an effective antidote to the prevailingassumption that human consciousness was “cut off” from reality, that oursubjective, interior world has no direct relation to nature and the externalworld, and hence no access to “truth.” For this point of view, all we know, andall we can ever know, is what is going on “inside our head,” and if we areinterested in knowing the “truth” about nature, we must look to science(although the obvious fact that scientists too have everything “inside theirheads” is conveniently ignored). As we saw in our discussion of Ouspensky andTertium Organum, this notion was associated with the philosophy of Kant, whoargued that the Ding-an-sich, or “thing-in-itself,” is forever beyond our reach.Ouspensky proposed one solution to this curious situation: enhance ourappreciation of space and time in order to perceive more of the world. Goethetook a different but related approach. He was extremely wary of metaphysics andsceptical of any purely abstract thinking that divorced human beings fromharmonious interaction with nature. He had an unshakeable bedrock faith in thesenses and was forever upbraiding his fellow Germans for their, to him,debilitating addiction to “ideas.” This is not to say that Goethe was a meresensualist with no interest in ideas. Indeed, it is an idea that led Steiner tofind in Goethe a countercurrent to Western materialist science. However, thisidea came to Goethe not through the detached thought-spinning of a mindabstracted from experience, but from his conscious and imaginative participationin the observation of nature. The kind of truth that would arrive at theconclusion that reality is forever beyond our grasp was for Goethe no truth atall, nor would that “reality” be of any use.For Goethe truth is “a revelation emerging at the point where the inner world ofman meets external reality. . . . It is a synthesis of world and mind, yieldingthe happiest assurance of the eternal harmony of existence.” This is so because“there resides, in the objective world, an unknown law which corresponds to theunknown law within subjective experience.”1 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-1]Goethe did not come to this conclusion through poetic meditation, but throughthe rigorous practice of scientific observation—which, for a poet like him,often meant the same thing. The “idea” mentioned above was Goethe's Urpflanze,the archetypal plant from which all others are derived, the subject of hisbotanical study The Metamorphosis of Plants. The details of his observationsneedn't concern us here, but what is curious and unusual about this “idea” isthat Goethe claimed that it was not solely a product of his head—of detachedabstract thinking—but was actually perceivable by closely observing a plant inthe process of growth. The trick is to observe it not with the cool detachmentof the scientist, careful to exclude any subjective element from theobservation, but with the imaginative warmth and ardor of an artist. In this wayGoethe claimed to have actually seen the Urpflanze itself, and it is only inthis way, he says, when human imagination “participates” in the external world,that truth, or at least any truth worth having, emerges. Admittedly, this is aradical departure from the idea of truth, and the place of human consciousnessin relation to it, that has held center stage for the last three centuries.One of the targets of Goethe's criticism was “transcendental philosophy,”epitomized in the philosophy of Kant. The other was modern science or, perhapsmore accurately, the “scientism” that was then emerging and has since become ourown dominant sensibility. Goethe found both ultimately debilitating and antilifebecause both were founded on abstraction at the cost of experience. His approachwas phenomenological: what were important for him were the actual phenomena ofour experience—blue skies, green grass, white clouds. Kant, as we have seen,argued that there is good reason to suspect that these things may not exist inreality—as, that is, things-in-themselves. Science undermined a faith in theimmediacy of our experience in a similar way.We can characterize the advance of science as the sole arbiter of truth byseeing in it the gradual expulsion of human consciousness from its object ofstudy. This began when Galileo split—“bifurcated,” in Alfred North Whitehead'sphrase—reality into two camps, which for convenience we can call thequantitative and the qualitative, or, following Galileo, primary and secondaryqualities. Primary qualities were all those things that could be measured withcertainty and that would remain constant, regardless of how they were perceivedby an observer: position, speed, mass, etc. Secondary qualities were thosethings that were “purely subjective,” meaning the sensual aspect of experience:the blazing reds of a sunset or the refreshing caress of a breeze. Primaryqualities were primary because they could be accurately and repeatedly measured.And because they could be measured they were considered “real”—which meant theyexisted “objectively,” on their own, independent of human subjectivity.Secondary qualities—which in effect are what we mean by “the world” (we areusually more interested in the sensuous aspect of a tree than in its mass)—wereby definition “unreal,” or, as the cliché goes, “merely subjective.”2[../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-2] Thus, where we, as sensuous interpreters ofreality, see a glorious sunset and feel the mystical awe that often accompaniesthis experience, the ideal “objective” observer—some recording device orother—would perceive “reality” in the raw: a collection of colorlesselectromagnetic waves refracted through the Earth's atmosphere.Although Goethe the poet was concerned about the threat to poetry that such adevelopment suggested—he knew that the beauties of nature, both the naturalphenomena themselves and our subjective response to them, would lose theirprimacy as they were methodically “explained” by science—what troubled him moredeeply was that such an idea of truth would eventually leave humanity as themaster of a spiritually void reality. For there was no doubt that science“worked.” Today we are convinced of this as never before. But it is also truethat we are more alienated from ourselves and from our world than at any othertime in history. The truths this science was uncovering were inimical to usbecause they extracted human consciousness from the world and pushed it furtherand further back into a narrow corner, while opening up a “reality” that was asdull and dead as it was pointless. Truths such as these stood the whole idea ofthe value of truth on its head, a recognition Nietzsche would bring to itsironic and paradoxically logical conclusion later in the century. Truth, forGoethe, is only of value if we can harmonize it into our total being. Theabstract concepts of a detached objective science were not of this sort. Moredangerously, they advanced people's power to manipulate nature without advancingtheir capacity to appreciate her. Goethe, a more robust soul than Nietzsche, metthe challenge head on and sought to beat the scientists at their own game byshowing that human consciousness is an integral part of truth—most famously inthe color theory he developed contra Newton. The success he had can be measuredby the fact that his scientific writings—which he considered more important thanhis poetry—were left in the hands of the unknown twenty-one-year-old RudolfSteiner.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-3]By the time Steiner began to develop the ideas that would take shape asAnthroposophy, the scientism Goethe wished to counter had long been establishedas the “official” guarantor of truth, a position it now holds unrivaled acentury later. There had of course been many warning voices. William Blake,Goethe's more obscure contemporary, spoke of the “Satanic mills” blackeningEngland's green and pleasant land. Others followed—Madame Blavatsky, as we haveseen, was one. By the end of the nineteenth century a veritable chorus had risenup against the juggernaut of material progress and scientific rationalism. Yetscience and the scientific sensibility were so successful that they could absorbthese criticisms and relegate them to impotent sentimentality, while pointingout their own undeniable concrete achievements. To have any influence on thetimes, something more than poetry was needed: science had to be fought withscience. And this is what Rudolf Steiner decided to do.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]The science Steiner had in mind was the rigorous investigation and explorationof consciousness. This meant understanding how our own consciousness arrived atwhere it is today. Goethe was important for Steiner because in his pursuit ofthe Urpflanze Goethe pointed to a relationship between the inner and outerworlds that had existed in the past and that Steiner believed would exist again,in a different way, in the future. With a poet's intuition and a scientist'sscrutiny, Goethe had hit on the crucial insight that human consciousness wasnot, as Descartes and those who followed him believed, a passive mirrorreflecting an external world whose “laws” determined it with ironboundnecessity; consciousness, rather, was a cocreator of that world. Or, as Steinerwould say in an early work on Goethe, speaking of our relationship to theexternal world: “Man is not only there in order to form for himself a picture ofthe finished world; nay, he himself cooperates in bringing the world intoexistence.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-4]Steiner believed that our modern consciousness is not the only kind ofconsciousness. He knew that although we take it for granted and assume that theconsciousness we experience is consciousness per se, throughout history humanbeings have perceived the world in ways much different than the way we perceiveit. Steiner, like Madame Blavatsky, accepted Darwin's idea of evolution,realizing that, like everything else in the world, consciousness, too, hasevolved. But also like Blavatsky, he argued that Darwin and his followers hadgrabbed the stick at the wrong end: matter or material pressures such assurvival had not produced spirit—our subjective, interior world. It was ratherthe other way around: the material world we perceive through the senses is acreation of consciousness as it unfolds in its evolution. The “spiritualscience” Steiner devoted the last twenty-five years of his life to advancing wasan elaborate, detailed, and inspiring—if often intellectuallychallenging—account of that evolution.Steiner had made an early attempt at communicating his belief in the primacy ofthought and thinking. But in an age given over to explaining inner experience byanchoring it in the brain's chemical exchanges, a work of subtle epistemologylike The Philosophy Of Freedom (1894)5 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-5] wasbound to have little effect. Even qualified thinkers like Eduard von Hartmann,author of the once immensely influential The Philosophy of the Unconscious(1869), had no insight into the book's importance. Yet its basic message, thatthought and the conscious ego behind it are the real expressions of anirreducible spiritual freedom, is one that is as important to grasp today as itwas a century ago.Steiner begins the book with a fundamental philosophical question, whose answerwill determine the importance of any questions that follow: “Is a human beingspiritually free, or subject to the iron necessity of natural law?”6[../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-6] Put this way, it is clear that it is only as a“spiritually free being” that we can engage in any kind of true thinking at all.A computer, however great its speed in processing information, never “thinks,”because it operates according to a set of rules dictated by its program. Itcannot choose what to think. But once we seriously engage with a question orintuition by making the gesture of inner effort, then we are in touch with thatpart of ourselves that is truly free, because it is only from that “free” partthat such effort can arise. (Bergson, we remember, said that the force of mindhas “the faculty of drawing from itself more than it contains.”) In the greatGerman philosophical tradition, Steiner spends more than two hundred pagesmethodically and powerfully arguing that human beings are indeed “free” and thatthrough the rigorous observation of our thinking we can become aware ofourselves as conscious, spiritual entities.Steiner's arguments are not difficult to follow; they do, however, demand aserious, flexible, and alert mind. The curious thing about The Philosophy ofFreedom is that in actually accompanying Steiner in his step-by-step expositionwe become aware of our own thinking as an activity, which is precisely theexperience Steiner wants us to have; it demonstrates better than any argumentthe reality of our freedom. The book's subject is the very activity we engage inas we try to understand it. It is a book about thinking, and it succeeds, notwhen it “convinces” us of its arguments, but when, by prompting us to thinkabout our own thinking, it triggers the very experience it is trying todescribe.7 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-7] Steiner demonstrates that thephysical world which materialist science argues is the true root of “spirit” isitself a product of spirit. As William James and Henri Bergson would arguearound the same time, without the selective activity of the mind there would beno “world,” only a formless chaos. Or, as Steiner put it in another work, “Thecontent of reality is only the reflection of the content of our minds. . . . Wereceive from reality only the empty forms.”8 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-8]When neuroscientists observe the brain and its chemical reactions—the physicalbasis of thought—they are also observing their own thought. Consciousness isthere, because it is only through consciousness that any observation can takeplace: we can never get at some “purely” material stuff, because any such stuffwould of necessity be part of our mental world. Matter itself is an idea. Andwhen the materialists reply that all this is poppycock, they rely onarguments—that is, thoughts and ideas—to do so. Even the thought that thinkingcan be explained by reducing it to brain processes is itself something more thanthose processes—it is, as Steiner would patiently point out, a thought.This leads to another central observation: our thoughts are not arbitrary,negligible epiphenomena taking place in our heads, with no relation to theworld. They are as much a part of the phenomena of the world as the flowers andleaves of plants. Common sense tells us that the world is “complete” withoutyour or my thoughts, which are “tacked on” to it, solely inside our heads. ButSteiner tells us that we have no right to think this. “Doesn't the world bringforth thinking in human heads with the same necessity that it brings forthblossoms on the plant?”9 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-9] If you plant a seed inthe earth, it will send out roots and stem, blossoms and fruit. If youcontemplate the plant, as Goethe did in search of the Urpflanze, it will bringforth concepts. Why, Steiner, asks, aren't these as much a part of the plant asits leaves? This organic relation between inner and outer worlds also does awaywith the notion that we are forever cut off from the reality that lies behindour perceptions. Transcendentalism is right to believe that there is somegreater reality than what we experience through the senses, but that greaterreality is not some inaccessible thing-in-itself; it is our own inner responseto the world, the concepts we bring forth to complement and fulfill bare senseperception.From all of this Steiner arrives at the centrality of the conscious ego, the“I,” an emphasis that runs counter to a great deal of “antiego” thought popularin our time. Contrary to philosophies as disparate as poststructualism andJungian psychology, as well as to various scientific attempts to explain it inmolecular, Darwinian, or other determinist ways, Steiner declares the human ego,the “I,” to be the aim of the entire world process. That process is theevolution of consciousness. This emphasis on the ego was shared by two ofSteiner's predecessors, the philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) andMax Stirner (1806–1856).10 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-10] But Steiner takesthe ego into areas neither of his philosophical antecedents had anticipated.Practically everything Steiner wrote or lectured about is rooted in hisconception of the evolution of consciousness. And although a beginning readermay rightly feel daunted by the prospect of so many volumes, the basic ideas,although highly challenging to modern scientistic sensibilities, are relativelyeasy to grasp—which is not to say they are simple. But Steiner had the systembuilder's penchant for taking a core idea and extrapolating from it andelaborating on it until it encompassed the world. As a brief survey of his workshows, he applied his central theme to a dizzying number of subjects:reincarnation, art, education, diet, architecture, agriculture, history,healing, to name a few. As I mentioned, Steiner adopted the importance of thenumber seven from Theosophy. Like Blavatsky, he taught that our world evolvesthrough seven planetary incarnations; but he goes on to relate these to ourseven “bodies,” as well as to the seven levels of consciousness we and the worldwill pass through during our cosmic evolution. Also like Blavatsky, Steinerspeaks of Hyperborea, Lemuria, and Atlantis. More immediately significant forour purposes, are the seven “post-Atlantean epochs” that follow the sinking ofthe fabled continent, the fifth of which we are currently experiencing.Like Madame Blavatsky, Steiner too was a reader of the Akashic Record. But therewas a difference between their accounts. The reason for this, Steiner claimed,was that Blavatsky read the Akashic Record haphazardly, while in a state oftrance; Steiner, however, had developed a method of perceiving it whileretaining full consciousness. With his emphasis on the central importance of theconscious ego, he had little faith in mediumship or trance states, arguing thatpenetrating other spheres is of little use if one lacks the clarity of mind toobserve them accurately. One result of this is that Steiner's accounts have aprecision unlike other reports of the Akashic Record.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Exactly what Steiner did when he “read” the Akashic Record is a matter ofconjecture, although there are some indications. In his book Rudolf SteinerEnters My Life, Friedrich Rittelmeyer remarks that when people came to Steinerfor spiritual advice he would arrange to sit where he could avoid looking intothe light. Then he would lower his eyes and make a “certain deliberateadjustment of his being.” Rittelmeyer remarks, “With Rudolf Steiner there was noquestion of trance. One looked into the superconscious, not into a dark, dreamysubconsciousness. . . . He seemed to pass without effort into the higher statesof consciousness; or rather it was as if both states of consciousness, that ofsense perception and of spiritual perception, were there for him freely andnaturally.”11 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-11]Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]If, as is clear, Steiner was adamantly against trance states, then one asks whatexactly was the “deliberate adjustment of his being” Rittelmeyer refers to? Onepossibility is that Steiner had developed a method of entering what are known as“hypnagogic states.”12 [../Text/part0040.html#c10-FN-12] We will return to thisidea shortly, but first we need to take a look at exactly what Steiner “saw”when he “read” the Akashic Record."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]COSMIC EVOLUTIONAccording to Steiner, our present solar system has evolved out OF three previousstages, which he, with a perhaps unfortunate choice of terms, calls Old Saturn,Old Sun, and Old Moon. (He uses “old” to differentiate these ancient “planets”from the current celestial bodies bearing these names.) Although Steiner usesastronomical terms, he did not believe that these ancient “planets” existed inwhat we would call material form. He sees the Saturn stage as characterized byheat and the Sun stage by the addition of air, or gas, while during the Moonphase water, or liquid was introduced. Only in our present Earth stage, whichrepresents the ultimate stage of materialization, do the planets appear in theirsolid physical forms. Following Earth, there will be three more planetaryincarnations: Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan, which will involve an increasingspiritualization. The entire process is under the guidance of what Steiner callsthe “spiritual hierarchies,” who serve in his system the same function asBlavatsky's Dhyan Chohans.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c11-FN-1]After reaching the Earth stage of evolution, what we might call the beginningsof creatures like ourselves took shape, although, at this point, human “bodies”were more like gas than anything else. Steiner follows Madame Blavatsky inspeaking of Hyperborea and Lemuria. Major cataclysms took place during theseperiods, such as the extrusion of our present Sun and Moon from the Earth, apoint on which Steiner differs considerably from current astronomy. The Moon hadto be removed, Steiner tells us, because once the Sun had broken off, the“hardening” forces of the Moon threatened to solidify human beings prematurely.After Lemuria came Atlantis, and it was here that our physical body wasperfected. Following the destruction of Atlantis, Steiner tells us that thehuman race evolved through what he calls the post-Atlantean epochs. There areseven of these in all; currently we are in the fifth post-Atlantean epoch, withtwo more to follow. Each is devoted to the perfection of a certain stage ofconsciousness, related to one of our nonphysical bodies. The firstpost-Atlantean epoch began in 7227 B.C. and lasted until 5067 B.C. This was theAncient Indian epoch and its “mission” was the development of the etheric body.The second post-Atlantean epoch—the Ancient Persian epoch—focused on theperfection of the astral body, and lasted from 5067 B.C. until 2907 B.C. Thethird post-Atlantean epoch, the Egypto Chaldean, began in 2097 B.C. and lasteduntil 747 B.C. It was concerned with developing what Steiner calls the “sentientsoul.” With the descent and crucifixion of Christ during the fourth postAtlantean epoch—747 B.C.– A.D. 1413—the detached, objective “I” was brought toperfection. This is known as the Greco Roman–Christian epoch, and its missionwas the development of the “intellectual soul.” During this period the Earthreached its most “material” state; the process of “hardening,” which beganduring the Lemurian phase, reached its peak—or, more accurately, its nadir—andthe return trip to the more spiritual states began, Christ's crucifixion beingthe exact midpoint of the entire process. The current epoch, the fifth, began in1413 and will last, Steiner tells us, until 3573. It is called theEuropean-American epoch and its goal is the perfection of the “consciousnesssoul.” Each epoch has its own presiding spirit, or Zeitgeist, the current onebeing Michael, whose mission is to guide us to regain our spiritual perceptionwithout losing the powers of independent thought and critical observation wehave acquired through our “descent” into matter. In Michael's mission to help us“recognize the supersensible in the immediate sense world,”2[../Text/part0040.html#c11-FN-2] we can recognize the Goethean science that liesat the heart of Steiner's project. Unfortunately, some of the spiritualhierarchies seek to impede our evolution, and throughout its history, Luciferand Ahriman have tempted human beings away from their true destiny.This brief and sketchy run-through can give only a bare hint of the complexevents Steiner “saw” as he read the Akashic Record. The entire process, from OldSaturn to our present state and beyond, is aimed at developing our independencefrom the spiritual powers presiding over the affair. This seems odd, until werealize that what is essential for Steiner is our capacity to freely embracethose powers. Earlier ages and, indeed, whole planetary incarnations, enjoyed agreater and more intimate participation with the spiritual forces than we do.But the consciousness associated with these periods was not free in the sense weare today. Again, one might ask, Why, if in earlier times conditions were more“spiritual,” did spirit, or consciousness, become more “material”? Steinerreplied to this in Cosmic Memory: “It requires a higher power and capacity todirect denser forms of substantiality than to control those less dense.”3[../Text/part0040.html#c11-FN-3] Spirit descended into matter in order todevelop its power of control. It was only by slowly “detaching” itself from itssource that consciousness could return to that source and yet retain its ownbeing and independence. In earlier times, the kind of clairvoyance, spiritualsight, and other paranormal abilities that we find exceptional were commonplace.This was one of Steiner's arguments against trance-states and mediums likeMadame Blavatsky: they were a kind of “throwback” to an earlier, atavistic stateof consciousness. Given the trajectory of human evolution, a philosopher likeBertrand Russell, for all his scepticism and abstract rationality, was a moreapt example of the appropriate stage of human consciousness in the modern world.Yet, for all its incisive power, Russell's desiccating intellect had to betranscended as well. As Robert A. McDermott remarks, “This entire cycle . . .has had as its primary task the perfection of the physical, rational, and egopowers of humanity in combination with the spiritual powers possessed by theAtlanteans and those born in the early epochs of the present cycle.”4[../Text/part0040.html#c11-FN-4] All of Steiner's thinking has this character:an earlier stage, once passed through, is not abandoned, but is insteadintegrated into the next stage.Steiner encapsulated his teaching on our previous states of consciousness in aseries of lectures given in Munich in 1907; now available under the titleRosicrucian Wisdom, they present perhaps the best short introduction to hisideas.In the Saturn condition, consciousness was in a very dull, deep state, whichSteiner calls “deep trance consciousness.” Mediums are familiar with this state;in it, all other conscious activity is deadened, and those exhibiting it appearto be virtually dead. In the Saturn condition, the mind is unaware of itsimmediate surroundings, but conscious of what Steiner calls “cosmic conditions.”This is not the same as Bucke's “cosmic consciousness.” It is a “deep tranceconsciousness” that seems to be a curiously insensible state, a condition of akind of dull “universal awareness.” The mineral world, Steiner says, stillexperiences such a state, and if we could speak to minerals, they would tell uswhat things were like on Old Saturn.On Old Sun, consciousness existed in a kind of perpetual sleep, the deep,dreamless sleep we experience today. It is still rather dull, but by comparisonwith Old Saturn consciousness it is relatively clearer. On Earth today, theplant world shares this sleep state—we remember Bergson's remark that thevegetable kingdom had “fallen asleep in immobility.”5[../Text/part0040.html#c11-FN-5] If plants could speak, Steiner tells us, theycould tell us what conditions were like on Old Sun.On Old Moon, consciousness was what Steiner calls “picture consciousness.” Wecan best understand it, he says, by considering our own dreams. In comparisonwith our clear, waking-state consciousness, dream consciousness is still quitedim, but compared to Old Saturn and Old Sun, it is much better defined.Nevertheless, instead of a clear perception of an object in a physical worldexternal to us, which is what we get in our waking-state, picture consciousnessencounters only symbols and representations, as in dreams. On Old Moon, insteadof seeing another human being's physical body, we would perceive a kind of aura,and from its colors we would know whether the being was a friend or not. OldMoon consciousness also lacked our clear-cut sense of time and space, again asis the case in dreams. On Old Moon, images were not “fixed” to objects as theyare for us—Steiner speaks of colors and forms hovering “freely in space.” ThisOld Moon consciousness strikes me as very important, and we will return to itshortly.What we know as “consciousness” first appeared on our present Earth. This is ourfamiliar clear, rational consciousness. Its central characteristic is theawareness of a solid, well-defined physical world that appears external to us.It is the world “out there,” which we generally assume exists as it appears tous, whether or not we are conscious of it and, indeed, whether or not we existat all. This external world appears to us to be completely independent of ourconsciousness, a point we will return to later. Although we can withdraw ourawareness of the external world and focus it on our thoughts, memories, orimagination, the images associated with these “inner objects” are generally notvery vivid, unlike images in dreams, and most of the time our waking state isconcerned with “dealing” with events in the outside world. That, in fact, is ourgauge for determining whether or not someone is sane. An inability ordisinclination to acknowledge the world outside our own subjectivity isgenerally a characteristic we associate with madness.Beyond our everyday waking state, Steiner foresees three further states ofconsciousness, which he links to the future incarnations of the Earth asJupiter, Venus, and Vulcan. He calls the next level of consciousnessImagination, in which our clear, waking consciousness is combined with thepicture consciousness of Old Moon. This is what consciousness will be likeduring the Jupiter incarnation. After that, during the Venus incarnation, thestate of consciousness Steiner calls Inspiration will appear. This is wakingconsciousness and picture consciousness, plus the consciousness of Old Sun.Finally, in the Vulcan incarnation, the last three states will be joined withthe consciousness of Old Saturn, in the state Steiner calls Intuition. Butunlike the initial “dull” Saturn condition, this universal consciousness will beperceived in a clear, waking state, and so may be much more like the “cosmicconsciousness” Bucke spoke of.Of these different levels of consciousness, the one that strikes me as the mostinteresting is the one Steiner calls Imagination. Being the next level in line,it is the one we would have a good chance of experiencing. And having said that,it strikes me that we already do experience it, because it is not only in dreamsthat the curious conditions Steiner associates with Old Moon consciousnessappear. They are also associated with what are known as “hypnagogic” states."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]HYPNAGOGIAThe literature on hypnagogia was relatively thin until 1987, WHEN ProfessorAndreas Mavromatis of Brunel University published the first full-scale accountof this strange state of consciousness. In Hypnagogia: The Unique State ofConsciousness Between Wakefulness and Sleep, Mavromatis maps out thephilosophical, psychological, paranormal, and neurological implications of thisweirdly suggestive state of mind. Each of us experiences hypnagogic states atleast twice a day, but most of us have little awareness or knowledge of them. Asthe title indicates, hypnagogic hallucinations—visual, audial, even sometimesolfactory—occur at the onset of sleep. When they occur as we are waking, theyare called hypnopompic. (There is some debate over whether the actualexperiences differ in any significant way, but the terms simply relate towhether one is entering or leaving sleep.) Mavromatis establishes that in statesof hypnagogia we can become aware of generally “unconscious” processes, such asdreams, while remaining conscious. Allowing for oversimplification, a shorthanddefinition of hypnagogia is that it is “dreaming while awake.” However, thesedreams are not simple “daydreams.” As Mavromatis shows, in hypnagogia we can“see” sometimes utterly bizarre images and visions with an unsettling clarity,while remaining perfectly aware of the “outside world.” Mavromatis also relateshypnagogia to paranormal experiences such as precognition, synchronicities, andclairvoyance; to creativity; and to psychological and spiritual growth. He alsodiscusses the interest in them shown by other esoteric thinkers, such asOuspensky and the Scandinavian philosopher Emmanuel Swedenborg.1[../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-1] If, as is clear, Steiner maintained theimportance of retaining rational consciousness while “reading” the AkashicRecord, then some form of hypnagogic state may have been his means of doing so.There is even the possibility that a kind of consciously induced hypnagogicstate may be what Steiner has in mind as the next stage in the evolution ofconsciousness.As Mavromatis and others have pointed out, the images and pictures that appearin states of hypnagogia are almost always “auto-symbolic”—they represent eitherthe physical or psychological states of the persons experiencing them, or theirthoughts as they drifted out of consciousness. People experiencing hypnagogichallucinations often shift in and out of a “normal” sense of space and time.They see strange landscapes, and entire adventures can unfold in a few moments.Mavromatis conducted experiments in controlled hypnagogia and discovered thatunder certain conditions subjects were able to focus on the hypnagogic imagerywhile at the same time maintaining a clear awareness of the external world, evento the point of carrying on a conversation. Mavromatis also discovered that itwas possible to induce particular imagery in some subjects through mentalsuggestion—in other words, that hypnagogia could be telepathic, and that it evencould be shared among several subjects.In the fascinating chapter “The Old Versus the New Brain,” Mavromatis arguesthat hypnagogia is linked to the subcortical structures of the brain, which areknown collectively as the “old brain.” During states of hypnagogia, he claims,the usually dominant neocortex—the evolutionarily recent and specifically“human” part of the brain—is inhibited, and much older structures, such as thereticular brainstem core, hippocampus, medulla oblongata, and thalamus, “takeover.” Cortical brain activity is associated with clear, logical thought andwith the perception of a well-defined “external” world. When such activity isinhibited—during sleep, for instance, or in states of deep relaxation—the olderbrain structures dominate. These structures are more attuned to inner experienceand to a “prelogical” form of thought that uses imagery, symbols, and analogyrather than language and clearly defined concepts. If we remember that Steinerclaimed that Old Moon or picture consciousness is an older form ofconsciousness, then much of what Mavromatis says about the activity of the oldbrain during hypnagogia seems suggestive.For example, Steiner says that in picture consciousness “human beings livedentirely in such pictures as they have in modern dreams, but then they expressedrealities.” These pictures, however, “hovered freely in space.” Steiner uses ourperception of the color blue as an example. In picture consciousness, blue “wasnot resting upon objects. . . . The form of beings with a colored surface couldnot have been perceived at that time.” Instead an inhabitant of Old Moon wouldhave seen “a freely hovering picture of form and color.” Steiner uses theexample of salt, saying that when we see salt on a table today, we see it as agranular object of a definite color occupying a specific space. Pictureconsciousness, however, would perceive it as a freely floating color and form.2[../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-2]Mavromatis suggests that the function of cortical consciousness is to“stabilize” and “objectify” sensation: “Consciousness as such does not reside inthe cortex, but in the old brain; it is the specificity of consciousness thatthe cortex is concerned with—it provides sequential-temporal and spatialrelationships, it particularizes and individualizes existence.”3[../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-3] Given that in picture consciousness sensationis neither stable nor objectified, but, as Steiner says, “free floating,” thekind of consciousness preceding the development of the cortex must have beensomething like the kind Steiner describes. Mavromatis also links subcorticalactivity to “paranormal” phenomena like “blind sight” and “paroptic vision,” thecurious ability to “see” without the use of the eyes. Unlike “normal” sight,which is focused and directed linearly—we speak of a line of sight—paropticvision is spherical, meaning that it can “see” in all directions equally; italso seems to be able to detect colors beyond our ultraviolet limit.4[../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-4]Mavromatis also speculates that consciousness began with a single “nuclear”sense out of which the later specific senses developed. This nuclear sense wassynesthetic, meaning that it was a form of perception in which all of our laterdifferentiated sense perceptions were combined. Rather than having our presentsensory specificity, in which colors are clearly differentiated from sounds,taste from scent, and so on, this primitive “nuclear” sense would have been akind of general “awareness,” probably tactile in character, lacking the kind ofsharp differences between things we now know. This primitive nuclear sensestrikes me as similar to the “dull” universal awareness of Old Saturn referredto by Steiner.Mavromatis's conjecture that consciousness proceeds from a diffuse synestheticstate to the perception of an external world containing well-defined objects isstrikingly like Steiner's outline of the evolution of consciousness through thesequence of planetary incarnations. And if, as Steiner argues, the developmentof “supersensible” perception is achieved through a “return” to an earlier stageof consciousness while maintaining clear, rational awareness, then Mavromatis'sremarks on hypnagogia warrant serious consideration.For instance, if, as Mavromatis maintains, synesthesia is characteristic ofearlier stages of consciousness, then one is surprised to discover thatsynesthetic phenomena are precisely what the person developing supersensibleperceptions experiences.5 [../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-5] In a series oflectures on music given in Berlin in 1906, Steiner remarks that as the initiateproceeds in developing “supersensible perception” one of the signs of success isthat his or her dream life changes. From the usual chaos of symbolicrepresentations, the initiate enters a world of “flowing colors and radiantlight beings.”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-6] This, Steiner says, is the“astral world.” Curiously, he remarks that the astral world is always presentand surrounds us continuously, and that only the presence of our everydayconsciousness prevents us from perceiving it. Similarly, Mavromatis tells usthat the subcortical structures responsible for hypnagogic phenomena are alwaysactive, and it is only the dominance of the neocortex that obscures their work.(Just as the stars are always present in the sky, and it is only the brillianceof the Sun that obscures them.)After sufficient training, resulting in a transformation of the state of deep,dreamless sleep, the initiate enters a second higher world. In this world, whichSteiner calls Devachan, a world of “resounding tones” permeates the color worldof the astral. At a deeper level of the Devachan, these tones begin to be heardas words. Steiner goes on to say that all of us experience these differentworlds as we pass through sleep; the difference between a non-initiate and aninitiate is that the initiate undergoes these experiences consciously.Mavromatis records that colors, tones, and words are all experienced duringhypnagogic states, oftentimes in startling combinations. Similarly, Steinerremarks in How to Know Higher Worlds that one of the first signs of advance onthe path of initiation is that one begins to be conscious in one's dreams. Oneof Mavromatis's descriptions of the hypnagogic state is that it can becharacterized as either being awake while dreaming or dreaming while awake. Hegoes on to relate hypnagogia to what is described in Tantric Yoga as the “FourthState,” “the half-dream state,” which is the junction of all the states—waking,sleeping, and dreaming. Maintaining awareness while in this state is essential,because by doing this the student will ensure the “continuity of consciousnessunaffected by sleep.”Curiously, this “intersection” of states is paralleled in the anatomy of thebrain responsible for it. Mavromatis points out that the thalamus, which heconjectures is the “center of consciousness” and the probable source ofhypnagogic phenomena, is anatomically linked to the reptilian brain (centralcore), limbic system (paleomammalian brain), and the cerebral hemispheres—thethree “houses” of the “triune” human brain. He suggests that each of the “threebrains” has a consciousness and a logic of its own, and that the “consciousness”of one level would appear very strange to that of another.7[../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-7] In hypnagogia, he argues, the dominance of thecortex is inhibited through the onset of sleep, or through deep relaxation,allowing the “consciousness” of the other brains to appear. Usually, corticalconsciousness is completely absent as we fall asleep, so we pass into theseother states unawares. But if a minimum level of cortical arousal is maintained,then the consciousness of the old brain can be observed. This can be done,Mavromatis suggests, in meditative states which are characterized by theactivation of the thalamus and other old-brain structures, and during which thepractitioner is on guard against “falling asleep.”Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]The thalamus is also important, Mavromatis argues, because located within it isthe pineal gland, that tiny organ the philosopher Descartes believed to be theseat of the soul, whose function is still somewhat of a mystery today. Datingback to the Devonian and Silurian periods, the pineal gland is extremely old.One of its earliest functions in primitive reptiles was as a kind of eye locatedin the top of the head, and in some contemporary vertebrates, includingourselves, the pineal gland is still photosensitive. In human beings, the early“pineal eye” appears in the initial stages of embryonic life; it soondisappears, but its associated gland remains. And this, like the ancient eye, issensitive to light.Recently, one crucial function of the pineal gland has become clear: it is theonly gland in mammals that produces the amino acid melatonin, which is importantin the production of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Melatonin is also involvedin the synthesis, release, and levels of serotonin in the hypothalamus, as wellas in the synthesis and distribution of other neurotransmitters in other partsof the brain. Melatonin is also linked to skin color, and this function isassociated with the pineal gland's sensitivity to light.An excess of light and stress tends to inhibit the production of melatonin,resulting in a decrease in the size and weight of the pineal gland. Darkness andrelaxation have the opposite effect, increasing the synthesis of melatonin aswell as the pineal gland's overall activity. Melatonin itself has a calmingeffect on the nervous system, and it is thought that its production is increasedthrough meditation or deep relaxation, creating a kind of positive feedback:meditation stimulating the production of melatonin, which increases feelings ofcalm and detachment, which lead to greater production of melatonin, and so on.That the pineal gland is located precisely where ancient Vedic literature placesthe “third eye,” whose function is “spiritual vision” and whose opening resultsin “enlightenment,” offers some hard, neurological evidence for a belief toooften relegated to fancy and superstition. Mavromatis likewise remarks that inthe Vedic tradition the spiritual vision provided by the third eye was onceavailable to human beings and has only been temporarily lost, its return at ahigher level guaranteed through our spiritual evolution. The similarity withSteiner's teaching need not be stressed, and Mavromatis himself suggests thatthe conscious participation in hypnagogia, with its access to other realitiesand “earlier” forms of consciousness, is a good candidate for the next step inhuman evolution. He also relates the pineal gland and its unique function to theoccult and esoteric symbolism of the scepter of Hermes. In the twin snakescoiled about a rod crowned by a winged cone, Mavromatis sees the integration ofour conscious and unconscious minds, united by the unique state of hypnagogia.The means of inducing hypnagogia, or more precisely, of becoming aware of thehypnagogic imagery that is continuously emerging into consciousness, is alsosuggestive of Steiner's method of “reading” the Akashic Record. That Steiner sat“where he would not be obliged to look against the light,” and the “deliberateadjustment of his being, often accompanied by a lowering of the eyes,” suggeststhe darkness and the relaxed, meditative state conducive to the activity of thepineal gland.8 [../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-8] Such states promote the “minimumdegree of arousal without active thinking” that Mavromatis argues are essentialfor conscious awareness of hypnagogic imagery. In such meditative states thethalamus and other old-brain structures become active and cause the cortex to“idle.” The old brain then “declares its independence” from the cerebral cortex.Yet the “minimum degree of arousal” prevents cortical consciousness fromdisappearing completely and promotes the peculiar characteristics of hypnagogia.An old-brain structure like the hippocampus, for example, is concerned withmaintaining the distinction between perception and internal imagery. Yet if atthe point of sleep, or during self-induced states of relaxation, the “minimumdegree of arousal” is maintained, then the function of the hippocampus can beinhibited, and internal imagery may be experienced as external perception. Giventhe exceptionally detailed and vivid accounts of human and cosmic evolutionpresented in Steiner's lectures, one comes away with the impression that thesewere things he saw, almost as if there was a kind of continuous film running inhis consciousness.9 [../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-9] Again, as the “older” formsof thinking associated with hypnagogia are preverbal, it is not surprising thatFriedrich Rittelmeyer remarks that he “often noticed that at the beginning of aconversation it was not easy for [Steiner] to find the right words. One said tooneself then that he had surely been occupied with his spiritual investigationsand needed a few seconds for the transition to the world of purely physicalexistence. He tried to find the appropriate word, missed it, and stopped.”10[../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-10] The passage from subcortical to corticalconsciousness was not yet complete, and words, the currency of the cortex, werenot yet easily at hand.Rittelmeyer offers other good evidence that hypnagogia was at least a part ofwhat Steiner envisioned as the next stage in the evolution of consciousness. Asquoted above, Rittelmeyer remarks, “It was as if both states of consciousness,that of sense-perception and of spiritual perception were there for [Steiner]freely and naturally.” This “double consciousness” is precisely what Steiner sawas the characteristic of our coming Jupiter consciousness, which, we remember,is our current waking rational consciousness combined with the pictureconsciousness of Old Moon. Such double consciousness is also what Mavromatissees as an evolutionary potential. “The ability to retain consciousness of one'ssurroundings while dreaming,” he writes, “is a definite evolutional advance oversleep dreaming: it enables a person to retain control over his externalenvironment while investigating his internal terrain. An individual may, then,learn to oscillate in and out of hypnagogia to any desired degree. . . .Learning to balance oneself in hypnagogia lies along evolutionally normal andnatural directions.” Such a development, he concludes, sees hypnagogia not asmerely a regressive state—as hyper-rationalists view any loosening of rationalcontrol—but as a progressive one “in which the various aspects of consciousnessand the bipolarity of rationality-nonrationality are brought to a synergeticrelationship.”11 [../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-11] Again, that Steiner'srecapitulation of previous levels of consciousness is practically identical withthis hardly needs stressing. As we will see, such a “return to advance” is verymuch in line with another theorist on the evolution of consciousness, the Germanphilosopher Jean Gebser, whose ideas on the “structures of consciousness” havemuch in common with Steiner's visions of cosmic evolution.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Mavromatis remarks, “Hypnagogia gives rise to the insight that there are manyrealities and that what we call wakefulness merely constitutes one of them,”12[../Text/part0040.html#c12-FN-12] a sentiment echoing William James's classicpronouncement on the subject. He goes on to suggest that our so-called wakingstate is hardly any less of a dream than the kind we experience during sleep.This, as hardly needs pointing out, is a perception shared by practically allmystical, occult, esoteric, and spiritual traditions. It is only in relativelyrecent times—taking place, perhaps not merely coincidentally, within the periodSteiner calls the fifth post-Atlantean epoch—that our three-dimensional solidwaking world has appropriated sole ownership of the category “reality.” Thisworld of space and time we all know so well is the gauge by which we judge thevalidity of other possible worlds. But if, as Steiner through his cosmic visionand Mavromatis through his neurological research suggest, this all-too-familiarworld of solid objects and passing time is the product of a particular kind ofthought, then it stands to reason that a different thinking may indeed produceor reveal a different kind of world.This indeed does seem to be the case. Mavromatis remarks that dreams andhypnagogic phenomena take place in their own kind of space, not limited by theconstraints of our known three dimensions. Hypnagogia can be shared; it can betelepathic; it can be precognitive; and, if we are right in relating it toRudolf Steiner's reading of the Akashic Record, it can reach back in time. Giventhe archaeology of consciousness presented in the structure and function of thebrain, this last proposition should not seem at all preposterous. If, asMavromatis suggests, the task of the cerebral cortex is to stabilize andobjectify existence in order to present to consciousness a more wieldy andeasily manipulated world—which, we remember, is precisely what Bergsonsuggested—then a consciousness with its roots in other, older parts of the brainmay indeed present a very different kind of world, a world perhaps lessconstrained by our present ideas about space and time, subject and object, orpast and future.However, there does seem to be a kind of “hierarchy of consciousness” implied inthe structure of the brain itself; otherwise, why would evolution take thedangerous step of developing risky self-consciousness at the expense ofinfallible instinct? Yet, as Mavromatis points out, consciousness itself doesnot “reside” in the cortex, and a purely cerebral consciousness would lack thedepth and texture supplied by the old brain. The kind of objective consciousnessexemplified by rigid, impersonal rationalists who deny any meaning or value tothe world is perhaps a good approximation of a purely cortical awareness;perhaps even closer would be the kind of consciousness some scientists claim tohave “generated” in computers. And if the cortex is to be accorded greater valuebecause it is the most recently evolved organ of consciousness, then surely thenext step should be granted even greater preference. Rational-corticalconsciousness, then, would be seen as one stage in an ongoing evolution ofconsciousness—which is precisely how both Steiner and Mavromatis do see it.But if this evolution of consciousness can be seen in the structure of the brainitself, as I believe Mavromatis has shown, then the next question is, Has itleft any other trace? Is there any other evidence for the kind of evolutionSteiner and other thinkers have claimed? Short of discovering Atlantis itself,is there any other sign that something along the lines of what Steiner andMavromatis have suggested has actually taken place? In short: is there a “fossilrecord” of the mind? We approach this question in the next section."},{"pageContent":"PART THREEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE INVISIBLE MINDIn studying the history of consciousness, we are immediately faced with a uniquedifficulty. Unlike paleontology, where the outlines of ancient life-forms areopen to study, in trying to understand what a consciousness prior to our own mayhave been like we run into the fact that there are no “fossil remains” ofprevious consciousnesses available for our inspection. We cannot dig throughstrata of earth and piece together the remnants of early minds, nor collectfragments of ancient consciousness into a likely arrangement. This is so becauseof the simple fact that the mind, consciousness, is not material. It does notoccupy space and, in a very real sense, it is not constrained by the limits ofthe present moment. Consciousness can range through the past or peer into thefuture at a moment's notice, just as it can focus on a galaxy millions of lightyears away as easily as it can observe what is taking place right before itseyes. Yet it is this very freedom from materiality that makes consciousnessdifficult to study.If I want to understand something about the history of the Earth, I can go tothe Museum of Natural History here in London and walk through the physicalremains of past ages. The outline of a sixty-five-million-year-old ammonite, theskeleton of a mastodon, shards of prehistoric pottery, and pieces of Neolithictools are there to speak to me of their time and age. But I do not see anancient consciousness on display behind the glass. There are no minds preservedin formaldehyde nor ideas stuffed and presented in a mock-up “natural setting.”And even if I accept the reigning notion that consciousness is caused by brains,I am still in the same predicament. Brains indeed are material objects, but theyare exceedingly delicate ones, and none remain from ancient times for us tostudy. So we have little way of knowing if the brain of, say, the ancient Greekswas in any significant way different from our own, and if this could havepossibly given them a different consciousness.No, the fact of the matter is that the only consciousness available to us todayis our own. And although many scientists believe that by studying the physical“hardware” of the brain—neurons, chemical transmitters, electricalexchanges—they are studying consciousness, this is not really the case. I canmake a complete physical analysis of a compact disc containing Mozart's pianoconcertos, just as I can do a chemical breakdown of my copy of Tolstoy's War andPeace, but in neither case would I approach the music or the novel. The surfaceof the compact disc and the ink and paper of the book are the means by which themusic and the novel manifest; if I destroy them, I will only have destroyed onemeans of the music's and the novel's manifesting. Neither the music nor thenovel will have been touched, and I can easily purchase other copies. It is eventrue, I believe, that if somehow all copies of Mozart's piano concertos andTolstoy's War and Peace were destroyed, neither the music nor the novel would betouched. Both have their real existence in the consciousness of their creators,and once given to the world they now exist in a shared world of ideas, which isalso immaterial. Something of the same is true, I believe, of all attempts toexplain consciousness by studying its physical correlates. A particular neuralnet may be active when I contemplate a sunset or meditate on the idea offreedom, but that neural net is no more my experience of the sunset or myprofound thoughts about personal liberty than the pixels making up the letterson my computer screen are the words in this document.Consciousness, our entire interior world of thoughts, feelings, dreams, beliefs,hopes, fears, ideas, imagery, and everything else, can neither be weighed normeasured, nor in any way handled in the same way we treat physical objects.Consciousness is not big, small, round, square, hot, cold, heavy, or light.Everything else in the world we encounter and deal with through our senses.Whether or not Rudolf Steiner is right about the evolution of consciousness,most of us do live our waking lives with our awareness focused almostexclusively on the outer world. This is a world of solid, palpable objects thatwe do our best to either manipulate or avoid. We either touch them with ourhands or devise machines to do this for us. We are very good at this, andpractically everything we meet with in our day-to-day lives can be handled inthis way. But not consciousness. We can neither pick it up nor put it down,bring it toward us nor move it out of the way. Of course we say that we “weigh”thoughts or “grasp” an idea, but these are simply metaphors. In fact most, ifnot all, of our ways of speaking about consciousness and the mind aremetaphorical. Thoughts “race.” We speak of a “stream” of consciousness. We saythat someone has a “closed” mind, that someone else has a “bright” idea, andwonder what is going on “inside” yet another person's head. But on closerinspection we realize there is something odd about all of this. No thought hasever “raced.” There is no “stream” of consciousness. One's mind is neither“closed” nor “open.” And no idea, however bright, has ever illuminated a darkroom. The only thing “inside” people's heads is a brain. If we were absolutelyliteral and opened someone's skull, we wouldn't find thoughts or ideas, onlycerebral spinal fluid and gray matter. These are all ways of speaking about avery curious thing, the mind. And what is perhaps most strange about thiscurious thing, is that it is at once the most intimate and the most distantthing about us. What could be “closer” (again, a metaphor) to us than our“self”? And yet, what can we say we know about it?Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]In Living Time, the psychologist Maurice Nicoll, a disciple of P. D. Ouspensky,makes the curious remark that we, our “true selves,” are really invisible. Wecan see people's faces, hear their voices, watch their movements, and feel theirtouch, but we never actually see them. And the same is true of ourselves. I cansee my face in a mirror and hear my voice on a tape recording, but is thatreally me? No, Nicoll says. The “real you” is that stranger who inhabits yourinner world (another metaphor) and who, from time to time, you get a glimpse of(another metaphor) but more often take for granted. We may think that this talkof an “invisible you” is itself a metaphor, but there is at least one experienceof our “invisibility” that we all share. From around our second or third yearuntil our old age and death, we feel this sense of “I” inhabiting thatmetaphorical space behind our eyes. In the passage from that small child to aweary septuagenarian or octogenarian, the physical body goes through an immensenumber of changes, with some very visible results. In fact, we know that thevery cells of our bodies, and the atoms and molecules making up those cells,have changed many times over during our lifetimes, and that in all truth we arenot the same “bodies” we started out as. But there is a curious persistence inour interior selves. They, of course, change too. But who hasn't looked at aweathered middle-aged face in the mirror and thought, “But I still feel as if Iam in my twenties”? And who hasn't raged against the ravages of time, whosetrail we see in every wrinkle and feel in every aching bone and creaking joint,and felt that this scarecrow of old and tired flesh is not the “real you”? That“real you” is not that aging body, trapped in the currents of passing time. Itis something else. What that “something else” is, is consciousness.Now, having said all this, you might wonder how I can contemplate writinganything about the evolution of consciousness if consciousness itself is such anelusive thing. If consciousness has evolved, how can we possibly know? In the1920s the school of psychology known as Behaviorism took the “invisibility” ofconsciousness so seriously that it argued that precisely because no psychologisthad ever “seen” consciousness, it therefore did not exist. For Behaviorists,there was no “interior world,” no “ghost in the machine,” only behavior—which,like everything else science studies, can be observed and measured. And, as Ihave mentioned earlier, Daniel Dennett, one of today's leading philosophers ofconsciousness, has argued along similar lines. So, the very immateriality ofconsciousness has led some very influential thinkers to argue that it issomething that simply doesn't exist.Clearly, this view can't be right. Consciousness exists. You, reading thesewords, are aware of it, just as I am, writing them. As Bergson said,consciousness is something we are aware of so intimately and immediately that itrequires neither proof nor definition. The immateriality of consciousness is notan argument against its existence. It is instead one of itscharacteristics—perhaps its most central one. It argues very persuasively thatwe are beings who inhabit two worlds: one of space and time and matter andmotion, and another of something we used to call “spirit” but today feel morecomfortable calling “psychic” or “mental,” or, in this case, “consciousness.”But having said that consciousness is not material, it doesn't follow that ithas no relation to matter. As we saw in the first part of this book, forphilosophers like Bergson consciousness has “invaded” matter, entered it,“colonized” it for its own purposes. These metaphors may seem too aggressive forcontemporary sensibilities, but they do suggest the sense of struggle andstriving we associate with spirit. Matter is inert. A stone will stay in thesame spot indefinitely unless something or someone moves it. It is essentiallypassive. A stone will not get out of the rain or move out of the path of anapproaching object. Physicists tell us that what appears to be solid,motionless, “dead” matter is really an incalculable number of atoms, vibratingat an inconceivable rate. But this is not what we see and it is not how weinteract with it. The stone is, we say, an inanimate object. Living things, onthe other hand, are animated. They move. Plants grow, animals move about insearch of food. Yet, like the stone, plants and animals are made of matter. Onan atomic or subatomic level they are perhaps ultimately not very different, buton the level of molecules and larger bodies such as cells, they are. Plants,animals, and people are matter with something else. For esotericists like RudolfSteiner, that something else is what is known as an “etheric body.” Forphilosophers like Bergson and Nietzsche, that something else is “life,”“spirit,” the “life force.” Consciousness is not material, but in some strangeway, it can enter matter and organize it for its own purposes.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]What has all of this to do with studying the evolution of consciousness? Well,one way of doing this is the approach that Bergson took: studying “evolution”itself. Consciousness or the élan vital—in Bergson the two are the same—entersmatter at an early stage, as early as three and a half billion years ago, andbuilds it up into finer and more complex bodies: into “organisms,” which are“organized” life-forms. It is only living matter that we say is “organized”; weeven speak of the “organs” of the body. A stone is not “organized”; it is, inAlfred North Whitehead's term, an “aggregate.” The difference between the two isthat if we take a large stone and break it in two we then have two smallerstones. But if we take a living thing—a plant or a person—and do the same, we donot have two smaller organisms. We have disrupted the organism; we have“dis-organized” it and, in doing so, have killed it.1[../Text/part0040.html#c13-FN-1] The stone, on the other hand, is not “hurt.” Wemerely have smaller lumps of the same thing.By studying the forms of organized matter, the variety of living things in theevolutionary “stream,” Bergson and other thinkers, like Teilhard de Chardin,chart, as it were, the movement of consciousness through matter. They show howconsciousness has adapted matter to its ends, where it has been successful,where it has failed, and hence, they provide a kind of “map” of the “flow ofconsciousness.” But if, as thinkers like Ouspensky suggest, with human beingsthe Great Laboratory (another metaphor for the “life force”) has been verysuccessful in organizing matter, then the character of the “flow” changes. If,as these thinkers claim, in human beings (or at least in some of them) the GreatLaboratory has succeeded in creating an organism that can continue to developthrough its own efforts, then it is no longer the direct control of matter thatis the aim. Consciousness now begins to push its first sprouts through the darkloam of the “unconscious.” For, even though I have been using the term“consciousness” throughout as the name of the agency behind evolution, we arenot to assume that early life-forms like trilobites or contemporary ones likesunflowers are conscious in the way that we are. Slowly, and with many setbacks, that indefinable yet unmistakable condition we call “self-consciousness”begins to emerge in human beings. And at this point, the evolution ofconsciousness takes a turn. Now it is focused no longer on the directpenetration and control of matter, but on the growth and development of theinterior world of these new self-evolving creatures. And it is through them thata new relationship with matter develops. These agents of the life force nowbegin to interact with it in a new way, through what they will later call art,science, and religion—in a word, culture. Now it does become possible that astone cut in half is not merely two smaller stones. If that stone has felt thehand of a sculptor, fashioning it into a tool or into an effigy of a deity, itbecomes “organized.” A broken hand axe is not merely two smaller stones, just asa toppled statue is not merely rubble. The hand axe and the statue are matterimbued with spirit—no longer as a force or energy entering matter, as is thecase with living things, but as the imprint of human imagination. It is the mindpressing itself upon the material world. And it is through these “mindprints,”that we can trace the further evolution of consciousness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]CRACKING THE EGGExactly when the mind began to leave its trace on the physical world is unknown.When did that spark of spirit ignite the latent powers of imagination in theearliest human beings? When did we take those first fledgling steps out ofinstinct and unconsciousness that would lead to the Buddha, Beethoven, andlanding on the Moon? When did we first begin to climb out of the millennia ofkinship with our animal ancestors and regard the world illuminated by the dawnlight of self-consciousness? When, in other words, did we first become human? Noone knows. And it is quite possible that no one will ever know with anycertainty. The search for some exact date when self-consciousness first appearedseems futile; the problem of what would count as evidence is alone enough to putoff even the most dedicated researcher. It is nevertheless the single mostimportant development in human history, and it is unlikely that it has left notrace. The roots of consciousness reach deep into the rich soil of thepreconscious, and when we look this far back into human history and prehistorywe invariably enter the realms of myth. As Erich Neumann and Marie-Louise vonFranz have shown, practically all creation myths—stories explaining “thecreation of the world”—can be read as accounts of the rise of consciousness outof the primal depths of the unconscious.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c14-FN-1] Togive only one example, in the Judeo-Christian tradition one of the “names ofGod” is “I AM THAT I AM,” the basic statement of self-awareness. And the firstact of creation was the appearance of light, where before there was onlydarkness, chaos, “formless and void,” an apt description of a state ofunconsciousness or preconsciousness.But it is not only as a manner of speaking that we can look at the emergence ofconsciousness as the emergence of a world. Up until around the age of two,children do not distinguish any break between themselves and the outside world.Until that point, there is in truth no “world” for them, in the sense of some“thing” other than themselves set against their awareness. They exist in a kindof seamless unity with the world beyond their bodies, what Neumann has calledthe “uroboric” condition, taking the term from the alchemical symbol of thesnake with its tail in its mouth, an archetypal emblem of totality. At thisstage the psyche and what will become “the world” exist in a kind of blissfulbut unconscious unity. One has only to observe a baby at its mother's breast tounderstand what Neumann means. Neumann—and, as we will see, other thinkers, likeJean Gebser—believe that early human beings existed in a similar condition withthe Earth, and it is still a debatable question just how much of a “world” inthe way that we experience it exists for animals. There is good reason tobelieve that animals are “in” the world in a way that we are not—in any case,there seems little evidence that animals ever feel the kind of existentialterror we sometimes feel at the recognition of a strange, alien otherness setagainst our own existence, nor the awe we feel at a night sky or magnificentsunset. Myths like the exile from the Garden of Eden do not depict thepunishment of a vindictive God meted out to disobedient creatures. Rather theyshow the painful rupture of this unconscious bliss by the rise of consciousness.The shame Adam and Eve feel at their nakedness is the awareness that they are nolonger merely unconscious natural creatures, but have crossed over the thresholdinto consciousness. Suddenly the warm buoyant unity of the primal garden isshattered, and they find themselves separate beings, facing a strange world. Forbetter or worse, they are no longer merely animals.In Neumann's view, shared by other psychologists like Melanie Klein and D. W.Winnicott, the expulsion from the garden is not only some primal historicalevent, nor merely an archetype embedded in the human psyche. It is a traumaexperienced by every human being who hatches from the uroboric egg of infancy.As Neumann writes, “Detachment from the ouroboros, entry into the world, and theencounter with the universal principle of opposites are the essential tasks ofhuman and individual developments.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c14-FN-2] These“tasks” form the challenges of the hero's “journey,” and they are not merely thenarrative material for ancient myths. Each of us, insofar as we becomeindividuals—following the path of what Jung called “individuation”—must facethese challenges. They may seem of small consequence today, as most of us havelittle memory of a time when “we” did not exist. But as Neumann writes, “Triteas it seems to us, the logical statement of identity—‘I am I'—the fundamentalstatement of consciousness, is in reality a tremendous achievement.”3[../Text/part0040.html#c14-FN-3] (Having seen this awakening take place in myown sons at around the age of two, I can attest to its profound significance.)And on a broader scale the tasks must be faced by humanity as a whole, and whatis generally known as the “rise of civilization” is our collective coming tomaturity. How much and in what way we have been successful, or at what stage ofarrested development we may be stuck, are questions each of us must addressindividually.Neumann also echoes an idea that we have already encountered in Rudolf Steinerand in a different way in the work of Andreas Mavromatis, and that we will againfind in the philosophy of Jean Gebser. The rise out of uroboric unity is not asimple jettisoning of a childlike “oneness” with nature. As Neumann writes,“Man's task in the world is to remember with his conscious mind what wasknowledge before the advent of consciousness.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c14-FN-4]This has echoes of Plato's notion of knowledge as memory; it is also reminiscentof Steiner's vision of a future consciousness that is a recapitulation of ourancient Moon consciousness yet with full rational awareness, as it is arestatement of Mavromatis's conception of hypnagogia as a “descent” into the oldbrain while maintaining the wakefulness of the new. This psychic balancing actlooks easy in print, but it is extremely difficult in practice and gives rise towhat I call the “Goldilocks syndrome,” a situation in which the individual orcollective mind teeters between an excessive rationality on one hand, and aplunge back into the unconscious on the other, only rarely hitting on the middleground where it is “just right.” (In Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties andthe Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius, I examine one such oscillation: the“occult revival” of the 1960s.)The available evidence suggests that the appearance of self-consciousness is arelatively recent event. Given this, the balance seems heavily weighted on theside of the unconscious. We may find it difficult to grasp that for millenniaour ancestors lived in a state similar to what we enjoy as infants. Yet asNeumann and other thinkers suggest, the pull toward the unconscious is strong,and there is no final, decisive entry into full consciousness—or, at least,there is none at our present stage of development. To achieve consciousness is astruggle, and to maintain it is a burden. Many of us are prone to throw off itsload and return to the less demanding conditions of the unconscious—hence thewidespread drug and alcohol abuse too common to our time, as well as other, moredangerous manias involving sex and violence. Again, this shouldn't bemisunderstood as arguing for consciousness and against the unconscious. Relaxingwith a glass of wine or losing ourselves in a book or film are also ways ofloosening consciousness and opening up to deeper parts of ourselves. Thequestion is one of balance. To avoid life's realities by sinking into drug abuseis not the same as the pleasant shift in awareness the judicious use of alcoholengenders, nor is a rigid, absolutely “rational” way of life the same as takingresponsibility for one's actions and decisions. In life, as in the fairy tale,getting it just right is not always easy. And the fact that self-consciousnessis relatively new makes it even harder.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Just how recently self-consciousness appeared is, as we have seen, a difficultquestion to answer. Anatomically “modern” human beings first appeared in Africaat least 100,000 years ago, but somehow we find it difficult to conceive thatthese early ancestors had a consciousness like our own; theorists like Neumannand Jean Gebser argue that their mental world was probably much more like ananimal's, still close to nature in the uroboric embrace. According to thestandard account, Homo sapiens sapiens—“behaviorally” modern human beings, i.e.,ourselves—emerged 60,000 years later, around 40,000 years ago, in what has beencalled a “cultural big bang.” During this late stage in the Upper Paleolithic(Old Stone Age), the first shoots of art, religion, magic, technology, andsocial organization are said to have appeared, and these are the boundariesbetween creatures like ourselves, and our earlier ancestors. But even here ourinterior world and theirs must have been very different. Early Homo sapienssapiens looked like us, and, in many ways, acted as we do. But whether theythought as we do is another matter.Although it is difficult, if not impossible, to pinpoint exactly whenself-consciousness appeared, one sign of it would certainly have to be thebeginning of a written or symbolic record, what we have come to call “history.”As Erich Neumann writes, “So long as an apperceptive ego consciousness islacking, there can be no history; for history requires a ‘reflecting’consciousness, which by reflecting, constitutes it. Hence the time beforehistory must be indeterminate chaos and nondifferentiation.”5[../Text/part0040.html#c14-FN-5] Which seems to be saying that the “I” and“history” should appear at the same time—or perhaps the “I” first, with historyby definition following shortly after. Which is to say that before the “I” therecan be no history, and there can be no history without some reflection of that“I.”In fact, if one thinks about it, it is difficult to avoid the idea that the “I”is that reflection: a “self” is its own reflection, or at least it is difficultto see how there could be a self without that reflection. As A. R. Orage argued,self-consciousness is like photographic paper turned in on itself. It isdifficult to see how a “self” could have awareness of itself without somethingreflecting that self back. Having a “self,” being a “self”—“selfing,” if I amallowed to coin a word—seems to be a kind of “duo” or “double” consciousness,and we are reminded of the “double consciousness” in relation to hypnagogiadiscussed in the last section. For some metaphysicians, God's “reflection” isthe world. In human beings, that something, that reflection, is “history.”But if history is a clue to the appearance of self-consciousness, when did itbegin? It is commonly accepted that history as we know it began with the “birthof civilization” in the Fertile Crescent some 5,000 years ago. Traditionally,the date and place for the start of civilization and hence history is around3100 B.C. in Egypt, the event being the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt andthe beginning of the dynastic period. The famous Palette of Narmer, whichdepicts the first king of the First Dynasty subjugating a victim by a blow tothe head with his mace of authority, symbolizes the event. As one scholarremarks, this image has been reproduced in countless books on the “origin” ofcivilization, and has been called “the first page of the first chapter of thewritten history of Egypt.” Any standard textbook on the history of civilizationwill agree. And yet, such a view partitions into two hugely unequal portions thetime that the human species in some form—from our earliest ancestors toourselves—has existed on the planet. The earliest known stone tools found inAfrica date back to 2.4 million years ago and are believed to have been made byHomo habilis, the earliest known member of our own genus. The time between thisancestor fashioning its paleolithic implements and King Narmer bringing his macedown on his pitiful subject, and hence starting civilization (although the factthat it started off with such a “bang” raises doubts about how civilized itactually was), amounts to about ninety-five percent of the time somethingremotely “human” walked the Earth. Civilization, from Narmer on, amounts toabout five percent. If we associate self-consciousness with the start of historyand the rise of civilization, then it is easy to see how recent an arrival itis. For the overwhelming majority of “our” time on the planet,self-consciousness, at least as we know it, did not exist. Small wonder that thefledgling ego has a hard time of it resisting the pull back into its darker,less demanding past.Some scholars however have questioned this division, as well as what they see asthe unequal value and attention the two parts have received. If the historicalperiod comprises only five percent of our time on the planet, it has made up forthis by drawing at least ninety-five percent of the attention and praise.“Prehistoric” has come to mean a variety of negatives; when we picture completedestruction, we speak of being bombed “back into the Stone Age.” Civilization onthe other hand, its few discontents excluded, is the epitome of the desirable,and essentially means “progress,” in the sense of technologicaladvance—although, this, of course, is as limited and narrow a definition as theone given for “prehistoric.” Not all archaeologists are satisfied with thisdichotomy, nor with the definition of civilization on which it is based, but formany years the possibility of an ancient, “lost” civilization predating our ownwas as inadmissible as the idea that we may not have descended from apes.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Such an idea, of course, is a standard theme in much esoteric thought. We haveseen it already in our discussion of Madame Blavatsky and Rudolf Steiner. In theearly 1960s, it gained a wide popularity through Pauwels and Bergier's book TheMorning of the Magicians (1963). This argued, along with a dozen other eccentrictheses, that there was evidence of a “prehistoric,” technologically advancedcivilization thousands of years before our own, whose source seemed to point toouter space. By the late 1960s this idea fuelled the best-selling but highlydubious work of Erich von Daniken and his imitators, and enjoyed a widereadership among the counterculture through the work of John Michell. A Platonicphilosopher, mathematician, and student of sacred geometry, Michell argued inbooks like The View Over Atlantis (1969) that places like Stonehenge,Glastonbury, the Sphinx, and other sacred sites were linked through a network of“ley lines.” These were lines of magnetic or “spiritual” force crisscrossing theplanet, whose existence was known to the ancients. Thousands of years before therise of Western civilization, Michell's ancients understood the Earth's hiddenforces and built a civilization around them, based on astronomy, sacredgeometry, and harmony with nature. A similar idea has informed a spate of morerecent, highly successful books arguing that civilization is much older than theofficial account; the work of Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval, for example, whosuggest that the Sphinx may have been built as early as 10,500 B.C., has beenespecially influential.For the hippies in the early 1970s who read John Michell's books and flocked toplaces like Glastonbury, his ley lines were a portent of a New Age; for somecritics, they were the standard utopian dream, the Golden Age served up withtie-dyed trousers and patchouli oil. In more recent years, however, the ideathat “civilization as we know it” is not the sole claimant on that title hasreceived strong support from researchers whose theories cannot simply berejected as pipe dreams. Increasingly, there is reason to believe that theperiod we call “prehistoric” was not one long doldrum until the rise ofcivilization."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE LOST WORLDIn the 1980s the late Marija Gimbutas became a controversial figure in the worldof archaeology, and later in culture at large, for her belief that a matriarchalStone Age civilization based on a worship of a Great Goddess predated theso-called origin of civilization in Egypt, and existed in Europe between 7000and 3500 B.C. Peaceful, nonhierarchical, and living in harmony with nature, thecivilization of “Old Europe” was centered, she claimed, on socialresponsibility, artistic creation, aesthetic achievement, nonmaterial values,and a respect for the generative powers of the female, leading to anecologically sound society fostering equality between the sexes. Flourishingduring long periods of stability, the various farming communities making up OldEurope erected temples, developed skills in ceramics and metallurgy, lived inspacious houses, and even had a kind of sacred script. Artisans produced aremarkable number of goods, and early trade routes enabled a wide exchange inshells, marble, copper, obsidian, and other materials. Çatal Hüyük, in thesouthern part of central Anatolia (Turkey), is the showcase site for Gimbutas'stheory, a remarkable prehistoric “town” founded some 8,000 years ago, estimatedto have supported a population of 7,000 people. Wall paintings, sculptures, andstatuettes support the theory that the inhabitants of Çatal Hüyük worshipped aGreat Goddess, and there is good reason to believe that the important ritualsassociated with her were performed by women, with men taking part in secondaryroles. Men in general seem to have occupied a subordinate position in thesociety of Çatal Hüyük; male images have been found in the iconography of thesite, but they are usually subsumed by the more dominant figure of the feminine.Similar temples and sites also devoted to the Goddess and worship of thefeminine have been found in Malta, Slovakia, Serbia, Moldavia, and the BritishIsles. All attest to Gimbutas's view that a wide spread Goddess-oriented“civilization” existed in Europe some three thousand years prior to theunification of Egypt.But according to Gimbutas, this holistic Golden Age of high aestheticachievement and sexual equality came to an end between 4300 and 2800 B.C. Duringthis period, the peaceful, feminine-centered civilization of Old Europe sufferedincursions from a Proto–Indo-European culture that would eventually overrun anddominate it. Originating on the steppes of Russia, the Neolithic Kurgan cultureespoused values that were the complete opposite of Goddess worship. Horse-ridingwarriors, the Kurgans shattered the stability of Old Europe with devastatingweaponry, and a male-centered, patriarchal religion based on the worship of asky god. The Kurgan warriors toppled the worship of the Goddess, reducing herand her fellow female deities to secondary positions as wives of the new malepantheon. Sexual inequality, aggression, and linear and dualistic thinking—all,needless to say, elements of our own culture—leveled the older culture, whicheventually died out, its stable, holistic way of life based on the cycles ofnature shrinking to mere folklore and superstition.Although it was popularized by writers like Riane Eisler ( The Chalice and theBlade, 1987), Gimbutas's vision of an ecologically, politically, and sexually“correct” prehistoric civilization crushed by androcratic male warriors whosevalues went on to shape the Western world increasingly marginalized her amongher archaeological peers. Perhaps inevitably, it was seen as more of a blueprintfor a feminist utopia than an actual reconstruction of a past culture. This isunfortunate. Although Eisler, perhaps understandably, presents a simplifiedpicture of what she sees as the need to regain the values of a “partnership”culture lost to our “dominator” one, Gimbutas's work in uncovering this lostpast is exemplary and adds an essential dimension to our self-understanding.1[../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-1] The fact that she was not alone, that otherthinkers have argued persuasively for the existence of a Goddess-orientedprehistoric civilization, adds weight to what too often seems in the work ofsome of its advocates an exercise in wishful thinking.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]In a series of brilliant books written in the 1970s and 1980s, the psychologistStan Gooch argued that prior to the appearance of our direct ancestor,Cro-Magnon man, Neanderthal man (Homo sapiens neanderthalensis) lived in what wewould have to call a kind of “civilization.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-2]Neanderthal man, who appeared about 100,000 years ago, has come to stand for anassortment of negatives: brutishness, stupidity, a general animal-likeexistence. In fact, Neanderthals had a larger brain than ours, their skullsshowing a 1400-cubic-centimeter capacity, compared to our own average of 1300.This, Gooch argues, is mainly due to the larger size of the Neanderthals'cerebellum, a subcortical structure that in his view served as a kind of earlycerebral cortex, but one that provided Neanderthals with a significantlydifferent consciousness than our own—a point we will return to shortly.The Neanderthals had stone and bone tools, and showed an interest inornamentation, but what is truly remarkable about these ancestors is that theyhad a profound religious and ritualistic sense. At a Neanderthal site at LaQuina in the Dordogne, seventy-six absolutely perfect spheres were found, aswell as a carefully shaped flat flint disk some twenty centimeters in diameter.There seemed no apparent utilitarian use for these objects, which, however,could indicate some form of Sun or, more to the point in Gooch's view, Moonworship. There is evidence that the elderly in Neanderthal groups were caredfor, indicating some sense of respect and veneration, and the dead were rituallyburied, usually decorated with flowers and often with food and other offerings,suggesting a belief in some form of afterlife. But what is most striking aboutNeanderthal culture is that their dead were often painted, sometimes covered, inred ochre, a name given to the iron ore hematite, a source of red pigment. Redochre mines discovered in southern Africa dating back to 100,000 years ago givesome idea of the importance this mineral had for the Neanderthals. It isestimated that a million kilograms of the ore had been mined from one of theoldest sites. Ochre is not a food and it was not used as a material inconstruction. Mining a million kilograms suggests a cooperative effort involvingmany generations. As the ore was used solely for religious and ritualisticpurposes, this argues that they were powerful motivating forces in Neanderthallife. Gooch believes the ochre had such a powerful attraction because of itsresemblance to blood—menstruation cycles were an important part of Neanderthal“religion,” he argues. Yet strangely, although they possessed red ochre as wellas black manganese dioxide, another source of pigment, which they formed into“crayons,” there has so far been no report of Neanderthal cave art. They do notseem to have been “self-symbolic.”Gooch believes that the Neanderthals' large cerebellum made them what we wouldcall “psychic,” and that this made them sensitive to hidden forces as well as tonatural phenomena like magnetic fields, useful for dowsing—an idea that seems tosupport John Michell's ancients and their understanding of ley lines. Goochbelieves, like most orthodox paleoanthropologists, that the Neanderthals wereexterminated by our direct ancestors, the Cro-Magnons about 25,000 years ago.But, disagreeing with the standard account, Gooch also believes that Cro-Magnonmales mated with Neanderthal females, and that their issue was—ourselves. Inthis view we are a “dual” being, bringing together in an often uncomfortableunion two diametrically opposed mentalities and consciousnesses (once again aninstance of “double consciousness”). Where Neanderthals were intuitive,“socialist,” nature-oriented, and devotees of the Goddess and the Moon, CroMagnons—like the Kurgan warriors who devastated Old Europe—were logical,hierarchical, male-oriented, and believers in a solar sky god. One centraldifference between Neanderthals and Cro Magnons was that the former were what wetoday might call sex addicts: according to Gooch, the Neanderthals had an almostinsatiable lust, and it was this, perhaps more than any other reason, thatenabled their women to gain dominance. Cro-Magnons, apparently, were altogethermore continent creatures.Classic Neanderthals were short, hairy, barrel-bodied, and nocturnal, withlarge, perhaps bulging eyes (physical characteristics, Gooch suggests, resultingfrom a successful adaptation to Ice Age conditions); Cro-Magnons were tall,slender, relatively hairless like ourselves, and diurnal. They were also highlyefficient killers. In what must have been one of the most ruthless and sustainedacts of genocide in human history or prehistory, Cro-Magnons wiped out what theymust have considered an ugly subhuman animal. Yet, argues Gooch, the Neanderthallives on, contained within our skulls. Like Andreas Mavromatis, Gooch sees thesubcortical cerebellum, our inheritance from Neanderthals, as the source of our“other self,” the unconscious, the “ancient adversary” with which our rational,cortical consciousness is in perpetual conflict. Yet again like Mavromatis,Gooch sees the rare moments of reconciliation as the precursor of a new kind ofconsciousness, the brief glory of “just right,” when the Goldilocks of awarenesshits on the successful proportions of “old” brain and “new.”But our “dual consciousness” is not the sole blessing (or curse, depending onhow you look at it) that our Neanderthal ancestors bestowed on us. Theirsubcortical consciousness gave them a profoundly different view of the world—aswe would expect, remembering what we know of hypnagogia—and, if Gooch is right,it is possible that with the Neanderthals we have some evidence of a kind of“Old Moon” culture, although, to be sure, the points of similarity do not tallywith Steiner's vision exactly.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-3] Neanderthals,Gooch argues, were Moon worshippers, and their “Moon culture” was so extensiveand widespread that he is prompted to speak of a “Neanderthal empire,” radiatingout from central France, and reaching Africa, Siberia, and Turkey.4[../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-4]Yet before we start thinking of some Golden Age of pre-Eden harmony, Gooch tellsus that this “empire” included some practices we today would find highlydubious: orgiastic group sex, for one (which may not strike many of us as toobad),5 [../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-5] but also other, less titillatingpastimes such as human sacrifice, ritual cannibalism, and drinking blood. Racialmemories of devotions such as these have lodged in our consciousness; theyappear as an assortment of dark figures—vampires, bogeymen, goblins, and theyeti, as well as classical figures like satyrs, centaurs, and the Minotaur.Esoteric wisdom as found in the teachings of the Kabbalah, and other “occult”systems such as Rosicrucianism are, Gooch argues, unavoidably garbled echoes ofthe original Moon knowledge. He also makes a persuasive argument that aconsiderable number of common superstitions—unlucky thirteen, lucky seven,touching wood—as well as holy days such as Christmas and Easter, are all highlycorrupted (from the ancient point of view) remnants of the universal Moonreligion once practiced by our Neanderthal ancestors.Here I have given only a bare fraction of the massive evidence Gooch presents tosupport his theory. His vision of a Neanderthal “Moon Empire” may not entirelyconvince, but if we are left questioning in some instances, others are strikingin their implications. One such is the widespread and apparently inexplicablereverence shown to a rather faint and certainly unspectacular constellationknown as the Pleiades or Seven Sisters. In a fascinating chapter of Cities ofDreams, Gooch sets forth the evidence that this undistinguished group, made upof fourth-magnitude stars—not particularly brilliant—was not only known to ourancient ancestors, but appears in the mythology of many disparate peoples, andin exactly or nearly exactly the same context. For example, for the ancientGreeks, the story went like this: Orion the hunter came upon six sisters andtheir mother one day in a wood. Burning with lust, he chased the sisters throughthe wood for five years, whereupon Zeus took pity on the girls and changed boththem and Orion into stars, hence the constellations of Orion and the SevenSisters. Strangely, a very similar myth exists among the Aborigines ofAustralia. Wurrunna the hunter was out in search of game, when he too came upona group of seven girls. He grabbed two of them and took them as wives on thespot. However, the trees in the forest took pity on the girls and suddenly grewto a tremendous height; the five free sisters climbed to the sky, as did theother two, thus escaping Wurrunna. The same story, Gooch tells us, appears indifferent forms in other mythologies as well. The Pleiades are always known asthe Seven Sisters, and they are always hunted. Likewise, they always escape,either through magical means or through the intervention of a god. Now, there isnothing whatsoever in the bare appearance of the Pleiades that should suggestthey are women, and certainly nothing to tell us they are hunted. Yet this isthe story time and again. The Pleiades also have the unchallenged distinction ofbeing the only constellation noted and named by every culture on the planet,past or present. Why should a faint group of stars that, as Gooch remarks, wouldnot be recognized by the average person have such importance?Gooch proposes that the Pleiades gained their unique importance in worldmythology because some 30,000 years ago, just at the time when our Cro-Magnonancestors were wiping them out, Neanderthals were tracking the rise of the SevenSisters as the harbinger of spring.6 [../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-6] TheMoon-worshipping Neanderthals would have been very knowledgeable of the heavenlymotions, and, as worshippers as well of the Goddess and her procreativepowers—which, for Gooch, were all an aspect of the Moon—they would have beenespecially keen on noting the arrival of the vernal equinox. Gradually, due tothe precession of the equinoxes, the coincidence of the rising of the Pleiadesand the arrival of spring faded, and in any case, as Gooch points out, theCro-Magnons, who inherited the Neanderthals' “wisdom,” would have had otherthings to deal with, like the new Ice Age. So the astronomical knowledge of theNeanderthals would sink into myth—where we find it today.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Whether or not this indeed points to a “Neanderthal empire,” Gooch does receivesupport from other scholars. In his fascinating book Lost Civilizations of theStone Age (1998), the Oxford prehistorian Richard Rudgley echoes Gooch about theodd status of the Pleiades, along with discussing other remarkable “anomalous”findings. Like many prehistorians, Rudgley was troubled by the apparentabruptness with which “civilization” was supposed to have begun. He wasdissatisfied with the standard story of Narmer's mace starting off everythingwith a bang in Egypt, as well as with the most popular, though not academicallyaccepted, alternatives: Atlantis or the “ancient astronaut” accounts. Rudgleyasked a simple question: Why couldn't the roots of civilization be found in theperiod we call prehistoric?He found that they could and his book is a persuasive collection of evidenceshowing that students of the history of civilization may soon have to rewritetheir textbooks. Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age amasses a remarkable amountof material arguing for the high culture and civilization of people we usuallyconsider our unquestioned inferiors. Rudgley cites the evidence for aPaleolithic (Old Stone Age) language reaching back 15,000 years, far earlierthan Sanskrit or the Proto–Indo-European language dating to between 4000 and6000 B.C., commonly considered one of the “ur” languages from which our moderntongues have evolved. Indeed, similarities between the languages of suchdifferent areas as southern Africa, the Amazon rain forest, and Europe point tothe possibility of an even older Mother tongue called Proto-Global, believed bysome prehistorians to have emerged around the same time as the firstbehaviorally modern human beings, 40,000 years ago. It is argued that the riseof this world-tongue, from which, its advocates claim, all the planet's diverselanguages group emerged (numbering between 5,000 and 10,000, depending on yourcriteria), may have been responsible for the “sapiens explosion” that eventuallyled to us.Rudgley also brings together the evidence for Stone Age mathematics, medicine(including trepanation), surgery, dentistry, writing, pyrotechnology, even akind of Upper Paleolithic pornography. Some of his most fascinating accounts areof the use of psychotropic substances among the inhabitants of Old Europe. Opiumwas domesticated by farmers in the western Mediterranean area by around 6000B.C., and the use of cannabis can also be traced back to the Neolithic period.There is even evidence that it was used by the Kurgan people who were alleged tohave overrun the farmers of Old Europe; a burial site in Romania dating from thethird millennium B.C. and belonging to the Kurgans was found to contain a ritualbrazier in which the remains of charred cannabis was discovered.The taste for altered states of consciousness seems to have a long history. InThe Long Trip: A Prehistory of Psychedelia (1997), Paul Devereux suggests thatthe curious forms found in Neolithic cave art at sites like the island ofGavrinis off the coast of Brittany may be the result of our Stone Age ancestors'use of psychedelic substances. One curious thing about this site and others likeit is that the forms—swirling, curvilinear lines, resembling nothing so much asgiant fingerprints—are very much like the kinds of patterns associated with whatare known as “entopic forms,” the swirls and curls of light produced by rubbingone's eyes. They are also often seen at the point of sleep and are, as we mightexpect, associated with some types of hypnagogic experience. As I recountedearlier, the philosopher Jurij Moskvitin came upon his discovery of what hecalled “selective forms” by focusing on the strange patterns he detected on thesurface of his retina. He associated these patterns with religious and mysticalart, and suspected that his experience was probably a very old one, known tohuman beings for ages. The patterns on Gavrinis suggest this is the case and arealso perhaps more evidence that early human beings had a consciousness similarto what we experience during hypnagogic states.7[../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-7]Some of the most remarkable material in Rudgley's book deals with Stone Agescience, specifically what we would call astronomy. It has been known for sometime that megalithic sites like Stonehenge, Callanish in Scotland, and otherswere erected as Neolithic observatories. Since the 1960s, the work of theaeronautical engineer Alexander Thom, the astronomer Gerald Hawkins, theprehistorian Alexander Marshack, and those who followed them has maderespectable the notion that our so-called prehistoric ancestors hadmathematical, engineering, and astronomical capabilities equal to, and in someinstances exceeding, our own. Marshack, for example, was fascinated by a seriesof markings he recognized on some pieces of bone dating from the UpperPaleolithic. After examining them under a microscope, he realized that at leastone group of markings formed a kind of calendar, charting the phases of theMoon. During a visit to Callanish, Thom realized that the main north-south axisof the stones was aimed directly at the Pole Star. He also knew that at the timethe stones were erected, the Pole Star was not in its present position, whichmeant that to align the stones to geographic north without the Pole Star as aguide would have been an extremely complicated business, requiring a highlysophisticated engineering ability—not the sort of thing usually granted the“primitive cavemen” who were supposedly responsible for the site. Gerald Hawkinstook the measurements and alignments of Stonehenge and ran them through hiscomputer. The result confirmed the idea advanced earlier in the twentiethcentury by the astronomer Sir Norman Lockyer that Stonehenge was a kind ofastronomical clock. The conclusion from all of this evidence was that theprehistoric people who had built these sites were not ignorant, brutish savages,but possessed talents and skills we can only call civilized.This astronomical talent seems to have appeared at a very early stage. Theconstruction of Stonehenge began around 3100 B.C., about five centuries beforethe pyramids—at least according to the standard account. But Marshack's bonedepicting the phases of the Moon was 35,000 years old. The Moon is undoubtedlythe largest object in the night sky that we can view with the naked eye, and itdoes go through a series of easily recognizable changes, so it is not toodifficult to imagine Neanderthals or Cro-Magnons making a rough calendar of itsphases. But a faint group of stars is another matter. Rudgley does not mentionStan Gooch or his theories, but he does point to the same remarkable role thePleiades had for our ancestors. Discussing the work of the Russian prehistorianBoris Frolov, Rudgely echoes Gooch by remarking on the curious fact that thisunspectacular star group is known as the Seven Sisters to native people in areasas far apart as North America, Australia, and Siberia. Frolov and Rudgley bothdiscount the possibility of this being mere coincidence—and by their remarks oneassumes they also dismiss, as Gooch does, the idea that some form of Jungian“archetype” or expression of the “collective unconscious” can account for it.But if this is not a coincidence, the alternative is startling. Without going sofar as to propose a “Neanderthal empire,” Rudgley remarks that the only otherpossibility is some common heritage between these widespread groups. If that isthe case, then it must reach back before the time the New World was firstoccupied, around 12,000 years ago—and even farther still, to before the peoplingof Australia, which most authorities date at about 40,000 years ago. So, Rudgleysuggests, both the observation of the Pleiades and their christening as theSeven Sisters must have taken place as early as 40,000 years ago. As he drylyremarks “This is something which is extremely awkward for most widely acceptedviews of the history and knowledge of science.”8[../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-8]Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Understandably, the idea that Neanderthals were not only observing the Pleiadesbut christening them as the Seven Sisters some 40,000 years ago, and that thisinformed a common heritage later shared by people as diverse as North AmericanIndians and Australian Aborigines, is difficult for the standard view ofpaleoanthropology to accept. But this is not the only oddity about our past thatthe accepted view of prehistory has had to contend with.According to that account, around three and a half million years ago an apelikecreature called Australopithecus afarensis took the evolutionary step that wouldeventually lead to us. The famous “Lucy” and “first family” discovered inEthiopia by the anthropologists Donald Johanson and Tom Gray in 1974, and datingback to 3.5 million years ago, are of this type. Then, after another millionyears, Australopithecus africanus appeared, the hominid ancestor discovered byRaymond Dart in the 1920s. Sometime around 2.2 million years ago, Homo habilis,“tool-making man,” arrived, the earliest-known member of our genus. After himcame Homo erectus, who lived from 1.6 to .5 million years ago and was the firstto move out of Africa, spreading to the temperate zones of Asia and Europe. Andaround 500,000 years ago the earliest populations of Homo sapiens made theirfirst appearance on the planet. Four hundred thousand years later—100,000B.C.—Neanderthal man was active in Europe and western Asia, and by 40,000 yearsago Homo sapiens sapiens, the eventual inheritors of the Earth, first arrived.Now, at around 500,000 years ago something happened that, in terms of standardDarwinian evolutionary theory, shouldn't have. Suddenly, the human brain grew atsuch an accelerated rate that many scientists speak of a “brain explosion.” Homoerectus had a brain capacity of 600 to 800 cubic centimeters; present-day humanbrains average around 1300 cc. In a mere 500,000 years the brain expanded toalmost twice its size. Prior to this the brain had stayed between 600 to 800 ccfor something like two million years. This is certainly ample time for themechanisms of Darwinian selection to have made some changes, yet the period ischaracterized by an evolutionary standstill. Many anatomical features remainedthe same. There was some slight improvement in tools, but nothing more. Onewriter even speaks of the time as characterized by “an almost inconceivablestagnation and conservatism.” But then came what we can call a cerebral “bigbang,” because most of the brain's rapid growth circa 500,000 B.C. had to dowith the cerebrum, the layer of neural tissue sitting atop the “old” subcorticalstructures. From Homo erectus developing the stone tool technology known asAcheulian we get, in something like an evolutionary blink of an eye, Plato,Shakespeare, Beethoven, and Einstein. Science, as the cliché goes, cannotaccount for this.Another evolutionary anomaly ignored by most orthodox paleoanthropologists isthe unaccountable presence of what seem to be fossils of anatomically “modern”human beings in time periods when they are not supposed to have existed—ratherlike discovering a laptop computer amidst a heap of Homo habilis remains. In acontroversial book published in 1993, Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompsonpresented a kind of archaeological “book of the damned.” Forbidden Archaeologyis a nine-hundred-page study of the science of palaeoanthropology, from itsinception to the present, focusing on the odd bits and pieces of evidence thatdo not fit into the standard account. The result is something like an X-Filesapproach to the study of human evolution.Cremo, admittedly, is a devout member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, anorganization formed around the teachings of Swami Prabhupada, the guru ofKrishna Consciousness, who for a short time in the late 1960s occupied theposition of spiritual guide to the Beatles after the post had been vacated bythe Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. This, of course, is enough to make Cremo persona nongrata among professional archaeologists, and one has to admit there is thepossibility of bias in his approach. According to Hinduism, human beings like ushave walked the planet for enormous periods of time, the yugas spoken of in theBhagavata Purana, a commentary on the ancient Vedic hymns. (We, incidentally,are in the tail end of the Kali Yuga, a period of decline that is supposed topresage a new Golden Age.) Even so, Cremo and Thompson collected a disturbingamount of evidence suggesting that much of what may have upset thearchaeological applecart has been conveniently left out of the official story.The core of their study focuses on various findings reported during the latenineteenth and early twentieth centuries that seem to contradict the Darwinianaccount of evolution. Since Thomas Huxley's debate with Bishop Wilberforce, thataccount had become the reigning orthodoxy. I can only touch on the material theyprovide, but these few examples should give an idea of the sort of thing thathas been swept under the “official” archaeological carpet.For example, in one instance from the 1870s, bones from an extinct three-toedhorse called Hipparion were discovered, and it was clear that they had beenfractured in order to extract the marrow. What made them odd was that thefractures appeared to have been made by a stone tool, not by animals. One groupof bones excavated from the site and showing the same fractures dated back to atleast five million years ago—much earlier than “Lucy” and her family. In anotherexample from around the same time, sharks' teeth found in a layer dating back totwo and half million years ago displayed fine holes that seemed clearly boredthrough them, making the teeth resemble ornaments for a necklace, something notassociated with the hominids present at that time. In yet another case, in the1860s, the head of the Geological Survey in Portugal, a man named CarlosRibeiro, discovered flint tools in a layer of limestone dating back to thePliocene and Miocene, two and five million years ago respectively, much earlierthan the accepted view of when such tools should have been present. In each ofthese cases—and Cremo and Thompson's book is filled with hundreds more—theanomalies were either ignored, rejected, or qualified in order to fit into thestandard account of human evolution.9 [../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-9]Cremo and Thompson are not the only ones who pondered the possibility thatbeings anatomically very much like us walked the Earth millions of years beforethey are supposed to—at least according to the official view. In 1978, atLaetoli, a site twenty miles south of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania—a place madeworld famous by the work of the anthropologist Louis Leakey—Mary Leakey, her sonPhilip, and a member of their expedition named Peter Jones came across aremarkable discovery. They found several sets of footprints left in volcanic ashthat dated to about 3.5 to 3.8 million years ago. The footprints were those ofhominids, and they indicated that their makers walked upright. But what wastruly remarkable about these remains was that the footprints were typicallyhuman. Mary Leakey spoke of “unique evidence, of an unimpeachable nature” whichestablished that “our hominid ancestors were fully bipedal a little before 3.5million years ago.” “The essentially human nature and the modern appearance ofthe footprints were quite extraordinary.”10 [../Text/part0040.html#c15-FN-10]Years earlier her husband, Louis Leakey, began his career by investigating anequally unusual discovery made by a German geologist named Hans Reck. At OlduvaiGorge in 1911, Reck came upon an anatomically human skull in a layer of earth atleast 800,000 years old. According to the accepted view, this should not be thecase. Darwinian theory argued that any remains that old should not be “human,”and any that were human, could not be that old. Although Alfred Wallace, thecofounder of the theory of natural selection, believed that human beings as weknow them existed as far back as the Tertiary Period (ten to fifteen millionyears ago), the “missing link” between ourselves and apes was thought to be notmore than 500,000 years old. So Reck's skull was either that of an apelikecreature, or it was much younger than he believed. Twenty years later, in 1931,Louis Leakey visited the site with Reck and investigated the strata where theskull was found. It was clear to him that indeed it was nearly a million yearsold. It seemed that some creature not so vastly different from us was occupyingthe Earth at a time it should not have; Leakey had pushed our presence on theplanet back by nearly a million years, and the experts, of course, were nothappy about this. He later raised much controversy by his contention that sometwo to three million years ago, Australopithecus and Homo habilis coexisted, abelief that was contested but that his son Richard Leakey also advanced. Somesupport for this view was provided by Donald Johanson and his discovery of Lucyand the First Family. Australopithecus afarensis, Johanson's name for his find,was not, as far as we know, a toolmaker, yet tools were discovered along withLucy and her “family.” If they hadn't made them, who had? One possibility isHomo habilis, which would push its presence on Earth back by at least a millionyears.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]If nothing else, these anomalies suggest that the neat and orderly account ofthe “ascent of man” from early apelike ancestors to ourselves is not as foregonea conclusion as the experts would claim. And while it does not argue thatalternative accounts such as Madame Blavatsky's and Rudolf Steiner's aretherefore correct, it at least gives us room to speculate, without feeling thatwe are merely whistling in the dark. One thing that does suggest itself is thatnotions of a “multiple evolution” of the kind offered in different ways byBergson and Ouspensky cannot be simply ruled out. If the idea of anuninterrupted linear progression from some ancient hominid ancestor to us failsto account for these various anomalies, then we are justified in, as Ouspenskywould put it, “thinking in other categories.” Human beings, or someone very muchlike them, may have been around for much longer than we have supposed. If thatis the case, another question arises. If beings like us have been around forsuch a long time, why didn't they build a civilization like ours much earlier?Even if we put aside the possibility suggested by Mary Leakey's footprintsdiscovered at Laetoli that a human like being walked upright around the sametime as Lucy and the First Family, and concentrate on much more recent timeslike, say, the last 50,000 years, we are still left wondering, why civilizationas we know it dates from only 5,000 years ago.Neanderthals were observing the movement of the Pleiades some 40,000 years agoand giving this faint group of stars a name that would last for millennia. Fivethousand years later, our ancestors were charting the phases of the Moon. By8,000 B.C.—10,000 years ago—the people of Old Europe had erected Çatal Hüyük andother Goddess-oriented sites and, if we accept Marija Gimbuta's account,developed a culture of nature worship and aesthetic and social sensitivity. Soonafter come the megalithic observatories like Stonehenge and Callanish. All ofthese activities suggest intelligence, reason, knowledge, and technical skill.In fact, one anthropologist examined Stone Age tools dating from some 330,000years ago using tests devised by the psychologist Jean Piaget—famous for hiswork in child psychology and cognitive theory—and declared that the people whohad made them were as intelligent as ourselves. And yet, even with all theseattributes, the very qualities necessary to create “civilization” as we know it,the prehistoric world remained very different from our own.The question that raises is: Why?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]NONCEREBRAL CONSCIOUSNESSOne answer to the question why civilization did not begin earlier is that it ishighly likely the consciousness of our prehistoric ancestors was very differentfrom our own. Given what we have heard from Stan Gooch and Andreas Mavromatis,this is to be expected. If our own cerebral cortex dates back to the brainexplosion of 500,000 years ago, we can imagine that the consciousness of thehominid ancestors who left their footprints at Laetoli some 3.5 to 3.8 millionyears ago was probably not very much different from that of the animals. Homohabilis developed tools, and Homo erectus had enough curiosity to leave thehomeland of Africa and explore new lands—driven, of course, by a variety ofenvironmental factors. But for something like three million years, our ancestorswere in many ways as rooted to the earth as the trees they once lived in.With the brain explosion this changed. Whatever may have caused the change, itshifted our ancestors' awareness. They began to use some of their intelligenceand to notice the world around them. And some of the things they saw were theMoon and the stars. Of course they had seen them before, but now theylooked—different.One of the things we must grasp about our “premodern” ancestors is that theywere “in touch” with nature to a degree we find difficult to imagine. And thisremained true even after the “brain explosion,” but there was a difference. Homohabilis and Homo erectus were more than likely “in” nature in the same way thatanimals are today. But with the brain explosion Homo sapiens—Neanderthals andlater Cro-Magnons—began to experience a certain “separation” from the world.This is a point we will explore further in our discussion of Jean Gebser's work.Suffice it to say here that at this time our ancestors began to recognizepatterns in nature and to become aware of the relationships between them: themovement of the Pleiades, for example, and the arrival of spring. Or the phasesof the Moon and the menstrual cycle—as Stan Gooch suggests.But this would seem to say that the prehistoric mind was merely a dim version ofour own, not that its consciousness itself was different. Yet there is reason tobelieve that what prompted our ancestors to chart the phases of the Moon wassomething more than their attempts to devise a kind of primitive calendar—and inany case, their sense of time was very likely not like our own. Bergson, weremember, argued that the brain's function was essentially eliminative, and bythe brain he meant by and large the cerebral cortex. And Andreas Mavromatis, aswe have seen, suggests that “cortical consciousness” is aimed at stabilizing andobjectifying sensation.This prompts us to ask some obvious questions. What is it exactly that thecerebral cortex is “eliminating”? And what kind of sensations is it“objectifying”?One theorist who has speculated on the nature of “noncerebral” consciousness mayoffer some useful suggestions. He also happens to be associated with one of themost celebrated archaeological anomalies of our time: the true age of theSphinx.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Before the mid-1990s the name René Schwaller de Lubicz was known, at best, to ahandful of intrepid but eccentric scholars, whose interest lay in the esotericside of ancient Egypt and the often-impenetrable mysteries of alchemy. With thepublication of Graham Hancock's best-selling Fingerprints of the Gods in 1995,Schwaller became known to millions as the man who claimed that the Sphinx wasthousands of years older than had been suspected. It was not, he argued, builtaround 2500 B.C. as the official view held, but had been constructed muchearlier, as early, perhaps, as 10,500 B.C. Hancock was not the first to bringSchwaller's fascinating theory to light. His remarkable ideas about the age ofthe Sphinx had been pointed out several years earlier in John Anthony West'sbrilliant book The Serpent in the Sky. West's central theme was one that hasbeen a mainstay of esoteric thought ever since Madame Blavatsky: that thecivilization of Egypt—which, we remember, started “abruptly” in 3100 B.C. withKing Narmer's mace—is in fact thousands of years older than the official viewupholds. Moreover, West also pointed out there was good reason to believe thatrather than appearing “overnight” out of the darkness of predynastic Egypt, thearchaeological marvels that we associate with Egyptian civilization, like theSphinx and the pyramids with all their mathematical and engineering genius, mayindeed be the remains of a civilization that existed for millennia before Egypt,a civilization that we may, for convenience, call “Atlantis.”The Serpent in the Sky, is, in fact, a study of Schwaller's ideas about theprofound mathematical and symbolic aspects of the wisdom of ancient Egypt; likeSchwaller's own books, it reached a relatively small audience, generally thoseinterested in these or similar aspects of what has come to be known for betteror worse as New Age philosophy. When West's book first appeared in 1979, the“New Age” was still a marginal affair, although Marilyn Ferguson's The AquarianConspiracy (1980) was about to uncover a broad grassroots interest in ideasabout consciousness and spirituality. By the time of Hancock's book, New Ageconsciousness had spread, creating a large audience eager for ideas and insightsoffering some sense of meaning in a predominantly materialistic, rationalisticculture. As in the occult revival of the 1960s, the notion that a highlyadvanced civilization rich in spiritual insight and cosmic knowledge hadpreceded our own, but was unknown to modern science, satisfied a felt need. Thistime, however, the creators of that civilization did not come from outer space,and the evidence for their existence was more convincing than the inaccuraciesand fabrications of Erich von Daniken and the like.The story of Graham Hancock's investigation into the true age of the Sphinx isbest told in Keeper of Genesis (1996, U.S. edition The Message of the Sphinx),cowritten with another archaeological detective, Robert Bauval (author of TheOrion Mystery, 1994). The story is too involved to go into here, but basicallyHancock, author of a best-selling book about the lost ark of the covenant, wasintrigued by Schwaller's remark (which he came across in West's book) thatexcept for its head, the Sphinx showed clear signs of water erosion. This wassomething no Egyptologist had noticed before—or perhaps some had but had decidednot to mention, for good reason: the observation would upset the standardarchaeological record and explode the accepted date for the beginning ofcivilization. The fact that Schwaller de Lubicz was a maverick student ofancient Egypt, who also practiced alchemy and had a penchant for secretsocieties and right-wing politics, meant that his ideas were not immediatelyaccessible to the average archaeologist. What was known of them was consideredthe work of a crank.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-1] (The title “de Lubicz”was given to Schwaller by the Lithuanian poet and diplomat O. V. de LubiczMilosz for his efforts on behalf of the Lithuanian people in the aftermath ofWorld War I.)Schwaller made his remark about the water erosion on the Sphinx in one of hislast books, Sacred Science, published in 1961. Although it was aimed at a“general” audience, it is still a difficult work, and, like his other, even moreunwieldy books, it remained relatively unknown. So amidst the wealth ofSchwaller's equally eccentric notions regarding ancient Egypt, the one thatcould be scientifically tested lay unnoticed for years.Until John Anthony West. West realized that if it could be confirmed that theSphinx had suffered water erosion, archaeologists would have to start rewritingtheir textbooks. He sought help from scholars, including geologists,archaeologists, and Egyptian specialists. When it became clear that he wasinterested in arguing that the Sphinx showed signs of water erosion, they backedaway. The notion seemed too cranky and occult, another addition to the grab bagof esoteric ideas that had accumulated around Egypt since the eighteenthcentury. Finally, in 1989, West approached Robert Schoch, a professor at BostonUniversity. Schoch is a geologist and paleontologist whose specialty is theweathering of soft rocks, precisely like the limestone the Sphinx is made of, sohe had the exact expertise needed to make a geological assessment of its erosionmarks. His conclusions corroborated Schwaller: the erosion marks on the body ofthe Sphinx were made by water—not, however, by flooding, as Schwaller thought,but by rainfall.This is startling because the “official” date of construction of the Sphinx is2500 B.C., yet the kind of rainfall needed to cause the erosion marks hadn'thappened in bone-dry Egypt since at the very least 7000 to 5000 B.C.—and this isa conservative estimate. The erosion marks push the construction date back byseveral thousand years, to a time when the only tools available to the localNeolithic hunter-gatherers were some flint and bits of stick. No engineers, nomathematicians. A major anomaly, to be sure.As if this wasn't bad enough, Hancock and Bauval argue that the Sphinx and theplan for the pyramids, if not their actual construction, actually date back to10,500 B.C. and that the entire Giza complex is a monument commemorating what isknown in the ancient Egyptian religion as Zep Tepi, “The First Time.” Usingcomputers to trace back the precession of the equinoxes, Hancock and Bauvaldiscovered that circa 10,500 B.C. the Sphinx, the Nile, and the ground plan forthe three great pyramids all mirrored, with a startling accuracy, the night skyover Giza, specifically the constellation Leo, the Milky Way, and the belt ofOrion. All three feature prominently in Egyptian religious beliefs. (And forwhat it's worth, we recall that for both the ancient Greeks and the AustralianAborigines, Orion is the hunter chasing the Seven Sisters.) “The First Time,”Zep Tepi, occurred during the Age of Leo—some 12,000 years ago—a period evenmore prehistoric and backward, at least according to the official account, thanthe 7000–5000 B.C. of Robert Schoch's estimate. It also happens to be a likelytime period for the fabled sinking of Atlantis . . . In either case, given theaccepted account of humanity's “ascent,” there is no way anything like theSphinx could have been constructed at that time.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]But the true age of the Sphinx is only one of the many mysteries surroundingancient Egypt that Schwaller investigated. And as startling as it is for us—andshocking for the archaeological establishment—it is not the most important ofhis central ideas. Clearly it supports his fundamental belief that Egyptiancivilization is much older than academic Egyptologists claim. But more thanbeing an archaeological anomaly, what is important about the Sphinx is what itsays about that civilization. And for Schwaller, what the Sphinx tells us isthat the core of ancient Egyptian culture was a fundamental insight into the“laws of creation.”The evidence of the Sphinx, the pyramids, the stupendous Temple of Luxor, andthe magnificent stones of Karnak—all of which, Schwaller argues, are much olderthan we suspect—forces us to admit that the people responsible for thempossessed a spiritual insight and cosmic genius of which we have littleawareness. In the face of these tremendous works we “moderns,” he argues, mustadmit the existence of “a humanity both inspired and prehistoric,” something theacademic standard-bearers are loath to do.2 [../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-2]Everything about Egyptian civilization, from the construction of the pyramids tothe shape of a beer mug, Schwaller claimed, was motivated by a centralmetaphysical vision about the nature of cosmic harmony and an awareness ofhumanity's place in the evolution of consciousness. Not something we generallyassociate with cavemen dragging their girlfriends around by the hair.The kind of mathematical, astronomical, and engineering genius evident in theSphinx, the great pyramids, and other Egyptian monuments has been recounted bynumerous writers—a reader might start with Hancock and Bauval, and then turn toJohn Anthony West's and John Michell's work. That the great pyramids embodyprofound geodetic and celestial insights, and that they are constructed with anengineering finesse that is difficult, if not impossible, to repeat, even usingthe most advanced “modern” techniques, has been known for some time.3[../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-3] The history of “pyramidology,” in whicheverything from flying saucers to biblical prophecies has been associated withthe ancient Egyptian builders, is an absorbing, amusing, and enlightening study;sadly, it falls outside our present pursuit. But if the remarkable scientificknowledge of the builders of the Sphinx and the great pyramids is challenging toour standard model of the “progress” of civilization, what is even moredisturbing is the notion that whoever constructed these works of genius had aconsciousness radically different than our own.This consciousness Schwaller called “the intelligence of the heart.” He believedthat through a “harmonic coincidence of the ambient cosmos,” the ancientEgyptians were “able to know the forces that bring about the becoming ofthings.” This “knowing,” however, was not a “knowing by learning,” but animmediate, unreflective grasp of the fundamental laws of existence.4[../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-4] Lost to us moderns because of our emphasis onrational, logical thinking—the function of the cerebral cortex—this“intelligence of the heart” was communicated by the ancient sages through therich symbology of their monumental structures.As we have seen, the most fascinating and disturbing fact about ancient Egypt isthat, like the Greek goddess Athena, it appears suddenly, fully grown. There isno apparent development or evolution of the Egyptian style: hieroglyphics,technical skill, and architectural mastery are there, all of a piece, seeminglyout of nowhere. It is precisely this fact that has led some theorists, likeSchwaller, to suggest that these accomplishments are an inheritance from anearlier civilization. Whatever the case, it is evident that there is a profounddifference between our own sensibilities and those of the people responsible forthese works. Contact with this ancient world produces an eerie feeling, theproximity of, to our mind, a very strange and alien consciousness. One reasonfor this, Schwaller remarks, is that the Egyptian monuments exhibit the“cohesion of a style which does not speak to the ordinary sentiments of man andleaves no place for sensuality.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-5]A similar assessment can be made of Schwaller's own work, which is austere anduncompromising in the extreme. Yet his basic idea can be extracted from itsimposing setting: that the ancient Egyptians, and the people who came beforethem, saw the world in a way very different from how we perceive it.Schwaller's basic insight is not that different from Bergson's, whose influencehe came under during his time as a student of the painter Henri Matisse. Likepractically everyone else in the early part of the twentieth century, Matissewas deeply influenced by Bergson's philosophy of “intuition”—and Bergson's laterremark that the universe is “a machine for making gods” is a sentiment Schwallerwould later wholeheartedly support. After Bergson, a reading of Einstein, MaxPlanck, Niels Bohr, and Werner Heisenberg suggested to Schwaller that thestrange world of quantum physics and relativity opened the door to a universemore in line with the cosmologies of the ancients, and less compatible with theNewtonian clockwork world of the nineteenth century. Bohr's “complementarity”and Heisenberg's “uncertainty principle” were particularly influential onSchwaller's investigations of the true meaning of Egyptian hieroglyphics.Niels Bohr ended the debate over the nature of light—whether it was a particleor a wave—by opting for a position that saw it as both, with one definitioncomplementing the other. And Heisenberg argued that we cannot know both theposition and the speed of an elementary particle, since pinpointing one obscuresthe other—hence the “uncertainty.” What these non-Newtonian notions suggestedwas that “reality” exceeds our logic's ability to grasp it. Complementarity anduncertainty demand a stretch of our minds beyond the either/or of syllogisticlogic—something that Ouspensky had argued for way in advance of the popularityof what became known as the new physics. Both ask us to hold mutually exclusiveideas together, the basic principle behind Zen koans. The result, Schwallerknew, could be an illogical but illuminating insight.Such insights, he argued, were behind the mind that created the hieroglyphics,in which the “simultaneity of opposite states” plays a central role. Schwallercalled this practice symbolique, a way of holding together the object of senseperception and the content of inner knowing in a kind of creative polarity—aprocess that sounds remarkably like hypnagogia. When Egyptians saw thehieroglyph of a bird, he argued, they knew it was a sign for the actual,individual creature, but they also knew it was a symbol of the “cosmic function”the creature exemplified—flight—as well as all the myriad characteristicsassociated with it. (Again, we are reminded of Ouspensky and his experience ofthe ashtray.) Hieroglyphs did not merely designate: they evoked. As Schwallerwrote in Symbol and the Symbolic, “The observation of a simultaneity of mutuallycontradictory states . . . demonstrates the existence of two forms ofintelligence.”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-6] One form is our familiarrational, scientific intelligence. The other is the intelligence of the heart.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Schwaller believed that the appearance of the new physics indicated thathumanity was moving toward a massive shift in awareness—an idea, we shall see,shared by his near contemporary Jean Gebser. Schwaller related this shift to theprecession of the equinoxes and the coming Age of Aquarius. But he knew thatscience alone could not provide the deepest insights into the true character ofthe world. For this a completely different kind of consciousness is necessary.This belief led to his study of theosophy and esoteric knowledge. In particularit led to alchemy and his meeting with the mysterious individual known asFulcanelli, one of the great figures of myth in our time. One result ofSchwaller's alchemical studies was his belief that in esotericism a concrete,objective knowledge unknown to modern science could be found. Schwaller rejectedJung's idea that alchemy was a purely psychic affair, a working out of thecomplexes and “projections” of the alchemist's unconscious. He knew that alchemywas a spiritual practice involving the consciousness of the alchemist—it was, oris, as we shall see, a form of “participating” with nature. But it also involvedobjective insights into the nature of matter. This insight into the reality ofobjective knowledge fueled Schwaller's later investigations into Egyptiancivilization.One form of this objective knowledge came to Schwaller in 1926 during a seriesof “channeled” communications he received from a higher intelligence. He calledthe voice that spoke to him “Aor,” which means “intellectual light” in Hebrew.(It was also, incidentally, the mystical title he took after an initiatoryexperience; later, students who gathered around him in Suhalia, his alchemicalcommunity in Switzerland, would call him by this name.) These “inspirations”revealed to Schwaller the true significance of time, space, measure, andharmony. The basic message was to “think simply,” to abstract oneself from timeand space. “To cultivate oneself to be simple,” he wrote, “and to see simply isthe first task of anyone wishing to approach the sacred symbolism of AncientEgypt.” “Thinking simply” is necessary because “the obvious” blinds us—“theobvious” being our perception of the world via cerebral consciousness alone,which divides, analyzes, and “granulates” experience—all of which is another wayof expressing Bergson's insight about “static perception.” Schwaller would laterdiscover that the ancient Egyptians associated this static perception with theevil god Set. Its opposite, the intelligence of the heart, was linked to the godHorus.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Schwaller formulated his central ideas about ancient Egypt during his studies atthe temple of Luxor. On his first visit in 1937, he was impressed with atremendous insight. The temple, with its strange, “crooked” alignments, was, hewas certain, a conscious exercise in the laws of harmony and proportion. Hecalled it the Parthenon of Egypt and searched the temple for evidence of the“golden section,” or phi, a mathematical proportion believed to have beendiscovered by the Greeks.7 [../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-7] If it was embodiedin Luxor, that would prove the Egyptians knew of it much earlier. Schwaller didfind evidence for phi, and also for much else: the precession of the equinoxes,the circumference of the globe, the secrets of pi. But what struck him forciblywas his insight into the essence of Egyptian consciousness. The Egyptians, hebelieved, saw the world symbolically. Nature for them was a kind of “writing”conveying truths about the metaphysical forces behind creation, the Neters, asthe Egyptian gods are called. Viewing the world from the inside in this way gavethem access to their profound mathematical and astronomical knowledge—knowledgenot available to “cerebral consciousness” until centuries later. Luxor was akind of living organism, a colossal compendium of esoteric truth, whose everydetail, from its total design down to its very material, voiced a centralrevelation: the insight that the Conscious Man, the Pharonic King, was the goalof cosmic evolution. According to Schwaller, the Egyptians believed that eachindividual type in nature is a stage in a kind of cosmic embryology, whoseculmination is the human being. The different species developed different“cosmic functions”—the Neters, which we translate as “gods.” The ConsciousHuman, far from descending from the animals, is the apotheosis and integrationof their “cosmic functions.” We have seen that a similar idea was shared byMadame Blavatsky, Ouspensky, and Bergson.The essence of this evolution has to do with what Schwaller calls “functionalconsciousness,” which, with all respect to his profound insight into ancientEgypt, seems very much like Bergson's “intuition.” “Functional consciousness” isa way of knowing reality from the “inside,” and Schwaller believed that theculture and religion of ancient Egypt—the two were really the same—were based onthis “inner knowing,” which is very unlike our own “outer” oriented one. Theancient Egyptians, he argued, were aware of the limitations of purely cerebralconsciousness, the Set mind that granulates experience into fragments of spaceand time. Granulated experience produces our familiar world of disconnectedthings, each a kind of “island reality,” a fragmentation that in recent yearshas come to be called the “postmodern condition.” From this perspective, when Ilook at the world, I see a foreign, alien landscape, which I can only know fromthe “outside,” by taking it apart and analyzing it. But in doing so I tear bitsand pieces of the world out of their context, rupturing the whole. The result isthat I may be able to analyze the fragment in great detail, but it is no longerliving, vital. As Wordsworth said, “We murder to dissect.” It is not too much tosay that since the seventeenth century and the rise of scientism—the applicationof scientific method to phenomena outside its scope—much of the world has woundup on the dissecting table.The ancient Egyptians, Schwaller believed, saw the world in another way, and wehave good reason to believe they were perhaps the last people to experiencereality as a totality. As Schwaller wrote in his difficult work Nature Word,“The Universe is wholly activity.” In a section called “The Way,” he advises hisreaders to “leave all dialectic behind and follow the path of the Powers.”Tumble with the rock which falls from the mountain.Seek light and rejoice with the rosebud about to open: . . .labor with the parsimonious ant;gather honey with the bee;expand in space with the ripening fruit.8 [../Text/part0040.html#c16-FN-8]All of these injunctions are classic examples of the kind of “knowing from theinside” that Bergson had in mind in his talk on intuition. In this way, weparticipate with the world, rather than hold it at arm's length, objectifyingit, as modern science is prone to do. In this sense, Schwaller's injunctions arealso expressions of the “participatory consciousness” we will discuss in a laterchapter."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE SPLITClearly, if Schwaller de Lubicz is right, the ancient Egyptians, and thehypothetical civilization that preceded them, had a relationship with the worldprofoundly different from our own. And while the achievements of the ancientworld are awe-inspiring and without doubt worthy of respect, those of the modernworld are also considerable. The ancient Egyptians never saw pictures from theHubble telescope—but there is a good chance they would not have felt the need tobuild one. If they were as “at home” in the cosmos as Schwaller suggests, theywould have felt no need to explore it—it was there for them, immediately, intheir “unreflective grasp of the fundamental laws of existence.” And if you havea strong intuitive knowledge of something, you feel no need to make the effortto explain it. Take language, for example: we all know how to use it, but mostof us would be hard pressed to explain in detail how or why it works. And thoseof us who do ask questions about it are usually seen as a bit odd.If Schwaller is right, there is good reason to believe that the “humanity bothinspired and prehistoric” that preceded us had a similar relation to theirknowledge about the cosmos. Feeling the living presence of the Neters, theywould not have understood a desire to know why the universe is the way it is.The question itself would not have made sense to them. While this may haveprevented them from developing the kinds of problems we face in the modernworld, both environmental and psychological, it also had its drawbacks.In From Atlantis to the Sphinx, Colin Wilson suggests that it may have beenprecisely their closeness to the cosmos that prevented our ancestors fromevolving. They simply felt no need to. Since everything was at hand, evolution,which is the result of challenge and curiosity, was left without a prompt. Inthis sense, being kicked out of the Garden of Eden was probably the best thingthat could have happened to Adam and Eve. Had they remained in the cozy,uroboric embrace of Mother Earth—or God's graces—they would never have felt theneed to develop their own abilities and potentials. Wilson also speculates thatearly human beings, even as late as the ancient Egyptians, existed in a kind of“communal consciousness,” a unitary mind that we experience briefly during massevents like rock concerts and football games, which the Egyptians “tapped” inorder to perform some of their engineering marvels, such as lifting thetwenty-ton stone blocks that make up the pyramids. Such group experiences fillthe solitary ego with a sense of power and connect it to something greater thanitself—the basic drive behind religion.Most of us enjoy such immersions in collective consciousness, at leastoccasionally. During them we are no longer a vulnerable, insignificant atom, butpart of a vast, vital “whole.” To want to experience such feelings is perfectlynormal; it is part of being human, and, on a smaller but even more intimatescale, is the central attraction of love. But such collective consciousness canalso be used for less-than-desirable purposes, as was made clear during Hitler'syears in power, when mass meetings like the Nuremberg rallies fused the separateconsciousnesses of the crowd into a single, group mind. Such a mind can indeedbe powerful, but it is not always intelligent, as any kind of mob hysteria makesclear. And even when it does not grow demonic, a group mind has a curiouslystatic quality. For a variety of reasons, intelligence, genius, and insight areprofoundly individual, and what the mass mind may gain in power and “wholeness,”it lacks in innovation and adventure. (Attendees at any conference or boardmeeting can attest to this, and the fact that more and more “creative” decisionsare now made by committee suggests a current distrust of the authoritativeindividual.)Creation is a solitary affair. A mind that feels close bonds with those aroundit may never suffer from anxiety or cosmic loneliness, but it may also neverfeel the spur to satisfy its own needs through creative effort. Insecurity,angst, a sense of being “myself, alone” may at times be unbearable; they arealso the flipside of courage and determination.But how did the split occur? How did we get from a collective mind, at one withthe cosmos, led by the directives of a sacred, spiritual king, to ourselves,island egos adrift in a strange, alien universe? The process probably began longago, long before the reign of the Pharaohs and the building of the pyramids andthe Sphinx. Cro-Magnons lived in a vital, magical world, as the cave art atsites like Lascaux and Altamira shows. But they were just that bit less immersedin the cosmos than their Neanderthal predecessors. According to Stan Gooch,Cro-Magnons had all the qualities we attribute to our “rational” selves. Ourrational, logical, “masculine” traits, focusing on dealing with an externalworld—what Gooch calls “system A”—are our inheritance from the Cro-Magnons andare a direct outcome of the growth of the cerebral cortex. “System B,” ourmystical, intuitive, “feminine” qualities, related to our interior world, derivefrom our Neanderthal ancestors—who, Gooch tells us, had a much largercerebellum, the subcortical “little brain” that may have been evolution's firstchoice for an organ of self-consciousness. So Cro-Magnons, and the hybrids thatemerged from their mating with Neanderthal females—ourselves—had at least onefoot out of the Garden. Clearly the Kurgan horsemen, who Marija Gimbutas arguesoverran the Goddess-oriented civilization of Old Europe, seem to have been lesspeaceful and harmonious, no longer suckling at Mother Earth's breasts. Thecommunal society of sites like Çatal Hüyük suggests that their inhabitants mayhave shared something like the collective consciousness of ancient Egypt, whilethe hierarchical structure of Kurgan clans, as well as their emphasis on a solarsky god, argues for a society held together by fear and authority.We shouldn't think, however, of the Cro-Magnons or Kurgans as being individualsin the sense that we are. More than likely the sense of self-consciousness weexperience was dim in them, if present at all. They were still part of thegroup. But the split from the whole, from the totality, had begun. Linearthinking, which posits cause and effect, and which Gooch and Gimbutas argue wastypical of both the Cro-Magnons and Kurgans, functions by separating one groupof events from the totality in which they are embedded. It posits a “past” and a“future,” rupturing the ever-present “now” which, in its totality, contains bothin a timeless whole. (Nonlinear, “acausal” knowledge systems, like the I Ching,function by accepting that at any time a part of the whole is representative ofits entirety, much as a small portion of a hologram nevertheless contains itsentire image.) Cro-Magnons practiced magic, painting images of their prey on thewalls of their cave. By doing this they exerted their will upon the world. Theywanted to influence events in the future, not merely take things as they came.And by doing this they had taken a step out of the whole.Clearly, then, we shouldn't think of the split as a sudden, solitary event—asingularity as it is called in physics. Rather it was something that occurredover time. But there were obvious signs that something had changed. According toa recent book, one such occurred on the eastern shores of the Mediterraneansometime between 1700 and 1500 B.C., with the invention of what we know as thealphabet. The Phoenicians are traditionally given the honors for this, but thereis evidence of an earlier alphabet, and more than likely credit for developingthis revolutionary tool should be shared by several groups who inhabited thelands between Egypt and Mesopotamia in the second millennium B.C. Whoever may beresponsible, Leonard Shlain argues in The Alphabet Versus the Goddess (1998)that with the rise of the alphabet, the old image oriented, holistic, nonlinearGoddess consciousness embodied in Egyptian hieroglyphics was jettisoned in favorof a new device which “shifted the perceptual mode by which people understoodtheir reality, deflected the thrust of gender politics, and changed the courseof history.”1 [../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-1]Cultures that adopted the alphabet made remarkable achievements: monotheism,codes of law, democracy, the sanctity of the individual, economics, and thedevelopment of science, philosophy, and drama. But, Shlain tells us, there was aflipside. The “abstraction” from the whole that made the alphabet possible alsoopened the door to the abuse of nature, war, imperialism, racism, and sexism.For all its undoubted advantages—I would not have written this book without itand you would not be reading it—literacy has not been an unalloyed boon forhumankind, and certainly, according to Shlain, not for womankind. It has beenmuch more like a Pandora's box—which may be merely another of the kind ofantifeminine remarks it has engendered.Shlain argues that by focusing on this abstract, linear means of communicationwe have become a left-brain-dominated civilization, at the expense of our rightbrain and the nonlinear, holistic, participatory consciousness typical of thematriarchal, Goddess oriented societies that preceded literacy. Literacy, Shlainsuggests, is a predominantly male device, fostering a detachment from nature anda devaluing of the nonmasculine. His argument is well put and convincing, and,for an inveterate reader and writer like myself, disturbing. For example, hepoints out that the Phoenicians, who supposedly invented the system that, morethan anything else, our humanist civilization is based on, are not particularlygood missionaries for the ABCs.One might expect that the inventors of the alphabet would have excelledculturally, or that the creativity that inspired the alphabet would lead toother significant advances. Yet the only area in which the Phoenicians can becredited with innovation is in the art of naval design. . . . The most vividdescriptions of the Phoenicians come not from their own pens but from theirenemies, the Romans. In the final stages of the Roman siege of Carthage, thePhoenicians threw several hundred children, drawn from the finest families, ontothe stoked fires with the bronze belly of their god Moloch. This cruel deitycould only be appeased by human sacrifice.2 [../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-2]Shlain says that such cruelty, has sprouted throughout history in landsfertilized by the letter, along with patriarchy, a hierarchical socialstructure, and a rejection of nature, and infers that it stems from theinvention of the alphabet itself. This is because “all forms of writing increasethe left brain's dominance over the right.”As civilization progressed from image-based communications, such as pictographsand hieroglyphs, to non-iconic forms, such as cuneiform, written communicationbecame more left-brain oriented. An alphabet, being the most abstract form ofwriting, enhances left-brain values the most. . . . Unlike icons, which oftenevolved from images of things, an alphabetic word bears no resemblance to theobject or action it symbolizes.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-3]As the popular literature on split-brain theory has made widely known, the leftcerebral hemisphere is oriented toward language and logical, linear thinking,toward analysis, and toward “dealing with the world.” It is, in the jargon, the“scientist.” The right hemisphere is geared toward patterns; it sees the worldholistically, sensually, and has little sense of time, being quite content toinhabit a perpetual “now.” It is the “artist.” The alphabet, by focusingconsciousness on an abstract means of conveying information, loses the feltreality of what it is communicating. The hieroglyph of a bird still looks like abird. The word “bird” doesn't look like anything; it bears no direct relation towhat it is symbolizing. In other words, it seems that literacy is as far removedfrom Schwaller's intelligence of the heart as we can get.Shlain's argument warrants serious consideration, as does his belief that withthe rise of the Internet and our electronic culture we are moving away from thelinear-bound thinking of the book to a kind of renaissance of the image. This,he suggests, will foster a more feminine, harmonious, and holisticconsciousness. His forecast in many ways resembles that of Marshall McLuhan inthe 1960s; it also suffers from the same drawbacks. Whether an “image-based”culture is in itself preferable to a “literary” one, and whether indeed theInternet is as nonlinear and nonliteral as he suggests, are questions we willreturn to in a later chapter. But it is clear that Shlain has certainly peggedone of the major shifts in the history of consciousness, and one of the ways,perhaps the central one, by which we have arrived at minds like our own.4[../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-4]Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Shlain's date of 1700–1500 B.C. seems fairly recent for the birth ofself-consciousness, but the work of another theorist argues that consciousnessas we know it appeared even later, only as recently as 1250 B.C. In The Originof Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (1976), the Princetonpsychologist Julian Jaynes argues that until the later part of the secondmillennium B.C. human beings did not possess the kind of “interior world” thatwe do. They were not, in effect, self-conscious. Jaynes finds evidence for thisbizarre theory in Homer's epic poem The Iliad. Composed in the eighth or ninthcentury B.C., The Iliad depicts events in the Trojan War during the time of theMycenaean civilization some six or seven centuries earlier. Jaynes writes, “Thepicture then is one of strangeness and heartlessness and emptiness. We cannotapproach these heroes by inventing mind-spaces behind their fierce eyes as we doeach other.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-5] Simply put, he argues that TheIliad contains no words for internal states of mind. The heroes of The Iliad, aswell as the people living at the time its events took place, could not “lookinside” themselves as we do. They did not ask themselves, “Hmm, what shall I dotoday?” or “What do I think about this?” Instead, when they needed to know whatto do they listened to “voices” they heard in their heads, voices they believedcame from the gods. Jaynes tells us they really came from the right brain.Curiously, the inspiration—literally—for Jaynes's theory was a hypnagogicexperience, this one auditory. One afternoon, when he had been thinking hardabout the problems in his book, “particularly the question of what knowledge isand how we can know anything at all,” he had a remarkable experience.My convictions and misgivings had been circling about through the sometimesprecious fogs of epistemologies, finding nowhere to land. One afternoon I laydown in intellectual despair on a couch. Suddenly, out of an absolute quiet,there came a firm, distinct loud voice from my upper right which said, “Includethe knower in the known!” It lugged me to my feet absurdly exclaiming, “Hello?”looking for whoever was in the room. The voice had had an exact location. No onewas there! Not even behind the wall where I sheepishly looked. I do not takethis nebulous profundity as divinely inspired, but I do think it is similar towhat has been heard by those who in the past claimed such special selection.6[../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-6]If Jaynes had read Wilson Van Dusen's enlightening little book The Natural Depthin Man (1972), he would have known that his hallucination was not merely a“nebulous profundity,” but a valuable insight, clearly related to what he hadjust been thinking about so desperately. Including “the knower in the known” isa fundamental precept of the “participatory epistemology” we will be discussingshortly. Jaynes, unfortunately, was a convinced materialist, and he uses hisexperience as evidence for his belief that the gods of the ancients were merelysimilar hallucinations, which our ancestors only mistook for messages fromdivine beings. Wilson Van Dusen has shown, however, that rather than being sheernonsense, the kinds of voices one hears during states of hypnagogia often havevery insightful things to say.Just as the imagery seen in hypnagogia can depict profound truths, these voicescan be autosymbolic, commenting on one's state of mind, or on the thoughts onehas focused on while drifting into sleep. That Jaynes ignored the content of hishallucination is unfortunate, but not surprising, given the reductionist,scientistic bent of his thinking. Van Dusen, a clinical psychologist, with anequal scientific training, thought otherwise.Much of the hypnogogic area looks simply like cute images and odd sentencesbeing tossed around in one's head until one asks precisely what the individualwas thinking of at that same moment. Then it begins to look like either arepresentation of the person's state or an answer to his query. . . . I wastrying to pick up hypnogogic experiences and heard, “still a nothing.” I wasn'tgetting much and it said as much. While I was trying to see in detail howhypnogogic experience forms I heard, “Do you have a computer?” I was gettingvery sleepy in the hypnogogic state and heard “The usual snoofing.” At the timethe odd word “snoofing” sounded like a cross between snooping (trying to snoopon the hypnogogic) and snoozing (getting sleepy). . . . I was thinking of therichness of the process and heard “My liberal arts course.” While meditating ona pain in my head I heard “Nonmaterial!”7 [../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-7]Clearly, although Jaynes failed to recognize it, “Include the knower in theknown!” belongs in this category. For the rest of his book, although he has muchto say about hallucinations, especially about the voices heard byschizophrenics, he goes no deeper into his own experience.8[../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-8]Jaynes's theory is that until around 1250 B.C., human consciousness was“bicameral.” Bicameral simply means two-chambered, and what Jaynes refers to arethe right and left hemispheres of the brain. He argues that until 1250 B.C. thetwo hemispheres were independent, functioning as two separate minds within oneskull, and supports his theory with findings from split-brain research. Sincethe discovery of the “division of labor” between the two hemispheres waspopularized in the 1980s, much of the material on the “two brains” has becomewidely known. But the most remarkable discovery is that in a very real sense,two minds do inhabit our heads. Neurosurgeons operating on individuals sufferingfrom epilepsy often sever a knot of fibers called the corpus callosum, whichconnects the two cerebral hemispheres, hoping this will stop the spread of theepileptic “storm” from one hemisphere to the other. It works, but the procedurehas a curious side effect. For some unknown reason, the right side of the bodyis controlled by the left cerebral hemisphere, and the left side by the right. Aperson with a severed corpus callosum who bumps into something with the leftside—connected to the right brain—does not know it. This is because our “I,” theverbal, linguistic ego, is housed in the left brain. And so “it,” connected tothe right side of the body, did not bump into anything. Other equally disturbingexamples of this remarkable phenomenon can be found in the literature. Jaynesargues that until 1250 B.C., all human beings were like people with severedcorpus callosums. And instead of being able, as we are, to look inside ourselvesand carry on inner dialogues, the people of an earlier time heard voices,telling them what to do. They believed the voices were the voices of the gods,but Jaynes argues they were really hallucinations coming from their “othermind,” the right brain. So, faced with a certain situation, say, crossing a deepriver, or going after game, they would ask “the gods” for their advice. This,Jaynes argues, is the true root of religion. The gods are voices in the head.This sounds like an unbelievable idea until one looks at the evidence hecollects to support it. He has amassed too much to recount with any detail, butthrough a study of ancient texts, the archaeological record, split-brainresearch, and the development of language, he concludes that human beings of thesecond millennium B.C. and earlier simply did not possess what we call an“interior world.” The chapter on “The Mind of Iliad” is, to my mind, the mostconvincing.But if Jaynes is right, then what happened in 1250 B.C. to change this? Hesuggests that several crises—natural catastrophes, wars, massive migrations,raids on coastal cities by marauding pirates—created a time of such stress andupheaval that people were forced to react much more quickly than they were usedto, and this eventually broke down the wall between the chambers of the mind.Previously, life followed well-worn routines, and they needed to consult thegods only infrequently, when confronted by some novelty or unusual situation.They could petition the voices and wait for their reply. Often, Jaynes remarks,they may have had to do this several times. En route to build a dam downriver,our bicameral ancestors may have forgotten why they were there, and may have hadto ask the god for instructions each time the purpose of their journey slippedtheir mind. But with volcanic eruptions (Jaynes cites the destruction of theisland of Santorini sometime between 1470 and 1170 B.C.; the devastation isbelieved to have been greater than a nuclear explosion), such leisure was nolonger possible. Add to this wars, social collapse, famine, and pirates, and itis clear that the old bicameral mind would be sorely tested.Some of Jaynes's most impressive evidence is from literature and inscriptionsthat come directly after the “breakdown.” In 1230 B.C., Tukulti-Ninurta I,tyrant of Assyria, had a stone altar made that tells the tale. On the face ofthe altar, Tukulti himself is shown kneeling before the empty throne of his god.As Jaynes remarks, “No king before in history is ever shown kneeling. No scenebefore in history ever indicates an absent god.”9[../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-9] A cuneiform tablet from about the reign ofTukulti dots the i's and crosses the t's:One who has no god, as he walks along the street,Headache envelops him like a garment.Another tablet laments the departed voices:My god has forsaken me and disappeared,My goddess has failed me and keeps at a distance.The good angel who walked beside me has departed.10[../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-10]Other tablets from around the same time repeat a similar lament.One foreboding sign of a change in consciousness around this time is the rise ofcruelty, something we have already seen in the context of the rise of thealphabet. A century after Tukulti-Ninurta, the Assyrian tyrant Tiglath-Pileser I(1115–1077 B.C.) began one of the bloodiest campaigns in human history. Oneclear sign of a shift in human beings' relation to the gods is that, unlikeprevious kings, Tiglath-Pileser does not join his name to that of his god. But amore startling indication is the sheer brutality of his reign. “The Assyriansfell like butchers upon harmless villages,” Jaynes writes, “enslaved whatrefugees they could, and slaughtered others in thousands. Bas-reliefs show whatappear to be whole cities whose populace have been stuck alive on stakes.”11[../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-11] Tiglath-Pileser's laws carried the bloodiestpenalties known to history, even, Jaynes tells us, for minor offenses. Jaynesbelieves this reign of terror is a result of the breakdown of the rule of thegods, an attempt to hold a crumbling civilization together by sheer fear.Remembering Cro-Magnons' extermination of Neanderthals, and the Kurgan warriorsdescent on Old Europe, the disturbing thought is that self-consciousness itselfis rooted in bloodshed and atrocity.And yet, although the historical facts that Jaynes calls on to support histheory are undeniable, it is difficult for us to accept that before the end ofthe second millennium B.C. human beings simply did not have “insides”—were, asJaynes depicts them, automatons, directed by the hallucinated voice of a god ordead king. That their consciousness differed from our own is clear—that, infact, is the central argument of this book. But that they were as bicameral asJaynes suggests somehow seems too extreme. It is difficult to imagine automatonsdesigning and constructing the Sphinx or the pyramids, although, again, Ibelieve their self-consciousness was not as acute as our own. We can even agreewith Colin Wilson, who suggests that it is not our ancestors who were bicameral,but ourselves, stuck, as we seem to be, in our left-brain cerebralconsciousness, with little access or appreciation of the intuitive,participatory powers of the right—or of our cerebellum, as Stan Gooch wouldargue. The “unreflective grasp of the fundamental laws of existence” thatSchwaller saw at work in the monumental structures of ancient Egypt seems a farremove from Jaynes's mindless zombies, prodded by the barked commands of a deadking. It does, however, seem much more like the kind of insights offered byright-brain consciousness. And as the left brain is geared toward “dealing” withthings, the “withdrawal” of right brain awareness—for whatever reason—would findhuman beings alone in a world that had suddenly become alien. No longersupported by an unconscious bond with nature, and faced with a host of problems,the new left-brain consciousness would surely look for the easiest way to handledifficulties. It may seem an odd way to put it, but cruelty may be nothing morethan a shortcut devised by a consciousness suddenly thrown into a threateningworld.Jaynes is right, however, to see the change in consciousness as a departure ofthe gods. His theory is that the bicameral voices were made up of “stores ofadmonitory and perceptive experience,” the echoes of the commands of the eldersof the clan, much as the haranguing voices heard by schizophrenics are oftenthose of an overbearing parent or spouse. This “experience” was then transmutedinto articulate speech, which then gave them their commands. The gods, then,were “a mere side effect of language evolution.”12[../Text/part0040.html#c17-FN-12] When their voices were no longer heard, theyhad gone.As self-consciousness and language are directly related, this makes a kind ofsense. As we have seen, R. M. Bucke said as much as early as 1901. But otherthinkers who have looked into the relation between language and the evolution ofconsciousness have not been as dismissive of the gods as Jaynes. In the nextsection we will see how, for at least one thinker, it may be that throughlanguage itself something like the gods may return."},{"pageContent":"PART FOURImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]PARTICIPATORY EPISTEMOLOGY"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE SHOCK OF METAPHOROwen Barfield, who died in 1997 at the age of ninety-nine, is perhaps best knownfor being the close friend of C. S. Lewis. With Lewis, Charles Williams, and J.R. R. Tolkien, Barfield is also known for being a member of the Oxford literarygroup, the Inklings. To a smaller but by no means less dedicated audience, he isprobably the most articulate interpreter of the ideas of Rudolf Steiner. Butbefore he became the most literate and philosophical of Steiner's manyapologists, Barfield had made a small reputation for himself in 1926 with thepublication of his first book, History in English Words. As the title suggests,the book deals with history and language, but not in the way one mightimmediately think. It was not “History and English Words,” but “History inEnglish Words”—meaning that history could be found within the words themselves.As Barfield wrote,In our own language . . . the past history of humanity is spread out in animperishable map, just as the history of the mineral earth lies embedded in thelayers of its outer crust. But there is this difference . . . : whereas theformer can only give us a knowledge of outward, dead things . . . language haspreserved for us the inner, living history of man's soul. It reveals theevolution of consciousness.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c18-FN-1]What Barfield meant by “the evolution of consciousness” can be best understoodby his brief remark in a later book, Romanticism Come of Age (1944). Here hecalled it “the concept of man's self-consciousness as a process in time.” Thishe distinguished from what is known as the “history of ideas.” In the history ofideas, an ancient Greek, for example, and a postmodern American have verydifferent ideas about the world, but both are held to perceive the world in thesame way—with the understanding that our ideas, informed by modern science, arecloser to the truth. There is no question of a difference between ourconsciousness and that of the ancient Greek, only between the ideas “inside” it.When we open our eyes, we see the same world that the Greek saw—it's just thatwe have better ideas about it.For Barfield this is totally wrong. Not only do our ideas about the worlddiffer, but the world the ancient Greek saw and the one we see are not the same.Our consciousness is very different from that of an ancient Greek—or from thatof a Greek of late antiquity, or someone from the Middle Ages. Not only ourideas about things, but also our consciousness of them, have evolved over time,and the record of that evolution lies in language. And whereas the standard viewof evolution has a consciousness much like our own, confronting a preexisting,external world made up of distinct, independent, impermeable objects, the recordleft by language, Barfield argues, suggests something different.Barfield came to this study, he tells us, at an early age. The inspiration was,of all things, a Latin lesson. During an instruction in the accusative case, theyoung Barfield came upon the sentence Cato, octoginta annos natus, excessit evita, which, he saw, could be translated as “Cato, at the age of eighty, walkedout of life”—meaning that Cato, the great Roman orator, died at eighty. Whatstruck him was the felt change he experienced when he realized that the drabfact of Cato's dying could be expressed figuratively, that is, in a metaphor—inthis case, that of Cato “walking out of life.” It was not only the pleasantsensation of appreciating a neat turn of phrase, although the aesthetic aspectof the recognition appealed to him; it was also that this way of expressingthings and grasping them (another metaphor) somehow increased his knowledge andawareness of life. As he would later phrase it, it “changed one's consciousnessa little.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c18-FN-2] He realized that language initself, and not only the facts or ideas it is used to convey, could be enjoyed;moreover, focusing one's attention on it led to some interesting results.These results increased when Barfield began to look more closely at poetry,something he had developed a great love for in his teens. He came to theconclusion that, as in his Latin lesson, metaphors were at the heart of hisappreciation. This power of using language figuratively, of, as it were, making“pictures” with it, affected him deeply. The world became a more profound, amore meaningful place when seen through the lens of the great poets. They madeit more alive, and at the time Barfield was discovering this, such enliveningwas rare. It would not be long before the suffocating atmosphere of linguisticanalysis and logical positivism would stifle the Western mind. And in poetryitself, an anti-Romantic modernism had taken center stage, ushered in by T. S.Eliot's The Waste Land (1922), a profoundly urban, almost prosaic work depictinga world of fragments, far removed from the sudden gripping sense of hiddenmeanings that Barfield's reading was revealing to him.This revelation, Barfield realized, was possible because of the poets' use oflanguage. It was not only that they said interesting things and that theirsubjects were interesting in themselves (and as the poetry that affectedBarfield most deeply was lyric poetry, the subjects were invariably the poetsthemselves, their moods and feelings); it was the way their use of languageaffected his consciousness that appealed to Barfield. They did not just say thatthe world was full of hidden meanings, they showed this to be so. This effectwas so pronounced that Barfield wrote a book about it.Published in 1928, Poetic Diction explored this curious ability of poetry tochange its reader's consciousness, to effect, as Barfield put it, a smallincrease in knowledge and wisdom. The pleasure afforded by lyric poetry, heargued, came about precisely because of this change. When the metaphors thepoets used were fresh and new, the “shock” of seeing sunrise as the “rosyfingered dawn” (Homer) or of feeling one's soul to be a lyre (Shelley)contrasted with one's prosaic understanding of these things, and, for the briefperiod that the shock lasted, one enjoyed a kind of “double consciousness.”Years later Colin Wilson, in his little book Poetry and Mysticism (1968), wouldalso argue that this “duo-consciousness” was at the heart of aesthetic andmystical experiences, citing Ramakrishna's samadhi at the sight of a flock ofwhite swans passing before a dark cloud, and at a less ecstatic level, thedomestic bliss of curling up in a warm bed with a good book, aware of the coldrain pattering against the window: the essence of both experiences is contrast,another form of the double consciousness discussed earlier.Barfield recognized, however, that the pleasure in metaphors is, of course,fleeting. With repeated readings, the “newness” evaporates, although the wisdomgranted by the change in consciousness can be retained—at any rate, one hopes itis, and it is this belief that informs the idea that reading great literature“humanizes” us. But the shock fades. So Barfield also discovered that metaphorsgrow old. They become, to paraphrase Emerson, “fossilized.” (“Language,” Emersonsaid, “is fossil poetry.”) Metaphors, Nietzsche remarked, are like coins whosefaces become worn down by use. We handle metaphors everyday but no longerexperience the shock they must once have produced. Today we hardly recognizethem at all, or if we do we see them as clichés or simply manners of speaking.(The technical term is “trope,” a “turn of phrase,” which is itself a kind ofmetaphor: in which direction do phrases “turn”?)At the beginning of the last section I examined a few of the many metaphors weuse to talk about the mind. We all use them, quite unconscious of the fact thatthey are metaphors, and I believe we would find it extremely difficult to talkabout the mind in any way other than metaphorically. In the paragraph above Ispeak of pleasure being “fleeting” and of newness “evaporating”—yet pleasuredoes not run, nor does novelty dry up, except only metaphorically. I mentionthis to bring our attention to the fact that we all use figures of speech thatat one time must have seemed wonderfully new and unusual, but that we now hardlynotice. (This is why we look for striking new metaphors in writers.) It is onlyan extremely literal mind that finds metaphors “difficult,” just as a similarkind of mind sees no difference between a myth and a lie. When I was a child,there was an old comic routine in which the straight man took literally everymetaphoric phrase of his partner, who was soon in tears, desperate to expresshimself. If he mentioned some old affair as “water under the bridge,” thestraight man asked, “Which bridge?” If he referred to some easy task as “takingcandy from a baby,” the straight man accused him of child molesting. Trying tocommunicate without metaphors is extremely difficult and invariably frustrating.The one language I can think of in which it can be done is mathematics, and thisis possible because it reduces content to the bare minimum.3[../Text/part0040.html#c18-FN-3]It was this “aging” of metaphors that prompted Barfield to his next phase ofstudy. If language, as Emerson said, is “fossil poetry,” then as we look intothe history of language, the fossils should become “more alive.” And this isprecisely what Barfield found. He recognized that it was not only poetry thatcould effect a change in consciousness. Our everyday language at an earlierstage of its development could produce a similar effect. This is because as wego further and further into its history, language becomes more figurative, moremetaphoric, more like poetry than it is today. Barfield discovered that readingliterature from an earlier period produced the same shock as did reading poetry,and this led him to formulate a theory about why the shock should be produced.It came about, he argued, from our coming into contact with a consciousnessdifferent from our own. (Schwaller de Lubicz, as we have seen, felt the sameabout our reaction to the monuments of Egypt.) A similar phenomenon takes placewhen learning a foreign language, as I can attest from my own fumbling attemptsat learning German. The mind grasps what all good translators know: that thereis no direct substitution of one language for another, because even though theymay speak of the same thing, different languages express a different way ofseeing the world. In Barfield's case, this insight came from looking at thehistory of his own language, English.What is thought-provoking about this is that, in the case of poetry, one expectsthe poet to try to use language in an evocative way. Poetry in this sense is aspecial case. But the language Barfield was reading was the language of prose,which is supposed to be straightforward, descriptive, expository; what he found,however, was that this language produced the same effect. And if the effect isproduced by a consciousness different from our own, that meant the writer of theprose had such a different consciousness. Further, since this was not a specialcase, it also meant that the everyday consciousness of the time in question wasitself different. And this meant, for Barfield at least, that consciousness mustevolve.This evolution, Barfield came to see, moved from a more metaphorical way ofseeing the world to a less metaphorical way, from, as the German scholar ErichHeller put it, an age of Poetry to an age of Prose.4[../Text/part0040.html#c18-FN-4] It could also be seen as moving from a more“concrete” consciousness to one that is more “abstract.” And again, evidence forthis hypothesis seemed to lie in language itself.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]“It is a commonplace . . . that, whatever word we hit on,” Barfield wrote inSaving the Appearances, a book we will look at in detail further on, “if wetrace its meaning far enough back, we find it apparently expressive of sometangible, or at all events, perceptible object or some physical activity. . . .Throughout the recorded history of language the movement of meaning has beenfrom the concrete to the abstract.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c18-FN-5] Giventhis, the standard understanding of the evolution of language, Barfield argues,is that all words referring to something spiritual or abstract have their originin literal meaning. So when we refer to a “spirit” enlivening the physical body,what we are talking about is something like breath. We find this, for example,in the Hebrew ruach and the Greek pneuma, both of which designate an “indwellingsoul,” but also the volatile character of air. Such considerations have led sometheorists to suggest that all words that are supposed to point to some kind of“spiritual reality” are merely metaphors, “ways of speaking” and “turns ofphrase,” that have been mistaken to indicate some actual “intangible” entity.Indeed, one theorist even went so far as to call mythology, with its talk ofgods as the source of natural phenomena, a “disease of language.” A similarsensibility was at work in the years Barfield was writing his book, withlinguistic analysis and logical positivism arguing that the traditional concernsof philosophy, the great questions of metaphysics, were simply the result of amisunderstanding of language. (Wittgenstein, who started this trend, famouslyremarked that philosophy was a sickness from which philosophers needed to becured.)It was clear to Barfield, as it was to thinkers like Nietzsche and Emerson, thatmodern language, with its abstract terms and nuances of meaning, is, as hewrote, “apparently nothing but an unconscionable tissue of dead, or petrified,metaphors.” The deeper we dig into language, the more metaphors we find. But, asBarfield continued his study, he realized there was something wrong with thisidea. Etymologists, like the famous Oriental scholar Max Müller, believed thatearly speech began with very simple, literal words and phrases for tangible,perceptible things. Then, with the “dawn of reason” (itself a metaphor), ourearly ancestors began to use these phrases “metaphorically,” to describe innerand outer experiences. Barfield even jokingly suggests that Müller has to positsome early generation of “amateur poets” who supplied their fellows with a wholecatalog of clever turns of phrase, and that the habit hasn't left us since. Ifwe take this theory to its logical conclusion, Barfield argues, the resultshould be that today, after millennia of metaphor building, we should all bespouting poetry whenever we speak. And likewise, we should, being so much moresophisticated, find poetry from earlier times rather less poetic. Neither ofwhich, of course, is true. In fact, quite the contrary seems to be the case: ourcommon language has a flat, “matter-of-fact” character, and it is this that ledErich Heller to say that we have moved from an age of Poetry to an age of Prose.And hence our attraction to the “classics.” Homer still thrills like nothingelse, and it is precisely because he does that we still read him. In fact, asBarfield found, rather than finding earlier poetry and language less figurativethan our own, we find the opposite to be the case, and we read older and ancientwriters because of the richness of their language. Anyone familiar with modernpoetry, which is little more than a kind of truncated prose, will see thedifference immediately.Müller and his followers erred, Barfield believed, by adopting an unquestionedDarwinian approach to the history of language. Just as simple organisms becamemore complex over time, so too, they believed, language evolved, from simple“root” words denoting tangible “things” into our highly abstract andmetaphorical speech. The only problem with this, Barfield argued, is that theevidence from language itself suggests something different.What the history of language tells us, he argues, is that our ancestors didn'tuse language in the way Müller and other earlier theorists believed, becausethey didn't see the same world Müller saw. Müller and practically every theoristafter him projected the world as perceived by late nineteenth- (or earlytwenty-first-) century Europeans into the past—which is why the only account ofthe history of language he could give was one that followed a Darwinian idea of“progress.” The same is true of various accounts of the “prehistoric world,” aworld, that is, before the arrival of human consciousness—a point we will returnto shortly. Barfield's arguments suggest that all ideas about the prehistoricworld, from paleontological textbooks to films like Jurassic Park, are, at theleast, questionable because, as Barfield put it, they project a picture of thatworld as it would be seen by a consciousness alive today. We have no way ofknowing what that world looked like to a different consciousness because we haveno record of a consciousness from that time. Even the fossils and other traceswe have discovered are limited in what they can tell us, since it is ourconsciousness that classifies and organizes them into the schemata of ancientlife.The kind of world our ancient ancestors saw—and which, Barfield suggests, ourmore recent ancestors continued to see—was not the well-defined, “objective”external world made up of distinct, independent, impermeable “things” that webump up against everyday. It was not a world in which a Cartesian res cogitansexisted on one side of an ontological borderline, with res extensa on the other.It was not a world in which such boundaries existed, nor one in whichepistemological conundrums troubled the heads—literally—of philosophers. It wasa world, he suggests, in which human consciousness “participated” and from whichit was not, as it is today, separated by an invisible wall of alienation. WhatMüller misunderstood as “metaphoric” was an ability to see the “inside” ofthings (remember Bergson and Schwaller), just as we now are aware of our own“inside”—our minds. Accounts of nature spirits; folk tales and myths aboutfairies, nymphs, and sylphs; legends of gods walking the Earth—all are rooted inthis “participatory consciousness.” This was the kind of world that the greatpoets saw; and, as Barfield discovered, it was also the kind of consciousnessthat Rudolf Steiner claimed was experienced by early human beings. Barfieldcalled it “original participation.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE PARTICIPATING MINDBarfield's ideas about “participation,” or, as I have called it, “participatoryepistemology,” run throughout his work. But the most concise expression of themcan be found in a book he wrote nearly thirty years after the publication ofPoetic Diction. Both Poetic Diction and History in English Words received highpraise, and Barfield contributed to the leading literary journals of the time,but it wasn't his destiny to make a living as a writer—an uneasy task in anyage. Forced by financial pressure to enter his family's law firm, he dropped outof the literary scene in the 1930s, only occasionally publishing articles inphilosophical journals. Then, after retiring from law, he made an impressivecomeback in 1957 with a deceptively short book, Saving the Appearances: A Studyin Idolatry.Saving the Appearances begins with some reflections on a common phenomenon: arainbow. While a rainbow lasts, it appears to us as a great arc of many colors,spanning rooftops and hills, somewhere out there in space. We have all seenrainbows and enjoyed them. We also know they are not quite like other things.Although we have been told many stories about what we may find there, we know wecan never get to the “end of the rainbow.” If we ran out and tried to reach it,it would be gone. Now, Barfield asks, bring to mind everything you've ever heardabout a rainbow and ask yourself a simple question: Is it really there?Most of us, I think, would say, “Yes, it is ‘really there.'” But then, what dowe mean by “really”? Well, although we know that rainbows only appear in showeryweather, and that they are a result of a peculiar arrangement of the raindrops,the sunlight, and our vision, we say they are “really there” because we aren'tthe only people to see them. Others do too. If I see a rainbow in the sky,usually my first reaction is to point it out to my companion—I can even rememberthe pleasure I had pointing one out to my son, who recognized it for the firsttime with great delight. We also know that people before us have seen them too,and their experiences have been recorded in literature. So although a rainbow isnot “there” in the same sense as, say, a tree is, it is still, for most of us,there. Yet if, for example, someone were to claim to see a rainbow on anabsolutely clear day, or at night, and we were confident that person was notsimply lying, then we could say that in this case the rainbow was not “reallythere.” It was, we would say, a hallucination.So a rainbow that we all see is “really there,” whereas one that only one personsees is not. This applies to anything we may consider a hallucination, although,to be sure, there have been reports of something called “mass hallucination,”such as the appearance of the Virgin Mary at Fatima and some UFO sightings, butfor the time being let us put these considerations aside.But then, Barfield asks, let us consider something else that we say is “reallythere.” Let us look at a tree.A tree, we know, is made of organic, cellular material, built up into wood,leaves, branches, roots, perhaps flowers. Unlike a rainbow, if we reach out totouch a tree, we can. We can hear the wind rustling its leaves, can grip itssturdy branches, can perhaps smell the fragrance of its blossoms, and, if welike, can even taste its bark or its fruit. The tree is as “there” as anythingcould be. Solid, indubitably present. Whatever the weather, rain or shine, atree is part of our objective, external world. Its appearance does not depend onanything except our having our eyes open.And yet we also know that the very material of which the tree is made is itselfmade of other things, of molecules, which are made of atoms, which are made ofsubatomic particles, which are made of even smaller elementary particles, whichthemselves are made of . . . well, something that is increasingly difficult todescribe using the idea of a “thing.” Charges of energy, probabilityfluctuations, quarks, leptons, and a host of other increasingly arcane“entities” (hundreds of them have been discovered), some of which are said toexist for only the most inconceivable fraction of time, while others are said tomove from future to past and not, as most of us do, the other way around. Thisworld of “elementary particles” (to use a convenient term) is, science tells us,what is “really really there,” and, as we recall with Galileo's distinctionbetween primary and secondary qualities, it has been telling us something alongthese lines for nearly the last four centuries. The most accurate way ofexpressing how modern physics—meaning the “new physics” beginning with Einsteinand quantum theory—sees the world is to say that the only “really real things”are mathematical equations. The old model of an atom with a nucleus around whichorbit electrons—a kind of miniature solar system—has been obsolete for decades,as has the idea of trying to “model” the behavior of these mysteriousnon-things. Today models and metaphors are used mostly to convey some idea ofthe discoveries of physicists to laymen (having worked as a science writer, Ihave some idea of how the process operates). And most models and metaphors aremisleading. When popular science writers talk of atoms as the building blocks ofthe universe, they are perpetuating a misconception. The universe is built of no“thing”—except perhaps mathematical formulae, something the ancient philosopherPythagoras suggested some millennia ago.But then, how do we get to a tree? When I see it, I do not see electrons“buzzing” (a metaphor; they don't) or elementary particles making prodigiousquantum leaps (a popular misconception).1 [../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-1] WhatI do see is a tall, stout, multilimbed, leaf-bearing growth of a general green,gray, and brownish color. And so do you. How is this so?Barfield makes the analogy that particles are to a tree—and to everything elseas well—as raindrops are to a rainbow. And just as rainbows are really therebecause we all see them, so too trees are really there because we all see them.But both, Barfield says, are “representations.” Our mind, our consciousness,“re-presents” the raindrops and the particles, in the first place as a rainbow,in the second as a tree. The difference between hallucinations and things thatare really there is that in the former the representation is solitary while inthe latter it is collective. A rainbow is, in Barfield's words, a “collectiverepresentation.” So is a tree—and the rest of the world, from stars toseashells, as well.This is curious, because, as most of us will agree, in some odd way a rainbow,which we say is “really there,” is “really there” in an unusual way, whereas atree is “really there” in a usual one. Those of us not put off by suchmetaphysical chatter can accept that the rainbow is a representation, formed bythe raindrops, my vision, and the sunlight. But a tree seems a different story.We might even be inclined to give a tree a good, strong kick—as Samuel Johnsononce did a stone, in order to refute Bishop Berkeley's contention that it was,in essence, just in his mind. But such a tactic would no more eliminate thequestion of the tree being a representation than Doctor Johnson's aching toesdid Berkeley's philosophy.Let's retrace our steps a bit.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Earlier I remarked, “We can characterize the advance of science as the solearbiter of truth by seeing in it the gradual expulsion of human consciousnessfrom its object of study.” While this is true, paradoxically there has also beenan increasing involvement of human consciousness in our understanding of “theworld.” Kant, we know, argued that the most fundamental “givens” of ourexperience—space, time, causality—were provided by the mind, by our “perceptualapparatus.” Later philosophers, like Edmund Husserl, argued that perception is“intentional,” that, unlike the Cartesian mirror, consciousness somehow “reachesout” and grabs the world, rather than simply reflecting it, an idea that, indifferent ways, we have seen in the thinking of William James and Bergson. Yet,scientists, particularly those of a strong materialist bent, continue to speakof an objective outside world, unadulterated by the influence of the mind—theyeven speak of the mind as being the product, or epiphenomenon, of purelymaterial forces. And ever since Descartes the aim of physics, seen as the mostauthoritative of the sciences since it dealt with the “really real” things ofthe world, has been to finally discover the most “real” of the “really real”things—those basic “building blocks” that popular science writers are alwaystalking about.Yet breakthroughs in physics in the early twentieth century made it clear thatin some baffling way the mind “participates,” as Barfield phrases it, in theworld, and that the great nineteenth-century ideal of the detached, objectivescientist, coolly observing the virgin processes of an external world, was amyth. We know now that the very act of observation alters the phenomena underscrutiny. As Morris Berman writes, “The major philosophical implication ofquantum mechanics is that there is no such thing as an independent observer.”2[../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-2] Werner Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle isperhaps the most popular formulation of this insight. Heisenberg said, asmentioned earlier, that we can know either the position or the momentum of aparticle, but not both. He explained how this is the case by imagining thefollowing situation. Imagine a microscope powerful enough to observe anelectron. Light travels down the microscope to illuminate our particle andenable us to see it. But this light is itself made of particles, which haveenough energy to knock the electron under observation out of its position. Theexperiment, then, has itself altered the situation it wishes to test. There isno longer, as in the classical model, a clear boundary between the observer andthe observed—something Julian Jaynes's hypnagogic hallucination tried to apprisehim of when it suggested he “include the knower in the known.” We can never peekfast enough to see what the world is like when we are not looking at it. “Weare,” as Berman again remarks, inescapably “sensuous participants in the veryworld we seek to describe.”3 [../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-3] The whole idea ofa nature “in itself” seems increasingly less intelligible, and this isespecially so in the discipline that started by trying to wrench “nature” freefrom the muddying effects of consciousness. Physicists now know thatconsciousness itself is part of their measurements. “What we observe,”Heisenberg wrote, “is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method ofquestioning.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-4] Again, as Morris Berman writes,“The great irony of quantum mechanics is that . . . the Cartesian attempt tofind the ultimate material entity, thereby ‘explaining' reality and ruling outsubjectivity once and for all, resulted in discoveries that mocked Cartesianassumptions and established subjectivity as the cornerstone of ‘objective'knowledge.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-5]That this “participation” of consciousness with the world opens the door onseveral taboo subjects, such as magic, “the occult,” and parapsychology isobvious, and is something we shall return to. For the moment, however, let usget back to Barfield and the tree.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]The “real” tree is made of elementary particles. The tree we see is arepresentation formed by our consciousness. So far, we are on firm scientificground. The world around us, from mountains and clouds to street signs andshopping malls, is also made of particles, and what we see is the representationof that world created, somehow, by our minds, our consciousness. But, asBarfield points out, there is a slight problem with this. The science that tellsus the world we see is a representation created by our consciousness also hassomething to say about the kind of world that existed before there was aconsciousness—at least, before there was a consciousness like our own. It tellsus what the world was like ten million, twenty million, five hundred million, abillion, or several billion years ago. And with its remarks about what may havebeen the case prior to the supposed Big Bang, it even tells us what the worldwas like before there was a world.With the exception of this last highly speculative exercise, the kind of worldthat science tells us existed long before there was a consciousness to representit seems, in all of its descriptions, to be quite like a world with aconsciousness like our own representing it. The arrangement of things may bedifferent—the continents may be fused together as one, the seasons may have beenunlike our own, volcanoes may have fumed incessantly and earthquakes rockedcontinuously. But all of this is still fundamentally the kind of world we wouldhave seen had we been there to see it. Except we weren't. No one was. Therewere, according to science, no human beings alive at the time. Hence there wasno human consciousness around to represent the particles of which the world atthat time, just like our own world, was made. There were no senses. No touch, nosmell, no hearing, no taste, no sight. And yet, science insists that the“prehistoric world” was just like our own world. There were different animals,and different plants, and the landscape was different. But it was a solid,objective, independent, three-dimensional external world, just like our own.But if the solid, objective world that we see is a representation of the “reallyreal” particles of which it is made, then how, given there was no consciousnesslike our own around to represent it, could such a solid, objective world haveexisted in “prehistoric times”? And by “prehistoric” I mean a time much earlierthan those discussed in the last section. We might want to say instead“prehuman” or “preconscious,” even “preorganic.” We know that, in the case of arainbow, if there were no sunshine, no raindrops, or no human consciousness,there would be no rainbow. In the case of a solid, three-dimensional world,there is only one necessary ingredient: human consciousness. As there was nohuman consciousness in prehistoric times, the conclusion seems to be that therecouldn't have been a solid, three-dimensional world either. There may have been“unrepresented” particles, but we have no idea, and can have no idea, what theymay have looked like, because for them to look like anything they would have tohave been represented, which they were not. The situation is, admittedly,baffling, but the poet William Blake summed it up two centuries ago: Where manis not, he wrote, nature is barren.6 [../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-6]All of this strikes us as difficult to grasp, but we must remember that allBarfield has done is follow some of science's dictums to their logicalconclusion. If what “really” exists are elementary particles, and if the worldwe see is a representation of those particles created by our consciousness, thena world without that consciousness would not be so represented. Imagine a worldthat was all rainbow. Then subtract one of its necessary ingredients. That isthe world before human consciousness.This being the case, what follows from it is highly suggestive. One thing itsuggests is that we need to distinguish, as Kant did, between a world “initself,” what Barfield calls the “unrepresented,” and a represented worldrelative to our consciousness, what he calls the “phenomenal world.” And this,as has been pointed out, is a crucial difference. If “we have chosen to form apicture, based very largely on modern physical science, of a phenomenal earthexisting for millions of years before the appearance of consciousness,” and ifthat “same physical science tells us that the phenomenal world is correlative toconsciousness,” then clearly our ideas about how that phenomenal world evolvedneed to be reexamined. For one thing, it follows from this that “the periodduring which the phenomenal earth has been evolving is probably much shorterthan is now generally assumed.”7 [../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-7] This indeed isa radical idea, and one that has hardly been taken up by contemporaryevolutionists. But what is even more radical is the fundamental shift thatBarfield's argument effects in our understanding of the relation between theworld and human consciousness. Barfield argues that, as we have seen, thehistory of language suggests that at an earlier time consciousness“participated” in the world and was not, as it is now, a kind of ghost, hoveringabove it. We will return to this part of his argument shortly. This loss ofparticipation happened over time, and it is only in our relatively recent“modern” period—the period since Descartes split the world in two—that it hasreached its end point of complete separation. It was not too long after thisthat human beings began to investigate the phenomenal world—created by their ownconsciousness—for answers to questions about their own origin, putting the cartbefore the horse in as fundamental a way as possible. (This “material world,”divorced from the consciousness that creates it, is the “idol” in the subtitleof Barfield's book.) This, Barfield suggests, is a pity becauseif the impulse to construe as process the record of the rocks and the vestigesof creation apparent in the natural order had come either a little earlier,before participation had faded, or a little later, when the iconoclasm implicitin physical analysis . . . had really begun to work, man might have read therethe story of the coming into being, pari passu, of his world and his ownconsciousness.This is so because “it is only necessary to take the first feeble steps towardsa renewal of participation . . . in order to see that the actual evolution ofthe earth we know must have been at the same time an evolution ofconsciousness.”8 [../Text/part0040.html#c19-FN-8]The world we see, Barfield is saying, is the way it is because our consciousnessis the way it is. If our consciousness were different, the world would be too."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE TAPESTRY OF NATUREThe history of language is important, Owen Barfield argues, because it reveals aconsciousness and a world unlike our own. In our world, consciousness isconsidered to be firmly located in our head, “produced” by the chemical andelectrical exchanges of a three-pound mass of organic matter called the brain.But this was not always held to be the case. The ancient Egyptians, we haveseen, spoke of an “intelligence of the heart” and located the seat ofconsciousness there. The priests who performed mummification were careful topreserve the heart and other internal organs, but cared little about the brain,drawing it out in pieces through the nostrils and discarding it. The Greekslikewise placed consciousness in a different part of the body than we do,locating it in the diaphragm, what they called the phrenes. From this we getwords like “frenzy,” to be out of one's mind, and the discreditednineteenth-century science of “phrenology,” the study of mental characteristicsthrough analyzing bumps on the skull. Aristotle, the first empirical“scientist,” did not think much of the brain, believing its main purpose to be akind of “cooling system” for the blood.Scientists today may argue that all this shows is that our ancestors had somevery bad ideas. Barfield argues that it tells us more than this: it tells usthat people of an earlier time saw the world in a way radically different fromthe way we see it. And if this is so, then it is possible that the figurativecharacter of older language may not be the result of a generation of ancientpoets spinning out reams of metaphors. It may have been that the world itselfwas more alive then, and that the poets were only communicating what theysaw—although perhaps this use of “seeing” is itself a metaphor more appropriatefor our own Cartesian age, which emphasizes the distance between consciousnessand the world and likes to keep the world at arm's length. Our ancestors'experience may have been much more visceral, much more of a felt contact betweentheir inside and the world's.Our own modern, and by now postmodern, alienation, the abstraction from theworld that we all take for granted, is at least partially rooted in the rise ofperspective and the radically different experience of space that generated. Wewill return to this in a later chapter, when we discuss the work of Jean Gebser;for now it is useful to point out that in earlier times something as basic andas unquestioningly accepted as our actual physical place in the world—not oursocial or economic standing, but our location as a physical object—was not thesame as we experience today. When I leave my room and go “outside,” I have a dimsense of a kind of open “space” stretching out to the horizon, and I move withinthat space as a kind of independent point. But, Barfield suggests, this sense ofour spatial environment, which we take for granted as “given,” was not alwaysthe case and is a product of our having grown up in a Cartesian/Newtonianworldview. However, “before the scientific revolution the world was more like agarment men wore about them than a stage on which they moved.” Compared with us,independent points moving about on a Cartesian grid of other independentmaterial objects, the people of that time “felt themselves and the objectsaround them and the words that expressed those objects, immersed together insomething like a clear lake of—what shall we say?—of ‘meaning,’ if you choose.”1[../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-1] They were somehow “blended into” theirenvironment—although they would never have used as abstract a word as that forthe world they were immersed in. They were part of “nature,” figures in itsliving tapestry, and not, like us, hard, independent atoms that rattle aroundwith everything else in a kind of open-ended box.In a fascinating chapter entitled “Medieval Environment” in Saving theAppearances, Barfield attempts to convey what a world that consciousness stillparticipated in would have been like. It is of course too long to quote in full,but some extracts will give an idea of what he means. He asks us to placeourselves inside the skin of the “medieval man in the street.” If we look at thesky,We do not see it as an empty space. . . . If it is daytime, we see the airfilled with light proceeding from a living sun, rather as our own flesh isfilled with blood proceeding from a living heart. If it is night-time, we do notmerely see a plain, homogenous vault pricked with separate points of light, buta regional qualitative sky, from which first of all the different sections ofthe great zodiacal belt, and secondly the planets and the moon (each of which isembedded in its own revolving crystal sphere) are raying down their complexinfluences upon the earth. . . . We take it for granted that those invisiblespheres are giving forth an inaudible music. . . . We know very well thatgrowing things are specially beholden to the moon, that gold and silver drawtheir virtue from sun and moon respectively, copper from Venus, iron from Mars,lead from Saturn. And that our own health and temperament are joined byinvisible threads to these heavenly bodies we are looking at. We probably do notspend any time thinking about these extrasensory links between ourselves and thephenomena. We merely take them for granted.2 [../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-2]Looking at the sea, Barfield goes on, medieval people saw one of the fourelements, Water. They knew that it, along with Fire, Air, and Earth, had aninvisible aspect, which they experienced in their own selves as the “humours”making up their temperament. Through them they were linked to the stars as well,since the signs of the Zodiac were each linked to one of the elements. If theysaw a stone fall to the ground, it did not do so because of some mysterious“occult” force called “gravity,” but because it desired to be in its rightfulplace. Their world in general was a much more living world than ours, a world inwhich they were microcosms within a macrocosm, with each different part ofthemselves linked to the macrocosm in a very specific way. They did not, as wedo, feel isolated from their “environment.” They were, as Barfield comments, notlike islands, as we are, but much more like embryos.3[../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-3]One clear indication that the medieval consciousness was much more participatorythan ours is the practice of alchemy. Clearly, a great deal of alchemy wasmerely a futile attempt to create actual physical gold, but as any student ofits history or practice knows, this was not the heart of the discipline. As C.G. Jung was to rediscover centuries later, a central theme of alchemy was theunion of the alchemist's mind with the material being worked on. Although, as wehave seen, Schwaller rejected Jung's interpretation, and many modern historiansand practicing alchemists believe Jung put too much emphasis on thepsychological aspect, it is impossible, I think, to spend much time studyingaccounts of alchemy without coming away believing that the key to thismysterious practice was precisely some form of the participatory consciousnessBarfield is speaking of. The central sense that comes from studying the bafflingwritings and diagrams that have come down to us from the alchemists is that theysaw the world as a living, active entity and not, as we do, as dead, neutralstuff. They didn't manipulate matter, as we do, but sought to arrive at someinteraction, or better still, communion with it. All the long, complicated, and,to our mind, tedious and pointless preparations and distillations were not“science” as we know it, but a means of bringing mind and matter into someequilibrium, of creating some medium of communication between the two, or,perhaps, of enhancing and perfecting the communication that already existed.Alchemy, as one maxim ran, “speeds up” the processes of nature. And that the aimof this “speeding up” was not merely to create riches is clear from anotheralchemical maxim, Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi, tam ethice quam physice:“Our gold is not the common gold, as much moral as material.” It is difficultfor us to conceive of gold, or any other material, as having a “moral” aspect,but this was something quite clear to the alchemists. And that the alchemiststhemselves were involved in the alchemical changes—were, perhaps, the centralgoal of those changes—is clear in a saying attributed to the alchemist GerhardDorn: “Transform yourselves into living philosophical stones.” We are remindedhere of Schwaller's dictum, “Tumble with the rock which falls from the mountain.Seek light and rejoice with the rosebud about to open.”This “communication” between the world and the mind was, of course, not limitedto the alchemists. It was inherent in the Hermetic tradition that they drew onand added to. It is, as mentioned earlier, at the heart of all “occult” views ofreality. “The secret that lies at the heart of the occult view,” writes MorrisBerman, “is that the world is sensual at its core; that is the essence ofreality. . . . When the Indian does a rain dance, for example, he is notassuming an automatic response. . . . He is inviting the clouds to join him, torespond to the invocation.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-4] And the notion ofan Indian rainmaker “inviting the clouds” to join him in his dance suggests thatwhat is at the heart of the occult worldview is a kind of mimesis, an “actinglike,” which is clearly a form of metaphor. We see the same idea at work inmagical cave art, in different forms of sympathetic magic, and even in forms ofhealing such as homeopathy. At bottom, each of these examples, as well as manyothers, say the same thing: that the human mind does not exist in isolation fromthe world, but is linked to it in ways few of us are aware of.At this point we should make clear that the reason we are unaware of the linksbetween our consciousness and the world is that these are formed and operatemostly unconsciously.5 [../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-5] We do not, as I'mcertain many readers have already said to themselves, go around saying, “Hmm,all right. I think I'll represent that bunch of particles as a tree, and thatbunch as a mountain.” We do not “participate” with the conscious part of ourminds. Much of “New Age” philosophy amounts to the saying “Create your ownreality,” but it is not as simple as that. I cannot suddenly turn my bedroominto the Grand Canyon, or even a doorknob into gold, simply by saying, “My mindcreates reality, so c'mon now, change!” What I can do is become aware of theunconscious processes involved in participation. What is different now abouthuman consciousness is not that it no longer participates in the world, but thatwe are no longer aware of that participation. Human consciousness has risen outof its earlier state of intimacy with the world and now sees it as somethingcompletely cut off from itself, rather as if a novelist forgot that he or shewas the creator of the people and scenes depicted and saw them as totallyindependent, and yet somehow went on writing the novel unconsciously. (Or,better still, it is like what we all experience when we dream: we are immersedin the adventures our minds create, yet are unaware of ourselves as theircreator.)Earlier human beings were not so much aware of the processes of participation asof the “participated world” itself, a world with living elements, naturespirits, gods, and all the rest. They felt themselves a part of the world, withan intimacy we probably only feel, aside from mystical experiences, in ourchildhood and, if we are lucky, when in love. This is why Barfield says it ispointless to ask questions about the origin of language, which to him is likeasking about the “origin of origin.” Language didn't come about as a way toimitate, master, or explain nature, as is generally assumed, because “nature” aswe understand it did not exist until language did. To Barfield the polaritiesmind/world and language/nature are a result of a splitting up of “originalparticipation.” To understand language, Barfield tells us, we must imagineourselves back to a stage at which human consciousness hadn't yet separated fromits unconscious background. At that point there was no “nature” and no“consciousness,” but the kind of cosmic intimacy Erich Neumann calls “uroboric.”Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Although this intimacy seems desirable to us in the isolated twenty-firstcentury, it also had its drawbacks. An inhabitant of Çatal Hüyük might not havefelt the kinds of psychic pressures that a postmodern Londoner does, but asMorris Berman remarked, “To be constantly immersed in Great Mother consciousnessis hardly the best state the psyche can be in.”6[../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-6] For consciousness to grow, her psychic apronstrings had to be cut. Even in more recent times, that sense of connection tothe cosmos we find enviable in the medieval mind could not last. A figure on atapestry, no matter how beautiful it may be, is fixed. The same “closeness” thatembraced medieval men and women, and held their ancestors even more firmly, alsolimited their freedom. Like Rudolf Steiner, Barfield argues that, howeverregrettable, the loosening of our consciousness from what he calls originalparticipation was necessary for human beings to become free, independentindividuals, capable of returning consciously to a state of participation. Inother words, the development of the ego, even in as radical a form as Cartesianscepticism, was necessary. However much we may daydream of how pleasant it mayhave been to live in medieval times, and however much we may pine the loss ofthe paradise of the Garden, it is our destiny to break free of these earlierforms of participation and to become fully aware of our own contribution to thephenomenal world.It is important that we do this, and not only for the possibility of enjoying arare and, as Barfield discovered from his study of poetry, psychicallynourishing experience. To be sure, as I can say from my own experience, theshock of feeling one's inner world to be directly and intimately linked to theouter one is vitalizing, to say the least. And, to a certain extent, we allexperience something of this sort already: anyone who has been baffled by acuriously apt synchronicity knows there is more to our relation with the worldthan what the science that denies these experiences suggests. Absorbed in abook, a film, or a piece of music, our mind stretches out beyond its normalconfines, its fixation on the here and now, and “participates” with deepermeanings and relations, becoming aware of, as Colin Wilson phrases it, “othertimes and places.” Becoming more attuned to these moments is a practice that canenhance both our psychic and physical health, as, contra Descartes, we now knowthere is no absolute boundary between the two. But Barfield suggests that oncewe become aware of our role in representing the world, a responsibility isincumbent upon us, a responsibility, I would say, of the imagination. We have toremember that Barfield is not saying, “It's all in the mind.” We do not “createreality.” There clearly is a reality “outside” us. What we do create is ourrepresentation of it, and it is to this we are responsible. It has become quitecommon in our postmodern time to think that “reality” is up for grabs, and theattitude engendered by this thought has been, on the whole, a kind of frivolouscynicism. If reality can be anything we want it to be—and that is the message ofthe new cybertechnology—then it can't be anything that important. This createsthe “been there, done that, got the T-shirt” jadedness in which everything,regardless of its degree of significance, is made simply image, simply surface,as there is no longer any depth. (It is curious that both postmodernism and NewAge philosophy have battened onto the “create your own reality” ideal with equalsuperficiality.)Yet Barfield, writing decades before either the New Age or the rise of thecyberworld, makes our responsibility for the phenomenal world the pivot of hisinsights into participation. “If the appearances are, as I have sought toestablish, correlative to human consciousness, and if human consciousness doesnot remain unchanged but evolves, then the future of the appearances, that is,of nature herself must indeed depend on the directions which that evolutiontakes.”7 [../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-7] This quotation requires a secondreading. If, as we have argued, our minds are responsible for the phenomenalworld, for trees as much as for rainbows, and if, as Barfield hasshown—successfully, I think—our minds evolve, with the corollary that they areevolving still, then the fate of the phenomenal world, of which “nature” ispart, is not only in our hands, but in our minds. We can be “environmentallycorrect,” Barfield is saying, not just through such useful and necessarypractices as recycling, purchasing organic food, avoiding waste, protecting theozone layer, and saving the rain forests—all of which are important ways we canfufill, as Rudolf Steiner called it, our “responsibility to the Earth”; neitherI nor Barfield is saying that we can or should avoid this side of ourresponsibility. But he is saying that we have a perhaps deeper, more immediateresponsibility. One of the most baffling as well as suggestive things RudolfSteiner said was that the future physical body of the Earth will be determinedby the kinds of thoughts people think now, just as the physical Earth we knowtoday has been shaped by the thoughts of the past. This is the kind of remarkthat leads people with a superficial knowledge of Steiner to believe he wassimply a crank, but given what Barfield has made clear about the relationshipbetween the mind and the phenomenal world, it makes a profound and troublingsense. As both Steiner and Barfield argue, the evolution of consciousness hasbeen from an immersion in the world to, with us, a complete separation from it,in order for us to experience freedom. Where earlier humankind participatedunconsciously, we now have the possibility and responsibility to do soconsciously. As Barfield wrote, “The future of the phenomenal world can nolonger be regarded as entirely independent of man's volition.”8[../Text/part0040.html#c20-FN-8]To me, this suggests that we need to become aware of both the unconsciousprocesses involved in participation and of the effect our imagination may haveon the world. Nature-oriented individuals may bristle at Barfield's claim thatnature herself is a representation, formed by the mind. Indeed, some radicalecologically minded people claim that since humankind itself is responsible fordespoiling the planet, the Earth would be better off without us. While I in noway condone the rampant exploitation and abuse this planet has been subjectedto, I do think that in many ways such sentiments share the same “idolatry” asthe very technology that they hold responsible for the problems. They see afair, “pure” nature that would exist without human beings, and envision in theirown way a “prehuman” Golden Age before the arrival of us unthinking despoilers.Again, we do have a responsibility for taking care of the Earth, just as we havea responsibility for taking care of our children. But we don't believe—at leastI don't—that our children would be fairer or purer or better off if we were notaround.In many ways, that vision of a Golden Age of an “untouched” Earth is a productof human imagination. Nature is as much erupting volcanoes and colliding starsas it is peaceful meadows and flowing brooks. And, as Barfield points out, thewhole idea of “nature” as we now appreciate it is very much a product of theminds of the Romantic poets he loved to read. In the eighteenth century, naturewas a thing either to avoid or to control. On his celebrated trip to Scotland,Samuel Johnson famously complained about all the mountains and lakes hiscarriage had to go around; and the idea of a garden then was of a well-sculptedtopiary. Our place was in civilization, not the wilderness, “The proper study ofman is man” was the accepted wisdom. It wasn't until the next century and theshift in consciousness known as the Romantic movement, which we will be lookingat shortly, that nature wild and free became something to be sought out andappreciated. Again, I am not saying that trees and hills and clouds and streamsdid not exist; of course they did. But they were not for the people of that timewhat they have become for us—symbols of a kind of unconstrained freedom and lostinnocence, slipping by now, it seems, into guilt. The fact that people today paylarge sums and make great efforts to get to places that people of two centuriesago would have assiduously avoided, says something about the influence of thehuman mind on what we call “nature.”In a very real sense, nature as we understand it did not come into being until1798, when William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge published theirLyrical Ballads. Of course there were others: Rousseau, for example, and Goethe.But it was Wordsworth and Coleridge who brought the actual presence of“nature”—Wordsworth's “unknown modes of being” and his “impulse from a vernalwood”—close to the common person. Coleridge had a profound influence onBarfield's thought, equal, probably, to that of Steiner, and it is clear thatColeridge had “participation” in mind when, thinking of our relation to nature,he wrote in “Ode to Dejection,” “We receive but what we give / And in our lifealone does Nature live.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THINKING ABOUT THINKING: JURIJ MOSKVITIN AND THE ANTHROSPHEREWhen Barfield impresses on us our responsibility for the future of thephenomenal world, he has in mind not only the way we “see” nature, but also theway we “represent” it. He has a useful terminology to describe the processesinvolved in participation. He speaks of “figuration,” “alpha-thinking” and“beta-thinking.” Figuration is the actual process of representation, oftransforming raindrops and sunshine into a rainbow, and elementary particlesinto a tree. It takes place unconsciously. Alpha-thinking is the kind ofthinking that we all engage in, and that scientists do to a much more acute anddisciplined degree. It is, as Barfield puts it, “thinking about” ourrepresentations, taking them, as it were, at face value as independent,objective “things” in a wholly external world. All technology, all theachievements and advances of science are made possible by this kind of thinking,but it completely ignores, or, more to the point, is unaware of, thecontribution of our minds to what it is “thinking about.” Our thinking about atree, botany, agriculture, ecology, and so on, until we get to physics andelementary particles, are all examples of alpha-thinking.Beta-thinking is something else. It is thinking about the representations asrepresentations, thinking about how our minds form the objects of the phenomenalworld. Thinking, that is, about thinking itself, as Rudolf Steiner did inIntuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path: A Philosophy of Freedom. It is this kindof thinking Barfield has in mind when he speaks of a “renewal” of participation.It is this kind of thinking that watches the unconscious at work. It is as muchan imagining and a watching as a thinking.We have already seen some examples of this in our discussion of hypnagogia. Oneof the clearest examples I know comes from a little-known work I mentioned in myintroduction, Essay on the Origin of Thought by the Danish philosopher JurijMoskvitin. Moskvitin's aim in writing his book is to explore what he calls theAnthroposphere. What Moskvitin means by this unusual name is the world createdby human consciousness, and for him this includes everything from cave paintingsto the theory of relativity. Although it is clear that the Anthroposphere existswithin or parallel to the world of nature, a reader of Moskvitin's book soongrasps his basic insight: we all live in a world that is much more “human” than“natural.” From the minute we awake, we are all in an immediate contact with aworld created by human effort, which has its roots in the human mind.Practically everything around us, from can openers to cars to the computer I amusing to write this book, as well as the language I am writing it in, is part ofthe Anthroposphere.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-1]Now, this may not seem a particularly profound insight, and as it is not centralto our theme here, I will forgo elaborating it, at the risk of not doingMoskvitin's book justice. But what is important to our discussion is howMoskvitin arrived at his insight, because it brings him to the recognition—whichwe have already seen in Owen Barfield—that even what we call the “natural world”is a product of the human mind.Moskvitin believes that the ideas and insights that are the source of theAnthroposphere originate sporadically in the minds of a few individuals, andthat the results of these are then copied by the rest of humankind. “Thequalities that we consider . . . particularly human and by which we differ fromthe other animals—i.e. our capacity for memory, reflection, and imagination—arenot naturally the property of all men, nor due exclusively to the influence fromthe social environment, but . . . are derivatives of some particular and rarefunction, the effects of which are spreading in society and apportioned amongall men by means of a principal of imitation.” Given this, his book is an“attempt to trace the roots of language and civilization to the region ofhallucinatory experience, dependent on mechanisms innate in the psyche andphysis of man.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-2]This indeed seems like very deep water, but a simple example can show whatMoskvitin means by a “principle of imitation.” Many of us drive cars, but notall of us invented the internal combustion engine. The same is true oftelevision, writing, algebra, or the practice of meditation. Someone, at somepoint, was the first to see the significance of these things. Whenever I want tocook a meal, I don't have to rediscover fire, nor do I have to reinvent thewheel each time I'm in the mood for a bicycle ride. Someone else has alreadydone this, and I profit from his or her insight by “imitating” the initialdiscovery. And as the value of one discovery can be appreciated by many people,there are fewer “discoverers” than there are “appreciators.” Not all of us havewritten the Jupiter Symphony. Mozart did. But we all can enjoy it.What is striking about Moskvitin's idea is that he traces the roots of humancreativity to, as he says, “the region of hallucinatory experience.” We havealready seen how important hallucinations were to Julian Jaynes's ideas aboutconsciousness, as well as their role in hypnagogic experience. Moskvitin alsosees them as crucial; they are, as I have quoted him saying above, responsiblefor language and civilization itself. He argues that the great creators andinventors of the Anthroposphere were individuals who, under some form of psychicstress, managed to release powerful imaginative forces from deep within themind. He calls these experiences “mutative points in the evolution ofcivilization,” and they are to him “the reactions of men exposed to conditionsthat bring about the collapse of their normal psychical setup, forcing the mind. . . to retreat from a position of externally directed attention and backtowards a state of mirroring its own inner recesses.”3[../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-3]The result of this experience, which could as easily lead to madness as tocreative insight, might be an important discovery, or a work of art, or a newreligion or vision of human society.4 [../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-4] Moskvitinranges over history, finding impressive examples to support his thesis, citingindividuals as distinctive as the Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus, the poetWilliam Blake, and Nietzsche, as well as Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and RudolfSteiner. It was perhaps these references to “occult” thinkers that mademainstream critics shy away from the book; it appears to have been published tono notice whatsoever. I first read it in 1984; ten years later, I had anopportunity to write an article on Moskvitin, and checked the book out of thesame university library to refresh my memory. In the decade that had elapsed, noone else had taken it out; the bookmarks I had left behind were still in place.Moskvitin calls these imaginative forces “selective forms,” and he came upon hisidea after observing these processes at work. His book, he says, is the outcomeof a long period in which he found himself drawn to meditating not so much onwhat he thought, but on how he thought. “I began to realize,” he writes, “thatbehind much of our intellectual activity . . . lie mental processes to which wenormally do not have access, but which are nevertheless prior to andindispensable for any kind of intellectual activity.”5[../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-5] In other words, Moskvitin accidentally hit upona method of engaging in what Barfield calls “beta-thinking,” and the experienceled to a perception of the mechanisms of “figuration.” Moskvitin's experienceled him to believe that this focusing on the mind's own activity is the traitcommon to all creators of the Anthroposphere.As I mention in the introduction, Moskvitin found himself quite by accident in aposition in which he was able to observe the mechanisms of perception. Havingonce achieved this by chance, he set out to do it consciously, which led to somepeculiar insights. For example, one of the first things he discovered was thatwhat he felt to be “himself” and his thoughts, that is, his rational, consciousego, was actually the thing to be observed—which raises questions of who thenwas doing the observing? The effort required to maintain this observationproduced a sensation of pleasure and a surge of unusual thoughts. Another thingit produced was an awareness of a kind of “film” or “screen” or “mosaic” withthe “most strange and beautiful patterns,” which seemed spread across his fieldof vision. This mosaic would appear in the hypnagogic states that hisobservations produced, “states of mind when consciousness is kept somewherehalfway between the waking state and dream.” As I write in the introduction,Moskvitin then became aware of a strange phenomenon. He began to see curioussparks and smokelike forms, which “upon close and intense observation became theelements of waking dreams, forming persons, landscapes, strange mathematicalforms.” (These sparks and smokelike forms bear a remarkable similarity to thepatterns and traces formed by the recorded movement of electrons and othersubatomic particles.) The sparks, Moskvitin writes, reminded him of “the tips ofwaves glittering in the sun,” which on prolonged observation appeared to be“strange rings and nets moving swiftly over the waves.”6[../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-6]As I mention in the introduction, Moskvitin became aware of perceiving oddgeometric patterns, which he associated with religious art or the kind ofvisions common to mystical experience—triangles, crosses, squares, and otherornamental shapes.7 [../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-7] Over time, these patternsseemed to assume three-dimensional forms and, as he writes, were projected ontothe “external” world by the eye itself. The sparks, smokelike forms, glitteringrings, and nets that he observed appeared to Moskvitin to be actually buildingup that “external” world, and he compared the experience to the effect of apointillist painting. Observed close up, the work of a painter like Signac, forexample, seems a chaos of dots and patches of color, but when we step away andsee it from a distance, we recognize it as a still life or landscape. The mindorders the riot of colors and random shapes into a pattern, and Moskvitin wasobserving this process at its most fundamental level. We can also compare theprocess to what happens when we look at what are called Rorschach blots,shapeless blobs of ink used in psychological tests, onto which the mind projectspatterns.It may seem difficult to accept that the world we see is a kind of cosmicRorschach test, but it is easy to observe our own “pattern making” propensity inaction. We all remember how, as children, we saw pictures in the clouds floatingoverhead, how one looked like a bird, another perhaps a face. Earlier I quotedthe novelist John Cowper Powys on children's “power of arriving at boundlesseffects through insignificant means.” This is so because children have yet tolearn that there is some impassable barrier between themselves and the world:they, it, and their mind still form a whole. Powys himself displayed apowerfully “participatory” mind, able in his novels to enter the consciousnessof animals, plants, even stones and old, crumbling walls, as well as planets andstars. He often writes from the point of view of an old, abandoned fence post,or of algae on a pond. Another novelist also keenly aware of this ability toproject consciousness into the world “outside” was Hermann Hesse. In Demian,Hesse's hero, Emil Sinclair, is taught by his mentor, the musician-magicianPistorius, to observe the strange patterns and faces his unconscious projectsonto a fire. Hesse's novel is a kind of fictional account of what Jung called“the individuation process,” and the aim of Pistorius's teaching is to show theyoung Sinclair that there is a whole world inside him that he is unaware of. Itis an example of what Jung called “active imagination,” which is basically akind of controlled hypnagogia. It is also an initiation into an awareness of howmuch our own minds participate in the world we see.Moskvitin takes this awareness a step further. It is not only that we projectpatterns onto natural “chaotic” forms, like flames, clouds, flowing water, or,as Leonardo da Vinci famously did, stains or cracks on a wall. Moskvitin, likeBarfield, is saying that we “project” the phenomenal world itself. Moskvitincame to see that there was no fundamental difference between the patterns and“waking dreams” he was observing and the so-called real world. Both are, as itwere, made up of the same “stuff.” The only difference is that in dreams,visions, hypnagogia, and other “altered states,” the pattern-making power of themind is not constrained by the information coming to it through the senses.As we have seen, Rudolfo Llinas and Denis Pare, two of the key people working onthe brain today, are in complete agreement with Moskvitin—although it isdoubtful they, or anyone else working in the field, has ever heard of him. Yetthe agreement is striking. Llinas and Pare argue that the only differencebetween dreaming and waking is that while we are awake the closed system thatgenerates the brain's oscillatory states—the synchronous firing of neurons—ismodulated by incoming stimuli from the outside world. When we dream (and we mustassume this includes hypnagogia and other forms of nonwaking consciousness aswell), that “closed system” is free of these stimuli and is then not limited inthe kind of mental experience it can create. Moskvitin's wording is different,but in all essentials the insight is identical: “If we remember that theessential difference between what we call the real world and the world ofimagination and hallucination is not the elements of which we build them up butthe sequence in which these elements appear . . . then it follows that thesequences directed from without represent a limitation of the otherwiseunlimited combinations of the selective forms released at random from within.”8[../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-8] Both Moskvitin's and Llinas and Pares's workcan be seen as confirmation of Barfield's aphorism that “interior is anterior.”Our inner world of dreams and visions comes before the outer one of sensorystimuli. The poets have always known this.This is as radical a departure from the tabula rasa picture of the mind that hasdominated “scientific” psychology for the last three centuries as we can get.For that view of our mental worlds, we are all, as John Locke said, “blankslates,” until written upon by stimuli from the outside world. What Llinas andPare have concluded through neurological research, and what Moskvitin arrived atthrough introspection and observation decades earlier, is that this picture isuntrue. We are not empty CDs, waiting for experience to make its mark on us.Philosophers like Plato, novelists like Hesse, psychologists like Jung, and theentire hermetic and occult tradition of the West have been saying the exactopposite of this. In a very real sense, we are microcosms, containing an entireworld within our psyches, a world in many ways much richer than the “real world”we are taught to gauge our possibilities by. For the scientific view of themind, dreams, visions, hypnagogic experiences, and the like are so much mentalrubbish, relegated to the psychic dustbin. It is the external waking world thatcounts, and our insides, if they are allowed at all, are merely a kind ofreflection of what takes place “out there.” This strict rationalist-mechanisticview of the human mind, which sees us as little more than automatons pushed andpulled by outside forces, and which has profoundly influenced not onlypsychology and philosophy, but Western politics for the last three centuries, isquite simply wrong. As Colin Wilson, one of the few influential thinkers to havecome across Moskvitin's book, sums up its insights, “The external world that oureyes reveal to us is just a limited version of the larger inner world.”9[../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-9]Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Moskvitin knew that if we follow this insight to its logical conclusion, theconsequences are profound. Perhaps most disturbing is the change it effects inour attitude toward reality. Poets and artists from the Romantic movement to ourown day have always felt that the “real world” is somehow not as real as itseems. They have always been moved by sudden glimpses of “another world,” onenot constrained by the limitations of space and time and the dull resistance ofmatter. As we have seen, Ouspensky's Tertium Organum is only one of a canon ofworks arguing for the preeminence of mind over matter. That “this world” of thesenses is maya, illusion, and that beneath its hard surface lies a living,vital, magical world, is a belief common to all mystical and occultphilosophies. Moskvitin knows this, and in his experience of the selectiveforms, he believes he has hit on the key to understanding this perennial belief.“All sensations recorded in literature of the ‘unreality' of this world,” hewrites, all notions “that there is a ‘painted veil' before our eyes preventingus from seeing things as they really are, all the metaphors that we are blindand that we may awake refer to such experiences of the actual composition of thephenomenal world, of how our senses are glued to something of which we can knowonly what it calls up in ourselves.”10 [../Text/part0040.html#c21-FN-10]If this is the case, then the world we see when we open our eyes is, as AndreasMavromatis suggested, as much a “dream” as the visions we see when we areasleep. And if this is so, it certainly is suggestive that our relationship tothese different but similar “dreams” is practically the same. In our dreams weare unaware that we are the creator of our strange nightly visions andadventures.Yet the same is true of the world we see each day. I may not be the creator ofthe “unrepresented” particles of which the material world is supposedly made,but I certainly am the creator of my representation of those particles, just asI am the creator of the rainbow I see during a rain shower. And just as I mayoccasionally dream that I am dreaming—have, that is, a “lucid dream”—andexperience a sudden sense of power and expanded consciousness, so too in mywaking state, I may occasionally recognize that I am the author of themarvellous world I see around me, and experience a radically differentrelationship to that world.For one thing, I may become briefly aware of my mind as an active power, andnot, as it usually appears to me, a passive reflection of the “real world.”Anyone who has experienced lucid dreaming and has learned how to control it tosome extent knows the feeling. In his chapter on dreams in A New Model of theUniverse, Ouspensky writes of his experiments in changing and altering hisdreams, and speaks of discovering a “hidden artist” in his unconscious mind;other writers have recorded the same sensation. But the same can be true of our“waking state.” Artists and writers know the difference between the times whenthey are intensely focused on a work, and the times when they are not. We knowthe difference between the times when we feel bored and listless, wheneverything seems drab and uninteresting, and those other times when our mindscatch fire from some fascinating idea or absorbing story. If we can observeourselves during those moments, I believe we will recognize that a good part ofour delight comes from the fact that we have remembered that our minds areactive and living—or at least are supposed to be. And it is moments like thisthat are the strongest arguments against the Cartesian “mirror” theory ofknowledge, much more than any epistemological conundrum. No mirror reaches outand “grabs” the world or sets off a chain reaction in itself when one ideatriggers another and then another. No mirror goes out of its way to find new andunusual things to reflect. And no mirror contains more than the image of what isbefore it. To paraphrase Bergson, we can say that if the mind is a mirror, thenit is one that has the curious power of showing more than it reflects: it is amirror that can produce its own images; it is not merely a blank, shiny surface,waiting for something to stand in front of it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE BLACK HOLE OF CONSCIOUSNESSRecognizing the active character of the mind led Jurij Moskvitin to one of hismost profound insights, which we might call the “black hole” theory ofconsciousness. It has some similarities to the famous “undecidable” theoremproposed by the mathematician Kurt Gödel. Simply put, Gödel showed that in anyrigidly logical mathematical system, there are propositions that cannot bevalidated—proved or disproved—on the basis of the axioms within that system. Tobe proved or disproved, such propositions would have to refer to somethingoutside the system. There were, Gödel proposed, no absolutely closed systems.There is always something in the system that points to what is beyond it. In thesimplest instance we can readily see that we cannot, say, use logic to validatelogic, because to do so we would have to assume the validity of what we aretrying to validate. The axioms of logic cannot prove themselves.Moskvitin says something similar about the relation of the mind to itself and tothe universe, and what he says seems a strong argument against there ever beingan explanation of consciousness in strictly materialist terms. He begins with asimple observation. If the phenomenal world, the world we perceive through oursenses is, as he, Barfield, and others argue, relative to our consciousness,then we must think of it more in terms of being our world, our universe, thanthe world, the universe. What we call reality, he writes, “is not necessarilythe whole universe, for the simple reason that it is limited by the human organsof perception. . . . There is not the slightest reason why our universe shouldbe the entire universe.”1 [../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-1] We can only know ofthe world what we can grasp of it through our means of perception, and so whatwe know of the world is shot through and through with elements of ourselves.Different means of perception, like a different consciousness, might reveal adifferent world. Nearly two centuries before Moskvitin wrote his book, WilliamBlake had the same insight. “How do you know but every bird that cuts the airyway, is an immense world of delight, closed to your senses five?” he asked.“Our world,” then, for Moskvitin, is a slice of a totality to which we can neverhave full access. And since our world is only a part of this totality, formed byour organs of perception, it is pointless to look for the origin of that worldin its own elements. This would be like looking for the author of a novel in thenovel itself, or the painter of a picture in the picture itself, or the dreamerof a dream in the dream itself. The “origin” of our world lies outside thatworld, just as the author of a book lies outside the book. This is not to saythat we can't look for the origin and causes of elements within that world, justas we can look within a story for the motivation of its characters. This, ineffect, is what science does. But the world itself, like the story itself,cannot be explained by its constituents, just as Gödel showed that propositionsin a logical system cannot be proven by the axioms of that system. Anyexplanation must refer to something outside. And if this applies to “our world”as a whole, it also applies to ourselves. As Moskvitin writes, “It is absurd . .. to look for an absolute cause, a source, of our existence in a world theappearance of which depends on the existence of a spectator which is exactlyourselves. . . . What is perceived can never be the perceiver.” A flashlight cannever shine on itself; it can illuminate everything but its own source of light.The attempt to illuminate itself can only lead to an infinite regress. “We shallhave an infinite series of increasingly subtle attempts to grasp the essentialprinciple in ourselves, but the ultimate point is beyond our Tantalic grasp—theego is transcendental. An unknown point will remain forever, and just as thereis a blind spot in the eye at the point where all the retinal tissues areuniting into a mainline leading to the brain, there is a blind spot in themind.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-2]It is through this “blind spot”—or black hole, as I call it—that we areconnected to what Moskvitin calls the “absolute universe.” “The thing thatcreated us, our cause . . . cannot possibly be contained in the slice that liesbefore our eyes. . . . The true cause must be something more complete than theselection made by our organs of perception.”3 [../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-3]Beyond “our world” lies another world, the totality, the world of what Ouspenskycalled “the miraculous.” Mystics, occultists, and metaphysicians have given itan assortment of other names: Gnostics speak of the Pleroma, Kabbalists of theAin Soph, Neoplatonists of the One. Each, however, speaks of the same thing.Scientists, Moskvitin points out, will not be happy with this observation,because they want to get at the source of “the real world,” which they believeis the world they see, and pin it down once and for all. But they cannot do thisbecause, “There will forever remain an unknown zone of ultimate causation,created by, and coinciding with that in ourselves that will forever remainunknown—the blind spot in the mind.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-4] In otherwords, there is some part of us that is not part of the phenomenal world, and itis this unknown part that is itself the cause of the phenomenal world. And sincethat is the case, the unknown part cannot be explained in terms of thephenomenal world of which it is the creator.The aptness of Gödel's theorem to our own relation to the world will be clear inthis last quotation from Moskvitin:A mind looking into a world external to itself will receive a picture of a worldin which there are some phenomena that cannot be explained in terms of the lawsgenerally ruling in that world. The reason is that a mind—any mind—is creatingits world by means of a process of selection. The thing that will be missing inthat world . . . is the law governing the total system because the mind is apart of the total system, and what it cannot perceive is itself. . . . The worldas we see it is determined by the structure of what to us appears as itssmallest components. To move deeper in this direction is to change the world.. . . [T]he total system of which the point (consciousness) is itself an elementwill forever remain unknown to the point. It is itself governed by a system ofwhich it can never grasp the totality. . . . Fully to grasp and understand whatit is in itself would be to grasp the totality. Therefore there will in itselfforever remain something unknown, and so there will remain something unknown inthe world that it perceives as external to itself. That unknown will appear aslife. The increasing approach to the unknown—the blind spot in itself—is thecreation of life itself.5 [../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-5]It is curious that Moskvitin says that to “move deeper” than the “smallestcomponents” of “our world” would be to change that world. This seems to besaying that the mind can alter reality itself. Over a century of documentationconcerning the reality of the “paranormal” seems to corroborate this suggestion,and anyone willing to investigate the material will find sufficient evidence forthe belief that in repeated cases the mind has clearly exerted a power over, orexceeded the constraints of, matter. Several good histories of the paranormalexist, and it would be pointless to repeat their findings here. In my ownexperience the clearest and most convincing evidence has been in the form ofprecognitive dreams and synchronicities, too exact and meaningful to beexplained by coincidence—which, in any case, explains nothing at all.6[../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-6] But more immediate than the possibility of the“hidden powers of the mind” are the potentials of our unconscious power of“figuration,” which we are considering here. This strikes me as immenselyimportant, and it is this Barfield is concerned about when he speaks of a“responsibility of the imagination.”If our unconscious minds are the creators of the phenomenal world, then itcertainly seems incumbent upon us to understand just what our unconscious mindsare about. And in order to do this, before anything else we would have to becomeaware of the reality of our unconscious minds. Certainly, the phrase “theunconscious” has been around for decades and is a part of our common vocabulary,but the fact that a part of our minds is not under our conscious control, andthat it plays a very large part in determining our lives, is still somethingpeople talk about more than actually grasp. We speak glibly about Oedipuscomplexes and archetypes, and there are reams of books on every aspect ofpsychoanalysis, dream interpretation, hypnotherapy, and whatnot. But we aretalking here about something deeper than our personal unconscious, that basementfull of childhood traumas and antisocial appetites.In the 1950s there was a science fiction film called Forbidden Planet, anintelligent adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest, set on another world. Ascientist, who lives alone on the planet with his beautiful daughter, hasdiscovered the remains of an ancient super-race, part of which is a machinecapable of amplifying the powers of the mind a hundredfold. When an expeditionsent to check up on the scientist's research arrives, he resents theirintrusion, as well as the attention the crew gives his desirable daughter.Curiously, the arrival of the expedition coincides with the strange appearanceof a mysterious invisible creature, a monster of enormous strength and ferocity.Several crewmembers are killed and much equipment destroyed before it becomesclear that the monster is a creation of the scientist's unconscious mind,amplified by his experiments with the super-race's “brain machine.” Along withthe amplification of his intellect and powers of reason, there has been an equalamplification of his dark, irrational urges. Resentful of the invasion on hisprivacy and jealous of the young crewmembers, he has unknowingly called forth amonster to fufill his secret wishes.7 [../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-7]We are all, I would say, in the same position as the scientist in ForbiddenPlanet. We all have to become aware of how much our own minds are responsiblefor the world around us. And this means becoming aware of how much our ownimagination is involved in shaping the world we see. We have already seen howthe imagination of poets like Wordsworth and Coleridge helped create the idea wehave of “nature” today. This doesn't mean we should all become poets, but itdoes mean that if we wish to become aware of participation as a living reality,we will have to make a particular kind of effort. As Barfield writes,“Participation as an actual experience is only to be won today by specialexertion; . . .it is a matter, not of theorizing, but of imagination.”8[../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-8] We have seen some examples of this “specialexertion” in Goethe and in Moskvitin's observation of the selective forms.But, Barfield warns, simply “imagining” more is not enough. He points out thatalthough since the Romantic movement the imagination has been considered a“good” in itself, this is not really the case. It can equally be “bad.” For ageneration held back by the rationalist mentality of the Enlightenment, anunfettered imagination would understandably seem an unquestioned good. But suchconstraints have long been broken, and for years now there has been little checkon the creations of the human mind. It is also true that even a cursory glanceat the products of the imagination over the last two centuries will reveal anincreasing obsession with the dark side of the mind.When Barfield was writing he had in mind the efforts of the Surrealists. He wasconcerned that with the accelerated rate of evolution, the kind of world theirwild obsessions depicted might move from their paintings onto the larger canvascalled “real life.” As the changes that have taken place in merely the lastthree hundred years show, the transformation of the human mind, and hence, ofits “representations,” has speeded up, and Barfield was concerned about whatthis meant for the future. The Surrealists were, of course, interested in theworkings of the unconscious, and some, like André Breton and Robert Desnos,explored the curious world of hypnagogia. But the Surrealists, like the psychicsand mediums of the nineteenth century, believed that any product of theimagination—or the “spirit world”—was by definition “good,” and that anyconscious control or inhibition was “bad.” This led to the paranoid landscapesof Salvador Dali, as well as the now highly unreadable reams of Surrealistautomatic writing. Barfield knew that much of the Surrealist aesthetic was mereaffectation, but he also knew that some was not, and those for whom it wasgenuine, he argued, must actually see the world in that way. Half a centuryearlier, Arthur Rimbaud, the “bad boy” of Symbolist poetry, threw himself into asystematic “derangement of the senses” in order to escape the confines of“bourgeois” normality. Many followed him, and a history of the imagination sincethe mid–nineteenth century could be seen as a history of our deepening obsessionwith the bizarre, gruesome, and inhuman. By the 1930s, Rimbaud's systematicderangement was the height of fashion, and it has since gone on to be adopted byadvertising. The “pictures of a dog with six legs emerging from a vegetablemarrow or a woman with a motorbicycle substituted for her left breast” thatconcerned Barfield are now casually absorbed, along with much worse, by theconsuming public through a variety of means.9 [../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-9]And, as Barfield said, those who appreciate these kinds of images are willing tomake the effort to see the world in that way. Eventually, over time, they willsee such a world, and, if Moskvitin's “imitation” theory of evolution iscorrect, so will many others. Today, with the formidable movie industry and ourability to “morph” reality or to create it “virtually,” the wedding ofunfettered imagination and technology can result in something like Star Trek's“holodeck,” which our hunger for raw sensation and aesthetic shock will use tofashion environments like William S. Burroughs's Naked Lunch. If this is thecase, then Barfield's warning about our moving into a “fantastically hideousworld” may prove uncomfortably timely. If the imagination of poets can transforminconvenient piles of stone and earth into beautiful mountains, it can alsotransform everyday reality into a kind of waking nightmare. And as the“bourgeois” public has been taught for decades to accept the visions of the“avant-garde,” however unsettling, as the work of genius, the process oftransformation may not take too long to complete.10[../Text/part0040.html#c22-FN-10]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]OTHER TIMES AND PLACESAnother thinker concerned with the imagination, whose name has already come upseveral times, is Colin Wilson. Wilson first came to prominence in 1956, when hewas only twenty-four, with the publication of his first book, The Outsider. Itwas an immediate bestseller, and the impecunious Wilson, who had written thebook at the British Library, while spending his nights in a sleeping bag onHampstead Heath, became famous overnight. Fame, however, is fickle, and Wilsonsoon discovered that his notoriety had more to do with an erroneous associationwith the Angry Young Men—writers like John Osborne and Kingsley Amis—than withthe existential ideas at the core of his book. Within six months, he wasroutinely attacked in the press and has since remained an aptly “outsider”figure himself, never quite accepted by the British literary establishment. (Thesame was true of Owen Barfield, whose books always sold better in the UnitedStates.)This has had little effect on Wilson's work, and over nearly half a century hehas built up one of the most stimulating and wide-ranging oeuvres in Westernliterature, producing well over a hundred books on subjects as diverse asphilosophy, psychology, criminology, sexual deviance, parapsychology, andliterary criticism, as well as several novels in science fiction, mystery, andother genres.As practically all of Wilson's work is related to understanding the mechanismsof consciousness, it is difficult to single out a particular book as the key tohis ideas. For readers unfamiliar with his work, The Outsider surely is the bookto begin with. Poetry and Mysticism, mentioned earlier, is a good briefintroduction to some of his main ideas.1 [../Text/part0040.html#c23-FN-1]Wilson began his exploration of human consciousness at the same place OwenBarfield did, with the Romantics of the nineteenth century. But his startingpoint was different. Like Barfield, Wilson recognized that with the Romantics ashift had occurred in human consciousness. What had happened, he argued, wasthat suddenly the human mind discovered the powers of the imagination. Ofcourse, people had been aware of this curious ability to focus on what Wilsoncalls “other times and places” ever since they first sat around a campfire andheard tales of a distant Golden Age, or stories of battle and adventure. Ifimagination is the ability to focus on “realities not present,” then clearlyhuman beings had been doing this for millennia before the Romantics. Butsomething happened toward the end of the eighteenth century that transformed thehuman imagination so radically, that it was as if it had discovered a completelynew power. The difference is like that between a horse-drawn cart and a sportscar. Both have wheels and are used for transportation, but the resemblance endsthere. The imagination as it began to appear in the second half of theeighteenth century was like a mental Ferrari. Or, perhaps more to the point,like a rocket ship.There had of course been myths, fairy tales, and stories of gods and goddessesprior to the Romantics, as well as tales of adventures and quests, but thesewere always tied to very well defined ideas about our place in the world. Therewas a “great chain of being,” and we were only one link in it, a relativelysmall one. The Romantics rattled that chain, broke it, and blasted off for otherworlds. However the space they travelled through was not that of the rotatingcelestial spheres, but the more mysterious one of their own minds.With the Romantics, dreams, visions, ecstasies, and wild flights of theimagination became the themes of a new consciousness. Perhaps the most famous“dream poem” in English literature is Coleridge's “Kubla Khan,” but it is onlyone example of a new fascination with the “dark side” of the mind and thestrange workings of the unconscious and the irrational. The Romantics discoveredthat there was more to human beings than the “daylight” rational picture of themthat had emerged in the Enlightenment. There was a whole “other world” insidetheir own mind, a world that the shallow, rationalist Enlightenment pictureignored or suppressed. The Romantics had discovered an entirely unsuspecteduniverse, a new dimension of reality, and had taught their readers how toexplore it.Curiously, Wilson argues that the first of these “mental travellers”—the phraseis Blake's—was a middle-aged printer named Samuel Richardson. Richardson wascommissioned to write a book, a sort of do-it-yourself course in correspondence,but he became so involved in his work that he got carried away and ended upwriting an immense novel about the attempted seduction of a servant girl by hermaster. Pamela appeared in 1740 and overnight became the first “bestseller,” inour sense of the term. And although there had been earlier books that we can seeas either novels or the forerunners of novels—like Don Quixote and RobinsonCrusoe—Pamela was the first that readers today would recognize as a novel.Richardson's novel, and his second, even larger work, Clarissa, are not inthemselves concerned with the new powers of the mind, or with any of the themesthat would obsess the Romantics. Both are, in essence, thegreat-great-grandmothers of the soap opera. The story of Pamela's unsuccessfulseduction—she safeguards her virginity until she forces her pursuer to marryher—is drawn out and full of so many coincidences and improbable situations thattoday's readers, use to plentiful and highly graphic sex, find it difficult tounderstand what all the fuss is about. But for the readers of 1740, it was arevelation. We have to remember that the world of easily accessibleentertainment—books, films, television, CDs, the Internet—that all of us takefor granted is a very recent development. It was only little more than a centuryago that anything like a popular market for reading emerged. In Richardson'stime, practically the only reading material available outside of the cities wasthe Bible or the weekly sermon. Most people lived lives of inconceivableboredom, and for many the only form of imaginative release from the drudgery ofexistence was drink. Readers familiar with Hogarth's etchings of Gin Alley knowhow swiftly that coarse intoxicant filled a hunger among the poorer classes.Wilson argues that Pamela and the other novels that emerged in its wake werelike a new kind of drug, but one without the horrific side effects of gin. Thestory kept readers interested—like all good novelists, Richardson instilled thatitch to “see what happens.” But aside from the mild titillation of sex, whatreally attracted Richardson's readers was the sense of having stepped out of theconfines of their lives. For a few hours, bored housewives all over Englandcould transport themselves into another world, Pamela's, and forget their owncares and woes. It was, as Wilson writes, “a magic carpet,” and soon all ofEurope was taking magic carpet rides.2 [../Text/part0040.html#c23-FN-2]Richardson, in effect, had created a new addiction, what the poet and essayistWilliam Anderson later dubbed “bibliomania.”The consequences were as important as Wordsworth's and Coleridge's invention of“nature.” What Richardson discovered was that human beings can “take trips”without moving out of their room, an insight that, like many adolescents, Idiscovered pouring over paperbacks of science fiction and fantasy in my room inthe late 1960s and early 1970s. In the Tao Te Ching, Lao Tse says, “Withoutgoing out of my door, I can know all things on earth. Without going out of mywindow, I can know the ways of heaven,” and in many ways Richardson's inventionof the novel was a practical application of this deep truth. Richardson taughtthe mind how to fly, and soon the writers and poets who came after him used thispower to explore other things besides the seduction of a virtuous servant girl.The mind was no longer chained to the earth; it had spread its wings and theeffect was staggering. Having tasted of this new power, human beings began tofeel a deep dissatisfaction with the “everyday” world. As Wilson writes, oneresult of this dissatisfaction was the French Revolution, many of whose leadersfueled their revolt through reading Rousseau, whose New Heloise, another novelof seduction, outsold Pamela, and Friedrich Schiller, whose play The Robbers wasperhaps the first in a long literary tradition in which the criminal, theoutcast of society, is the hero.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c23-FN-3] What washappening was that human beings were discovering their own strengths, a secretpower they were unaware of, and were recognizing that they might be somethingmore than “only human” after all. They might, it seemed, be something more likegods. The whole “occult revival” of the nineteenth century, typified by figureslike Eliphas Levi and Madame Blavatsky, was one result of this insight.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]But, as Wilson points out, the Romantics soon discovered they were gods inexile. They discovered that their flights of imagination, their magic carpetrides, did not last. They would be transfigured by some ecstasy, theirimagination soaring beyond the highest heaven, and then—they fell to earth.Coarse reality gripped them by the throat and cut their wings. Or theydiscovered that prolonged adventures in the “other world” left them unfit forthe “real world.” They became pathetic, ineffectual dreamers, cast ashore in ahard, inhospitable land. Many of them died alcoholics or drug addicts. Coleridgehimself had an enormous laudanum habit, as did De Quincey; both lost much oftheir creative powers in their later years, and Coleridge was famous foraccepting advances on the strength of outlines of tremendous works he wouldnever write. E. T. A. Hoffmann, whom Wilson cites as the quintessential figureof the time, drank himself to death. The Romantics came to believe that theirvisions and dreams were only that, “imagination” in the negative sense, and thatthe real world of drudgery and boredom was the truth. Like children faced withsome task they are unequal to, they sank to their knees and cried. (This was whyBarfield called his collection of essays on Steiner's philosophy RomanticismCome of Age; he believed that with Steiner the Romantic insights had “grownup.”) After an initial explosion of creative fire, the Romantic volcano burntout, and the generations that followed, like the Symbolists and decadents of thefin de siècle, increasingly withdrew from life and its challenges. As Wilson hasoften quoted, the hero of Villiers de L'Isle-Adam's play Axel summed up the lateRomantic philosophy of life: “As for living, our servants can do that for us.”Wilson was obsessed by this tragic quality of the Romantics and the poets andartists who followed them. Why did so many of the Romantics and other greatartists and thinkers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries either go mad,commit suicide or die prematurely? The list is impressive: Nietzsche, Hölderlin,Maupassant, Ibsen, Nijinsky, Strindberg, van Gogh, and many others: all eitherdied insane, committed suicide, or suffered severe periods of madness. Each ofthese thinkers was faced with the question of Ultimate Yes or Ultimate No, andeach, in different ways, answered in the negative. What drove these “Outsiders”over the edge? And, more importantly, could something have saved them?In his novel The Mind Parasites, Wilson uses the metaphor of a strange race ofpsychic vampires hidden in the human mind, who have been feeding on it forcenturies, as a way of explaining this cultural phenomenon. No one has everdreamed of their existence, and for ages they have lived off human vitality. Butin the Romantics, the parasites recognized a threat. Through them the humanrace, they saw, was becoming too aware of its own potentials, and would soonrealize the existence of the mental vermin who sap their energy. The parasitesare the cause of, in William James's phrase, our “habit of inferiority to ourtrue selves,” and it is in their best interest that we never discover who wereally are. If we did, we would throw them off as easily as we do the commoncold. And so the parasites decide to wipe out the Romantics and most of theartists and thinkers who followed them, sending waves of despair and depressionthroughout the Zeitgeist of the nineteenth century. The effect is devastating,and the optimism about our infinite potentials, which blossomed with the firstRomantics, withers and dies, leaving behind the pessimism of Kafka, Beckett,and, by now, today's postmodernists.Wilson's metaphor is, of course, only that, but it is a powerful and insightfulone. In the novel, the mind parasites are eventually defeated by a band ofscientists and philosophers who have learned how to control their consciousness,using methods developed by Edmund Husserl, the father of the philosophicalschool known as phenomenology. Husserl's basic insight, and the one that is atthe heart of Wilson's thought, is that perception is intentional. This isessentially another way of talking about the participatory nature ofconsciousness. Husserl was another philosopher dissatisfied with Descartes'account of the mind, and the mirror theory of knowledge. Rather than simplyreflect the outside world, Husserl argued that consciousness reaches out andgrabs it. Or, using another image, it is as if consciousness was a kind of gun,firing at its target. Both metaphors express the essential active nature ofconsciousness; they also suggest that consciousness may sometimes “miss.” Wedon't always hold onto what we reach out for, and not everyone is a marksman.Wilson recognized that the failure of the Romantics, as well as that of theexistentialists who followed them, was in this active quality of the mind. Theproblem with both, he believed, was that they shared an essentially passiveattitude to the world.One thinker associated with the late nineteenth century, however, did not. InNietzsche Wilson saw the will to health and vitality that is the key toanswering affirmatively the Outsider's question of Ultimate Yes or Ultimate No.It is true that Nietzsche died insane, and that throughout his life he waswracked by headaches, dyspepsia, and loneliness. By any common standard, helived a thoroughly wretched life, moving from pension to pension in a futileattempt to find the right climate to aid his faltering health. But it wasprecisely his sickness that led Nietzsche to his deepest insight: that beyondthe rational intellect there exists a tremendous, vital will to live, anoverpowering appetite for life that transcended critical reason. In his periodsof recuperation, Nietzsche felt this will rising up in him and, as we have seen,it led him to his vision of the Übermensch, the superman. Nietzsche, for all hissupposed atheism, was a deeply spiritual man, and given to what have to becalled “mystical experiences.” But in his case, these were not visions of God orof other deities, but profound insights into this tremendous will to live, intowhat he called the “Dionysian.” During one of these “peak experiences”—to use aphrase from Abraham Maslow, one of the thinkers of stature who recognized theimportance of Wilson's ideas—Nietzsche had his vision of “eternal recurrence.”When the idea came to him he spoke of being “six thousand feet above men andtime.”Wilson asked a simple question: Which was true, a vision like Nietzsche's andthe dozens of other examples he collected, or the despair and ennui of theRomantics and existentialists? He concluded that the mystical experience oftotal affirmation—which could be found in writers like Blake, Dostoyevsky,Goethe, Rilke, and many others—was true, because in such moments consciousnesshas increased its intentionality, its power of reaching out and grabbing theworld, and in doing so has become aware both of its own hidden strength and ofthe objective meaning inherent in the world.This, Wilson saw, is the basic problem of human consciousness. Because we assumethat consciousness is simply a passive reflection of the world, we fail to graspits real function, to act as a kind of laser beam cutting into reality to revealits meaning. By “meaning” Wilson does not mean any kind of rational argument orexplanation, but precisely the same kind of insights that Barfield experiencedwhen he read his favorite poets. Meaning of this kind is an immediate,unreflective appreciation, like that delicious sense of relief when we arethirsty and feel a cold drink going down our throats. It is essentially a senseof grabbing hold of reality. It communicates to us the insight that the world isinteresting, infinitely more interesting than we give it credit for being.Most of the time, however, we experience the world abstractly, as if a pane ofglass separated us from it, and only occasionally do we feel a real, vitalconnection: on a spring morning, perhaps, as Wilson suggests, or setting out ona holiday. What is dangerous about this is that because we can “see through” theglass, we rarely are aware of its existence and believe we really are “in touch”with the world, accepting our spring mornings as delightful and infrequentexceptions. Yet we aren't in touch with it at all; we go through most of ourlives never really “seeing” a flower or a blade of grass. The result is thatsome part of us slowly dies of a kind of “reality starvation.”Wilson has a handy concept to account for our separation from the world. Hecalls it “the robot.” The robot, he says, is that part of us that performsfunctions unconsciously. It is a kind of automatic pilot. The robot is a veryuseful and necessary tool, and the fact that we possess highly developed onesaccounts for our success as a species; other animals possess robots as well, butthey are not as efficient as ours (that's why you can't teach an old dog newtricks and why some species can't be taught any tricks at all). When we learnsome new skill like typing, driving a car, playing a musical instrument, orspeaking a foreign language, we first struggle with it consciously, painfullypracticing it step by step. But then one morning we awake and, miraculously, wecan do it. What has happened is that the new skill has passed from our consciousinto our unconscious mind. The virtue of this is that it allows our consciousmind to focus on something else. In computer-speak, the robot enables us to be“multitasking.” We all see people today driving with one hand while carrying ona telephone conversation. The robot does the driving, allowing them to focus onthe conversation, just as my robot is typing these words, freeing my consciousmind to focus on what I want to say. We can all think of other examples: apianist whose fingers command the keyboard and whose mind is concentrating oninterpreting the music, an actor who knows his part by heart and can focus ongiving it emotional depth. All of these are examples of Whitehead's observationthat civilization advances by making more and more of its functions unconscious,and so freeing up the conscious mind for new developments. The robot is alsoclearly linked to the philosopher Michael Polanyi's notion of “tacit knowing,”knowing how rather that knowing what. We can tacitly know how to do something,but be incapable of communicating our knowledge. Try telling someone how youride a bicycle. It's easy to show them how, but surprisingly difficult toexplain it in words. Without tacit knowing we would all be like infants. If Ihad to learn how to type every time I sat down to write, this book would neverbe finished.But there is a drawback to this. As Wilson points out, one problem with havingan efficient robot is that it can be too efficient and start taking over dutiesI would rather perform myself. It can begin to listen to a Bach fugue when Iwant to, with the result that I find it a bit dull. It can read a book when Iwant to, with the result that I don't absorb what “it” has read, and I have togo back. It can even make love to my girlfriend, with the result that I find theexperience oddly disappointing. Basically, when we approach life with ourhabitually passive attitude (James's “inferiority to our true selves”) we aresaying to our robot, “Go ahead and take care of this, it isn't important enoughfor me to attend to,” and the result is that sense of separation from life, ofnever really touching it, that plagues so many of us in the modern world. But asWilson points out, a sudden crisis or problem can awaken our urge to “takecontrol” and put the robot in the back seat. I may be driving quiteunconsciously, my conscious mind mulling over an argument or thinking about anarticle I have to write, when a car swerves in front of me. All of a sudden I amthere; a rush of adrenaline and “I” am driving, not the robot. And, as many ofus have noticed, for a short time afterward everything seems a bit more “there”as well. This is because I have taken over the driver's seat, literally in thiscase, from the robot and am putting my full attention into what is around me.And yet, unless another emergency demands this attention, I will unconsciouslyrelax, and hand the steering wheel back to the robot.This capacity of crisis to awaken our true will, Wilson observes, is behind theseemingly neurotic choices of many of his Outsiders, their drive, in Nietzsche'swords, to “live dangerously.” The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein inherited afortune from his industrialist father, but he gave this away and lived in nearpoverty in a small hut in a desolate part of Norway, in order to live more“authentically.” As an adolescent, the novelist Graham Greene suffered profoundperiods of boredom and depression that could only be lifted by playing Russianroulette. When Greene heard the hammer of his pistol hit on an empty chamber, heexperienced an overpowering vision of life's absolute value; the world thatbefore had bored him now appeared infinitely interesting. The philosopherJean-Paul Sartre said that he never felt as free as he did during World War IIwhen, as a member of the French Resistance, he was liable to be shot at anymoment. His philosophical mentor Heidegger had said that only a deep realizationof one's own mortality can instill in a person a true sense of “being,” aninsight that Gurdjieff agreed with.All of these examples, as well as the dozens of others Wilson has collected,succinctly drive home the point put by Dr. Johnson that the thought that onewill be hanged in a fortnight “concentrates the mind wonderfully.” Such aninsight is also behind the variety of techniques and embellishments many peopleemploy to “spice up” their sexual relations. A flagging erotic relationship canbe revitalized via a little S & M, or other “creative,” slightly dangerous, or“kinky” additions, like mirrors or role-playing. The aim of these, as well as“living dangerously,” is to get past the robot so that “you” are involved in theact. This is also the aim of other “dangerous” activities, from sports-carracing and mountain climbing to antisocial behavior like vandalism andshoplifting. The “thrill” each affords comes from “you” pushing the robot aside.Yet, as Wilson makes clear, these self-inflicted crises are slightly absurd. Thewhole point of civilization is to minimize crisis. We have struggled to get outof the caves in order to make life more convenient, not less. But, as Wilsonclearly saw, it is inconvenience that stimulates our will, while comfort andsecurity dull us and prompt the most sensitive and intelligent of us to seek outchallenges or, failing to find them, to create them ourselves. As Freud argued,there seems to be something inherently neurotic about civilization, so it is nowonder it produces so many “discontents.”Yet Wilson's answer to this is not to abandon civilization. If a “precivilized”state were preferable, surely we would never have bothered to climb down fromthe trees. Anyway, our immediate response to any kind of inconvenience is to tryto get rid of it—and this is the basic “shape” of the drive to civilization.Otherwise we would never come in out of the rain. This is also the argumentagainst attempts at “nonrobotic” consciousness that go about it from theopposite end, by putting the robot out of commission. The most obvious andeffective ways of doing this are drugs or alcohol. And, it has to be admitted,their initial effects are pleasurable. A glass of wine relaxes the robot's grip,and we suddenly recognize that the world is much more interesting and invitingthan we realized. Yet it is also true that overindulgence leads to profoundimpairment; the robot is so anesthetized that we can barely function at all. Thesame is true of other drugs. As Aldous Huxley famously said, gazing through thedoors of perception at a sink full of “beautiful” unwashed dishes, if everyonetook mescaline—as he had—there would be no wars, but there would be nocivilization either. Everyone would be too awash in cosmic consciousness to takecare of the business at hand.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Obviously there is some drive in us to bring order into our world, to gain somelevel of control over our environment. Yet once we have achieved this, we growweary of it, and seek out the very inconvenience we have just eliminated.Clearly there is some problem here, and it is directly linked to another curiousparadox of human psychology, our inability to appreciate freedom. Wilson notesthat one strange trait shared by practically all his Outsiders is that they allhave a passion for “freedom” and yet, upon achieving it, they all sink into aprofound state of boredom. And this happens because they have no idea what to dowith their freedom once they get it. We all experience something of this sort:we work all week and dream of what we will do with our weekend, yet when itarrives, the empty day yawns before us and we desperately seek something to fillit with, to, as the saying goes, “kill time,” anxious to return to our regularroutine. Gone are our plans to study German, listen to opera, finally work ourway through Tolstoy, or write that novel we've been dreaming of. Freedom, likethe removal of inconvenience, is something we crave yet paradoxically do notappreciate when we get it.Yet, contrary to the feeling of many who cast a wistful eye at some idyllic dawnage, it is not civilization or the modern world that is at fault; the problem isthat we have failed to understand how our consciousness works. Wilson recognizedthat the attraction of inconvenience and living dangerously is not in the actualproblems or challenges they present, but in the focus and concentration we bringto bear on meeting them. Heidegger and Gurdjieff hit the nail on the head whenthey said that the thought of one's death can lead to an experience of“being”—the thought, not the actual confrontation. Wilson grasped that one'smind, one's imagination, can serve the same purpose as an actual danger. Andthis, in fact, is the function of imagination: to focus the mind on realitiesthat are not at the moment present. We do this every time we think of what wewill do later in the day, or next week, or on next year's vacation. And oncethis is grasped, one realizes that the solution to “nonrobotic” consciousnesslies in strengthening the power of the mind itself, not in imagining dangers. Amind sufficiently capable of “pulling itself together” at will would no longerneed the trigger of some imaginary challenge, which in any case would soon loseits power of evoking our will. Like all “external” methods, danger can easilylose its charm, just as other means of stimulating the imagination do. This canbe easily seen in sex: pornography, kinky fetishes, and erotic fantasies soonlose their power to stimulate, and the jaded palate seeks stronger and strongerdevices to stir its appetite, just as a drug addict needs stronger and strongerdoses to get the desired effect. Yet a saturation point is reached, and anyonewho has ploughed through the Marquis de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom knows itarrives fairly early on.But there is no limit to the mental concentration we can develop, as long as wegrasp that this is what is necessary and resolve to put our full will into thework. Sex, danger, challenge are all means of avoiding our critical, rationalconscious mind and reaching into our unconscious vital reserves—the level ofwhat Barfield calls “figuration” and Moskvitin the “selective forms.” Wilsonrecognized the need to tap these reserves through the conscious mind itself. Themind, he saw, has the uncanny power of stimulating itself. As Bergson said, ithas the power to draw from itself more than it contains."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]FACULTY XOne of the powers the mind can draw from itself, Wilson discovered, is a strangeability to transcend time and space, what he calls “Faculty X,” the curiousability to grasp the reality of “other times and places.” Wilson firstformulated this idea in The Occult, and it has since been a central theme in allhis writing. Along with the notion of the Outsider, it is perhaps his mostimportant contribution to a philosophy of the evolution of consciousness.We have already seen one example of this in our discussion of Bergson: Proust'sfamous madeleine. But there are many others. One that Wilson has offered in manyof his books is that of the historian Arnold Toynbee. In his classic work AStudy of History, Toynbee recounts how he was sitting at the ruins of thecitadel of Mistra in Greece, meditating on the battle that had taken place therein 1821, which had left the site devastated. As he sank deep into his thoughts,he experienced a “time slip”: it was as if he could actually see the battlebefore his eyes. On another occasion he had a similar experience outside theBritish Museum, in which he seemed to see the whole of human history pass beforehis eyes in a kind of parade—not too dissimilar, we can see, to what we haveheard about the Akashic Record. Examples like these fill the pages of The Occultand also its sequel, Mysteries.Wilson also offers somewhat more startling evidence of our strange power to bein “two places at once.” Recounting some very radical forms of the“duo-consciousness” we have discussed in this book, Wilson documents someextraordinary cases of what the nineteenth-century psychic researcher F. W. H.Myers called “phantasms of the living”: the appearance of the “double” of anindividual while the physical body is elsewhere. Relating how the novelist JohnCowper Powys “appeared” one evening in the Manhattan apartment of his friend andfellow novelist Theodore Dreiser, while at the same time Powys was sitting inhis cottage in upstate New York, Wilson writes:We take it for granted that we live in a “solid” world of space and time,advancing from moment to moment according to unchangeable laws, and that we arestuck in the place that we happen to be at the moment. We are, in a sense,“trapped.” We feel this particularly strongly when we are bored ormiserable—that we are helplessly at the mercy of this physical world into whichwe happen to have been born. Yet these odd experiences all seem to show thatthis is untrue. The “real you” is not trapped in space and time. With a certainkind of effort of will, it can rise above space and time and be “elsewhere.”1[../Text/part0040.html#c24-FN-1]One curious thing about this “time slip” is that, although Powys had predictedto Dreiser that he would “appear” before him that evening, when Dreiser laterasked how he did it, Powys declined to answer. And the most probable reason,Wilson believes, is that Powys did not know. Yet, as readers of his novels know,Powys possessed a powerful imagination, and in his extraordinary Autobiographyhe admits to a fascination with magic and occult powers, admitting that hebelieved he possessed them himself. It is highly likely that Powys “thought”himself into Dreiser's apartment through some unusual feat of concentration.Another writer who shared Powys's fascination with the occult, to the extent ofbecoming for a period a practicing alchemist, was the playwright AugustStrindberg; he, too, experienced on several occasions the eerie phenomenon of“dislocation,” of transcending the normal limitations of time and space. AndGoethe, another poet with an interest in the occult, had this strange power ofbeing able to “project” his “double.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c24-FN-2]Wilson is clearly fascinated with these and other “paranormal” abilities, but heis more concerned with understanding the mechanisms of “everyday” consciousness.And a little reflection shows that we experience some form of duo-consciousnesspractically every day. In a certain sense you, as you read this book, are in“two places at once.” You are in whatever physical surroundings you happen tooccupy, but if I am doing my job correctly and have interested you in theseideas, you also occupy the world of thought and imagination, the “elsewhere”that Wilson mentions above. What happens when I take a book from my shelf, andset off on a trip on Samuel Richardson's magic carpet? I open it, flip throughthe pages, and idly glance at a paragraph or two, not really reading but justskimming the surface. Then something catches my eye—if it is a book of history,say a description of ancient Athens. I focus more intently on the page and sinkback in my chair with the intent to read through the section. A minute passes,then two. I'm interested. I forget the solid world I happen to be in andsuddenly, the landscape has changed. The walls of my room have disappeared andin their place I am hovering somewhere outside space and time. Now, if I amrelaxed enough and can muster the concentration, something strange may happen. Aparticularly well-written passage may trigger it, or I may not be able to linkit to any specific cause, but I will suddenly be aware that these events reallyhappened. There isn't another way to put it; our language breaks down when wetry to define the difference between “knowing” and “really knowing,” but itexists nevertheless. What has happened is that I have been catapulted centuriesback in time, to, say, the trial of Socrates, and I realize that these eventsactually took place. They aren't just words, a collection of facts, bare data.They are real.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]No animal, as far as we know, can experience this. Animals can't even experiencethe most rudimentary form of being in two places at once, something millions ofpeople do each night when they watch television. If no one plays with it andnothing else arouses its attention, a cat will stare into space and eventuallyfall asleep. Compared to it, the viewers of the worst sitcom are virtualProusts. Years ago a popular book advised its readers to “be here now.” Allanimals follow that sage recommendation. But it is clear that when most humanbeings find themselves in a physical space that does not demand their attention,the first thing they do is look for something to occupy themselves besides thefour walls. They look, that is, for a mental space to occupy, an imaginative“here and now,” which might be thousands of miles away, centuries in the past.Wilson believes that the reason human beings crave imaginative experience—a“mental space”—is that we possess two brains. (Readers will recall ourdiscussion of the split brain in chapter 17.) “My own belief is that we have twobrains,” Wilson writes,so we can be in two places at the same time. Human beings are supposed to becapable of being in two places at the same time. Yet we have not quitediscovered the “trick.” When we do, we shall be a completely different kind ofcreature—no longer the same kind of human being who lives out his life soincompetently on this long suffering planet, but something far more powerful andpurposeful.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c24-FN-3]In books like Frankenstein's Castle(1980) and Access to Inner Worlds (1983),Wilson spells out his reasons for why our “dual brain” allows us to experienceduo-consciousness. Fundamentally it is for the same reason that Schwallerrecognized in Egyptian hieroglyphics an expression of a “simultaneity ofopposite states.” As we have seen, the left-brain “scientist” focuses on theisolated “fact,” while the right-brain “artist” absorbs pattern and “meaning.”Usually the two are in conflict, and in our own fast-paced, highly outer-worldoriented culture, the left brain is dominant, with the result that we “scan” theworld, picking out the “facts” and absorbing little “meaning”: we see a lot oftrees but rarely the forest. Yet, in those infrequent moments when the twobrains work together—either at times of deep relaxation or when the right brain,which moves slower than the left, is “speeded up” through interest orexcitement—reality suddenly acquires an additional dimension. It becomesthree-dimensional and not, as we usually see it, flat, abstract, and dull. Inother words, when the two brains work together, the robot is temporarily shutoff and we are in touch with full reality. That is why events we read of in anovel often seem paradoxically more real than those in “real life” and why weourselves seem to occupy that imaginative world with an almost hallucinatoryintensity. It is because we are allowing the right brain to supply theadditional dimension. Wilson calls this process “completing,” and at its mostbasic level it is how we “make sense” of the world, linking its disparateelements into a comprehensible whole, what contemporary neuroscientists call the“binding problem.”Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Wilson believes that when we master the “trick” of being in two places at once,of stepping out of time and space, the human race will have made an evolutionaryleap. Strangely he sees other evidence for a major shift in human consciousnessin an area most of us would consider fertile soil for the exact opposite: thedark world of crime. Earlier I mentioned the humanist psychologist AbrahamMaslow, who is most famous for his notion of the “peak experience.” Peakexperiences, according to Maslow, are sudden bursts of “affirmationconsciousness,” and he believed they occur to most healthy, active people. Theyare a kind of psychological indicator that the individual is on the path of whatMaslow called “self-actualization,” a process of emotional and psychologicalmaturity similar to Jung's “individuation.” Wilson saw in Maslow's peakexperience a confirmation of his own ideas about consciousness, as well as acorroboration of his belief in the power of the mind to stimulate itself. Maslowbelieved peaks could not be created at will, but Wilson was intrigued by thefact that when Maslow got his students talking about their past peaks, theybegan to have more peaks more frequently. Obviously, simply thinking about peakexperiences could help trigger them, a step, at least, in the direction ofgenerating them at will.Wilson was also influenced by Maslow's idea of what he called “the hierarchy ofneeds.” Maslow believed that human needs are arranged in a kind of ladder, withthe most fundamental needs at the bottom, and “higher” needs at the top. Ourmost basic need, obviously, is for food. Then comes shelter, a home, some kindof “territory” that is our own. After this comes a need for love, sexualrelations, the family, and friends. Then comes the need for what Maslow calls“self-esteem,” to be known, recognized by your peers, appreciated by yourworkmates and friends. Maslow believed that as each lower need is met, the nexthigher need appears and makes its demands. So a starving person thinks only offood, but a homeless person with a full stomach pines for a little room, and soon.Maslow believed that these needs are all recognized by standard psychology andthat they are all what he termed “deficiency needs.” They are all prompted by alack of something: food, a home, sex, self-esteem. But he also believed that atthe top of the hierarchy, a different kind of need appears, one that is notrecognized by most orthodox psychologists. After the lower deficiency needs aremet, Maslow recognized that in some people—those he called “self-actualizers,”who tended to be a minority—a need for some form of creative expression becamedominant. This could take the form of artistic creation, or it could besomething as humble as a hobby—say a fascination with stamps. What characterizesthe “self-actualizing” need, Maslow argued, is that it doesn't depend onsomething outside the individual, but is rather an expression of the individualself. Essentially it is an absorption in some activity for its own sake, and notas a means to an end—to fulfilling a lack. It is a desire to do something well,to give form to the creative potential of the individual. When Samuel Richardsonbegan writing, it was because he needed money, but when he got carried away withPamela, it was because he became completely absorbed in it and was writing forthe sheer pleasure of creation. He was “self-actualizing.”Wilson realized that Maslow's self-actualization could be applied to a societyor civilization as a whole. With this in mind, he recognized a curious fact:researching a history of murder, he recognized a clear shift in the types ofmurders he was reading about. Early killings were straightforwardly about gain,and often for something as simple as food. There were, in fact, several cases inwhich the murderer cannibalized his victims. Then it seemed that most of themurders Wilson researched involved the murderers somehow protecting theirlifestyle, their homes and property. An embezzler would murder a businessassociate who had found him out, an adulterer would murder a mistress whothreatened to tell his wife, or a confidence man would murder a string of womenhe serially married and whose property he would inherit. Then, toward the end ofthe nineteenth century, a totally new kind of murder appeared: the sex crime,brought to morbid prominence through the courtesy of Jack the Ripper. TheVictorians who were shocked by the killings could not comprehend their motive;they spoke of “moral insanity” or saw them as a mad attack on “vice,” thevictims all being prostitutes. What they failed to see, because they had noprevious experience of it, was that the murders were a kind of sex act inthemselves, and that the Ripper, whoever he was, was driven by a powerful sexualcraving, which could only be satisfied through total dominance over his victims.(Sadly, what was new and unthinkable for the Victorians is now commonplace forus.) And in the twentieth century, another new kind of murder emerged: themurder for fame, for recognition, to “become known.” And toward the end of thattroubled century, yet another kind of killing appeared, what we call the“motiveless murder,” a kind of random, unpredictable spree that most of us lumpunder the name “serial killing.”Looking at this depressing survey of human inhumanity, Wilson was struck by asudden insight. The history of murder paralleled Maslow's hierarchy of needs.There it was: food, the home, sex, self-esteem. But where did that leave us? Hadwe entered the age of the self-actualizing murder, murder as a creative act?Wilson knew, of course, that murder—any sort of crime—and self-actualization aremutually exclusive. Crime, he believes, is essentially a kind of cheating, ashortcut, a choice taken by individuals too weak to actually work for the thingsthey desire. (Like Julian Jaynes, Wilson sees the roots of crime and cruelty inthe sudden development of left-brain consciousness.) Most of us who desirerecognition or love will take the necessary steps to get them. Criminals,however, don't have the patience or the maturity to do this and so try to “grab”what they want. And this is true not only of actual criminals, but of all weakpersonalities. Most of us stop short of actual violence, but in some cases theurge to fulfill these needs is so strong that a man will murder a celebrity inorder to get his name in the news, or rape a woman in order to have possessedher. But in each case, the shortcut that satisfied the criminals' needs ends updepriving them of both their freedom and the possibility of further development.No rapist can be seen as a self-actualizer.Wilson recognized that crime is a kind of Jungian shadow of society, anunfortunate but possibly unavoidable by-product of the evolution ofconsciousness. And the nightmares of motiveless murders suggests to him that,paradoxical as it may sound, we may be moving into a new stage of development.The obsession with fame and celebrity that characterizes our popular culture isanother sign that our society is moving up the ladder of Maslow's hierarchy.Forty years ago, sexual liberation was the battle cry. Today extramarital sex,nudity in films, homosexuality, lesbianism, and even sadomasochism are more orless accepted practices. In the 1960s, Andy Warhol famously said that in thefuture everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes. Now with television showslike Big Brother and countless talk shows where people clamor to reveal theirdark secrets, this prediction seems to be coming true. Is it possible that, forall its drawbacks, the New Age movement, with us now for some thirty years, isan indication that we are beginning to move from the self-esteem level to thatof self-actualization?It may seem perverse to point to something as dark as murder to indicate thatthe human race may be on the brink of a major mutation. Yet, as Alfred NorthWhitehead remarked, the ideas that advance civilization all but wreck thesociety in which they occur. In the next section we will look at the work ofanother thinker who believes humanity is in the midst of a massive shift in itsconsciousness. One that may destroy our current civilization or that, justperhaps, we may emerge from with a vision of hope and integrity for the future."},{"pageContent":"PART FIVEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE PRESENCE OF ORIGIN"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVEImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE ASCENT OF MOUNT VENTOUXSometime in the year 1336, the Italian poet Francesco Petrarca, known toposterity as Petrarch, did something that no one in history had done before: heclimbed a mountain to see the view.Obviously people before Petrarch had climbed mountains, but it was always forsome utilitarian reason. Hannibal crossed the Alps to attack Rome, and Mosesclimbed Mount Sinai to receive the word of the law from Jehovah. And thousands,maybe millions, of unnamed people before and since must have pushed their wayover inhospitable peaks for dozens of reasons—in search of food, to escapemarauding bandits, to discover fresh grazing land. But no one before Petrarchhad gone to the trouble of climbing an uninviting and dangerous summit simplyfor what we would call aesthetic reasons. At least we have no record of anyoneprior to Petrarch doing this.As we saw in the last section, as late as the eighteenth century the mountainsand other wild landscapes that today's vacationers seek out for pleasure andrelaxation were, if possible, rigorously avoided, and the idea of climbinganything more arduous than a hillock would have prompted a groan of complaintfrom Dr. Johnson and just about everyone else, until Wordsworth and Coleridgemade the pastime popular. It is difficult for us to grasp, but something as“obvious” to us as the enjoyment we receive from “taking in the view” of somescenic vista was, in Petrarch's time, utterly unknown. To put oneself at risk inorder to do so was considered madness, or worse. For some minds it was evenconsidered demonic.In a letter to the Augustinian professor of theology Francesco Dionigi di BorgoSan Sepolcro, the thirty-two-year-old Petrarch described his historic andunheard of outing. His choice was the formidable Mount Ventoux, an impressiveFrench peak located northeast of Avignon, where the Rhone River separates theFrench Alps from the Cevennes. Nearby is the principal mountain range of centralFrance, and the area around Mount Ventoux itself is rich in historical andesoteric significance. The Troubadours, the Albigensians, and the Cathars hadall thrived in this area, giving the landscape an affinity with Gnostic ideasabout the superiority of self-knowledge and experience over ignorance and blindfaith. Whether Petrarch had this in mind when he made his ascent is unknown, butit is clear from his account that he believed that in some way he hadtransgressed against the law, both of nature and of God. He knows that what hehas done has set him apart from other men. The idea of climbing the mountain hastroubled him for years, ever since he was a child; it was a kind of secret dreamthat disturbed his soul. Now that he has finally done it, he is terrified.“Yesterday,” Petrarch told his friend the professor, “I climbed the highestmountain of our region, motivated solely by the wish to experience its renownedheight. For many years this has been in my soul and, as you well know, I haveroamed this region since my childhood.” The mountain has always been in hissight, he tells the professor, and his desire had increased each day until itbecame so great that he decided to give way to it.With his brother Gerardo, who accompanied him, Petrarch met an old shepherd onthe way. When he informed the old man where they were headed, the shepherd “in atorrent of words, tried to dissuade us from the ascent, saying he had neverheard of anyone risking such a venture.” Petrarch ignored the old man'swarnings, although as they began to scale the height some foreboding must havecrept into his resolve. “While still climbing, I urged myself forward by thethought that what I experience today will surely benefit myself as well as manyothers who desire the blessed life.”It is clear from Petrarch's letter that when he finally reached the top heexperienced some sort of emotional and psychic shakeup. The letter becomesagitated; tenses shift, and the language takes on a disturbed character, as ifsimply the memory of his experience was enough to throw his consciousness intoconfusion and disarray. The “unaccustomed wind” swirls around him, and he andGerardo must hold themselves against its force. But more than the powerful wind,what frightens Petrarch with its sublime majesty is the hitherto unseen spacethat opens up around him. He is dazzled by the “wide, freely shifting vistas.”Their disturbing expanse shocks him and he is “immediately awestruck.”I look: the clouds lay beneath my feet. . . . I look toward Italy . . . and sighat the sight of the Italian sky. . . . Then I turn westward; in vain my eyesearches for the ridge of the Pyrenees, boundary between France and Spain. . . .To my right I see the mountains of Lyon, to the left the Mediterranean surfwashes against Marseille before it breaks on Aigues-Mortes. Though the distancewas considerable, we could see clearly; the Rhone itself lay beneath our gaze.And then, at that moment, Petrarch experiences what is for him a profoundsynchronicity. Gripped by the vision of space that stretches out before him,feeling—rightly, as we shall see—that he has stepped through a portal intoanother world, he looks for some support, and reaches for his copy ofAugustine's Confessions. Opening it at random, his eye falls on a passage thatreads, “And men went forth to behold high mountains and the mighty surge of thesea, and the broad stretches of the rivers and the inexhaustible ocean, and thepaths of the stars, and so doing, lose themselves in wonderment.”1[../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-1]It was as if the fates were dotting the i's and crossing the t's: what you aredoing now, Petrarch, is not some random, chance event, they said. It is of deep,perhaps even cosmic, significance. After this, things will be different.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]And this was one time at least when the fates were right. For what Petrarch'sterrible ascent of Mount Ventoux—in the true, accurate sense of the world“terrible”—inaugurated was not simply the beginning of ski lodges and vistapoints in the Rockies and other mountain chains, but a new, unprecedentedappreciation of space. If, as Owen Barfield suggests, in medieval times, humanbeings felt themselves to be part of a tapestry, or felt they wore nature aroundthem like a garment, when Petrarch made his mad ascent of Mount Ventoux, it wasas if he were tearing that garment from him and stepping out of the tapestry.The effect must have been as disorienting as that of an inhabitant of EdwinAbbot's Flatland who suddenly popped out into a world of three dimensions. Itwas not only a crazy thing to do, as the people of Petrarch's time clearlythought; it was also something more. For Petrarch had taken the first step in acompletely new understanding of the world—an understanding that we acceptwithout a moment's thought and take for granted, but that, like so much of ourexperience, is actually the result of a profound change in human consciousness,a shift so radical that the term “evolution” does not truly apply to it.“Mutation” would be more accurate. In this case it is the mutation from theflat, two-dimensional “embedded” world of the Middle Ages to the world that weexperience every day, the world of distance, “empty” space, “vanishing points,”and receding horizons. The world, that is, of perspective. This, and not theRussian orbiting of the satellite Sputnik in 1957, was the true beginning of the“space age.”One of the most important thinkers to recognize the nature of this shift and itssignificance for human evolution was the Swiss cultural philosopher Jean Gebser(1905–1973), author of one of the most challenging works of philosophy in thetwentieth century, Ursprung und Gegenwart, translated into English in 1984 asThe Ever-Present Origin. Although little known in English-speaking countries,Gebser has a reputation in Europe, where his work is seen in the long-standingtradition of polymath cultural theorists, thinkers like Oswald Spengler, ErnstCassirer, and Erich Kahler. There is something in the German mind that movesirresistibly toward a systematic and holistic view, a drive to see the world asa totality. Perhaps the greatest and most well known example of this is thephilosophy of Hegel. It is not a style of thought favored by British or Americanthinkers; in the English-speaking world today, the literary critic GeorgeSteiner perhaps comes closest to embodying it.In recent years, with the rise of schools like deconstructionism andpoststructualism, this search for unity has come under severe criticism, and theidea that a single mind can encompass the multiple and diverse elements ofcontemporary existence has become laughable, when it is not attacked as anexpression of intellectual totalitarianism. It is a shame that Gebser did notlive long enough to see the unprecedented success that thinkers like JacquesDerrida and Michel Foucault enjoyed in the 1980s, and the influence their workstill exerts on academics and the culture at large in the U.S. and Britain. (Intheir home country of France, however, they have both been considered passé forsome time.) For one thing, Gebser's remarks on their philosophies, both centeredon fracture, disruption, and the immanent lack of totality in human experience,would, we can safely assume, have been rewarding. But even more, their embrace,as well as that of their many followers, of a ruptured, broken, fragmentedworldview, would have been for Gebser simply more evidence for a belief he putforth decades before anyone had ever thought of “deconstructing” anything.Gebser believed that since about the turn of the nineteenth century, Westerncivilization has been in the death throes of what he calls its current“structure of consciousness”—in this case, the structure he calls the“mental-rational.” There have been three structures prior to this one (we willdiscuss these shortly), and we are now at the beginning stages of a fifth, whatGebser calls the “integral” structure. The “mental-rational” structure began,Gebser believes, in Greece around 1225 B.C. and is symbolized by the mythicalimage of the goddess Athena springing forth “fully grown” from the head ofZeus—a painful wrenching of a new form of consciousness out of an older one,reminiscent of the “breakdown of the bicameral mind” described by JulianJaynes.2 [../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-2] Athena, the goddess of wisdom, burstsforth armed with sword and shield when Prometheus—who stole fire from thegods—splits Zeus's head with an axe. From the beginning, the clear, decisive,directed thinking that we associate with rationality is linked to aggression andforce. (Again, the link to Jaynes's ideas is clear, also to Leonard Shlain's.)By the beginning of the fifth century B.C., the transition to this new structureof consciousness is complete, one result being the emergence of a new way ofthinking, philosophy, out of the older mythical mentality. Gebser notes that theperiod as a whole coincides with the philosopher Karl Jaspers's “axial age,” atime between 600 and 200 B.C. when the fundamental concerns of the Western mindfirst appeared.This mental structure, Gebser argued, reached a kind of apex with the rise ofperspective—inaugurated with Petrarch's mountain expedition—and has been in asteady decline ever since, notwithstanding the achievements of modern science.The self-reflexive work of Derrida and Foucault, in which, ouroborus-like,Western thought bites its own tail and, in its passion for analysis, begins totake itself apart, would have struck Gebser as probably the last gasp of aspeedily deteriorating form of consciousness. As we will see, the rise of“postmodernism” in general, with its taste for irony, parody, the disjointed,and the fragmentary, is good evidence in favor of Gebser's argument that at thestart of the twenty-first century we are moving headlong into a new form ofconsciousness, a consciousness he believed would manifest itself in a newexperience of time.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Jean Gebser was born in Posen, Prussia, in 1905. As his interpreter GeorgFeuerstein points out, the event was not without coincidence.3[../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-3] In that year Albert Einstein formulated hisspecial theory of relativity, a theory that would revolutionize science'sunderstanding of time. Five years earlier, Sigmund Freud had published his firstmajor work, The Interpretation of Dreams, which opened a door on a newunderstanding of the psyche. The same period saw Max Planck complete his theoryof the quantum, which would lead to a total abandonment of classical physics,and Edmund Husserl found the philosophical discipline of phenomenology, whichlaid the groundwork for later developments like existentialism. Feuerstein alsopoints out that 1905 saw the birth of another philosopher of consciousness,Erich Neumann. For a thinker concerned with sudden changes in humanconsciousness, Gebser certainly appeared at an apt point in history.Gebser's life reads like a classic example of an early twentieth-centuryEuropean intellectual. Like many he was caught up in the chaos of war. Severaltimes it uprooted him, and he felt at first hand the rise of fascism. An earlyexperience helped him deal with the uncertainty that characterized a worldravaged by conflict, economic depression, and the dark forces oftotalitarianism. While a young boy at a preparatory school, Gebser learned howto “swim free.” Jumping from the high dive, he discovered that his fall into thedeep pool was also a leap into the unknown. “It was then,” he later wrote, “thatI lost my fear in the face of uncertainty. A sense of confidence began to maturewithin me which later determined my entire bearing and attitude toward life, aconfidence in the sources of our strength of being, a confidence in theirimmediate accessibility. This is an inner security that is fully effective onlywhen we are able to do whatever we do not for our own sake.”4[../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-4] Years later this confidence in the face ofuncertainty would form the basis of Gebser's notion of Urvertrauen, “primaltrust,” the deep sense of well-being and acceptance of life that is thecounterpart of Urangst, “primal fear,” the underlying anxiety that characterizesmost of our attitudes toward the world.Like many who find themselves thrust onto the path of spiritual adventure,Gebser found ample opportunities to test his resolve and equanimity. Born intoan aristocratic family who had lived in Thuringia (Duchy of Franconia) forcenturies, as a boy he was educated at Breslau, Königsberg, and the renownedpreparatory school at Rossleben. His father, thirty-five at the time of Gebser'sbirth, was a lawyer by profession, but his great loves were literature, writing,and scholarship. His mother, twelve years younger than her husband, wasbeautiful, charming, and vivacious, yet she displayed a streak of self-seekingand capriciousness that led to much conflict at home. When his father died, theteenage Jean retreated into a world of books and ideas, but this protectivecocoon was soon burst; almost immediately after his father's death, Jean wasmade to leave home and school and begin an apprenticeship at a bank. Although hehated it, the dutiful boy fulfilled his obligations. But two years later, whenoffered a permanent position, Gebser declined and took his first big step intothe unknown, throwing off the comforts of “job security” for the uncertain joysof literature. With a friend, he started a publishing company, and a year laterthey launched a literary journal, Der Fischzug, in whose pages Gebser's earlypoems first saw print.Probably the major influence on Gebser at this time was the poetry of Rilke,whose theme of Herzwerk, “heart work,” is an early example of what Gebser meansby “primal trust.” When, in the Duino Elegies, Rilke calls us “wasters ofsorrows,” it is the acceptance of the totality of life—good and bad—that he hasin mind, and this is exactly what Gebser means by his “confidence” in the faceof uncertainty. In Rilke's poetry he also discovered a response to an idea thathad begun to obsess him: the thought of suicide. Like many young and sensitivemen during the dark years of the Weimar Republic, Gebser's “primal trust” wasrepeatedly put to the test. His family lost their savings in the economiccollapse, and the despair and hopelessness that would help put Hitler in powerand fuel the rise of pessimistic philosophies like existentialism presentedformidable challenges. Rilke's vision of a state of being in which one couldaffirm everything—the dennoch preisen, “praise in spite of,” embodied in theAngel of the Duino Elegies—convinced Gebser that the dark mood engulfing hiscontemporaries was to be rejected. Likewise a reading of Freud turned his mindaway from the provincial concerns of the youth movements of his day—some ofwhich later helped swell the ranks of the Nazis—and introduced an objective,scientific sensibility to complement his growing literary genius. Classes at theUniversity of Berlin, where he came under the guidance of the Catholicphilosopher Romano Guardini, helped to broaden his already polymath appetite forknowledge.In 1929, Gebser had another opportunity to test his “primal trust”: aconfrontation with Hitler's Brown Shirts convinced him that it was time to leaveGermany. The next year saw him traveling to Florence, then back to Germany, thento Paris, then to southern France. At this point, he changed his name from theGerman Hans to the French Jean—a sign he had rejected his Teutonic past and thenationalism that had overtaken his homeland. Like Nietzsche, Gebser was moreEuropean than German; both rejected the obscure, abstract style of thoughtassociated with German thinkers like Kant and Hegel in favor of the clarity andlight of the Mediterranean. Gebser's mind, again like Nietzsche's, moved beyondborders and nationalist ideologies in an attempt to embrace a new way ofthinking. The Europe of today, seeking to find a new, unified identity, couldfind in Gebser an articulate and convincing spokesman.In 1931, Gebser decided to settle in Spain. It was yet another leap intouncertainty; aside from financial worries, he had no command of Spanish, and hisfirst priority was to learn the language. He met the challenge successfully, aclear sign of his natural linguistic ability, and later translated the poetry ofhis friend Federico Garcia Lorca into German, along with the work of other poetsand political writers. Geber's relationship with Lorca was close. At a specialgathering in Madrid in 1936, he heard the poet read from “The House of BernardaAlba,” and Lorca later worked with Gebser on a translation of Frank Wedekind'sexpressionist play Spring Awakening. Gebser became fluent enough in Spanish towrite a book of poetry in his adopted tongue, Poesias de la Tarde (1936); hisstudy of Rilke's experience in Spain, Rilke und Spanien (1940), which firstmentions his notion of an emerging “aperspectival consciousness,” was alsooriginally written in Spanish. He also translated into Spanish the work ofanother poet in whom he saw signs of the incipient new consciousness, FriedrichHölderlin. His facility with the language also eased his financial worries bysecuring him a position in the Republic's Ministry of Education.Gebser's time in Spain was crucial for another reason. In the winter of 1932/33,he experienced a kind of insight, a “lightning-like inspiration” which latercrystallized into the central theme of his magnum opus: the notion that a newkind of consciousness was beginning to appear in the West. But his journeythrough chaos was not yet over, and between 1932 and 1949, when the first partof The Ever-Present Origin appeared, there would be several more leaps intouncertainty.One such leap arguably saved his life: in the fall of 1936, Gebser left Spainfor the French border twelve hours before his Madrid apartment was bombed. Warhad erupted once again, this time between the Republicans and Franco'sInsurgents. At the French border he was stopped and arrested, and there is agood chance he would have been executed had it not been for the influence of hisSpanish friends. One of these friends did not share his good fortune; FedericoGarcia Lorca was brutally murdered by the fascists. Strangely, it was whileawaiting a similar fate at the hands of Franco's army that Arthur Koestler hadthe mystical insight that would lead to his own explorations in the mechanismsof consciousness, brilliantly presented in his seminal work The Act of Creation(1963).5 [../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-5] Like Gebser, Koestler missed apremature death by a hairsbreadth; the experience turned him away from Marxismand political concerns, and focused his mind on science and the question ofhuman evolution. Gebser, too, was changed by his experience. Although a ferventspokesman for personal and political freedom, he found himself occupied more andmore with broader, more universal concerns.When Gebser finally arrived in Paris, he was armed with several of Lorca's poemsand surrealistic drawings; he later translated and published the poems with apsychological commentary in 1949. He quickly found himself at home in a circlethat included Paul Éluard, Louis Aragon, André Malraux, and Picasso, whosestudio in the Latin Quarter he visited. Paris then, just before the occupation,was a bleak, depressed city, home to a unique collection of intellectual andartistic personalities. It was the Paris of Sartre, Camus, and the Surrealists,but also of Gebser's older compatriot Walter Benjamin—then an obscure Jewishcritic, now the focus of a worldwide cult. It was also home to the enigmaticRussian teacher G. I. Gurdjieff and his brilliant pupil, the poet René Daumal,author of the spiritual classic Mount Analogue. For Gebser, a German who hadrejected his homeland in favor of the defeated country, those years were lean, atime of personal challenge and suffering. His Parisian tenure, however, wasbrief, and history soon had him moving on once again.In August 1939, Gebser entered Swiss territory two hours before the borders withFrance closed. For intellectuals like him, the situation in France was untenableand Switzerland promised safety. He was one of the lucky ones; a year later,after climbing a mountain pass and being arrested at the Spanish border, adepressed and panicky Walter Benjamin committed suicide by taking an overdose ofmorphine. Switzerland was the last stop on Gebser's decade-long Wanderjahre, butit was not the end of his spiritual travels. The Paris he had left behind hadbeen obsessed with politics—with Marx, fascism, and the inevitable splinteringand squabbling that plagues revolutionary cliques. (The backstabbing andmudslinging that dominated Sartre and Camus' relationship after the war ischaracteristic of the milieu.) When he left France, Gebser found not onlypolitical and personal freedom; in Switzerland he could discover the inner spacenecessary to explore the implications of his insight in Spain.One of the first manifestations of this was an article written in 1941 and laterexpanded and published as a book in 1944: Der grammatische Spiegel (TheGrammatical Mirror). In it Gebser collected his thoughts on an insight that hadoccupied him for many years: the recognition that the grammatical structure ofEuropean languages like German and French had in recent times “mutated” and wasshowing signs of a shift in thinking, indicating the appearance of a new kind ofthought in Western consciousness. Like Owen Barfield, Gebser saw that languageprovided good evidence for an evolution of consciousness. And also likeBarfield, he saw the clearest indication of this in poetry—in this case, that ofRilke. But whereas Barfield focused on the past history of language in order toshow the roots of our present consciousness, Gebser concentrated on what he sawas an unprecedented form of thought fitfully emerging then, which would soonappear in full as a new “structure of consciousness.” As his older contemporaryMartin Heidegger said, “Language is the house of being.” Like Heidegger, Gebserwould use language itself to spark a recognition of its own possibilities and toturn a sympathetic consciousness to awareness of its own future. Also likeHeidegger, he often used gnomic neologisms that can make grasping his insightsdifficult.Gebser's polymath mind soon reached out beyond poetry for signs of the newconsciousness. In 1941/42, he wrote Abendlandische Wandlung (Transformation ofthe Orient) in which he argued that changes in the sciences, inaugurated byEinstein's revolutionary work in the year of Gebser's birth, showed clearindications of a major shift in human consciousness. In the work of Einstein,Planck, Heisenberg, and Freud, as well as the parapsychological investigationsof J. B. Rhine and the depth psychology of his friend C. G. Jung, Gebser saw abreak with the linear, mechanistic paradigm of the classical scientificworldview, and a new awareness and expression of the “aperspectivalconsciousness” rising in the Western mind. That this focus on simultaneity andnonlinear time had already percolated through to modern literature Gebser knewfrom his reading of novelists like Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann, Robert Musil,James Joyce, and Hermann Broch, all of whom had abandoned the strict linearnarrative of the nineteenth-century novel, in favor of a “birds-eye view”approach—a development heralded by Ouspensky's forays into the “fourthdimension.” The reality of “other times and places,” made tangible by Proust'smadeleine, paralleled, Gebser knew, the most recent discoveries in what wouldsoon become known as the “new physics.”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-6]Convinced, like R. M. Bucke, that human consciousness was experiencing abreakthrough, Gebser turned his eye to our past, looking for evidence ofprevious transformations. The result was Foundations of the Aperspectival World,the first part of his major work, published as part one of The Ever-PresentOrigin in 1949. Part two, Manifestations of the Aperspectival World: An AttemptAt the Concretion of the Spiritual, was completed soon after and first publishedin 1953. For the remaining two decades of his life, Gebser delved deeper anddeeper into the implications of his insight in Spain in the 1930s, drawing fromthat sudden “personal view” an increasingly profound vision of the possibilitiesopen to us on the brink of a planetary transformation.His last years in Switzerland were filled with lectures, travel, conferences,and symposiums. He visited India, the Far East, North and South America. Just ashis reflections on contemporary science were informed by his many meetings withphysicists, biologists, and other professionals, the aim of Gebser's “journey tothe East” was to give him some firsthand experience of a world whoseconsciousness, he believed, though very different from ours, complemented thatof the West. Indeed, in his book Asien lachelt anders (Asia Smiles Differently),published in 1968, Gebser, although sympathetic to “Eastern thought,” warned, asC. G. Jung had, against any superficial adoption of it by Westerners—anadmonition no doubt prompted by the mass popularity of “Eastern mysticism” amongthe burgeoning youth culture of the 1960s. That Gebser was no stranger toOriental thought is clear from his writings, as well as from the fact that hewas a familiar face at the celebrated Eranos Conferences, along with Jung, ErichNeumann, Mircea Eliade, Heinrich Zimmer, and other scholars.The “East” also had another significant meaning for Gebser. In 1961, during avisit to Sarnath in India, the legendary site of Gautama Buddha's first sermon,Gebser had another lightning-like inspiration, this one of a more personalnature. He called it his satori experience—a labeling later corroborated by theZen scholar D. T. Suzuki. As Georg Feuerstein points out, Gebser, for somereason, wanted to keep this experience a secret, and it was not until 1971 thathe wrote of it in a letter to Feuerstein. Perhaps he was concerned that Westernintellectuals' prejudice again nonrational mentalities would find in thisspiritual insight sufficient reason to ignore his challenging ideas. Or,perhaps, as C. G. Jung felt about his interest in the occult, Gebser wasconcerned with the damage such an admission would make to his academicreputation. Given the unrestrained and guru-seeking atmosphere of the 1960s,Gebser may have wanted to avoid any chance of being seen as a “mysticalteacher.” In any event, the experience had profound significance for him. Hespeaks of it being a “transfiguration and irradiation of the indescribable,unearthly, transparent ‘Light' . . . a spiritual clarity, a quiet jubilation, aknowledge of invulnerability, a primal trust. . . . Since Sarnath I am as ifrecast, inwardly, since then everything is in its proper place.”7[../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-7] As we will see, the notions of “spirituallight,” “transparency,” and “diaphaneity,” one of Gebser's neologisms, hold forhim special significance as signs of the incipient aperspectival consciousnessstructure.Gebser's satori, like his earlier faith in uncertainty, would serve him in goodstead in later years. Recognition of his ideas began to spread outside hiscircle of friends and colleagues; but a punishing work schedule took its toll,as did his awareness that the West would soon be facing the most demandingchallenge of its existence—“The crisis we are experiencing today,” he wrote in1949, “is not just a European crisis . . . , it is a crisis of the world andmankind such as has occurred previously only during pivotal junctures.” In 1966Gebser suffered a complete physical collapse; a progressively worsening case ofasthma forced him to curtail his travels and minimize his work. He was unable toappreciate the chair in comparative civilizations created for him at theUniversity of Salzburg in 1967.Although he never recovered his health, Gebser continued to produce more books,attempting to convey the central significance of his ideas to a wider audience.He was aware that a younger generation, eager for guidance and more amenablethan their elders to ideas about other forms of consciousness, had arisen in thelast few years. (Like Nietzsche, Gebser always wrote not only for tomorrow, butfor the day after tomorrow.) The work of Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin,both of whom he acknowledged as fellow investigators of the new consciousness,had gained wide readership among the counterculture. Just months before hisdeath, Gebser wrote in the preface to the 1973 edition of his great work, “Theprincipal subject of the book, proceeding from man's altered relationship totime, is the new consciousness, and to this those of the younger generation arekeenly attuned.” That he was aware of some of the retrograde aspects of thecounterculture is clear; as we will see, his reflections on what he called the“magical” consciousness structure and the dangers of “group consciousness,”whose effects he had experienced firsthand during the rise of the Nazis, areapplicable to some of the more extreme manifestations of irrationality thatarose in the 1960s. But Gebser's “primal trust” shone through powerfully in hislast years, and he was convinced that whatever “ominous events” had occurredsince The Ever-Present Origin first appeared were outweighed by the morepositive insights and achievements, which “by virtue of their spiritual potency,cannot remain without effect.”8 [../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-8]Gebser died on May 14, 1973, convinced that within the next few decades thehuman race would move toward an event that he believed could “only be describedas a “global catastrophe,” yet equally convinced that if sufficient will andinsight were brought to the task, the crisis could be averted—or, at least,survived. In this respect, his thinking echoes Rudolf Steiner's vision of acoming “Ahrimanic future,” an age of total scientistic materialism, bereft ofspirit. Since Hiroshima, humankind's Cassandras have increased, both in numberand in volume, and it would be easy to relegate both Gebser's and Steiner'swarnings and prophecies to the dire rantings of yet another shrill jeremiad. Butthis would be a mistake. The cliff edge our civilization is moving toward is theend destination of “an increase in technological feasibility inverselyproportional to man's sense of responsibility.” Yet, a man without hope does notwrite a massive work of scholarship and insight arguing how our cultural suicidemay be avoided. The book, he said, was “addressed to each and every one,particularly those who live knowledge, and not just those who create it.”9[../Text/part0040.html#c25-FN-9] It was not, Gebser meant, a work of scholarshipaimed solely at scholars, but an attempt to map out the possibilities andpotentials of the future, a guide to help those few who accept the challenge toconsciously find their way through the ruins of the old consciousness and thestrange landscapes of the new. Thirty years after Gebser's death, we are livingthe transformation he predicted."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIXImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]STRUCTURES OF CONSCIOUSNESSThe Ever-Present Origin is a massive work of some six hundred pages, filled withcharts, illustrations, a dense etymological appendix, and chapter notes oftennumbering more than a hundred. It is a work of immense learning, erudition, andwisdom, and assumes the reader has a familiarity with the history and culture ofWestern civilization, as well as some knowledge of the more esoteric strains ofhuman creativity. Its scope covers religion, mythology, philosophy, literature,science, history, jurisprudence, psychology, and what today we would call theparanormal. Along with presenting a daunting synthesis of all human culturalactivity for the last few millennia, it is an attempt to, in Ouspensky's tersephrase, “think in other categories,” a confident leap into ontologicaluncertainty, with little more than poetic insight and intuition and the unwieldytool of language as guides. Gebser is not alone in recognizing that one of thechief tasks of philosophical thought in the twentieth and now twenty-firstcenturies is to augment our language—informed, as it is, with the metaphysicalbias of our currently deteriorating mental-rational structure—in order to openit to the new meanings presented by the emerging aperspectival consciousness.Hence his already rich work is filled with new coinages, whose meanings are notalways apparent or, when they seem to be readily comprehensible, are found to bemore difficult than anticipated. Further, Gebser, like Martin Heidegger, usesfamiliar words in an unfamiliar way and engages in lengthy and, at times,abstruse etymological analyses. Readers may at first be mystified by recurringterms like “origin,” “aperspectival,” “waring,” “integrality,” “timefree,”“diaphaneity,” “ego-free,” “latency,” and many more.Those coming to the book for the first time will be thankful for theindispensable glossary that Georg Feuerstein has appended to his sympathetic,insightful, and sometimes critical introduction to Gebser's ideas, Structures ofConsciousness. That there will be many more readers seems apparent. Along withinforming Feuerstein's own widely read books on Hindu philosophy, Gebser's ideasare a central influence on another popular writer on the evolution ofconsciousness, Ken Wilber, considered by many to be one of the intellectualheavyweights of the New Age. Sites devoted to Gebser's ideas can be found on theInternet, and a school of “integral philosophy,” including the work of scholarsand philosophers like Allan Combs and Noel Barstad, is disseminating them to awider, English-speaking readership.The value of this spread of Gebser's philosophy has, however, been questioned.In one of his more recent books, Coming Into Being: Artifacts and Texts in theEvolution of Consciousness (1998), the cultural theorist William Irwin Thompsoncriticizes Wilber's “appropriation” of Gebser, and bemoans the fact thatWilber's California students prefer his self-help version of Gebser's difficultthought to its more demanding source. Feuerstein himself, remarking on the lossthat many felt at Gebser's passing, said that “Socratic spirits like Gebsertypically live before their time . . . [and] are, therefore, never fashionable.If they were to become fashionable their cause would be lost, for undoubtedlytheir vision would be vulgarized.”1 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-1] In anothercontext, Algis Mickunas, one of the English translators of The Ever-PresentOrigin, has commented critically on the attraction Gebser has for “seekers for anew age and a saving spirituality” and has distanced his own work on Gebser fromwhat he sees as a warranted but limited appreciation.2[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-2]Perhaps, as Gebser believed, origin is preferable to its later developments.Yet, although he struggled against the very vulgarization that troubled GeorgFeuerstein, he was also wary of any kind of “spiritual elite” and warned of anymisinterpretation of his work that would include it under the rubric of“Nietzsche and the Gnostics, whose superiority doctrines include claims of powerand similarity to the divine.”3 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-3] With itsChristian stamp—another aspect Gebser shares with Rudolf Steiner—his “integralconsciousness” avoids any charge of hubris. Yet, it is also true that thedemands placed on one willing to endure the emerging transformation ofconsciousness are heavy. Gebser warned that if we do not overcome the comingcrisis, it will overcome us, “and only someone who has overcome himself is trulyable to overcome,”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-4]an admonition not readilypalatable to a generation bred on psychobabble and the spiritual quick fix. Thisis the Goldilocks syndrome in another form: vulgarization or elitism, popularmovements that appeal to many but lack any spiritual punch, or inner circles ofinitiates who too easily succumb to notions of evolutionary superiority. Findingthe “just right” middle ground between these two is, as can be imagined, noteasy.Gebser, I believe, hoped that his vision of a new consciousness could helptranscend this binary trap, the “either-or” paradigmatic of the consciousnessstructure that, according to him, we are currently exhausting. As the crisis hewarned of was inevitable and not limited to the concerns of any esoteric elite,it strikes me that to err on the side of vulgarization, however much our moresubtle sensibilities may be offended, is the lesser evil. That more people knowof his work today than did thirty years ago can only be a good thing. Hence theinevitably inadequate summary of his ideas that follows is presented in goodfaith.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]In its densely packed pages, The Ever-Present Origin charts the history andevolution of human consciousness, from its earliest appearance in protohumanhominids to the cultural achievements of the first half of the twentiethcentury—and having said that I must immediately add a disclaimer. For Gebserboth the notions of “history” and “evolution” as we understand them are chargedwith the deficient mode of the dissolving “mental-rational” consciousnessstructure; hence they are radically biased and inadequate to characterize theprocess by which the different consciousness structures “mutate” and emerge fromtheir perennial source, Gebser's “ever-present origin.” To explain the processby which consciousness structures emerge using the deficient vocabulary of onlyone structure is, as we have seen in our discussion of participatoryconsciousness, similar to trying to explain the origin of a novel in thecontents of the novel itself. “History” and “evolution” are not standpointsoutside of the process they are trying to explain; they are products of themodern period (the mental-rational consciousness structure) and are, Gebserargues, characterized by a linear understanding of time, anchored in a“beginning” and moving, in some sense, toward an “end.”To be sure, contemporary historians and evolutionists have abandoned anyteleological notion of their subject, and the idea that history “marches on”from its primitive beginnings in a neat, orderly progression to the present, orthat evolution has followed a similar trajectory, is no longer consideredtenable. Indeed, for some “postmodern” thinkers, “history” itself has ended, notin the sense of Francis Fukuyama, by reaching its “goal”—the globalization ofliberalism—but by no longer constituting an intelligible subject of discourse.According to these thinkers, there no longer seems to be a comprehensible entitywe can call “history”—a fate that has befallen several hitherto stable concepts,like “the state,” “art,” “philosophy,” even “man.” But this is a relativelyrecent development and, far from being an argument against Gebser's view, is,indeed, evidence for it: our “post-everything” culture is merely the clearestsign that the dominant consciousness structure of the last few centuries israpidly breaking up. Gebser's view differs from postmodern understandings ofhistory and evolution in that, rather than simply abandoning classical linearnotions in favor of random, ruptured, basically meaningless models, he embedshis consciousness structures in an atemporal source, what he calls “origin.”What Gebser means by origin is difficult to convey in a short space—a problem weface with each of his central insights. To understand any one of his coinages weneed to understand the others; the definitions and meanings are so intimatelyinterlinked that it could be said that Gebser's entire thought can be drawn outthrough the process of articulating one of his neologisms. This is so because ofthe key problem in dealing with “new” modes of thought: language.In trying to grasp a radically new kind of consciousness using, as we are forcedto, concepts forged by our familiar “old” mode of thinking, we are caught in anexercise that seems self-defeating—rather like trying to bang a nail into a wallusing the claw end of the hammer. (Ouspensky experienced something of thisproblem when he recognized that “a man can go mad from one ashtray.”) In tryingto do this, we are employing the very modes of thought we are trying to“subvert.” Nietzsche was perhaps the first to recognize the limits of the“prison house of language,” and subsequent philosophers have tried a variety ofmeans to escape from it. (The situation is similar to that presented by Kant andthe Dingan-sich.) Wittgenstein was so frustrated by our inability to sayanything other than tautologies that he declared philosophy a disease oflanguage. Later thinkers took to more graphic expedients; Derrida's alreadyunreadable “texts” are peppered with “erasures,” omissions, and “crossing-outs”in his attempts to avoid a language of “being.” The difference here is that, indifferent ways, both Wittgenstein and Derrida leave “nothing” in place of the“metaphysical” meanings they reject—Wittgenstein retreating into language as itis used “every day” (whatever that may mean) and Derrida into an endless cascadeof difference. Gebser, however, does not merely “empty” metaphysical language;he fills the old skins with a new, transfiguring wine. He escapes the prisonhouse of language not by retreating into silence or “absence,” but by increasingthe size of the prison until it resembles something much more like a cathedral.“Origin,” according to Georg Feuerstein, is “the ever-present reality . . . bynature divine and spiritual” out of which the different structurations ofconsciousness unfold in space-time.5 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-5] It isatemporal and nonspatial, existing outside time and space—insofar as somethingnonspatial can be “outside.” The origin, for Gebser, is “before all time” and isthe “entirety of the very beginning,” just as the present is “the entirety ofeverything temporal,” including “yesterday, today, tomorrow, and even thepre-temporal and timeless.”6 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-6] It is “sheerpresence,” a primal spiritual radiance whose luminosity is obscured by thelesser light of the consciousness structures that proceed from it. In this senseit is like the Pleroma mentioned earlier, which also exists outside of thecreated world, and is indeed the source and support of that world.Some readers may find it helpful to think of Gebser's origin in terms of thephysicist David Bohm's notion of an “implicate order,” which is likewise anatemporal unity out of which our present universe of space-time—and, Bohmsuggests, other universes as well—“unfolds.” To “picture” this, Bohm offers animage that may be useful: he suggests that the unmanifest implicate ordermanifests explicate “worlds,” like our own, rather like those Japanese papertoys that, when dropped into water, “unfold” into various shapes. The pelletcontains the form, yet the form remains invisible until it is released by thewater.7 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-7] Gebser is saying something similar whenhe speaks of his consciousness structures “unfolding” out of origin. They arecontained within it, in a state of “latency,” which Gebser calls the“demonstrable presence of the future,” a condition that is true of each of theconsciousness structures that emerge: each exists in potential in the structureprior to it. For our lives as a whole this is a powerful insight: each of ourtomorrows emerges from all of our todays. And, as a student of G. I. Gurdjieffonce remarked, the whole point of “work on oneself” is to ensure that yourtomorrow is not merely a repetition of today.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Gebser is clear that it is a mistake to think of origin as a simple beginning;it is, as he remarks of the ancient symbol of the yinyang, “a preforming andprimal paradigm of Being . . . not just prehuman, that is pre-mankind, butpre-tellurian, emerging from a ‘time' when the earth did not yet ‘exist.'”8[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-8] In this sense, Gebser's origin shares much withRudolf Steiner's contention that “any transformation in the material aspect ofthe Earth is a manifestation of spiritual forces lying behind matter. But if wego further and further back in time . . . we eventually arrive at a point inevolution where matter first began to exist. This material element developed outof the spiritual. Before this point, only the spiritual element was present.”9[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-9] Like Steiner, Gebser believes that thedevelopment of consciousness has proceeded through a progression away from itssource, origin. Hence he rejects interpretations of the unfolding ofconsciousness structures in terms of “progress” or of the linked idea of“evolution.” But also like Steiner, Gebser believes that the ultimate unfoldingof his consciousness structures—whose first stages we are currentlyexperiencing—will mean a return to origin, to the spiritual sources of being.For the Viennese satirist Karl Kraus, “Origin is the goal.” And for Kraus, aswell as for Gebser and other thinker-poets like Goethe, being “original” meansdrawing one's creative energies from the primal source. Our own ideas aboutoriginality, however, differ from this considerably; since the nineteenthcentury and the rise of the myth of the avant-garde, being “original” has cometo mean being absolutely “new.” An “original” idea is one that has “never beendone before,” and inevitably the gauge of this became how much the bourgeoiswere shocked by what one produced. (It was precisely this that troubled OwenBarfield when he thought about the future of the imagination.) By now, however,such attempts do little more than numb the audience they are designed toimpress, while instilling an appetite for the gross and tasteless—Damien Hirst'sdissected animals, far from being “original,” are preeminent examples of anexhausted gesture. Origin, for Gebser, has nothing to do with adolescent ideasabout being shocking, or with the ever receding horizon of the “new.” Origin, hetells us, is something always at hand. Although in a chronological sense theearliest human beings were “closer” to it—as we will see shortly—being atemporaland nonspatial, it is never removed from us. The central characteristic of theemerging “aperspectival integral” consciousness structure, Gebser tells us, isthat within it, the preceding consciousness structures are made “transparent,”thus allowing the primal “ever-present” radiance of origin to shine through.Just as Steiner's Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan planetary incarnations will be arecapitulation of “older” forms of consciousness integrated with our presentEarth “waking consciousness,” so Gebser's integral consciousness structure is aharmonizing and reorganization of the previous four structures. (We have seen asimilar notion of a recapitulation plus in Andreas Mavromatis's speculations onthe future of hypnagogia.)Gebser calls the first consciousness structure to emerge from origin the“archaic.” It is “zero-dimensional” and, for all intents and purposes, ispractically identical with its source, being little more than the first slightripple of difference between origin and its latent unfolding. According toGebser the archaic structure is characterized by the identity of consciousnesswith the world. It is, in terms of Owen Barfield's account of the evolution ofconsciousness, a time of complete and total participation, prior to the initialsplit giving rise to language. Hence, there is little to be said about thisstructure—not because it is uninteresting, but because the possibility of“saying” had yet to arise. It is a state, as Gebser writes, “akin, if notidentical, to the original state of biblical paradise: a time where the soul isyet dormant, a time of complete non-differentiation of man and the universe.”10[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-10] It is Erich Neumann's uroboric consciousness,a seamless unity between human being and world. Georg Feuerstein calls it a“fundamental dimness,” a “dimly lit mist devoid of shadow.”11[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-11] The condition is similar to what Steiner wroteof the “Saturn human being” in Cosmic Memory. “The condition of consciousness ofSaturn man,” Steiner says, “cannot be compared with any state of consciousnessof present-day man, for it was duller than that of dreamless sleep.”12[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-12] “Dreamless sleep” is precisely what Gebserassigns to his archaic structure. He quotes the Chinese philosopher Chuang-tzu,who lived ca. 350 B.C., as evidence: “Dreamlessly the true men of earlier timesslept.”13 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-13] Dreamless sleep is also acharacteristic of the oldest part of the brain, the reptilian limbic system,prior even to the preconscious hypnagogic condition that Mavromatis suggests mayhave been a biologically earlier form of consciousness. In this context it isinteresting to note that Gebser quotes another source suggesting that thearchaic structure may have been similar to what Mavromatis posits as a primal,“nuclear” synesthetic sense (see chapter 12). Gebser refers to a remark by thesinologist Richard Wilhelm. Commenting on early Chinese chromatic symbolism,Wilhelm remarks, “At that time blue and green were not yet differentiated. Thecommon word Ch'ing is used for the color of the sky as well as of the sproutingplant.” Gebser comments that this nondifferentiation suggests an “unproblematicharmony and complete identity of earth and sky,”14[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-14] perhaps a more “spiritual” way of expressingMavromatis's notion of a single nuclear sense, which would not yet register thedifferences we take for granted between green and blue, and the earth and thesky. And although Gebser rejects any suggestion of “primitive colorblindness,”15 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-15] we may recall R. M. Bucke'sremarks about the lack of color sense in our ancestors (chapter 1). Thatsynesthesia is also associated with newborns is another consideration linkingarchaic consciousness with Neumann's uroboric state.Dating in Gebser is always ambiguous, as Feuerstein himself admits, so it is notclear exactly when the archaic structure held sway. Because he argued that suchquestions about “beginnings”—“when,” “how long,” etc.—are “linear” expressionsof our current mental-rational structure, Gebser believed they strictly do notapply to other structures. Yet it is difficult to see how, barring an insightsimilar to the one Gebser experienced in Spain, we can talk about hisconsciousness structures at all, unless we use the concepts available. We havealready pointed out the difficulties involved in using an inadequate language.Nevertheless, it is the language we have; it may not be the best tool, but it isclearly better than none. Ken Wilber suggests that the “archaic period” beganthree to six million years ago and lasted until about 200,000 years ago; thisvast stretch of time covered our pre-sapiens ancestors, Australopithecusafricanus, Homo habilis, and early Homo erectus.Feuerstein questions the inclusion of Homo erectus, arguing that it is betterplaced in Gebser's next consciousness structure, the magical. Surely the pointis debatable, but what seems to be clear is that “archaic” or “Dawn man”(Wilber's term) lacked any sense of a self separate from the world. They werelittle more than a reaction to their environment and their own needs andappetites. We may dream wistfully of some ancient, lost “oneness” with nature,but the truth is that such oneness precludes our humanity. Archaic hominidslived in herds, not tribes; were motivated by the pressures of hunger, thirst,and sexual urges; felt no emotion; and had no thought of “spirituality.” Their“bond” with their fellows was involuntary and telepathic, not sympathetic. Theymay have been closer to origin or the spiritual source than we are, but they hadno awareness that they were—or of much else, for that matter. Their sense ofsmell was probably the strongest single source of interaction with the “world,”which for them was not the clearly defined collection of objects it is for us,but something much more akin to William James's “blooming, buzzing confusion.”Lacking a self, they also lacked memory or any means of symbolic thought. Theylived in a perpetual present, punctuated by eating, excreting, and copulation.Far from being inhabitants of paradise, our earliest ancestors were the bloody,savage raw material of the future.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]One step closer to that future were our “magical” ancestors, the bearers ofGebser's next consciousness structure. According to Gebser, the magicalstructure does not differ greatly from the archaic. Consciousness was stilldeeply interfused with its environment, and the idea of an “inner” and “outer”world was still to come. Yet at this point a slight separation between humanconsciousness and world has arisen. Where in the archaic structure human beingswere identical with the universe, in the magical structure they lived in unitywith it. There was still no ego-consciousness in the way we understand it; asFeuerstein writes, “For the hominid of the archaic structure the life-world wasthe self. The bearer of the magical consciousness, by contrast, lived throughthe ‘we’ of the horde. . . . The family group was the self.”16[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-16] (Again, this seems very close to Steiner's“group soul,” the dominant mode of consciousness of the pre–Greco-Roman epoch,which in many ways is still very dominant among less individuated personalitiestoday—both so-called primitives and members of various collectives: political,fashionable, professional.)In the magical period, our ancestors lived in the consciousness of the group,which was still very much united with nature. Language and the “world” itdenotes were yet to emerge, and it is more than likely that communication thentook place “immediately,” through a kind of telepathy, not of thoughts, but offeelings and impulses. Gebser relates the magical structure to the vital sphere,our visceral, biological life. He writes of the “vegetative intertwining of allliving things.” Morris Berman, writing of the same time, concurs with Gebser:“Paleolithic men and women took their cues from body feelings and the movementsof animals. This was a life governed by shifting moods rather than the demandsof the ego.”17 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-17]Throughout The Ever-Present Origin Gebser is at pains to make clear that what tous appear as previous consciousness structures are still present and active inour own consciousness. With the rise of our own dominant structure, they haveonly retreated into latency, yet their influence can still be felt. The archaicstructure, he argues, can be felt in some forms of dreams, what he calls“nuclear dreams” and “anticipatory dreams,” both of which participate in theatemporal character of origin. The magical structure with its “vegetativeintertwining” also remains active within us, and it is this, Gebser suggests,that accounts for the strange, fascinating coincidences we have come to call byC. G. Jung's term “synchronicities.” But Gebser came out of the darkness ofCentral Europe, and for him the “latent” potential of the magical structureseemed to offer more of a threat than anything else. To fully appreciate themagical structure today, he wrote, “requires . . . a sacrifice of consciousness;it occurs in the state of trance, or when consciousness dissolves as a result ofmass reactions, slogans, or ‘isms.' If we are not aware of this sphere inourselves, it remains an entry for all kinds of magical influence.”18[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-18]Gebser's remark that magical acts require a “sacrifice of consciousness” isreminiscent of the occult author Gustav Meyrink's aphorism that “Magic is doingwithout knowing.” Another magician, more well known though less succinct thanMeyrink, says the same thing. In chapter twenty of his voluminous “confessions”the notorious Aleister Crowley made some perceptive comments about his craft. Inremarking on the conditions necessary for a successful magical act, Crowleywrites that “success depends upon one's ability to awaken the creative genius,”which for him means the unconscious self. “Even the crudest Magic,” hecontinues, “eludes consciousness altogether, so that when one is able to do it,one does it without conscious comprehension, very much as one makes a goodstroke at cricket or billiards. One cannot give an intellectual explanation ofthe rough working involved.”19 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-19] Magic, in otherwords, is a form of “tacit knowing” (see chapter 23).20[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-20]That magic is best accomplished in a state of un- or nonconsciousness is perhapsthe central reason why it is a popular pastime among much of today's youth. Likesex, drugs, and rock and roll (or, for more contemporary listeners, “trancemusic”), magic aims at and is most successful during an “absence” of self. Thatthe release from the burdens of self-consciousness afforded by a return to an“earlier” structure is often mistaken for an experience of a “higher”state—formulated by Ken Wilber as the “pre/trans fallacy”—is only one of theconfusions attendant upon the dissolution of our current consciousnessstructure. Much of the “liberation” ethos of the 1960s and '70s was predicatedon this misunderstanding; a cursory glance at the times shows that magical“group consciousness” enjoyed a powerful resurgence then, aided by an impartialadvocacy of “mind-expanding” psychedelic drugs. That the time was also one ofpromise and potential is another indication that it was an expression of thedominant structure's breakdown: as the dominant structure collapses, a “freespace” is made available, a “spiritual vacuum” that will be filled by eithercreative or destructive forces. Any sort of leap always includes the possibilityof a fall.Although Gebser must have been aware of this atavism, he had already experiencedthe effects of a latent magical structure in a more powerful and devastatingform. The “vegetative intertwining” that concerned him was the kind he had seenoperating in Munich in 1929. A decade later, it had spread across most ofEurope. Mass movements like Nazism were less interested in the paranormaleffects of synchronicities than in the power of the latent magical structure tooverrule conscious critical discernment and bind people into a whole, the volk.It is clear that Hitler's oratory and Albert Speer's mass spectacles—like theNuremberg rallies, with their dazzling lighting effects—were a kind of “sorcery”aimed at and effective in drowning the lone conscious self in the buoyant watersof “the group.” (Again, the similarities to rock concerts with their mesmerizing“light shows,” drug use, and overpowering music are obvious.) In conditions suchas these, the ego, already weak and vacillating, is easily overwhelmed; thesheer vital energy of the crowd engulfs consciousness, and one is reduced tobeing a single cell, in a powerful, massive body. (The book to read on this isElias Cannetti's Crowds and Power.) Such environments are fertile for “magic.”The attraction of group consciousness is powerful; the Dionysian energies toppleany resistance, and the sheer sense of well-being produced by the influx ofvitality obviates any moral or ethical concerns. One needn't participate intotalitarian rallies to feel it. An office party or a football game serves justas well, but the dangers and energies involved in these are less than thoseattached to mass political movements—which don't necessarily need to be “rightwing” to warrant concern.That Hitler's rise to power was the result of some sort of magic is the theme ofseveral sensational books, most famously Pauwels and Bergier's The Morning ofthe Magicians. Yet “serious” writers also considered the possibility. HermannBroch's disturbing novel The Spell tells the story of a strange, persuasivedrifter who arrives in a mountain village and, through his charisma and hypnoticspeech, fairly soon brings the population under his sway. Broch correspondedwith Gebser, and his novels, especially The Sleepwalkers, are often alluded toas expressions of the new “aperspectival” consciousness structure. (He andGebser also shared a mutual friend in the cultural historian Erich Kahler.)Broch's title The Sleepwalkers itself suggests the dim, ambiguous state of aculture on the brink of collapse. Because of the effort involved in maintainingit, self-consciousness is always in danger of succumbing to the ease andlatitude of an earlier structure. Writing of the “magical” effects of Nazi masspropaganda, Morris Berman remarks, “Once we recognize that the human being hasfive (or more) bodies, and that these can get activated in such a way as togenerate spiritual or psychic energy (‘consciousness’) that can actually float .. . , then continuity via the history of ideas becomes unnecessary. . . .Consciousness is a transmittable entity . . . and . . . an entire culture caneventually undergo very serious changes as the result of the slow accumulationof enough psychic or somatic changes on an invisible level” (my italics).21[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-21]That much ritual magic involves sex of some sort is also a sign that we aredealing with a loss of self-consciousness and a return to an older, morevisceral form of existence. Rudolf Steiner, a member in the early 1900s of theOrdo Templi Orientis—an occult organization focusing on sexual magic—was alsoaware of the attraction and dangers of this “visceral consciousness,” which hebelieved was the source of trance states, mediumship, and much that we think ofas “mysticism.” Steiner believed that most of what passes for mystical insightis really a contemplation of subjective visceral activities, and he warned thatsuch practices provide opportunities for “Ahrimanic” entities to enterconsciousness, an instance of the “magical influence” Gebser warned of.Because of his experiences with the Nazis, Gebser is prone to see all “mystics,”“occultists,” and “esotericists” in the same way, as embodying this dangerousregression to a more primitive consciousness structure. His book is highlycritical of figures like Ouspensky and Gurdjieff, although, interestinglyenough, he makes no mention of Steiner, of whose work we can assume he wasaware. This is unfortunate; as we have seen, there are several parallels betweenhis work and Steiner's, and his ideas intersect at several points withOuspensky's. Had Gebser's initial encounter with the magical structure beendifferent, he may not have developed so suspicious an outlook.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]To the archaic and magical structures, Gebser tells us, is added the mythical.The mythical structure is characterized by polarity; here the first realseparation between consciousness and world occurs, although the two are stillintertwined in a way that we find unusual. It is very likely that OwenBarfield's experience of a change in consciousness from reading poetry was atleast in part a reactivation of the mythical structure. With the mythicstructure comes the differentiation of the unified cosmos into polarities likeearth/sky, male/female, god/goddess—or, as we have already seen, into thepreeminent mythic formula yin/yang. It is during the mythical consciousnessstructure that the “soul” first begins to emerge. Gebser sees this depicted inthe myth of Narcissus, the beautiful boy who fell in love with his ownreflection in a pool. Hence for Gebser the circle is the archetypal symbol ofthe mythic structure: here consciousness finds itself by projecting itself into,and returning from, nature. He relates the mythical structure as a whole towater, and in this it is in many ways similar to both Steiner's thirdpost-Atlantean epoch—ca. 2907–747 B.C., during which humankind develops the“sentient soul”—and the consciousness of our Old Moon incarnation.In the mythical structure, humankind first becomes aware of its inner world, thesoul, as it is “reflected” in the outer world of nature. There is as yet nothingthat we can call real thinking—which is not, of course, to say that the peoplewho lived in this period were “stupid”; merely that thinking in the sense weunderstand it had not yet appeared. The mythical structure perceives the worldnot as an object of thought, but as a subject of feeling. There is still nothinglike a modern ego, but according to Feuerstein the mythical mode “opened up thedimensions of empathy or more refined feeling associated with the world.” Thiswas a “matter of rapport and of being collectively flooded by such primaryemotions as fear, anger, sorrow, and pleasure.” The mythical mode “stillfulfills no less a function today, though our Western civilization's premium onthinking rather than feeling is a sure indication of the deficiency of themythical consciousness in our lives.”22 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-22]Nevertheless, a desire to feel the mythical element of our lives still exists,even in our predominantly mental-rational society, as the astounding success ofJoseph Campbell's The Power of Myth and other works in the 1990s shows.Stewart Easton, the historian of Anthroposophy, has a passage that indicates howthe mythic consciousness perceived its world:In the age before autonomous thinking, men perceived and interpreted . . . theworld through their feeling. Thus to the ancient Egyptian there was nocontradiction when his literature provided him with many different stories ofcreation and assigned the deed to various gods. When Hathor, the cow-goddess,was said to have created the world, no doubt the Egyptians recognized what weshould call the fruitfulness of the world and reverenced it accordingly; whenanother god made fast the boundaries of the earth and divided it from theheavens, we might say that its stability and permanence were accorded their due.When the god Ptah had a thought in his heart, and the thought was spoken as aword and the world was created, the wisdom, order and intelligence behind theworld were recognized. . . . No contradiction was presented to the Egyptiansbecause contradiction belongs to thinking, not to the feelings.23[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-23]Easton's remarks remind us of Schwaller de Lubicz's belief that the ancientEgyptians saw the world as a living being, whose manifestation involved a“simultaneity of opposites states” (see chapter 16) that for us would seemmerely illogical and contradictory. But, as Owen Barfield argued, this was inessence a metaphorical way of seeing reality. Where we recognize an abstractprinciple—“fruitfulness,” “wisdom,” “stability”—the consciousness of the mythicstructure perceived a living force, the neters of the Egyptians: in other words,gods. The gods did not “symbolize” the various aspects of the world associatedwith them: they were those aspects. The philosopher Ernst Cassirer writes thatfor the mythical consciousness, “The ‘image' does not represent the ‘thing'; itis the thing.”24 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-24]The notion of reflection, symbolized by Narcissus and the pool, suggests that inthe mythical structure the mind or soul was beginning to see itself. Hence, forGebser, it is in the mythical structure that language first rises to prominence.Whereas in the archaic and magical structures silence reigns—consciousnessremaining in an “autistic” uroboric state before the rise of language—in themythical structure language emerges as a form of sacred power, creating both a“self” and a “world” outside and other than that self.25[../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-25] Language then is a medium for polarities. Thelanguage Gebser places in the mythic period is not like our own prose; like OwenBarfield he sees this time characterized by a kind of poetry. This “poeticutterance” was propelled by what Gebser calls “oceanic thinking,” acircumambulation of images and metaphors, a process of linking new expressionsand formulations with previous ones through a kind of verbal labyrinth, an oral“eternal recurrence” whose aim was to maintain and elicit polarities through akind of spiraling, incantatory declamation. The mythical structure existed in akind of sacred circle or temenos, a self-enclosed sphere containing thepolarities of Heaven and Earth, a kind of cosmic egg whose protective shellhoused human consciousness well until the time of Copernicus.The self-enclosed aspect of the mythic structure, Gebser remarks, can still beexperienced in our dreams—and as we have seen with hypnagogia, the research ofLlinas and Pares seems to offer some corroboration for this. Gebser speaks ofthe mythic consciousness as a “silent, inward-directed contemplation,” which“renders the soul visible so that it may be visualized. . . . What is viewedinwardly, as in a dream has its conscious emergence and polar complement inpoetically shaped utterance”—an insight he shares with the French philosopher ofthe imagination, Gaston Bachelard.26 [../Text/part0040.html#c26-FN-26] Thesimilarity of this to Steiner's Old Moon consciousness, which functionedprimarily with images, need not be stressed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVENImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE MENTAL-RATIONAL STRUCTUREWith each of the structures emerging—or, as Gebser would say, “mutating”—out oforigin, there is an increasing separation from the source, a “progression” awayfrom the atemporal “ever-present.” Yet up to the mythic period there is still astrong connection between origin and the unfolding structures; in OwenBarfield's term, they still “participate,” and it is perhaps in the mythicstructure that a kind of optimum relation emerges: the unity with origin isstill strong, yet consciousness has “pulled away” enough to be aware of thatunity. After this comes a radical break. All three previous structures are verydifferent from our own consciousness—to us, total immersion in any of them wouldin all probability seem like an “altered state.” But now we are touching on theroots of our own form of mind.The next consciousness structure to emerge is what Gebser calls themental-rational. As I remarked earlier, its appearance was as profoundlyshattering as a natural catastrophe. The ambiguity and uncertaintycharacteristic of what we call the “postmodern condition” can give us some ideaof how people must have felt in the first stages of the mental-rationalstructure, but I believe the experience for them was much more disruptive—and,if we are to go by Julian Jaynes's account, it was.1[../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-1] It really must have been as if a world had beendestroyed, for with the rise of the mental-rational structure, the link betweeninner and outer space was, if not entirely severed, at least made extremelytenuous. We can liken it to when a child first realizes it is a separate being,an independent self, no longer completely under the protection of its parents.We may imagine an exhilarating sensation of freedom, but more likely the firstmanifestation of this is a profound feeling of fear.For Gebser, the early stage of the mental-rational structure—which, as weremarked earlier, he locates at around 1225 B.C.—brings “the first intimation ofthe emergence of directed or discursive thought. Whereas mythical thinking . . .was a shaping or designing of images . . . discursive thought is fundamentallydifferent.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-2] What is fundamentally differentabout this structure is that, unlike the mythical structure, which was stillconfined and supported by “mythic polarity,” discursive thought now, and for thefirst time, draws its energy from the individual ego. The ties with the group,although still strong in many, begin to loosen, and the “I” begins to emerge.This is the beginning of what Owen Barfield calls “alpha-thinking,” thinkingabout. It is also the beginning of what he calls “idolatry,” the habit ofconsciousness to forget that the representations it ponders have their source inconsciousness itself.As we have seen, for Rudolf Steiner the development of the ego is the task ofthe fourth post-Atlantean epoch, the age of the “intellectual soul” (747B.C.–A.D. 1413), and this coincides roughly with the “ascending” period ofGebser's mental-rational structure. For Steiner, Christ is the archetypal figurehere; for Gebser, the rise of Greek philosophy is a clear sign of the newconsciousness structure, although its spirit was already presaged in myth, thekey figure being Prometheus, whose theft of fire was symbolic of humanity'sfirst attempts to think for itself.3 [../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-3] As GeorgFeuerstein writes, this was the time of “the individual who could brave life,more or less, on his or her own, who did not feel particularly bound by, or evenbeholden to, the past, but who looked ahead to the possibilities of thefuture.”4 [../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-4] Indeed, it was at this point that anyidea of “the future” first emerged. Previously human beings had either beenasleep in a spaceless, timeless unity with the world or cradled in the“protective psychic circle” of the mythic structure. But now the magic circlewas broken, and linear time began. This is most evident in the Bible: thecreation myth posits an absolute beginning, and Christ's second comingintroduces a final goal toward which history is moving. Before this all accountsof creation and time itself were cyclical, products of the mythical structure.With the rise of the mental-rational structure, we emerged as creatures who, forthe first time, felt on our own in the world. We became agents who could makedecisions for ourselves, conscious egos who could act. It may be a commonplaceto say that homo sapiens sapiens has “progressed” more in the last twenty-fivehundred years of “civilization” than in all the millennia before; neverthelessit is true. Jurij Moskvitin's Anthroposphere, which we all inhabit, with itstelevisions, mobile telephones, and global communication networks, as well aslibraries, hospitals, and interplanetary satellites, is the result of thatfateful split brought about by the mental-rational consciousness structure.Whether it was “the breakdown of the bicameral mind,” or the rise of thealphabet—or some other unknown factor—the kind of unity between consciousnessand nature known in places like Çatal Hüyük was gone.But if this was the beginning of our psychic independence, it was also thebeginning of our estrangement from the world. The seeds of our later“alienation” were planted then. As Steiner points out, by the time of the fourthpost-Atlantean epoch, consciousness had become focused strictly on the physicalworld; “progression” from origin had reached a point at which the memory of the“everpresent” was absent, or at best dim. Through each “mutation,” consciousnesshad moved away from its spiritual source. Now, in the mental-rational structure,the luminosity of origin was more or less completely obscured by theincreasingly “hard-edged,” opaque objects of the physical world. Both Gebser andSteiner agree that this process was absolutely necessary: human intellectualfreedom could only be bought through the sacrifice of the spiritual intimacyenjoyed by earlier ages. Thus arose the possibility of science, the detailedexamination and understanding of the sensible world. But with this freedom cameanother, more dangerous possibility—the potential for consciousness to becomecompletely cut off from any perception of the spiritual worlds, from, that is,any sense of meaning. As we saw, this was Goethe's and Steiner's whole argumentagainst the dominance of “scientism,” which seeks to account for all humanexperience in terms of the “meaningless” play of matter and motion. Theirwarnings, however, have had little effect. Some three millennia after Athenafirst burst forth from Zeus's aching head, a science bent on explainingconsciousness—the spiritual—in strictly physical terms seems very strongevidence that this dangerous potential has indeed been actualized.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]This development is an expression of what Gebser calls the “deficient” mode ofthe mental-rational consciousness structure, a hypertrophying of one aspect ofthe structure at the expense of others. This is the kind of superrationalitythat coolly dismisses all “human” considerations from its concerns—thevivisectionist who, in “the name of science,” ignores the cries of his torturedlaboratory animal; the concentration camp commander who meticulously works outthe most “efficient” means of murdering his victims; the philosopher who deniesthe existence of consciousness because he has “never seen it.” This is theaffectless, lucid reasoning of the “impersonal” scientists who view the worldwithout a trace of any feeling for the living soul of nature, a view that allowsthem to “take it apart.”The stage of “deficiency” is basically a degrading of a structure, itsexhaustion prior to the emergence of a new one, which, as it were, clears apsychic space in which the new structure can arise. For Gebser, themental-rational structure entered “deficiency” with Petrarch's ascent of MountVentoux—with the rise, that is, of perspective. Petrarch's “discovery” ofperspective, Gebser writes, ushered in “a new realistic, individualistic, andrational understanding of nature.” It was “an epochal event” signifying “no lessthan the discovery of landscape: the first dawning of an awareness of space thatresulted in a fundamental alteration of European man's attitude in and towardthe world.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-5]Clearly, the most obvious result of the new “perspectival” perception was thechange in how consciousness represented the world. Hitherto, the naturallandscape and the human world took a backseat to the essentially spiritual andreligious subjects of paintings. Prior to perspective, the mundane world wasmerely a reflection of the spiritual realms, a hieroglyphic backdrop tocelestial events and figures. But with perspective, this changed. Therepresented world now became what was perceived from the point of view of asingle human consciousness. The world was now what we saw. One result of thiswas that, post-Petrarch, the elements of the mundane world began to demandattention for themselves, and the spiritual began to recede. As the literarycritic Erich Heller writes, with the Renaissance and the rise of perspective,“an abundance of images pressed upon the painters' imagination, claiming theirright to significance in the new field of vision. Pillars, towers, gates, trees,jugs and windows demanded to be seen with an intensity as never before.”6[../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-6] It was as if with the rise of perspective, theeveryday world was suddenly discovered.But if this shift from the “pre-perspectival” to the “perspectival” allowed forthe objects of our own everyday world to become imbued with a new importance, italso opened the door on the “naturalism,” “realism,” and “existentialism” thatwould eventually drain that world of any “transcendent” meaning. Heller hasfollowed this trajectory in his important book The Artist's Journey into theInterior. Through an analysis of the poetry of Rilke and the aesthetics of thephilosopher Hegel, Heller charts the gradual withdrawal of meaning from theexternal world. First, from the classical mythical symbols that had housed itfor centuries, then from the mundane world of nature and human handiwork, untilit reaches its final resting place in the subjectivity of the artist, typifiedby Rilke's much quoted dictum, “Nowhere will the world exist but within.” Rilke,like other artist-savants of the early twentieth century, recognized that theold symbols of meaning were no longer vital; like exhausted batteries, theycould no longer hold a charge. New symbols were needed, and where beforetradition would imbue its images with significance, it was now up to poets andartists to fulfill this task. They had to pour their own meaning into somearbitrarily chosen object—arbitrarily chosen since, with the collapse oftradition (both classical and religious), there was nothing to guide theartist's energies to a suitable vessel. So in the Duino Elegies Rilke advises usthat the Angel will not be impressed by any supernatural display, calling usinstead to offer him some earthly object: a jug, a rope, a bridge—whatever is athand. In Proust the transfiguring symbol becomes a piece of cake, a loose pavingstone, a lavatory.Yet, if in Rilke and Proust—and Yeats and T. S. Eliot—we have an example of whatthe philosopher Arthur Danto calls “the transfiguration of the commonplace,” wesoon after get the polar opposite: the making commonplace of the transfiguring.Cubist painters used preeminently mundane articles like cigarette packs assubjects for their world; not long after, some artists, like Kurt Schwitters,would use the packs themselves, no longer representing them, but simply fixingthem onto the canvas. Dada satirized the whole idea of “art” as any kind of“meaningful” project. The Surrealists who followed “found” art in the street,and saw in the products of the unconscious a kind of “psychic materialism”;they, like the Dadaists, carried on the Great Joke, pulling out the“transcendental” by the roots. Their “found art” exploded into a variety offorms: art brut, musique concrete, “word salad.” Art was no longer a means ofimbuing the everyday world with significance; rather, the whole drift of art inthe last century was to bring it down to the everyday—the central icon here, ofcourse, is Andy Warhol's Brillo Box.The competing ideologies that informed many of these works—existentialism,Marxism, etc.—although different in approach and values, shared one centraltheme: the absence of any transcendent meaning to human existence. No longer wasthere a single significance to human life, a shared awareness of our place inthe cosmos. Meaning, if it existed, was scattered among the interior worlds ofhundreds of artists; eventually it would become a purely personal meaning, anarcane, idiosyncratic reading of life, more times than not a foisting of theartist's obsessions on an increasingly befuddled public. And this absence oranarchy of “meaning”—the two are essentially the same—was not limited to art,but included science, literature, philosophy, and all human endeavors, informingthe Anthroposphere with a sense of chaos and pointlessness.It may seem a long way from Petrarch's thrilling ascent of Mount Ventoux to AndyWarhol's Brillo Box, but the trajectory is there and it has not stopped yet, asa visit to practically any contemporary art exhibit—or “installation”—shows. Thecentral shift, Gebser argues, is that with perspective, consciousness could now“block off” sections of nature from the whole; it could now focus on particular“slices” of the world and view these as separate realities, apart from the restof nature. Human consciousness, in a real sense, became the measure of allthings, and with the loss of the “transcendent” it was only a matter of timebefore we would empty out the inventory of our own invention: the uroboricserpent of analysis once again gnawing away at itself. It is the kind ofsensibility that Steiner located in the consciousness soul, the presiding“spirit” of the fifth post-Atlantean epoch, whose starting point of A.D. 1413 isvery close to 1336, the year of Petrarch's ascent. During the age of theconsciousness soul, there is an increasing “objectivity” of thought, a“hardening” and “fracturing” of our perception of the world, a complete breakwith “participation” and a triumph of what Schwaller de Lubicz calls “cerebralconsciousness,” which divides, analyzes, and granulates experience. A sciencethat wants to explain consciousness and an “art” that seeks to annihilate itsown meaning are two aspects of the same sensibility. Both wish to get rid ofanything that goes beyond the immediately given, whether that means neurons oran item from the grocery shop.7 [../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-7]That such a situation constitutes a crisis seems obvious. Indeed, the notionthat Western civilization is in crisis—or, in a more euphemistic variant, isundergoing a “transition”—has been the punch line of dozens, probably hundredsof books since the beginning of the last century. Oswald Spengler's Decline ofthe West, Ernst Bloch's Spirit of Utopia, Hermann Hesse's Glimpse Into Chaos,Edmund Husserl's The Crisis in European Science, Karl Kraus's The Last Days ofMankind, Arthur Koestler's The Ghost in the Machine, Robert Musil's The ManWithout Qualities, José Ortega y Gasset's The Revolt of the Masses, MartinHeidegger's Being and Time, René Guenon's The Reign of Quantity, Thomas Mann'sThe Magic Mountain, Colin Wilson's The Outsider—the list could go on. The abovecanon, by no means exhaustive, includes novels as well as works of philosophy,literary criticism, and drama—a sign that the concern with what the novelistHermann Broch called “the disintegration of values” is not confined toacademics, but reaches out across the cultural board. Works of art and music,and whole “movements” like Expressionism and Existentialism could be included inthis grouping. It would not be too much to say that one of the central themes ofthe twentieth and now twenty-first centuries has been the imminent collapse of“Western civilization”—for much of the last quarter of the last century itsunavoidable demise was not only welcomed but hastened on by members of its mostprominent academic establishments.Even staunch and spirited defenders of the Western mind have little hope for itcontinuing in any more than a nostalgic or elder statesman role. In a recentbook, George Steiner laments, “We have no more beginnings.” “There have beenprevious senses of ending and fascinations with sundown in western culture,” hewrites, but “nevertheless, there is, I think, in the climate of spirit at theend of the twentieth century, a core-tiredness. . . . We are, or feel ourselvesto be, latecomers. The dishes are being cleared.”8[../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-8] Likewise, the historian Jacques Barzun, atninety-five a witness to the long sunset of the West, has, in the monumentalFrom Dawn to Decadence (2001), charted, over the last five hundred years, thepath of our culture's birth, maturity, and now, with what he calls the “GreatUndoing,” its self-immolation at the hands of chat shows, gangsta rap, andtrendy postmodernisms. The great themes of “emancipation,” “individualism,” and“self-consciousness” that fueled the break with a creaking tradition, Barzunsays, are now entangled in an apparently irresolvable morass of competing andcontradictory “values.” That anything “great” can emerge from this is, hebelieves, doubtful.Cassandras, then, have not been hard to find, even if in more recent years theirdire warnings have been answered by a chorus of more optimistic, if lessconvincing, voices. Gebser, too, sees a “new age” approaching. But he isrealistic enough to know that it will not be a utopia. “Every consciousnessmutation,” he cautions, is “a sudden and acute manifestation of latentpossibilities present since origin.”9 [../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-9] “Sudden”and “acute” are the key words here, suggesting the equivalent of acivilizational ice age.10 [../Text/part0040.html#c27-FN-10]The “new factor” that Gebser believes can save us from complete destruction isthe emerging “aperspectival consciousness” of the “integral consciousnessstructure,” whose appearance he had recognized during his lightning-likeinspiration in Spain in 1932."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]THE INTEGRAL STRUCTUREGebser's descriptions of the new consciousness structure provide some of themost unwieldy passages in The Ever-Present Origin; here his neologizing reachesan evocative power and a density that will be difficult for all but the mostdedicated readers. This is to be expected; what is involved is nothing less thanour transformation, our “mutation,” into another form of reality. The present“deconstruction” of the mental-rational structure is in preparation for this newdispensation. There is no guarantee that the new structure will emerge beforethe total collapse of the old—that is up to us. The challenge is whether we willparticipate in the new mutation consciously, or simply be carried way by itseffects.As its name implies, the integral consciousness structure is characterized byintegration—in this case the integration of the previous four structures. Thisrecapitulation of “older,” more “primitive” forms of consciousness in a new modeis something we have already come across several times in this discussion. ForGebser it means a return to origin after our long progression away from it inthe various consciousness structures that have unfolded through time. Such areturn means several things for Gebser. One is what he calls the “concretizingof the spiritual.” As the word “concrete” suggests, this is a condition in which“the spiritual” becomes actually present and perceivable, no longer merelyintuited, conceptualized, or “felt.” With the “arational integral structure,”the actual originary “presence,” the primal “uncreated light,” is made apparent.The spiritual will be seen, not as an object among other objects, but as theinner radiance that has hitherto invisibly supported all objects, rather likethe Being Heidegger speaks of, which is itself not a being, but which allows allbeings to be. Related to this is what Gebser calls “diaphaneity.” The“diaphainon,” according to Feuerstein, is “that which ‘shines through,' namelythe ever-present spiritual origin.”1 [../Text/part0040.html#c28-FN-1] This“shining through” is what will become visible to the arational-integralconsciousness structure.Such a consciousness will participate in “diaphaneity” by virtue of its being“ego-free.” “Ego-freedom,” Gebser warns, is not to be confused with the simpleloss of ego, and its “blending” back into its source, characteristic of earlierstructures of consciousness and offered as the goal of many so-called spiritual,mystical, or magical paths. Nor is it to be seen as an ascetic denial ornegation of the self. Just as the progression of consciousness structuresfollows a course of “unperspectival,” “perspectival,” and “aperspectival”consciousness—which we can think of as point, line, and plane—so too does theego unfold through similar stages: from an egoless condition typical of thearchaic, magical, and mythical structures, to an “I” of the mental-rationalstructure, to, finally, a “transcendence” of the ego in the integral structure.This “transcendence” of the ego is actualized by the “concretion of thespiritual,” in which consciousness, in Gebser's term, “coalesces” with origin.Again, the idea is not to lose our sense of “I” by being absorbed into the“whole,” but to be aware of the whole and of ourselves as a part of itsimultaneously, another version of the “double consciousness” we have alreadyencountered. By consciously integrating the four previous structures andmastering their deficient modes—which, of course, would mean to become aware ofthem and their role in our lives—the “sheaths” or “layers” of consciousness thathave obscured the “uncreated light” become “transparent” and are seen asintegral parts of the ongoing “presencing” of origin, movements of a kind ofeternal symphony.We might say that until the emergence of the integral structure, consciousness,as it were, is in the position of someone viewing a painting with eyes only afew inches from the canvas. From this “perspective” we have an excellentopportunity to analyze fine brush strokes and textures of paint, but only of asmall area of the whole. The “painting” itself eludes us. (That much of modernscience and philosophy operates in such a position is, I believe, arguable.)With the “aperspectival” mode of consciousness, we can step back and see how thesmudges of color form a picture—that is, have meaning. And if this is true of apainting, it is also true of our relationship to the whole. From the point ofview of our perception and understanding of the universe, we are all smack upagainst a tiny portion of it, peering suspiciously at a fraction of reality andmaking our various assessments of such grand affairs as “life” and “the world.”It is inevitable that from the vantage points of our limited, mistrustful egos,these assessments are biased, prejudiced, and, for the most part, inaccurate. Inorder to make any judgments about “life,” “the world,” or anything else thatwould in any way be useful—and not merely a series of complaints—we would haveto be in a position to see much more of the picture than we do at the moment.This “bird's-eye view,” as Colin Wilson calls it, is the central characteristicof the emerging aperspectival consciousness. And although Gebser is at pains todifferentiate his insights from previous ideas about “other” forms ofconsciousness, clearly his “aperspectivalism” is related to various forms of“higher consciousness” we have discussed throughout this book—like Bucke's“cosmic consciousness” and Ouspensky's experiences with nitrous oxide. Bucke,Ouspensky, James, Steiner, Wilson, Mavromatis, Moskvitin, and the others all,like Gebser, see our present “ego-bound” consciousness as part of an ongoingdevelopment of consciousness—necessary and indispensable, but not an end goal.In different ways, each arrives at a remarkably similar conclusion. If“perspectival consciousness” is a function of the ego, then an “aperspectivalconsciousness” and a “transcendence” of the ego are clearly related.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Associated with this widening and multiplying of perspective is Gebser'sdifficult notion of “verition” or “waring.” Whereas the mental structure“conceptualizes” the world, the mythic structure “poeticizes” it, and themagical structure “vitalizes” it, the integral structure perceives it “intruth”—not as it appears to a function of a particular structure, but as thesource and support of those structures. In “verition” the world becomes “purestatement,” its meaning, presence, and being disclosing themselves asself-evident. “Waring” oneself or another reveals what Gebser calls the“itself,” the originary presence as it manifests in the human personality, our“apersonal” core, the essence, we can say, of our interiority once we havetranscended the ego.Reading Gebser on “aperspectivity,” “waring,” and the “integral consciousnessstructure,” one can agree with George Steiner that “our dictionaries lag behindour needs.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#c28-FN-2] Although Gebser's experience atSarnath came after he had written The Ever-Present Origin, the strongestimpression his account of the new consciouness makes is of its similarity tosome descriptions of satori—a wordless perception of actual being in all itsperfection. In satori, as well as in other “mystical” states—including onesinduced by drugs—“things,” the objects of the world, appear in an irreducible“givenness”; they are so “there,” so “real,” that language fails before them,and we are left, at best, with the silence that ends Wittgenstein's Tractatus.Things seen in satori are “im-mediate,” not “mediated” through the necessarylogical restrictions of language; under the influence of mescaline, AldousHuxley famously remarked that he saw as Adam must have seen on the first day ofcreation. There is an inexpressible “innocence of becoming,” in Nietzsche'sphrase, that we share with children—and that many of us spend the rest of ourlives trying to recapture—a freshness of perception that begins to fade as webegin to understand words, although poets have the ability to use wordsthemselves to revive this state of primal glory. Feuerstein's glossary ofGebser's terms is full of words beginning with the prefix “a”—“acategoricality,”“acausality,” “amensionality,” “aspatiality.” Like “asexual,” which meansneither sexual nor nonsexual, but a condition to which the notion of sexualitydoesn't apply, all of these “a” terms point to a kind of consciousness that haspassed beyond, “transcended,” the categories through which we usually understandour experience.In the integral structure, as in Hindu, Jewish, and Buddhist sacred scriptures,things are “neither this nor that”; they are “before” or “beyond”conceptualization. Likewise, given the Christian provenance of much of Gebser'sthought, his notion of the “concretion of the spiritual” has strong similaritieswith the idea of a “second coming” of Christ, similarities he again shares withRudolf Steiner, who spoke of a “reappearance of Christ in the etheric.” This,for Steiner, did not mean that Christ would “return” in another human body, asmany literal thinkers of both a New Age and fundamentalist stamp believe. Hemeant that in coming years the spiritual presence of Christ would becomeincreasingly perceptible to more people—an idea that seems to share much withGebser's notion of the spiritual becoming concrete. Gebser speaks of a “moreintensified Christianity” soon to emerge, after humanity passes through itspresent “three-day period of descent into hell.” With our “resurrection,”conditions on our planet will, one assumes, be considerably different.How and in what way they will be different is difficult to say since, as we haveseen, our language is geared to describe our world, the way it is now. But thatit is therefore impossible, as many mystics and philosophers have contended, tosay anything intelligible about a new or different world is, I believe, untrue.As Owen Barfield makes clear, the language we have now, like our consciousness,has developed over time, and what to us seem everyday figures of speech wouldhave been incomprehensible to people of an earlier age. So there is every reasonto believe that a century or two from now, with “aperspectivity” and theintegral structure more firmly in place, we may have a language capable ofsaying what to us is ineffable. And given the accelerating rate of change, sucha development may take place sooner than we think.3[../Text/part0040.html#c28-FN-3]Given an “accelerated rate of change,” there is, however, one aspect of the newconsciousness that is already accessible to us—it is, in fact, one that affectsour lives immediately and that many of us feel the discomforts (or pleasures) ofeach day. The meaning of two of the “a” words listed in Feuerstein's glossaryshould be more open to us: “achronon” and “atemporal” both speak of the changedrelationship of consciousness to time. At the opening of The Ever-PresentOrigin, Gebser speaks of our “altered relation to time” as being the centraltheme of the book. Later he speaks of something altogether more dynamic than amere alteration. The integral consciousness structure, he tells us, will bringabout an “irruption of time.”“To irrupt” means to “enter forcibly and suddenly.” We experience something ofthis quite commonly whenever someone “interrupts” us when we are speaking.Gebser suggests that not only the idea of time, but time itself will enter intoour lives more radically. It will “interrupt” our lives, break into ourexperience in new ways. If with Petrarch's ascent of Mount Ventoux Westernconsciousness entered a “space age,” with the turn of the nineteenth century, ithad, Gebser argues, entered a “time age.”Just as the different consciousness structures can be characterized by theirrelationship to space—“unperspectival,” “perspectival,” and “aperspectival”—sotoo can they be characterized by their relationship to time. Time as we know it,“linear” time that “moves” from a past through a present and into a future, is,Gebser says, a product of the mental-rational structure. Before that, the “time”of the mythical structure was cyclical: we see this in the Hindu idea of theyugas and in the ancient Greek notion of the four ages of gold, silver, bronze,and iron. In linear time the “past” no longer exists and the “future” has notyet happened, but in cyclical time this difference does not apply. “Past” and“future” are meaningless in a circle; in mythical time, events return to thebeginning, and the cycle starts again. We experience this with the seasons,although with the changes in weather patterns this “eternal return” may soon beupset. In the magical and archaic structures, there is no “time” at all, neitherlinear nor cyclical. Everything exists in a kind of pointlike present; we maythink of it as a series of disconnected dots or flashes of experience.(Having written this, it is clear to me that “time” and “self-consciousness” areintimately related. A newborn exists in a timeless state, punctuated by a seriesof discontinuous “nows” that take up its entire consciousness and recede intooblivion. A two-year-old enjoys a kind of “eternal return,” repeating patternsset down in the past—alterations in day-to-day activities meet with muchresistance. Only with the emerging “I” does the notion of time in anything likeour common sense of it arise, with fledgling ideas of “before,” “after,”“tomorrow,” “yesterday” taking hold. Given this, the fact that most of us remaintrapped in linear time throughout our lives seems to suggest that we never growup. A few get intimations of a kind of time beyond time, but usually only towardthe end of their lives when they do not have enough time left to make much useof this; and the people they express it to chalk it up to senility andsimple-mindedness.)Gebser points to the beginning of the twentieth century as the starting-pointfor the new “time consciousness.” We have already mentioned Einstein's part inthis; we could equally have spoken of Bergson's or Nietzsche's.4[../Text/part0040.html#c28-FN-4] Einstein, of course, altered “time” moreprofoundly than either philosopher, precisely because he was a scientist and nota mere “thinker”; in our scientistic age, it takes the voice of a scientist toeffect any large-scale change in things. (This was perhaps not so true in thenineteenth century: Hegel's philosophy had as profound an effect on the state ofthe world as could be imagined; for one thing, it more or less “created” theSoviet Union.)But Einstein was only one of many thinkers and artists for whom “time” hadbecome a central concern. The cubist visions of Picasso and Braque presented aperception of “simultaneity,” of “everythingatonce” rather than“one-thing-at-a-time.” Similarly in music Gustav Mahler's Ninth Symphony—a kindof Decline of the West in sound—began the “deconstruction” of the traditionalsymphonic form, a work that would be carried on by Arnold Schoenberg and hisatonal and twelve-tone systems, scattering the linear expectations of listenersused to the dramatic, dialectical structure of statement, challenge, andrecapitulation.5 [../Text/part0040.html#c28-FN-5] (The process had indeed begunhalf a century earlier with Wagner's famous “Tristan chord.”) In literature, aswe have mentioned, the novels of James Joyce, Thomas Mann, Robert Musil, HermannBroch, and others, introduced, to varying degrees, the experience of nonlineartime into their narratives, the greatest and most influential of these beingProust; time itself is the central theme of his massive opus. (Not everyone,however, was pleased about this development; in 1927, the artist and criticWyndham Lewis published Time and Western Man, in which he attacked the newfascination with temporal matters. Bergson, Proust, Joyce, and Whitehead came infor particular condemnation, and even Ouspensky received a slighting mention.)Poetry and theater also broke with traditional linear modes; August Strindbergemployed the “dream technique” that would become a standard part ofExpressionist drama, and T. S. Eliot's jagged and broken verse reflected thediscontinuity of experience felt by many.6 [../Text/part0040.html#c28-FN-6] Andarguably the most influential work of philosophy in the twentieth century had asone of its central foci time itself: Martin Heidegger's Being and Time (1927).Indeed, the new art forms that arose in the twentieth century used time as thebasic element. A painting is static; no matter how explosive its colors orforms, it exists in a kind of timeless moment. Not so cinema. The “movingpicture” introduced time into what was an essentially nontemporal realm; when weuse the colloquial phrase “the movies” today we are unaware of how radical abreak in human consciousness we are referring to. Films could even run againstlinear time, being shown backwards, or flout its remorseless annihilation ofexperience: anyone today can stop a video or DVD and watch a scene or an entirefilm again, something many of us would often like to do in “real life.” Soundrecording, of course, offered similar ways of altering time. A musicalperformance, unlike a painting, takes place in linear time, and once it is overit is gone, unless the performers play it again. But by the middle of thetwentieth century, anyone with a gramophone could put the needle back to thebeginning of the record and start again. Today, “multimedia” exhibits andinstallations using sound, video, and other electronic elements to create anexperience of “simultaneity” are a commonplace item in the art world.These changes are so familiar to us that it is difficult to grasp how new theyare. This is also true of the more recent “irruptions of time” that took placeas the last century closed. Unless, like myself, you are old enough to remembera time when computers were not a common household furnishing, things like theInternet, World Wide Web, mobile phones, and the other communication wondersthat dominate (or enrich) our lives will seem matter-of-fact. No doubt mychildren will accept them as a given, just as, for me, television was as much apart of “nature”—the world I found when I became aware of it—as a flower or thesun. Children who have grown up with the Web will take “simultaneity” and“multiple perception” for granted. For myself and others forty-something orolder, it has been a challenge to adjust my predominantly linear perception tothe new models. (Which is not to suggest that the new nonlinear consciousnesssupposedly engendered by the Web, etc., is a natural, or inevitable successor tothe throne; as much as I enjoy my computer and the Internet, most of myadjustment is sheer adaptation for survival.) This may not have been what Gebserhad in mind when he thought of time's irruption, but notwithstanding all thehype a new kind of perception has been emerging in the last few decades, and itis obvious that it has something to do with the rise of the computer.Image [../Images/00002.jpeg]Another, possibly more immediate, alteration in our experience of time is thesheer increase in the speed of everything. We live in an increasingly fastworld, a fact that brought the writer Milan Kundera to name one of his novelsSlowness. It is a cliché that today we move at a tempo our ancestors would havefound dizzying—as, indeed, many of us do: in his book Faster, science writerJames Gleich coins the phrase “hurry sickness.” The measurement of time has along history—the still classic and highly readable book to consult is J. B.Priestley's Man and Time7 [../Text/part0040.html#c28-FN-7]—and it is a curiousirony that church bells were first introduced to divide the day into sections oftime as an aid in synchronizing the meditation of monks. Today, the tables havebeen turned and the monks' timeless contemplation is a rarity. The bells havewon. In our hurrying world, it is time itself that counts.In 1972, the definition of a second was designated as 9,192,631,770 oscillationsof a cesium atom. Since then, this already fleeting segment of time—for allBergson's arguments, we still speak of time “spatially”—has been sliced intofiner and finer bits: the fermata, the nanosecond, the picosecond, thefemtosecond—which, at one quadrillionth of a second, reaches a degree oftemporal exactitude unappreciable by human consciousness. Just as elementaryparticles do not “exist” for us—we never have an immediate experience of anelectron, let alone a quark—such quantification has no real meaning for us. Andyet in our time-obsessed culture, there is a clear compulsion to slice time intosmaller and smaller pieces.The flipside to this is the injunction to “get the most out of your time.” Weknow of “fast food,” but that is just the start. The compulsion not to “wastetime” has gone beyond the few minutes devoted to nutrition. We speak of “realtime,” “time-sharing,” “multitasking”; time spent with our loved ones receivesthe hideous honorific of “quality time” (“Okay kids, let's have two hours ofloving each other”). The proliferation of amusements andentertainments—twenty-four-hour television offering hundreds ofchannels—produces the craving to “fill up” a day, or, conversely, to “kill time”between appointments. Instant accessibility produces a frenzy of empty activity.We are afraid of squandering time and do our best to “save” it—but clearly thereare no temporal banks into which we can make a deposit. To “save time” simplymeans either to complete a particular activity faster, or to combine severalactivities and perform them at the “same time”—one reflection of this being themultipurpose businesses that have become part of contemporary culture: theLaundromat that is also a bakery, the bookshop that provides cappuccino. Theidea that one should devote one's attention solely to a single task has, atleast in the popular mind, become old-fashioned; some writers, like CamilePaglia, revel in the new “multitasking” sensibility, boasting of their abilityto write while listening to the radio, watching the television, keeping an eyeon the Internet, and carrying on a telephone conversation, all simultaneously.(How such a regimen influences her writing is, sadly, a question I do not havetime for.) We live in a “cut to the chase, been there, done that” world, inwhich, conversely we do not want to “miss out” on anything. Perhaps this is whythe figure of the flaneur, the idler on the streets of nineteenth-century Paris,has become such an icon of contemporary cultural theory.That such a whirligig environment is affecting our perception has, of, course,been a subject of much discussion. For me, brought up on pop culture in the1960s and '70s, the frenetic, jittery camera style of much of today's televisionis, quite simply, unwatchable—whether or not the subject matter may be of someinterest or value. I do not see the world that way, although I am willing toaccept that many people do. (Then again, whether this is an actual shift inrepresentation or a “style” foisted on a passive public by an aggressive marketis another matter.) Such nonstop movement may be able to accommodate a greatdeal of material; but what it gains in quantity it loses in depth. We have heardabout the shortened attention span of today's teenagers. This same unwillingnessto linger over anything—one wonders how a film by Andrey Tarkovsky would faretoday—affects the other “media” as well. Postmodern prose has developed acynical syntax of the present, a verbal accompaniment to the digital “timepiece”(which, unlike the outmoded clock, displays no past or future—shades of Gebser's“ever-present) and the perpetual rush hour of the information highway. In this“nowspeak,” substance, character, emotion, tension, development and plotdissolve into a flat, television-like surface, punctuated by brand names anddesigner tags, whose immediacy jolts the skim-reader into a brief semblance ofattention.Along with this “will to the now,” there is a kind of hoarding of the past, an“archive mania” which, paradoxically, denies the past its true character. In itshands the past becomes a mere source of “information.” Unlike true historicalscholarship, there is no discrimination between what is worthy of being savedand what is not, what tells a story and what does not. Like Jorge Luis Borges'sunfortunate character Funes the Memorius, today's “information junkies” areeither unable or unwilling to forget anything. The result is an informationglut, a clutter of disconnected “facts,” the epistemological equivalent ofcollecting tinfoil, an inability to throw anything away, a disinclination to“waste” the smallest bit of “knowledge”—while, of course, at the same time thenatural world suffers a daily, mostly unrecoverable, expenditure.Ally to this the almost automatic “self-reflexivity” of a highly self-consciousculture, in which any new “product,” film, book, or performance, generatescritical comment almost instantaneously, and you have a milieu in which “works”are increasingly seen as mere triggers for analysis, thus producing anear-continuous flow of verbiage—which, naturally, will add to the alreadybloated reservoirs of “information.”"},{"pageContent":"LAST WORDSImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]PLAYING FOR TIMEIt would be easy to go on with this account of our life in the fast lane; wholebooks, like Gleich's, have been devoted to it. I have gone on at length aboutthe negative side of time's “irruption” merely to show that, at least on thisaccount, Gebser seems to have been prescient. If this were all there was to it,however, there would be little to look forward to except an increasinglyfrenetic world. More than likely that will be the case. But other aspects of thetime question seem also to have appeared. Not everyone is happy with the pace ofthings.Semicomical gestures like the Slow Food Movement, whose emblem is the snail, andmore serious organizations like The Long Now Foundation and the Society for theDeceleration of Time suggest that at least some of the population is determinedto drag its feet. And in the last few decades questions about time have gained asignificant foothold in the popular idea of the physical sciences—the success ofStephen Hawking's widely bought but little read A Brief History of Time (1988)clearly shows that. It is an axiom of both classical Newtonian as well asquantum physics that “time's arrow,” the relentless progression into the future,is a negligible factor. Time, scientists say, could flow backward, forward or inany direction, with no effect on our understanding of the laws of physics. Thisatemporality has received many shocks in recent years. Through the work of IllyaPrigogine on dissipative structures and the research of the celebrated Santa FeInstitute on chaos theory and complexity, “entropy,” the felt movement of time,has become a subject for serious investigation, providing good arguments againstthe strict determinism of standard physics and for such Bergsonian notions as“becoming” and “novelty.” Time is also a central theme in Rupert Sheldrake'scontroversial work on “morphogenetic fields,” as well as in his notion that theso-called laws of nature may not be Platonic constants, but may, like everythingelse, have “evolved” over time—an idea first presented in the early twentiethcentury by Alfred North Whitehead. Sheldrake's notion of the “presence of thepast,” the idea that life forms may possess a kind of “memory” not localized inthe strict mechanics of DNA but perhaps housed in a nonphysical field—firstpresented more than a century ago by Samuel Butler—is, as I remarked earlier,reminiscent of what we have seen of the Akashic Record, as well as of Bergson'sidea that the past “still exists” and is still “present to consciousness,”requiring but a slight adjustment on our part to be made available.In a different context, Bergson's ideas about time and consciousness receivedrenewed interest in 1994 when the literary critic Sven Birkerts published hisimportant book The Gutenberg Elegies. An inveterate reader, as the work's titlesuggests, Birkerts was troubled by what he saw as the demise of the book and thetriumph of the new “electronic media”—television and film, but most specificallythe rise of the computer screen—at the expense of the printed page. A sadnesspermeates the work, a sense of some irretrievable loss, which unfortunately ledsome reviewers to chalk the book up to Birkerts's own admitted melancholia. Butit is more than a mere exercise in nostalgia; his central concern is with theeffect the new “media” are having on our consciousness. He laments the loss of“deep time” and speaks of Bergson's “duration,” the meditative, expansiveimaginative time that accompanies true reading—the time that Samuel Richardsonfirst encountered and introduced to the Western world in 1740. This is the timeof Wilson's Faculty X and of the felt change in consciousness Owen Barfieldexperienced while reading poetry, not the tick-tock time of a cesium atom.Birkerts fears that with the rise of the flat computer screen and its muchtouted “simultaneity,” the ability of reading to open up inner depths and to,quite literally, slow down time is lost. There is something more to the idea of“sinking into a book” than a mere metaphor for absent-mindedness. (Indeed, if itis absent from “here,” that mind is also “present” elsewhere: in Homer's Troy,Dickens's London, Dostoyevsky's St. Petersburg, or even Birkerts's own elegiacreflections.) For all the Internet's impressive access to “information”—the“world of knowledge” it supposedly puts at our fingertips—such an ability totransport us to “other times and places” is lost to it and its like. Combinedwith the host of other technological advances, the instant accessibility of theInternet, coupled with the ephemeral “ever-perishing” character of itselectronic medium, has, Birkerts asserts, created a unique situation. “In thepast fifty years or so, something in the nature of time—or in our experience ofit—has changed radically. . . . The shape of the very frame of things hasaltered.” We have reached a condition of “critical mass,” the first stages of aunprecedented transition, the upshot of which is that “our old understandings oftime—and, therefore, of life itself—are in many ways useless.” Birkerts evenuses Gebser's preferred term for radical change, suggesting that “the human timeexperience may be undergoing a fundamental mutation.” The similarities of themesand vocabulary are striking. Birkerts speaks of “the sound- and image-saturatednow,” the “cataract of data and imagery.”1 [../Text/part0040.html#last-FN-1]This focus on the pictorial rather than the literal is of course an expressionof the decline of the linear in favor of the simultaneous, a decline thatBirkerts, an old-school reader, regards with dismay. Others, however, do not seethis shift in such dire terms. As we have seen, in The Alphabet versus theGoddess (chapter 18), Leonard Shlain welcomes the return of the image after itsmillennia-long subjugation by reading, writing, and the “abc's.” It wasprecisely the development of the alphabet with its heightening of left-brainconsciousness, Shlain argues, that has led to many, if not all, of the crisesconfronting us at the start of the twenty-first century. The various forms ofsimultaneity, and the “image-centered” culture of the electronic media, are, heargues, to be welcomed, not feared, for they presage the advent of a new“participatory,” feminine, nonlinear, and hence nonabusive, “concrete” thinking.The idea that “the next step” in the evolution of consciousness will involve a“return” to a pictorial kind of thinking, or at least to a thinking that exceedsthe limits of language, has been a recurring theme in this book. We have seen itin the image of Ouspensky's ashtray. It forms the essence of Steiner's notion ofImagination. It is the principle characteristic of hypnagogia. Owen Barfieldwrote of it in his discussion of “beta-thinking” and “representation,” as didJurij Moskvitin in his experience of the “selective forms.” A pictorial kind ofthinking is more than likely the kind of thinking, if we may call it that,experienced by our early ancestors—a metaphorical, image-based participation inthings. It is the kind of thinking Schwaller de Lubicz called the “intelligenceof the heart.” It is also the “fresh” experience of things we have as children.Colin Wilson's “Faculty X” is the grasp of other times and places—sometimes, aswe have seen, to the extent of actually being transported there. So there ismuch to say for this new imagistic consciousness. And if the speculations of thethinkers discussed in this book are only halfway valid, then, whatever ourpreferences, the species as a whole may be moving in this direction.So Shlain may be right. But if Birkerts's reflections are sound, then Shlain'swelcoming of the return of the image at the expense of the verbal ego is atleast a bit premature. After all, it was precisely through images andspectacle—not rational, linear arguments—that the Nazi totalitarian regimesecured its grip on a people. Linearity and the abstract thinking it promotesundoubtedly have their drawbacks. But the simultaneous, imagistic world of theInternet and electronic media is not necessarily an antidote. As Gebser knew,images and symbols operate at the level of the magical structure, bypassing thecritical, reflective mind. The perpetual “now” of the ever-present Internet doesnot allow for the deep, meditative time in which the mind can focus on valuesand understand why it thinks as it does. A picture may be worth a thousandwords, but without the words to tell you, you may not even know what you arelooking at—something all good advertisers know. The aperspectivalism andirruption of time offered by our new electronic Anthroposphere may be the firstglobal evidence of a shift in human consciousness—early advocates of the “wiredworld” were quick to forge links with Teilhard de Chardin and his Omega Point.But it may also be a final efflorescence of our “deficient” mental-rationalstructure.Steiner, Gebser, Wilson, Barfield, and others all make a point of stating quiteclearly that the ego, while in need of transcendence, is not simply to bejettisoned. An image-based consciousness rooted in the usurpation of languageand the rational ego may merely throw the baby out with the bathwater. And inany case, the kind of right-brain-dominant consciousness that Shlain envisionshas already been tried; it is a historically older form of consciousness, andthe left-brain ego developed out of it—necessarily, I would say, as Steiner,Gebser, Barfield, and others do—in order to complement it. A completelyleft-brain consciousness would be—is—a burden and a mistake: we have seen theeffects of such a consciousness in the increasing loss of meaning over the lastfour centuries. But a plunge into a postmodern version of Steiner's Old Moonconsciousness or into an electronic version of Gebser's mythical consciousnesswould have an equally retrograde effect. As in other circumstances, theGoldilocks rule applies here as well. If anything, duo-consciousness and itselusive “just right” have been a central theme in these meditations. The formula“right brain good, left brain bad” that Shlain applies to the history of Westernconsciousness is, for all the profitable insights he draws from it—and his bookhas many—in the end simplistic. The Internet, simultaneity, and various otherforms of the “return of the image” may indicate a change in consciousness. Butthey may not be that change itself. As in so many things, only time will tell.Yet, while the Internet and other electronic advances may not embody the “nextstep” in human evolution, it is difficult, considering the work of the thinkersI have discussed in this book, to come away without feeling that some shift inthings is imminent. In various ways, practically all the thinkers we have lookedat have argued that human consciousness, at least in the Western world, iseither on its way toward, or is in the first stages of, a radical change in itsmental furnishings. And likewise, practically all of them have argued that atleast part of this change will entail a new experience of time. I have placedJean Gebser at the end because he seems to me to have argued this point mostclearly and to have supplied an enormous amount of evidence for it.When P. D. Ouspensky began his experiments with the “fourth dimension,”evolution was still a relatively recent idea, and the new physics was still inits infancy. Today, both ideas occupy a dominant place in our understanding ofourselves. Indeed, our grasp of these and other difficult concepts and thesuccess science has had in applying them have resulted in the hubris of attemptsto explain what, short of the existence of life and of the universe itself, isundoubtedly the central mystery of our experience: consciousness. Yet, as Iremarked in the introduction, to explain consciousness means, in essence, toexplain ourselves—and when that core mystery is gone, something great andpowerful will also be lost. When the mystery of the self, of personhood, isreduced to some quantifiable formula, whether in terms of atoms, molecules,genes or adaptive behavior, then the world we live in will no longer be, asagainst all odds it still is today, a human one. As the philosopher LeszekKolakowski warns, such a world will be one in which a person is not an end inhimself, but “is reducible to his function; it will accept, in other words, thateach person is entirely replaceable. Such a civilization would signal the end ofhumanity as we know it.”2 [../Text/part0040.html#last-FN-2]Remarking that we are on the brink of such a transformation may put me in thecompany of other Cassandras—less eloquent and impassioned, no doubt, but morethan likely equally as effective. Yet, if we are to avoid the future thatKolakowski envisions, its dark possibilities must be faced. In different ways,disciplines and intellectual pursuits as far apart as genetics, neuroscience,the philosophy of mind, and poststructualism have argued that the “human being”as we know it—meaning endowed with spirit and free will and possessed of certaininalienable rights—is an outmoded and obsolete conception, a fallacy of pastthinking that our more rigorous experts have outgrown. Given the thrust of theseideas and their rapid spread throughout our culture—they are already mother'smilk to a generation of university students—unless some countervision ofourselves arises, their triumph is almost certain to be a fait accompli. Steinerhad forebodings of something of this sort, I think, when he spoke of a coming“Ahrimanic future,” yet he, and others in this book, offered a way to avoidthis. Another transformation seems to be our only chance. As all the thinkers inthis book have argued, this must be a transformation of consciousness itself. Ihave tried to show that the potential for this is available, and that the meansof actualizing it are within our grasp.But this shift itself will not be a picnic. As Morris Berman points out, “Itwill take a century or two” to arrive at a “new paradigm,” and the passage to it“will more than likely include wars, famine, depressions.”3[../Text/part0040.html#last-FN-3] Not a cheerful thought. But we already havewars, famine, and depressions without their leading to any great change;Berman's disturbing vision sounds more like “business as usual”—with thepossibility of our arriving at something “different.” How different is, ofcourse, something we cannot know. History is littered with the ruins of thefuture, and the fallout of failed prophecy. R. M. Bucke, with whom we began oursearch for “cosmic consciousness,” believed that the onset of the twentiethcentury would bring an age of unparalleled social and personal fulfillment.Utopia was just around the corner. Clearly, he was wrong. Rudolf Steiner, on theother hand, in the aftermath of one world war and the brief peace beforeanother, spoke ominously of coming catastrophes, of a super-Orwellian age inwhich spirit would be crushed beneath the scientific-rationalist heel. Steiner'sprophecy is chilling and eerily prescient, and, coming from such an optimistic,forward-looking thinker, is doubly unsettling.4[../Text/part0040.html#last-FN-4] Yet in our own time, Colin Wilson has seen thepossibility of a new, liberated consciousness reflected in the dark glass ofserial killing—as unlikely a place as we could imagine for securing thepossibility of a coming era of “self-actualization.” Surely the ways of thespirit are crooked and unclear, and predictions from “current tendencies” shouldbe taken cum grano salis.Gebser himself warned that we should not lose ourselves in great expectations.As he wrote in one of his last books, “The world will never become a paradise.If it did, its existence would become illusory. Let us not deceive ourselves andsuccumb to false hopes. The world will not become much better, merely a littledifferent, and perhaps somewhat more appreciative of the things that reallymatter.”5 [../Text/part0040.html#last-FN-5]At the beginning of a new millennium, in a time when the mystery of things—andnot only consciousness—is fading in the misdirected light of “explanation,” apossible future that will be “more appreciative of the things that reallymatter” is something to look forward to."},{"pageContent":"NOTESImage [../Images/00002.jpeg]Introduction: Consciousness Explained?1 [../Text/part0005.html#FN1].

Early in his career,endorsing the Victorian belief that masturbation promotes mental disability,Bucke briefly instituted the precedent of “wiring” the penis to prevent his malepatients from abusing themselves. The results were equivocal and the practicesoon abandoned. Later, he practiced gynecological surgery as a treatment forinsanity in women, again with debatable results. His notions, savage to us, werein keeping with the interest in endocrinology popular at the time, and wereprompted by a recognized need for more active methods of treating mentalillness. Bucke later abandoned surgery and in his last years developed plans fora self-sufficient therapeutic community, an idea years ahead of its time.

Henri Bergson and the Élan Vital1 [../Text/part0009.html#FN1]. One of the earliest, most vocal, and incisive ofthese was Samuel Butler, who summed up his antipathy to the strict mechanicalinterpretation of Darwinian evolution with the complaint that Darwin had“banished mind from the universe.” In a series of brilliant, eloquent andeccentric books—Life and Habit, Unconscious Memory, Luck or Cunning—Butlerproceeded to make clear the inadequacies of Darwin's hypothesis, drawing onideas remarkably similar to Rupert Sheldrake's “morphic resonance.” Butler'sideas later influenced George Bernard Shaw, another outspoken opponent of strictDarwinian evolution. In an age drunk on the success of science, however, boththinkers were considered cranks and their criticisms had little effect on theircontemporaries.2 [../Text/part0009.html#FN2]. Years later, Aldous Huxley, in The Doors ofPerception, called upon Bergson's notion of the brain as a “reducing valve” toaccount for the effects of mescaline on consciousness.3 [../Text/part0009.html#FN3].

I should at this point address a question that inrecent years has put views such as Bergson's out of fashion. The question, thatis, if there is any way to judge a species' “superiority” and hence “rank” inthe order of evolution, with the corollary that humankind forms no higherspecies or goal and is merely one among a multiplicity of other livingorganisms, with no particular meaning or purpose. Indeed, some radicalbiocentric thinkers argue that humankind is a degenerate species, one the planetwould be better off rid of.To me, this question seems motivated more by muddled political concerns than byanything else. Clearly an increase of freedom and intelligence, hence choice andcreativity, is a valid and worthy gauge by which to judge evolutionary advance,and I accept Bergson's view that in human beings these properties reach a degreeof expression that so far seems unattainable by other species. Obviously, theonly means I have to judge this is by the very “humanness” whose superiority isin question. But then, it is by the same means that the advocates of“enlightened misanthropy” advance their views. The biocentrists who declare thatan owl, bear, or other endangered species is more “valuable” than humankind canonly arrive at that thought through their being human. As far as we can tell, noowl or bear or other species can. It is only human beings who are concernedabout the dangers of a mistaken appreciation of their value in the scope oflife, just as it is only human beings who are concerned about the environment.To say this is not to say that we are not faced with tremendous ecologicalproblems, brought on by our own selfishness and ignorance. Clearly we are. Butto argue, for example, that Beethoven is no “higher” than an amoeba is surelynot going to do much in the way of this. On the contrary, it is only byrecognizing our responsibilities as agents of life's creative advance that wecan muster the will and intelligence to face this challenge. And if thebiocentrist says that I only find Beethoven “higher” and “valuable” because I amhuman, I can only say that yes, I agree, but that this adds nothing to thediscussion, other than the tautology that because I am human I have humanvalues. Yet, what other values are there? If we subtract these “human values” weare left with no gauge at all, no means to judge anything, and certainly no wayof arguing that we should in any way be concerned about other species. (Wewould, I believe, be unable to carry on any kind of conversation whatsoever.)Even the biocentrists' ethic that puts animal life higher than the human isitself a human value. They would not think that if they weren't human.10 [../Text/part0009.html#FN10]. A digression here seems in order. Nothing iseasier than to point out the lack of evidence for our time exhibiting any“creative advance” over earlier periods, except in the sense of technologicalprogress, which in the last century was the accepted definition of progressitself. Indeed, in many ways we seem to show a good deal of “degeneration” and“decadence”—rising crime rates, looming ecological disasters, social breakdown,the lowering of intellectual and civil standards, “dumbing down,” and popularvulgarity, to name just a few. And our tendency to view the achievements of thepast as existing on a higher level from which we have slipped—recent postmodernand politically correct sensibilities notwithstanding—remains strong. If the“creative advance” of civilization were to be judged in a strictly linear,progressive fashion, then these criticisms would have to stand. Indeed, I agreewith many of them and it is not my purpose to argue that the early twenty-firstcentury is necessarily more advanced than, say, the fifteenth, tenth, orwhichever one you may choose. What I do believe is that what is asked of us isto view the entire period of humankind's coming into self-consciousness—thebeginning of which varies depending on your sources, but which we may forconvenience say was certainly achieved by at least 3000 B.C.—as the time inwhich the mind or consciousness began to lift itself out of the heavy slumber ofmatter. Within that period, which is anywhere between five and ten thousandyears, we have certainly seen nothing like the simple, neat, and gratifying“progression” from bestial savagery to “modern civilization,” so enamored ofnineteenth- and early twentieth-century thinkers. What we do see, I believe, arethe struggles of consciousness to understand itself and the world, to giveexpression to that understanding, and to use that understanding to discover andexplore new areas of itself and the world. Paradoxically, a study of history,ostensibly of the “past,” shows us how closely involved we are with it, and howevents seemingly distant from us need millennia to be worked out. Thedistractions and harangue of a shifting, fleeting “present” conceal from us ourlink to impulses initiated centuries ago, whose fulfillment may depend on ourcooperation.4. The Superman1 [../Text/part0010.html#FN1]. See also the eagle and snake symbolism of workslike Thus Spoke Zarathustra, both animals being familiar totems of alchemy. LikeSchopenhauer, Nietzsche was aware of Eastern thought, and while denying any kindof “other world,” his writing is driven by passionate “spiritual” questions andinsights. Nietzsche's attack on Christianity was prompted by the self-serving,hypocritical variety prominent in Europe at the time (and today) and was fueledby a profound need to find a deeper “meaning” for human beings than what itprovided. Schopenhauer's “will,” incidentally, is the same as Bergson's lifeforce, except that for Schopenhauer, a pessimist, its strivings were pointless.Nietzsche and Bergson were life-affirmers and took the opposite view.2 [../Text/part0010.html#FN2]. There are, of course, some severe problems withthis notion. If taken seriously at face value, eternal recurrence cannot beexperienced as either eternal or recurrent since, if everything recurs againexactly as it happens now—and has recurred such throughout eternity—there wouldbe no difference between “this” recurrence and either an “earlier” or “later”one. And being identical, we would have no means of telling them apart, even ifwe somehow had proof of the reality of recurrence. Each recurrence would appearto us as the “same time,” and hence seemingly occurring only once. If recurrenceis true and if it is eternal, I could only experience it as such if I hadalready done so in an earlier recurrence—which means that I would have to beaware of recurrence “from the beginning,” as it were, and so always aware of it,or at least aware of it in each recurrence. Which means that if I becameconvinced of its reality, say, tomorrow, my experience of that conviction musthave happened in an earlier recurrence, and will happen again in the next. Addto this the whole problem of “the first time” in a process that is supposedlyeternal, and we can see how difficult it is to make sense of it. Which is not tosay that the idea does not have transformative power, as it clearly does, andthat this was Nietzsche's true interest in it. For all his unconvincing attemptsto “prove” recurrence “scientifically” (see the collection of his notespublished posthumously as The Will to Power), Nietzsche, I believe, was notreally concerned with this aspect of the idea, but with whether or not itaffected one's attitude toward life. It was, as he makes clear in The GayScience, where the notion first appears, a test of whether one could say “Yes”to life or not. Subsequent writers who adopted the theme, like P. D. Ouspenskyand the novelist and playwright J. B. Priestley, abandoned this aspect of it,and focused instead on the possibility of becoming aware of one's recurrence andhence making changes in one's life. For a thoughtful study of the similaritiesbetween Nietzsche's recurrence and Rilke's doctrine of “once only” announced inthe Duino Elegies, see the brilliant essay “Rilke and Nietzsche” by Erich Hellerin The Importance of Nietzsche.3 [../Text/part0010.html#FN3].

One problem with this notion however is how the Inner Circle itself“evolved.” If all civilization is the product of “artificial cultivation,” howdid the “first” civilization come about?

Lyell's notion is known as uniformitarianism, andit argues that the same processes taking place now have taken place at the samerate in the past: the waves that crash against the shore today have done so inthe same way for aeons. Periodically Lyell's dictum is challenged by one versionor other of catastrophism, which argues that over the ages, the Earth has beensubject to sudden convulsions of one form or another. One popular account in the1950s, Immanuel Velikovksy's best-seller Worlds in Collision, argued that acomet nearly crashed into the Earth, causing terrific damage and, incidentally,accomplishing some of the miracles recounted in the Bible.

Spiritualism's menu of raps, table turning,messages from the dead, floating tambourines, and whatnot strikes us as silly,if not suspiciously morbid. But for a generation told that they were nothing buta collection of chemical reactions, evolved by chance in a universe doomed tocertain extinction, materializing spirits and levitating mediums seemed to offersome hope. If such things could be, then science was wrong—or at least it hadleft a good deal out of the equation. The idea that only the feebleminded weredrawn to séances is incorrect, although they participated in abundance. As wehave seen, thinkers as acute as William James and Henri Bergson were in thethick of it, along with Oliver Lodge, Thomas Edison, Sir William Crookes,Camille Flammarion, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The situation was similar towhat we find today with the “New Age”: people who are unsatisfied with the“scientific” account of human existence that declares we are either puppets of“selfish genes” or mere assortments of molecules, yet find little solace inrecognized religion, seek out alternative routes to personal and spiritualmeaning. Much of this is certainly sensation seeking, and the metaphysicalmarketplace offers a wide selection of spiritual fashions—but not all.

In modern times the idea that the Earth is aliving organism was perhaps first proposed by the German psychologist TheodoreFechner. In Tertium Organum Ouspensky adapts Fechner's idea to his vision of a“pluralistic” evolution and proposes that the various levels of consciousnessrepresented by the human, animal, and plant world may not have evolvedsequentially out of each other, but may instead be the different butsimultaneous and interconnected functions of one organism.

Steiner tells the story in An Autobiography.This, of course, is the best place to start for accounts of his life;unfortunately, it was left unfinished at the time of his death and only coversthe period up to 1907. Besides Colin Wilson's book already mentioned, otherbiographies include Rudolf Steiner: Herald of a New Epoch by Stewart Easton; AScientist of the Invisible by A. P. Sheperd (Edinburgh: Floris Classics, 1983);and Rudolf Steiner: A Documentary Biography by Johannes Hemleben (Sussex: HenryGoulden Limited, 1975).4 [../Text/part0016.html#FN4]. Another possible influence was the best-sellingThe Great Initiates by the dramatist and critic Edouard Schuré, published inFrance in 1889. Schure's book is a massive spiritual history of humankind, toldin the form of biographies of its great religious teachers. Schuré argued thatall religions share a secret, esoteric side not perceived by the masses, butrecognized by those with the requisite insight, and that its message has beenhanded down, from initiate to initiate through the centuries. Marie von Sivers,whom Steiner met in Berlin in 1900 and who first suggested that it was hisdestiny to lead a new spiritual renaissance, knew Schuré and was deeplyinfluenced by his book, which she translated. In 1902, by which time she hadbecome Steiner's companion (she would eventually become his second wife),Steiner delivered a series of lectures that would later become the substance ofhis book Christianity as Mystical Fact, part of which advances the view ofChrist as an “initiate”—an idea that would not cause much concern today but wasradical at the time. Schuré was Steiner's senior by twenty years; nevertheless,he recognized in the younger man a great spiritual power, and soon became adedicated follower—indicative of the kind of confidence Steiner instilled inthose who knew him.10.

An example of the difference between primary andsecondary qualities can be seen in music. For us, what emerges when the hammerof a piano strikes the strings in a certain order is a sonata by Mozart orBeethoven, which we deem beautiful according to our taste and the ability of thepianist. For “scientists” what emerges are silent vibrations of air, which areunaffected by sequence or performance. What is of absolute value to us is,insofar as they are in pursuit of “truth,” irrelevant to scientists. Their“reality” likewise leaves us unmoved.3 [../Text/part0017.html#FN3]. A good account of Goethe's ideas on color can befound in Arthur Zajonc's brilliant Catching the Light, which can also be read asan account of the evolution of consciousness from the point of view of ourexperience of light. Elsewhere he writes, “The qualitative experience of colorin humans is incidental to the discipline of physics.” But, he adds, “Thissituation is emphatically not the case for the science of human consciousness.The phenomena at the center of study are precisely the phenomena of consciousexperience” (in Hammeroff et. al. eds., Toward a Science of Consciousness III,p. 417).4 [../Text/part0017.html#FN4].

As with many fundamental philosophical questions,a difficulty arises from the tool we have to grapple with them: language.Steiner was correct to suggest that the phrase “spiritual activity” would becloser in English to the experience he wished to convey than the literalequivalent of freiheit, freedom. Yet even that suffers from the blunt, unwieldynecessity of using one word to designate different, but related, experiences.Most of us would argue that simply in reading Steiner's—or anyone's—book, wewere being mentally “active.” But then, what is the difference between reading abook about Steiner's, or anyone's, life and absorbing the facts, and thenreading it and having the sudden vivid realization while reading that thisperson was not simply a name on a page, but an actual person who lived andbreathed and to whom these things happened? We do not have a word to clearly andunambiguously denote this difference, yet it is the difference between “merelyliving” and feeling the unmistakable reality of life. I may say that I am afree, active being and acknowledge the truth of that statement. But to feel itis something other.8 [../Text/part0017.html#FN8].

Also, JohnHenry Mackay, author of the standard biography of Stirner, Max Stirner: seinLeben und sein Werk (1897), was a friend of Steiner's during his Berlin period.11 [../Text/part0017.html#FN11]. Rittelmeyer, Rudolf Steiner Enters My Life, p.61.12 [../Text/part0017.html#FN12]. For the suggestion that Steiner read theAkashic Record during hypnagogic states I am indebted to Colin Wilson. SeeRudolf Steiner: The Man and his Vision. That Steiner associated hypnagogicstates with spiritual perception is clear from remarks he made in a lecturegiven in 1918, later published as The Dead Are With Us (London: Rudolf SteinerPress, 1964). “Besides waking life and sleeping life there is a third state evenmore important for intercourse with the spiritual world. . . . I mean the stateconnected with the act of waking and the act of going to sleep” (pp. 18–19).11. Cosmic Evolution1 [../Text/part0018.html#FN1]. Clearly we can see the ancient tradition of thefour elements in the first four planetary incarnations: fire, air, water, andearth. But one thing does seem odd. Although one would think that the element offire, or “heat,” should be associated with the Sun, Steiner instead chose Saturnas the initial stage of the cosmic evolutionary process. There is perhaps areason for this. For Steiner, “matter” evolves out of spirit. Each of theplanetary stages he discusses represents an increasing density of matter: from“heat,” or fire, to earth is a process of increasing condensation. Heat, as weknow, is electromagnetic radiation of a certain wavelength. Its physicality isminimal, so it would make sense to introduce it as the first step in a processof gradual “materialization.” And heat makes sense as well in terms of currentideas on the origin of the universe. Big Bang theory argues that the universebegan as an inconceivably hot, incredibly dense “point” which—for no apparentreason—“exploded” some ten to twenty billion years ago. So Steiner, who knewnothing of the Big Bang—the idea wasn't mooted until George Gamov and hiscolleagues first developed the theory in the 1940s and 1950s—made a prettyaccurate “guess.” In fact, if one ignores his terminology, much of Steiner'saccount parallels what can be found in scores of popular science books.But why Saturn? Two possibilities come to mind. One is that Saturn was theancient god of time, as well as the ruler of the Golden Age, the mythicalparadise of the earliest times. According to contemporary cosmological theory,“time” itself began with the Big Bang, so having Saturn at the outset makes atleast mythological sense. But there is another possible reason. Saturn is alsoassociated astrologically with contraction, concentration, and constraint;people of a “saturnine” disposition are prone to melancholy and frustration.That the terrific “heat” that preceded the universe was contracted into aninconceivably dense “point” seems a fairly “saturnine” condition, and againSteiner's nomenclature is surprisingly accurate. But this physical contractionhas psychological and spiritual parallels. In a series of lectures given inBerlin in 1911, Steiner remarked that the picture of cosmic evolution presentedin An Outline of Esoteric Science was, although “correct,” “deeply immersed inMaya and Illusion” (The Inner Realities of Evolution [London: Rudolf SteinerPublishing Company, 1953], p. 21).Steiner seems to hit the Big Bang nail right on the head when he goes on to say,“Of space there was none in our sense on ancient Saturn. And time first cameinto being there” (ibid.). But what he is at pains to communicate is that eventhese abstract yet still relatively “physical” accounts are not the full truthabout ancient Saturn. Steiner admits that in his written accounts he had todescend into the trappings of maya in order not to “startle” the public. Giventhat the account of cosmic evolution presented in An Outline of Esoteric Scienceis fairly startling itself for an unprepared reader, one wonders what it isSteiner was trying to obscure. What the reader of the lectures in The InnerRealities of Evolution discovers is that the real character of our previousplanetary existences has more to do with certain moral and existential states ofconsciousness than with metaphors of increasingly dense materiality. Steinertold his audience in Berlin that the true nature of the Saturn condition wasthat of a “dreadful emptiness into which flows fear” (ibid., p. 11). An initiateseeking to understand the state of consciousness during the Saturn incarnationmust be able to feel “his environment tinged and saturated with that whichinspires dread and fear wherever he turns” (ibid., p. 10), and also the innerstrength and certainty to overcome this fear. Considering that people born“under the sign of Saturn” are usually given an ample share of angst, Steiner'sinsights seem remarkably appropriate. In the lectures Steiner remarks that hehas searched contemporary literature for any sign of an awareness of this“Saturn condition,” and declares there is little to be found. This was in 1911.He died in 1925, two years before Martin Heidegger's massive meditation on humanbeings' “thrownness” into Being, Sein und Zeit. When Steiner gave his lectures,Kierkegaard had not yet been rediscovered, Jean-Paul Sartre was five years old,and existentialism, with its chorus of dread, anxiety, fear, and nothingness,would not become an intellectual and cultural fad for at least another twentyyears. In his pronouncements on a primordial psychic condition, Steiner seems tohave anticipated the spiritual emptiness that would dominate the Western popularconsciousness until the revival of the occult and mysticism in the 1960s.2 [../Text/part0018.html#FN2].

Ouspensky wrote of his remarkable experienceswith both hypnagogia and “lucid dreams,” a related phenomenon, in the chapter“On the Study of Dreams and On Hypnotism” in A New Model of the Universe. Thebest account of Swedenborg's familiarity with hypnagogic states can be found inWilson Van Dusen's books The Natural Depth in Man and The Presence of OtherWorlds. Hypnagogia is also intimately related to the practice of “activeimagination” developed by C. G. Jung.

Experiments with paroptic vision were carried outin the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by the scientists CesareLombroso and Jules Romains, with startling results. (See Colin Wilson'sPoltergeist [1981] and Afterlife [1987] for an account of Lombroso's work.) Thepoet René Daumal, later a student of G. I. Gurdjieff, carried out several “blindsight” experiments with a colleague of Romains.

Mavromatis, like other theorists such as ArthurKoestler, suggests that creativity, like hypnagogia, is a kind of “regression”to an earlier, prerational kind of thinking. Given this, it isn't surprising tofind synesthesia as a characteristic of several creative individuals. Thecomposer Olivier Messiaen, for example, saw colors while hearing, and evenreading, music. The novelist Vladimir Nabokov was a synestheist, as were thepoets Baudelaire and Rimbaud. Much of the psychedelic art of the 1960s,associated with the use of mind-altering drugs whose effect is associated with a“regression” to prerational states of consciousness, was synesthetic.6 [../Text/part0019.html#FN6].

Curiously, Gurdjieff speaks of human beings as“three-brained beings” in Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson, a work written inthe 1930s, considerably before the notion of a “triune brain” became popular inthe 1960s through the work of Paul McLean.8 [../Text/part0019.html#FN8].

The fact that Eisler at age six was a refugeefrom Nazi Germany may account for her particular animus toward thinkers likeNietzsche, whom she associates with Hitler's unquestionably repulsive politicalviews. Nietzsche had indeed been appropriated by Nazi ideologues for a brieftime, mostly through the influence of his sister, Elisabeth-Forster-Nietzsche, arabid anti-Semite, Aryanophile, and promilitarist. But when it became clear thatNietzsche's views on just about everything were as remote from the Nazis' aspossible, he was quickly cast aside. Nietzsche was an outspokenanti-anti-Semite, an eloquent opponent of German militarism (and militarism ingeneral), and, contrary to Ms. Eisler's remarks, a profoundly spiritualindividual. That Eisler repeats many of the stock misrepresentations of hisideas, as well as the standard quotations taken out of context, displays herunderstandable zeal in promoting her cause, but does little to forward it.2 [../Text/part0023.html#FN2].

The dates for Neanderthals are much later thanwhat we would suppose for the initial “human beings” who possessed Steiner's OldMoon consciousness. Yet as Steiner makes clear, that consciousness did not endwith the evolution of Old Moon into Earth; it lingered on, and it was not untilthe fourth and fifth post-Atlantean epochs that the kind of clear, rationalconsciousness we experience today became dominant. So although Neanderthalsappeared much later than the time of Old Moon, their consciousness couldcertainly have shared many of its characteristics. Likewise, the consciousnessof the Cro-Magnons who supplanted the Neanderthals seems, at least according toGooch, to be much more like that of our own, yet, given Steiner's timeline, theyappeared during the age of Atlantis. But just as the Old Moon consciousnesscontinued for a time beyond Old Moon itself, our clear, waking consciousness mayhave had its beginnings with the Cro-Magnons. It is also possible that theGoddess worshippers of Marija Gimbutas's Old Europe were close descendants ofNeanderthals, or of “modern” humans with more Neanderthal “in” them thanCro-Magnon, just as the opposite may have been true for the Kurgan warriors.On the subject of “Moon consciousness” in general, the idea that an ancientuniversal religion based on magic and the worship of the Moon predated our ownsolar, logical civilization was perhaps first proposed by Robert Graves in hisclassic The White Goddess (1948). The idea, of course, has by now become part ofthe common stock of popular pagan, occult, and esoteric ideas, finding amajority of its adherents in the variety of Wiccan practices available today.It may be well to comment on the disparity of time periods that may arise whenrelating the ideas of different thinkers about the evolution of consciousness.This will become more apparent when we discuss the work of Jean Gebser, which inmany ways bears important similarities with that of Rudolf Steiner. Rather thanattempt an exact chronological correlation, which I believe is not possible nornecessary, what strikes me as important in showing any such relation is tounderstand the similarity in the kind of consciousness described, and not thesupposed historical periods during which they are believed to have existed. ThatSteiner, Mavromatis, and now Gooch all, in different ways, point to a kind ofconsciousness that in a general sense seems to have preceded our own is, to me,the important thing, and not whether or not they match up chronologically.Having said this, I believe there are enough points of contact between thespecifics of their different theories to at least suggest the possibility theyare all talking about the same thing.4 [../Text/part0023.html#FN4]. See especially Cities of Dreams, pp. 242–249.5 [../Text/part0023.html#FN5]. Ideas about and preferences in sexuality arguablymay stem from one's own “consciousness type.” Highly “individualized” charactersmay find the idea of group sex off-putting, although not necessarily for reasonsof morality or prudery. I have not had an opportunity to research this in anydepth, but it is my intuition—and at this point it is only this—that individualswith a high regard for their “self” or “personality” would find group sexunattractive precisely because such activity operates by lessening thedistinctiveness between individuals; and as that distinctiveness is valued bystrong personalities, anything that subtracts from it is to be avoided. Suchindividuals set much store by what sets them apart from others. Sex, like otherbodily functions, is a highly generic activity—as the philosopher NicolaiBerdyaev remarked, the soul resides in the face, not the genitals—and in theabandon of group eroticism, one partner is as good as another.Characters of a weaker personality would be attracted to group sex for preciselythe opposite reasons, because in such activity they would lose what little senseof self they have—which to them is generally a burden, or, in any case, is tooweak to be of much value—and gain a greater “identity” as part of a single, massunit, in which everyone is the “same.” There is also less chance of threat: ifyou and I are “equal”—i.e., reduced to our sex organs, which operate pretty muchthe same in everyone—then there is less need for me to protect myself from you.People of this second type consider the first “uptight”; those of the first findthe second “loose” or “sloppy.” It is however a not uncommon observation thatthere is a kind of inverse ratio between the volume of sexual objects and theiraphrodisiacal powers: one naked woman is a more powerful sexual stimulant than adozen. This is so, I would argue, because the sight of many naked bodies reducesthem to an uninteresting “sameness.” Penises and vaginas as such do not differgreatly, and multiple displays can have a dulling effect.On writing this, it strikes me that herein may lie one argument for the demiseof “fertility-based” religions and the rise of ‘soul-” or “individualbased”ones—Christianity in particular, with its emphasis on the value and importanceof each individual. In the earlier pagan beliefs, what were worshipped were thegenerative powers—the phallus and vagina. These were of importance, and theindividual was recognized solely insofar as he or she was an expression of orvehicle for these powers, which functioned, as already mentioned, with areliable regularity. It is a well-known fact that one's sexual organs can easilybecome stimulated whether one wants them to or not. They are not under thecontrol of the individual—or at least what control we can exert over them islimited. For a religion that argued the importance of the individual as anindividual, it would be essential to advance those aspects that were under theindividual's control and to diminish, or at least to inhibit, those that werenot. It may not be sex per se that is proscribed by, say, Christianity, but sexas an expression of the nonindividual aspect of human nature. Sexual love, asopposed to lust, can be seen as the “individualizing” of sex, in whichindiscriminate copulation becomes devotion to a single beloved. It is also nosurprise then that many of the “anti-Christian” activities that are anathema tothe church are also anti-individual—the witches' Sabbath, the coven, the satanicorgies. These all may indeed be great fun—it is “liberating” to cast offindividuality and plunge into some form of “oneness”—but one enjoys thesepastimes at the expense of one's self-consciousness. (Of course, the oppositeview is that if you can't enjoy these sorts of things, you must be sufferingfrom some “anxiety” about losing your ego.)In saying this I am not arguing for Christianity and against paganism, onlytrying to see both in the light of an evolution of consciousness. For if thatevolution, at least in part, is concerned with the development of theindividual—and I believe history suggests that this is indeed what has takenplace—then we are bound to see clashes between a consciousness that valuesdistinctiveness and those that value nondifferentiation. This may turn out to benothing but a rewriting of Nietzsche's views on Apollo and Dionysus, but itstrikes me that this dichotomy may be a basic distinction between charactertypes.6 [../Text/part0023.html#FN6]. Due to the precession of the equinoxes, theposition of the Pleiades, as well as the other constellations, changes over timerelative to the calendar; today they rise during the spring months; 30,000 yearsago they would have risen at the time of the vernal equinox.7 [../Text/part0023.html#FN7]. Some theorists have even suggested that it wasprecisely some psychoactive substance that set human beings on their higherevolutionary trail. For the late Terence McKenna the “hidden factor in theevolution of human beings, the factor that called human consciousness forth frombipedal ape with binocular vision, involved a feedback loop with planthallucinogens.” See his essay “Mushrooms and Evolution” in The Archaic Revival(San Francisco: Harper, 1991).

Something very similar was argued by Alfred North Whitehead in hislittle-known but brilliant Symbolism, Its Meaning and Effect (1927), in which hediscusses our two modes of perception, which he calls “causal efficacy” and“presentational immediacy,” or “meaning perception” and “immediacy perception”for short. Whitehead's central insight is that in immediacy perception weperceive things as disconnected fragments, outside of their wider context. Thisis a necessary expedient for “dealing” with the world, but it distorts andobscures the relations between things, and hence when it predominates, as inscientific analysis or in the radically disjointed perception that Sartre called“nausea” and Camus “the absurd,” it communicates a profound sense ofmeaninglessness, as meaning is dependent on the excised relations. Meaningperception, equally valid but undervalued in our immediacy-oriented culture, is,as Ouspensky discovered when looking at his ashtray, precisely an awareness ofthe multiple relations everything has with everything else. And, as Ouspenskydiscovered, too much meaning can be as dangerous as too little. The optimumcondition would be what I have called the Goldilocks state, when a balance of“just right” is maintained—enough meaning to prevent a lapse into nihilism andthe absurd, and enough immediacy to prevent being overwhelmed by insight.Failing this, the next best would be a mental discipline that would allow forthe easy shift into one or the other, from viewing the world through a telescopeor a microscope, without losing the knowledge of the reality each mode conveys.7 [../Text/part0024.html#FN7]. As John Anthony West points out in The Serpent inthe Sky, the golden section is more than a central item in classicalarchitecture. It is the mathematical archetype of the manifest universe, themeans by which we have an “asymmetrical” “lumpy” world of galaxies and planets,and not a bland homogenous sameness, a question that contemporary cosmologistsare also concerned with. Schwaller linked phi to the orbits of the planets, theproportions of Gothic cathedrals, and the forms of plants and animals. It is a“form constant,” a blueprint for reality, a law of creation.8 [../Text/part0024.html#FN8]. Schwaller de Lubicz, Nature Word, pp. 134, 135.17. The Split1 [../Text/part0025.html#FN1].

Shlain was not the first to put forth theargument that a direct relation may exist between literacy and cruelty. In hisessay “To Civilize Our Gentlemen” (in Language and Silence, pp. 55–67), GeorgeSteiner advanced the possibility that a highly developed literary mind mayfoster an inability to appreciate the actual sufferings of other human beings.The German soldiers who daily herded Jews and other “undesirables” into the gaschambers and ovens at Auschwitz and Buchenwald relaxed in the evening over Rilkeand Goethe. Reading the great poets apparently had little effect on theirtreatment of their fellow human beings. Yet the converse is also true.Dostoyevsky has made his readers profoundly aware of human suffering. Dickens'snovels depicting the squalor and poverty of the working class helped bringpublic awareness and action to their plight, and it is a commonplace that“serious” literature today must concern itself with some treatment of thesocially or politically disenfranchised. As much as literature may be an escapefrom reality, it is also a means of galvanizing our awareness of it, and it iscommon experience for readers like myself that a good writer—not only a greatone—can focus our consciousness to such a degree that the scene depicted is morereal than it might be in actual reality. This, in fact, is the key to ourenjoyment of it, not, I submit, because we have weakened our grasp of realitythrough reading, but because writing, like all art, succeeds by heightening andmodifying that reality, in order to communicate its meaing in as concentrated aform as possible. The Germans, we know, were also great lovers of art—images—astheir plundering of the great treasures across Europe shows. This loveapparently did not inhibit their activities.5 [../Text/part0025.html#FN5]. Jaynes, The Origin of Consciousness, p. 75.6 [../Text/part0025.html#FN6].

In his important chapter “The Presence of Spirits inMadness” in The Presence of Other Worlds, a study of Swedenborg, he came to theconclusion that many schizophrenics experience not only the kinds ofthreatening, demanding, and generally harrowing voices that Jaynes recounts, butalso voices of a “higher order,” what he came to consider “angelic” or“spiritual guides.” These voices showed a remarkable intelligence and insightand often helped the individual as much, if not more, than conventional therapy.Such “intelligent” voices seem related to the comparable phenomena of the more“mature” personalities that often emerge in severe cases of “multiplepersonality disorder.”9 [../Text/part0025.html#FN9].

Barfield, Owen Barfield and the Origin ofLanguage, pp. 2–3.3 [../Text/part0027.html#FN3]. Clearly there is a sense in which all of languageand symbolism is metaphorical, in that the word or symbol stands for somethingelse. The word “tree” is not a tree; neither is a picture of one. Yet it isclear that a picture “stands” closer to what it depicts than does its name, sowe can perhaps speak of degrees of metaphorical relation, to coin an ungainlyphrase. The prehistoric mind that first recognized the hunted animal in itsrepresentation (“re-present”: to present again) on the cave wall must have beenprofoundly moved, but the mind that first “saw” (a metaphor) that the word orsound stood for the thing entered a new dimension of reality. A furtherdevelopment, or, as Barfield would argue, a conscious recognition of a primalrelation between the mind and the world, would be the kind of analogicalthought—read poetic thinking—that constitutes “metaphor” as we understand it:this is to that as that is to that; my anger burns as the fire does.4 [../Text/part0027.html#FN4]. At the time he was writing, Barfield was verymuch a lone voice; his argument that the mythopoetic habits of early humanbeings, as well as that of contemporary primitives, were not an indication oflower intelligence, but a sign of a consciousness different from our own, was,to say the least, considered eccentric and had little influence either on thephilosophy of language or literary criticism. Since then it has become acommonplace of anthropology, most notably through the work of ClaudeLévi-Strauss. Other philosophers also interested in the relation betweenthought, language, and reality have made a study of the “mythologicalconsciousness” central to their work; two of the most influential have beenErnst Cassirer and Gaston Bachelard.5 [../Text/part0027.html#FN5].

Quantum “leaps” involve indescribably tinydistances and are really not leaps at all, but a metaphor to describe the odddisappearance of a particle from one orbit and its equally odd appearance inanother without covering the space in between, rather as if you popped out ofthe office and into your home without traversing the streets separating the two.No particle “braces” itself for the jump.2 [../Text/part0028.html#FN2].

In his poem “To The Muses,”he laments the loss of the inspiration that once filled poets with divinemadness. “How have you left the ancient love,” he cries. “That bards of oldenjoy'd in you! / The languid strings do scarcely move! / The sound is forc'd,the notes are few!”Other poets after Blake made the best of the situation. W. B. Yeats, writing inthe 1930s, stoically remarked, “Though the great song return no more / There'skeen delight in what we have: / The rattle of pebbles on the shore / Under thereceding wave” (“The Nineteenth Century and After”).For a brilliant discussion on this shift in human consciousness, the reader cando no better than to refer to Erich Heller's essay “The Poet in the Age ofProse” in his collection In The Age of Prose, and also his extended treatment ofthe same theme in The Artist's Journey Into the Interior.7 [../Text/part0028.html#FN7].

See Colin Wilson's Beyond the Outsider, pp.54–57, in which Wilson discusses Fichte's notion, presented in The Vocation ofMan (1800), of a “transcendental ego” projecting the world perceived by theperceiving “I.” “Instead of the contemplating mind (‘I think'),” Wilson writes,“looking out at alien nature, there is a far more interesting situation. Thereare two I's; one is the ‘I think,' and the other the ‘transcendental ego,' theego behind the scenes, the cinema projectionist who is projecting nature outthere. This metaphor of the cinema described the situation precisely. For if youare sitting in a cinema watching the screen, you assume that what you arewatching is happening right in front of you. But in a far more fundamentalsense, it is happening behind you, in the projection room.”6 [../Text/part0029.html#FN6]. Berman, Coming to Our Senses, p. 113.7 [../Text/part0029.html#FN7].

There is a similarity between Moskvitin'sAnthroposphere and what the philosopher Karl Popper calls “World 3.” Oddlyenough, Popper presented his idea in Objective Knowledge published in 1972, nottoo long before Moskvitin published Essay on the Origin of Thought. Popper'sWorld 3 is, like Moskvitin's Anthroposphere, a world of human creation. It isthe world of ideas—not the Platonic Ideas, which are a kind of archetype,existing in an atemporal “perfect” realm, and which would exist whether or nothuman beings encountered them. Popper's ideas are the world of human knowledgeand creativity, the world housed in the libraries of the world and, as somewould hastily say, on the Web. World 1, Popper argues, is the physical worldstudied by science. World 2 is the world of the human psyche, our subjective,interior world of feelings, emotions, thoughts. World 3, he argues, is notmaterial, although its content is obviously expressed in material media—books,records, even films. It is, however, just as “objective” as the physical world.The similarity to Moskvitin's Anthroposphere seems obvious.2 [../Text/part0030.html#FN2]. Moskvitin, Essay on the Origin of Thought, p. 1.3 [../Text/part0030.html#FN3]. Ibid., p. 2.4 [../Text/part0030.html#FN4]. The link between creativity and madness is ahoary theme in the literature on “abnormal mental states,” and a representativebibliography would take us far beyond our subject. In writers we have alreadydiscussed, Andreas Mavromatis devotes a significant chapter of his book to therelation between hypnagogia and various mental instabilities, most prominentlyschizophrenia. Likewise, Danah Zohar's SQ devotes an important section to thecreative potential of “schizotypic” personalities, “schizotypy” denoting apersonality with characteristics often found in actual cases of schizophrenia,but not schizophrenic itself. Outside authors already mentioned, I can recommendThe Anatomy of Creation (1976) and Solitude (1989) by the late Anthony Storr, aswell as many of his other works, as excellent studies of the links betweencreative and disturbed states of mind. Max Nordau's Degeneration (1895),mentioned earlier, is a classic example of how a thoroughly “bourgeois” mind isthreatened by sensibilities different from its own, and how it typically lumpstogether the two extremes—genius and madness—that exceed its mediocrity.5 [../Text/part0030.html#FN5]. Moskvitin, Essay on the Origin of Thought, p. 1.6 [../Text/part0030.html#FN6]. Ibid., pp. 50, 52, 53.7 [../Text/part0030.html#FN7]. Clearly, Moskvitin's experience is not anuncommon one, especially to individuals who experimented with psychoactivesubstances. Two early and influential psychic voyagers also reported visions ofgeometric forms as central to their inner journeys. During his period of“experimental mysticism,” Ouspensky recorded a powerfully profound insight,centered around a vision of an enormous flower, “a rose or a lotus the petals ofwhich were continually unfolding from the middle. . . . In this flower was anincredible quantity of light, movement, color, music, emotion . . . knowledge,intelligence, mathematics” (A New Model of the Universe, p. 290). And under theinfluence of carbon tetrachloride, his fellow Gurdjieffian René Daumal recordeda vision of red and black circles and triangles “becoming one another in ageometrically impossible way, this transformation taking place in anon-Euclidean space.” See “The Determining Memory” in Daumal The Powers of theWord (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1991).8 [../Text/part0030.html#FN8].

Moskvitin, Essay on the Origin of Thought, p. 80.However, we should avoid the danger of relativizing the value of these differentworlds based on the fact that each is a product of different powers ofperception. A snail may indeed, and surely does, inhabit a different world fromthe one we do, but from all we can tell from the snail's behavior, it is a worldthat includes less of the total reality than the one we inhabit. This is not tosay that our world is the closest approximation to the total world. We have noidea if it is or not, and most likely beings exist who have a greater perceptionof the totality than ourselves. The world I see with my glasses on is adifferent one from the one I see with them off, but I do not believe they are“relatively equal” worlds. In one I can easily avoid being hit by a car; in theother my chances of being hit are amplified. The different worlds revealed bydifferent consciousnesses are not all in an equal relation to the totality ofwhich they are parts. What makes, say, mystical or aesthetic experiences somoving is not merely that they are different from our everyday experience of theworld, but that what constitutes this difference is in some way greaterexperience. In them we somehow see more of the world than we otherwise do.2 [../Text/part0031.html#FN2]. Ibid., pp. 81–82.3 [../Text/part0031.html#FN3]. Ibid., p. 82.4 [../Text/part0031.html#FN4].

On the history of the avant-garde artist as theeducator of the “philistine” public, see The Use and Abuse of Art, the brilliantseries of lectures by the historian Jacques Barzun. His thesis, which he hasargued in other books, is that since the nineteenth century the goal of artistshas been the realization of an “unconditional life,” in pursuit of which theyhave “educated” average people about their, and their society's, utterworthlessness. As an “unconditional life” is an unobtainable ideal, one resultof this has been an increasing “world rejection,” culminating in a profoundself-effacement and mea culpa on the part of nonartists, who are routinelybaffled by the increasingly “shocking” productions of their educators. The endof this, of course, is the stridently unaesthetic world of twenty-first–centuryart, with bisected sheep and manure-covered canvases representing the artisticimagination.23. Other Times and Places1 [../Text/part0032.html#FN1]. “The Outsider Cycle,” beginning with The Outsiderand running through Religion and the Rebel (1957), The Age of Defeat (1959)(U.S. The Stature of Man), The Strength to Dream (1962), Origin of the SexualImpulse (1963), Beyond the Outsider (1965), and summed up in Introduction to theNew Existentialism (1967), forms the foundations for a new existentialphilosophy, rejecting the pessimism of Sartre and Heidegger, and based on thework of Edmund Husserl and Alfred North Whitehead. The Occult (1971), Mysteries(1978), and Beyond the Occult (1987) sum up twenty years of research into theparanormal and related areas. His biographies of Gurdjieff, Rudolf Steiner, P.D. Ouspensky, and other central figures in esotericism are good introductions tosome of the main themes in the “countertradition” of the West. Novels like TheMind Parasites (1967) and The Philosopher's Stone (1969) are thrillingexpositions of his ideas about human consciousness, using themes from sciencefiction and the work of the writer of weird fiction H. P. Lovecraft. Sadly, manyof these books are now out of print in the U.K. and U.S., and, times being whatthey are, Wilson is best known to a contemporary audience for his books oncriminology and the psychology of murder, the most “philosophical” of thesebeing A Criminal History of Mankind (1984). Even here, though, he sees the riseof peculiarly modern phenomena like sex crimes and the so-called motivelessmurder as indicators of a shift in human consciousness. As in all his work, theevolution of human consciousness is his abiding concern.2 [../Text/part0032.html#FN2]. For Wilson's full account of the rise of thenovel, see The Craft of the Novel.3 [../Text/part0032.html#FN3]. Along with Alfred North Whitehead's Adventures ofIdeas (1937), Wilson's history of the novel is a good argument against theMarxist and positivist notion that history is moved by purely material forces.It is generally argued that the Romantic movement arose in reaction to theIndustrial Revolution. Wilson, however, makes a strong case for thecounterargument: that the Industrial Revolution itself was a product of the newpowers of the imagination unleashed by Richardson's invention of the novel.

Gebser comments that theobjection that Wilhelm's remark refers to a “case of primitive color blindnessis groundless. Application of such a concept here is tantamount toanachronism”—meaning that our notions of color blindness are a product of ourstructure of consciousness and should not be applied to other structures. Thisis a profitable guideline, as far as it goes. But one problem that can emergefrom this policy is that whenever one of Gebser's interpretations of a previousconsciousness structure runs into a counterinterpretation, he, or one of hisdefenders, can pull out this clause as an all-purpose defense against criticism.Exactly why color blindness must be anachronistic in this case is unclear. I amnot saying it is applicable, only that, aside from Gebser saying it is, I do notsee any evidence that it must be. The situation is common to all “total”accounts, and is most apparent in Marxist or Freudian thought. Both commonlyplace themselves outside the critical arena by declaring any opposing view to beprecisely an expression of what they are “explaining”; i.e., if I disagree witha Freudian about my Oedipus Complex, or with a Marxist about the class struggle,it must be because of my “defense mechanisms” and my “false consciousness.” Inattempting to account for all human endeavors in terms of his consciousnessstructures, Gebser and his followers run the risk of a similar reductionism.Clearly, my own remarks here can be seen as an expression of a limited,“perspectival” consciousness, and hence their force as criticisms would bedenied.16 [../Text/part0036.html#FN16].

The idea that consciousness itself is animpediment to perfection is the theme of Heinrich von Kleist's remarkablestory-essay “On the Marionette Theater.” Briefly put, Kleist argues that humanbeings lack the grace and beauty of marionettes because, unlike puppets, theyare conscious of their actions. It is for this reason that animals appear to usas graceful creatures, exhibiting an ease and “naturalness” unavailable toself-conscious creatures. Kleist however, in a three-part process that bearsmuch similarity to Owen Barfield's account of participation—and that would beemployed by M. H. Abrahms in his brilliant study of Romanticism NaturalSupernaturalism—pictured a future time when humankind will have passed throughits awkward state of self-consciousness and so regain, on a “higher” level, thesublime unconsciousness of the marionettes.

Jaynes and Gebser both present fateful encountersin the sixteenth century between the Aztecs and the Incas and their Spanishconquistadors as paradigmatic examples of the confrontation of two radicallydifferent kinds of consciousness. For Jaynes it was a meeting between bicameral(Incas) and unicameral (Spanish) minds; for Gebser, amagical-mythical-unperspectival consciousness (Aztecs) met with disaster at thehands of its European mental-rational conquerors (Jaynes p. 160; Gebser, pp.5–6).

Feuerstein, Structures of Consciousness, p. 99.5 [../Text/part0037.html#FN5]. Gebser, The Ever-Present Origin, pp. 15, 12.6 [../Text/part0037.html#FN6]. Heller, The Importance of Nietzsche, p. 101.7 [../Text/part0037.html#FN7]. As Gebser was well aware, major changes inconsciousness are not always unalloyed. The “retreat from the world” and ourpassing into the “invisible” that Heller charts through Hegel and Rilke has itscurrent “shadow” symbol in the ubiquitous Walkman, icon of mass “interiority.”Its popularity argues for a kind of negative “spiritualization,” a triumph ofsubjectivity over the external world, and the loss of any meaningful sense of“public space.” Wrapped in our unobtrusive designer headphones, we float, islanduniverses, oblivious of the others around us. The “access to other worlds”discovered by the Romantics has, with consumer humanity, degenerated into theportable personal entertainment center.Paradoxically, this most unmistakable agent of social atomism is only one of aflood of things that accompany our return to the cave. But these things—thefamiliar items of our consumer culture—have at best a fleeting significance.They are made to be replaced; their function is not to last but to be the tokenfetish in the rituals of consumption. They have no being, no enduring “presence”in the world, and hence can in no way act as a conduit for “meaning.” Just asthe act of buying something is the true meaning of consumption, and not thething bought, so the item itself is a necessary element in the process ofdisposal. We have to get rid of it in order to consume again. Seen this way, weare true “consumers,” assimilating our purchases, and then, soon after,excreting them. We no longer buy things to “have.” We eat them. No one holds onto last week's breakfast.With this in mind it is interesting to note that at around the same time Rilkewas receiving the inspiration of the Elegies and developing the poeticmetaphysics of “the invisible” (“We are,” he told his Polish translator, “thebees of the invisible”), Rudolf Steiner gave a series of lectures along verysimilar lines. In 1911 Steiner gave a lecture series called The Reappearance ofChrist in the Etheric (Spring Valley, N.Y.: Anthroposophic Press, 1983) in whichhe said that the present Earth was becoming a “corpse,” in preparation for itsnext planetary incarnation as Jupiter. For this to happen, “It is necessary forthe earth to be destroyed; otherwise the spirit will not become free” (p. 131).As Rilke was about to declare that “Nowhere will the world exist but within,”Steiner was informing his audience that the external world was in the process ofpassing away so that it may be reborn in a more spiritual form. Both share inthe sense of what Heller calls “the loss of significant external reality.” Seemy article “The Fate of the Earth According to Rudolf Steiner” in the Fall 1994issue of Gnosis.8 [../Text/part0037.html#FN8]. George Steiner, Grammars of Creation, pp. 1–2.Like Owen Barfield and Jean Gebser, Steiner, too, sees in language a gauge ofthe evolution of consciousness. Yet what he sees at the beginning of our newmillennium is a language “darkened” by the brutalities and inhumanities thatcrowd the exiting century, a language stamped by the boots of a Hitler, aStalin, and other totalitarian demigods, and cheapened by the coarse handling ofmass media, until it no longer has any reservoir of “future,” any potential tothrow itself with “hope” into uncertainty.9 [../Text/part0037.html#FN9]. Gebser, The Ever-Present Origin, p. 39.10 [../Text/part0037.html#FN10]. Whether it is myth or the dim memory of someactual catastrophe, the story of Atlantis relates how, almost overnight, apowerful, magnificent culture sank beneath the waves. The mysterious ruins andlost cities found over the globe point to once-tangible glories that are nowmere tokens of the past. That the same fate can befall our own culture is nolonger unthinkable. Casting an eye to the future, Morris Berman writes, “If thewest is to survive at all, it will in all likelihood have to pass through asevere crisis, a civilizational breakdown, including plague (already beginning),famine, and massive economic depression, in its transition to a new culture.Anything could happen during such a situation, including the emergence of aRoman-style government, if the period of breakdown is of sufficient intensityand duration” (Coming to Our Senses, p. 173).For many, the scenario Berman depicts seems already in place; clearly since theevents of September 11, 2001, the idea that “the West,” and specifically theUnited States, is “safe” is less certain than before.We may indeed be passing through what the historian Arnold Toynbee called a“time of troubles,” the period of challenge and difficulty that precedes thedisintegration of a civilization. Toynbee argues that a civilization in perilreacts in specific, recognizable patterns. One is to seek safety by a “return tothe past,” by reviving a “primitive,” “archaic” way of life. The various “backto nature” and fundamentalist philosophies that have emerged in the last fiftyor so years suggest something of this sort. Another reaction is the polaropposite, a flight into “the future,” something our various cybernauts andtechnocrats seem to offer. In either case, Toynbee argues, these options fail tomeet the challenges presented by the “time of troubles” and, inevitably, thecivilizations that follow these routes go under.28. The Integral Structure1 [../Text/part0038.html#FN1]. Feuerstein, Structures of Consciousness, p. 214.2 [../Text/part0038.html#FN2]. George Steiner, Grammars of Creation, p. 23.3 [../Text/part0038.html#FN3]. In his elegant and powerful little bookMetaphysical Horror the philosopher Leszek Kolakowski offers hope that a newvocabulary may soon be emerging: “Language may indeed have suffered a nervousbreakdown, but we have reason to believe that the sickness will not be terminal.Language will most likely resume its tireless attempts to cross its own bordersand venture into the illicit realm of the inexpressible. The civilization inwhich we live surrounds our use of words with well-guarded barriers, but it alsonaturally and continually devises ways of cheating and getting around thewardens. We cannot tell where the invincible spectre of the Absolute willre-emerge and how it will be resuscitated” (p. 55).4 [../Text/part0038.html#FN4]. Charles Hinton's books about the “fourthdimension” (see part 1) seem clear evidence of the “breakup” of the perspectivalworld, while Ouspensky's work, which brings together Hinton's ideas about“higher space” with speculations on the nature of time, seems a paradigmaticexample of the transition from a “space” to a “time” consciousness.5 [../Text/part0038.html#FN5]. A personal note here on Gebser's ideas and theirrelation to music. According to Gebser, by definition, atonal, serial, tachist,aleatory, twelve tone, and other “modern” developments in music are, insofar asthey are expressions of the new “arational” consciousness, more authentic than,say Mozart or Beethoven, whose work is an expression of the mentalrationalstructure. We can say that, according to Gebser, all “postclassical” music—tocoin an ugly phrase—is “preferable” to its antecedents because of its relationto the new, emerging consciousness. And the same, of course, can be said of theequally modern developments in literature, painting, sculpture, etc.One problem with this, however, is that, for all its supposed “timefreedom,”most music since, say, 1945, has, along with a great deal of modern “serious”literature, moved further and further away from any immediate appeal. There are,to be sure, devotees of what is today called “new music,” just as there are areadership and an audience for “difficult” literature and art. But as a means ofexpressing the spiritual quest in humanity and of actually moving its listeners,I cannot see how composers like Stockhausen, Varèse, Boulez, and others, up toPhilip Glass and John Cage, exceed, or even equal, the composers of theClassical-Romantic tradition. The works in this tradition are and remainbeautiful, and continue to express the deep spiritual longings and striving ofWestern consciousness. Admittedly, Gebser agrees that the works of the arationalstructure are not “beautiful” (Gebser, p. 462). They are, he suggests,“spiritual,” which, no doubt, is true. Martinu, Bartok, Messiaen—the reader caninclude his or her own favorites—imbue a powerful spiritual presence into theirwork. But although I enjoy the work of these composers, I cannot help feelingthat the sonata-allegro form, and its linear trajectory of theme, variation, andreconciliation, is somehow an archetype of Western consciousness's search for,and discovery of, self.Linearity can accomplish spiritual acts impossible for the kind of simultaneitythat Gebser argues is indicative of the new consciousness. A symphony is linear,one-note-after-another, not all-at-once: were an orchestra to play all the notesof the Jupiter Symphony simultaneously, it would not be music, but noise.Likewise a novel or story or any narrative form; we only need think of WilliamS. Burroughs's “cut-ups” or the “automatic poetry” of the Surrealists to seewhat is wrong with an “aleatory” approach to writing. Finding out “what happens”is the lure of reading narrative—as we all know, finding out in advance killsthe joy of reading or listening. The same is true of philosophy: as Hegelfamously pointed out, simply to state conclusions is not enough; the “truth” ofthought is in the process of arriving at it. In our desire to escape the“deficient” mode of the mental-rational structure, we must be careful not toabandon those aspects of linearity necessary for perceiving and graspingmeaning. (Gebser's friend Erich Kahler expressed his concerns about this in hisunjustly little-known book The Destruction of Form in the Arts [1968].)And this suggests that, for all their obvious depth and import, it may be wiseto take some aspects of Gebser's consciousness structures with at least a grainof salt. In our efforts to make the transition to the new structure, there isthe danger that we may develop a new, totalizing (to use a postmodernist phrase)ideology. Just as zealous Marxists are anxious to avoid anything that is“counterrevolutionary” and, “for the good of the revolution,” steel their willto go against their own preferences, followers of Gebser's ideas may find itmore “arational” to listen to alinear, postclassical, aleatory music becausethat is the more “authentic” kind of music for the emerging consciousnessstructure—not necessarily because they like it. Although I am aware of thevarious “new” developments in the arts, my own tastes remain for the most partClassical-Romantic, up to early modern. But this does raise a questionconcerning what we may clumsily call the “historicity of art.” Is it“inauthentic” of us to be moved by, say, an ancient Greek statue because it is aproduct of a passing consciousness structure? Or is there an atemporal realm inwhich great art exists, outside the changes and modifications of passing time?Is each age equidistant from the “beautiful,” or are some closer or farther awayfrom it?6 [../Text/part0038.html#FN6]. Eliot's Four Quartets is one of the great “time”poems of the century. As noted earlier, Eliot was among the cream of London'sintelligentsia who attended P. D. Ouspensky's lectures in the 1920s. Eliot'slines, like “Time present and time past are both perhaps present in timefuture,” and “To be conscious is not to be in time,” are powerful condensationsof some of the ideas he gleaned from Ouspensky's talks.7 [../Text/part0038.html#FN7]. Priestley, a novelist and playwright sadly out offashion, called himself a “time-haunted man” and was a devotee of both Ouspenskyand the time theorist J. W. Dunne. Priestley's plays Time and the Conways and IHave Been Here Before deal with notions of eternal recurrence and multiple time.One of his last books, Over The Long High Wall, sums up a lifetime of ponderingthe mysteries of time.Last Words: Playing for Time1 [../Text/part0039.html#FN1].
