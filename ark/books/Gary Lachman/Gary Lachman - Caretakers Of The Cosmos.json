While working on an earlier book, The Quest for Hermes Trismegistus(2011), about the influence of Hermeticism and its mythical founder, the ‘thricegreatest Hermes’, on western consciousness, I touched on the idea of humanbeings as ‘cosmic caretakers’, as individuals given the responsibility of‘taking care of the cosmos’ – no mean task, as I’m sure readers will agree.Although for centuries Hermes Trismegistus was believed to have been a realperson who lived at ‘the dawn of time’, and who received a primordial ‘divinerevelation’ – the ‘perennial philosophy’ that is at the heart of much of westernspiritual thought – he is now thought to have been a fictional figure, devisedby the authors of the Hermetic writings, who lived in Alexandria in Egypt in thefirst few centuries after Christ. In the Asclepius, one of the books making upwhat is known as the Corpus Hermeticum, the body of mystical writings on whichHermeticism is based, Hermes Trismegistus tells his student Asclepius that manis a creature of two natures, of, indeed, two worlds. Man is, according toHermes, a creature of the natural world, of the body and the senses, and as suchis subject to all the laws and limitations that come with ‘living in thematerial world’. But he is also an inhabitant of another world, that of mind,spirit, the soul, consciousness, which, in essence, is free from the limitationsof his other nature.How this came about is told in the Hermetic creation myth.1[part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--1] In the Poimandres, perhaps the best known of theHermetic books, Nous, or the Universal Mind, explains that after the creation ofthe world, he thought it good to create a being like himself who could enjoy hiswork. So he created man. For a long time, the idea that Hermetic man was createdin the image of his creator suggested that the Hermetic books borrowed elementsfrom the Judeo-Christian tradition. In that tradition, too, man is created inthe image of God. Recent scholarship, however, argues that the author of thePoimandres, who remains unknown, came to the idea independently. Whatever thecase, in two powerful spiritual traditions that have had an enormous influenceon western consciousness, the same idea, that man is made in the image of thedivine plays a central role.Unlike in the Judeo-Christian tradition, but similar to the Platonic and Gnosticcreation accounts, in the Hermetic account the actual work of making the cosmoswas undertaken by a ‘second Nous’, a demiurge or ‘craftsman’, created by thefirst Nous to carry out the job. When man saw what the craftsman had forged, hemarvelled at its beauty, and quite understandably, wanted to be a creatorhimself. Nous, his Father, loving man, agreed. The craftsman did as well, andhappy to share in his work, he gave man some of his power. He gave him a shareof the ‘seven spheres’ which encircle the earth, the seven spheres being theorbits of the seven ancient planets, Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,and Saturn. These seven spheres govern what takes place on earth; inHermeticism, as in astrology, they are the source of our ‘destiny’ and ‘fate’.Readers familiar with the history of astronomy will know that they are the sevenplanetary spheres that pre-Copernican astronomers believed encircled our earth,and they will also know that the ancient astronomers believed that the earthitself was at the centre of the cosmos.Now, in the Hermetic creation myth, the cosmos and the earth were originallyformed through the action of the creative Word, the logos or Mind. But by thetime that man is created, the Word has left the earth and returned to its sourcein Nous, leaving behind a world of mere matter. It is explained in the creationaccount that the material which the craftsman uses to create the cosmos is akind of ‘grim darkness’ that originates in the chaos which precedes creation.When the logos leaves it, it returns to its original state. To readers ofcontemporary cosmology, ‘grim darkness’ sounds rather like the ‘dark matter’ ofwhich we are told most of the universe is made. It is still a beautiful world,and through the turning of the seven spheres, living things have emerged fromthe earth’s waters. Man, curious about what the creator has been up to, desiresto see the earth. He pierces the seven spheres and looks down upon the beautifulworld, marvelling at the craftsman’s handiwork. The earth, however – we can alsosay Nature – sees man too, and recognising the Nous within him, desires him –apparently the earth is a woman – wanting to partake again of the divine Word.Man, too, sees his reflection – and hence that of Nous – on earth’s waters, andbecomes enchanted with it, much as the youth Narcissus does in the Greek myth.No sooner does man wish to be with the earth then he drops from his heavenlyperch through the seven spheres and enters into a form without the Word, thatis, a body; in other words, matter. (Up until then he has been in a solelyspiritual immaterial form.) It is through this descent from beyond the sevenspheres to the earth that man becomes a creature of two worlds. Passing throughthe seven spheres, he absorbs their character and becomes subject to their laws.Wrapped in the arms of the earth, he is subject to all its limitations, to theconstraints of mindless, spiritless matter, and the necessities inflicted on himby the dictates of ‘destiny’ and ‘fate’. But within him still glows a spark ofhis origin, his birthright from the world beyond, and it is this connection withhis source, with its freedom and power that will save him.THE GNOSTICSIn many ways this myth is very similar to the account of man’s place in thecosmos given by the Gnostics, who were contemporaries of the ancientHermeticists. The Gnostics were early Christians who embraced an interpretationof Christ’s teaching very different from what became the official church. As inthe Hermetic myth, for the Gnostics, creation is the work of a second Nous orGod, but in their case it is an entirely disastrous affair. This second God,whom they call the demiurge, or ‘half god’, is something of an idiot; at leasthe is so inflated with his sense of power and importance that he comes toconsider himself the true God. For the Gnostics, this demiurge is Jehovah, theGod of the Bible – William Blake called him ‘Old Nobodaddy’ – and the world hehas created is a kind of trap, an evil realm of falsity and oppression. Yet likethe Hermeticists, the Gnostics, too, believed that a spark of the true God – theGod beyond the world – was hidden within them. The aim of their spiritualpractices and beliefs was to awaken this spark and release it, so that theycould return to their source, beyond creation.This notion of the world being a trap, and its creator a kind of demon, has hada powerful influence on western consciousness. Although for many centuries, theonly source of information about the Gnostics were hostile accounts writtenabout them by church fathers, who saw them as heretics – indeed the church wasparticularly successful in wiping them out – in the last century or so, the workof many different scholars has provided a different, broader view of these earlyChristians and their ideas.2 [part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--2] Gnostic themes andwhat we can call a Gnostic sensibility have become a part of the modern mind.They can be found in the work of the psychologist C.G. Jung. The idea of life asa kind of prison which we must escape is at the heart of the ‘Fourth Way’ of theenigmatic esoteric teacher G.I. Gurdjieff.3 [part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--3]Gnostic ideas can be found in the work of novelists like Hermann Hesse andThomas Pynchon, in the philosopher Martin Heidegger, for whom man is ‘thrown’into the world, and in less high-brow sources, such as the science fiction ofPhilip K. Dick and the films in The Matrix (1999–2003) series, and Peter Weir’sfilm The Truman Show (1998), about a man who discovers that his entire life hasactually been a television program. Another film, Alex Proyas’ Dark City (1998),though less well known, is the most Hermetic of the lot, with its herodiscovering that, not only is the world he lives in false, he himself is a kindof god.It is a welcome sign that Gnostic ideas have made their way into the culturalmainstream. They lead us to question the status quo and seek the truth. Butthere is another side to this development. This idea of the world as false, as akind of prison, has, I believe, led to, or at least certainly added to, oursense of uncertainty and insecurity, to our anxiety and paranoia. The kind of‘conspiracy consciousness’ that permeates much of our postmodern life is a kindof Gnosticism; at least it shares in the sense that, in the words of a Bob Dylansong, something is happening but we don’t know what it is. Powers greater thanourselves – the government, big business, aliens, the unconscious, or the‘cultural forces’ invoked by much postmodern thought – control our lives, andthis feeling of being manipulated adds to the general sense of helplessnesswhich is a strong current in contemporary life. This sense of helplessness canlead to some undesirable effects, such as random violence against the ‘system’or a general ‘retreat from life’. It can lead to cynicism and a kind of genericnihilism that accepts that ‘nothing is true’, with the corollary that,everything, then, is permitted. It also encourages the kind of ironicworld-weariness associated with some forms of postmodernism, the ‘been there,done that, got the T-shirt’ sensibility that informs much of our jaded tastes.As Colin Wilson pointed out decades ago, modern man suffers from what he calls‘the fallacy of insignificance’, the sense that nothing we do really matters,that life is meaningless, and that, in the long run, ‘you can’t win’.4[part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] This is an extremely unhealthy state of mind,and if this book has a central aim, it is to show that it is wrong.THE LEAPIt is true that the Hermetic philosophy shares some elements with the Gnostics.We know that both groups knew of each other, as the famous ‘Gnostic gospels’found in Nag Hammadi in Egypt in 1945, included some Hermetic texts.5[part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--5] But there is one central sense in which they areradically different. The Hermeticists believed, as did the Gnostics, that theyhad fallen from a free, limitless spiritual world into this severely limitedworld of necessity and constraint. But unlike the Gnostics, they did not believethat this world was a trap or that they were prisoners in it. As we have seen,for the Hermeticists, man’s descent from the higher spiritual world into thisworld of space and time, of constraints and limitations, was not the work of anevil or idiotic demiurge, but came about through man’s love of the earth, andthe earth’s love of man. There is even a sense in which this descent wasn’t a‘fall’, as it is considered in the Gnostic and Judeo-Christian traditions.Rather it was a jump, or, to take a leaf from the Danish religious philosopherKierkegaard, a leap, of faith perhaps. Although some of the thinkers andphilosophers I will look at in this book do consider that man’s fall was theresult of some cosmic catastrophe or crime, there is a sense, I think, in whichwe can see it as a freely chosen act, a willing embrace of a tremendousresponsibility and obligation.The Hermetic philosophy sees it as such. When Asclepius asks Hermes Trismegistuswhy man has a dual nature – one of matter and one of spirit – Hermes explainsthat it is so he can ‘raise his sight to heaven while he takes care of theearth,’ and so he can ‘love those things that are below him’ while he is‘beloved by the things above.’ Asclepius himself, when asked about man’s needfor a body, explains that it is necessary so that we can take care of creation.Asclepius tells his listeners that Nous gave man a ‘corporeal dwelling place’and ‘mixed and blended our two natures into one’, doing justice to our twofoldorigin, so that we can ‘wonder at and adore the celestial, while caring for andmanaging the things on earth.’6 [part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--6] For theHermeticists, man finds himself on earth not as the result of some cosmiccatastrophe or a ‘fall from grace’ or because he is trapped on it through themachinations of an evil idiot god, but because he has a particular mission toaccomplish here. He – we – are here for a reason. As the Gnostics did, Hermeticman struggled against the constraints of the world, the snares of matter and thebody, the limitations of the flesh, the prison house of the cosmos, the destinyand fate of the seven spheres. But this was not in order to escape fromcreation, but in order to take our rightful place within it: to embrace theobligations and responsibilities that come with being ‘caretakers’ of thecosmos.IN THE COSMOS BUT NOT OF ITBut if we cannot take care of the earth or the cosmos if we escape from it,neither can we take care of it if we are only a part of it, like everythingelse, subject to its laws, limitations, and constraints. Caretaking seems toimply some position outside or above what you are taking care of, whether it ischildren, a pet, or someone’s flat. If I am taking care of my children, I cannotact like a child myself. Or I can only briefly, in play, and only on thecondition that, when necessary, I assume full responsibility as an adult. Thereis a Sufi saying, which is also in the Bible, that tells us that we should be‘in the world, but not of it.’ This tells us that although we cannot avoid pain,suffering, triviality, falsehood, inequity and the other evils in the world wedo not have to submit to them, as difficult as that may be. In a sense we cansay that in order to take care of it, we need to be in the cosmos – which weclearly are, at least physically – but not of it. The Hermetic account of manand the world seems to agree. Man is made of the stuff of the world, the ‘grimdarkness’ that preceded creation. But he is also made of ‘higher’ stuff, themind. So, at least according to Hermes Trismegistus, while we are in the world,we are not completely of it.This idea, that we are in the cosmos but not necessarily of it, may seem strangeto readers unfamiliar with the Hermetic tradition. Nevertheless it was, indifferent ways, shared by some important thinkers who were, more or less, withinthe western intellectual mainstream. In the early part of the last century,philosophers as different as the phenomenologist Max Scheler (1874–1928), thecultural philosopher Ernst Cassirer (1874–1945), and the Christianexistentialist Nikolai Berdyaev (1874–1948), all came to a similar conclusion,although by very different paths. Each contributed to a movement in twentiethcentury philosophy known as ‘philosophical anthropology’, an attempt at arrivingat a metaphysical account of man, broader and more holistic than the reigningreductive, materialist ones. In different ways Scheler, Cassirer, and Berdyaev,arrived at the same conclusion: that it is impossible to explain man adequatelyin terms of his place in society, his animal origins, his physical constitution,or the deterministic laws it is subject to. Each argued that man’s essence iscreative, that human consciousness brings a new dimension, a new world, intobeing, and that any attempt to reduce this to the laws that govern the physicalworld is not only doomed to failure, it results in a world empty of all meaningand value.COSMIC AMNESIAFor the Gnostics, then, we are spiritual beings, trapped in an evil physicalcosmos, and our only salvation lies in escape. For the Hermeticists, we can saythat we are spiritual beings with a mission, but we have forgotten it and oursalvation lies in remembering it. And, if the idea that we are caretakers of theearth and cosmos is correct, then it is not only our own salvation, but that ofcreation itself, which is at stake. Wrapped in the arms of Nature, we havefallen asleep and we dream that the limited, constrained world of time and spaceand matter, the everyday world we know so well, is the only reality. As long aswe remain sunk in this dream world, this is true: it is the only reality. And aswe are, by most official accounts – which emerge within the dream – onlyinsignificant transitory specks in a vast, non-human universe, which hasexisted, we are told, for billions of years, the idea that we are in some wayresponsible for it, is laughable. Yet there are moments when we wake, briefly,from the dream, when some vague memory of another life, and another world, flitsacross our consciousness, when we somehow remember who we are and why we arehere, and when the sense of some enormous mystery comes over us and disturbs ourslumber. For most of us, these moments are little more than a brief, strangefeeling, which, if we notice it at all, we chalk up to being ‘weird’ and soonforget about. Some of us, however, are troubled by them, and by the feeling ofunreality they cast upon the solid, unavoidable world we bump up against eachday, and by the nagging sense of having forgotten something that they seem toproduce.As a teenager in New Jersey in the 1970s I read a novel by Doris Lessing,Briefing for a Descent Into Hell (1971), which had a powerful effect on me. Init a man is found wandering around the Thames Embankment, suffering fromamnesia, and raving about fantastic adventures in other worlds. He is taken to amental ward where the doctors, trying to ‘cure’ him, subject him to a battery ofdrugs and electro-shock therapy. Throughout the book there is the sense that,although from our commonsense everyday point of view – the view of the doctors –he is quite clearly mad, from another perspective it is unclear if his remarksare simply ravings or real memories of some other existence. There is somemission he is trying to remember, some important purpose that he has forgotten,and which the doctors, with their drugs and electro-shock, only make moredifficult to recall. As an angst-ridden teenager it was easy to identify withthe hero and to see the doctors as agents of the ‘establishment’, trying toforce him to accept the reality of a world he has seen through. It was onlyyears later that I discovered that the book is considered a work of Gnosticfiction. I can also remember a science fiction story in a comic book when I wasyounger, about a man investigating possible aliens, living in disguise on Earth.All his leads turn out to be false except for one, and when he tracks this onedown he discovers that the alien is himself. I didn’t know at the time that Iwas reading a version of the Hermetic account of man, but as I later discovered– and wrote a book about – popular culture is often a source for disseminatingideas that mainstream ‘high’ culture considers nonsense.7[part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--7]REPAIRING THE UNIVERSEIt was while writing about this human role as a cosmic caretaker that I recalledsimilar themes from other spiritual traditions. Some emphasise different aspectsof the caretaker role, and some push that role into more active, creative areas.In these man is seen as not only a caretaker, in the passive sense of havingsomething already complete, finished, entrusted to his care, as a custodian orcurator of a museum is. He is regarded as a co-creator of the cosmos itself, anidea I explored in other books, specifically in the context of the ideas ofRudolf Steiner.8 [part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--8] And in some versions he is evenseen as someone responsible for correcting the mistakes God – or whoever – madewhen creating the universe.In the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah, for example, there is the idea oftikkun, which is generally translated as ‘repair’. In the Judaic tradition, asin the Christian, God is usually seen as perfect, omnipotent, and infallible,but in the tradition of Lurianic Kabbalah, stemming from the teachings of thegreat sixteenth century Kabbalist Isaac Luria (1534–1572), this isn’t the case.According to Luria, when God created the world, something went wrong, and Hecreated man in order to correct his mistakes, to repair the damage caused by hisblunder. This surely gives man an exalted position, but some Kabbalisticinterpretations go even further, and suggest that God made his cosmic mistakeson purpose, but unconsciously, so that he would have to create man in order tocomplete the work of creation. In this sense, God suffered from a kind ofFreudian slip, rather like when we leave our umbrella at a house we would liketo visit again, but aren’t consciously aware that we do. In this interpretation,God has a ‘dark side’, unknown to himself, and the fractures and cracks that runthrough creation were planned by his unconscious, so that He would have to callin man to do the repairs. The inference is that the work of creation cannot becompleted without our contribution, and some thinkers consider this to be soessential that, in the words of the Cretan writer and poet Nikos Kazantzakis(1883–1957), through it we become the ‘saviours of God’.This idea of man as a ‘repairer’ is also at the heart of the work of the Frencheighteenth century mystical philosopher Louis Claude de Saint-Martin(1743–1803), who during his life was known as the ‘Unknown Philosopher’, apseudonym he used for his writings. For Saint-Martin, ‘The function of mandiffers from that of other physical beings, for it is the reparation of thedisorders in the universe’. Saint-Martin’s vision is within the context ofChristian mysticism, but he shares with the tradition of tikkun and Hermeticismthe idea that man has a crucial role to play in the work of creation. Indeed,for Saint-Martin, man is, in a very real sense, the entire purpose of theuniverse, the answer to its mystery, the key to its existence. In some waysSaint-Martin, and other mystical thinkers with similar views, like theeighteenth century Swedish scientist and religious thinker Emanuel Swedenborg(1688–1772), seem to anticipate some contemporary scientific ideas, which arguethat the universe itself is designed in order to produce intelligent life likeourselves, what is known as the ‘anthropic cosmological principle’.THE FALLACY OF INSIGNIFICANCEYet, even during his time, more than two centuries ago, Saint-Martin recognisedthat man suffered from a sense of insignificance. In fact, I first came acrossSaint-Martin’s ideas in the book by Colin Wilson in which he analyses ‘thefallacy of insignificance,’ The Stature of Man (1959), a study of the ‘loss ofthe hero’ in modern literature.9 [part0005.xhtml#rw-num-note--9] At thebeginning of the book, Wilson quotes Saint-Martin. Men, Saint-Martin writes:… have believed themselves to be obeying the dictates of humility when they havedenied that the earth and all that the universe contains exists only on man’saccount, on the ground that the admission of such an idea would be only conceit.But they have not been afraid of the laziness and cowardice which are theinevitable results of this affected modesty. The present-day avoidance of thebelief that we are the highest in the universe is the reason that we have notthe courage to work in order to justify that title, that the duties springingfrom it seem too laborious, and that we would rather abdicate our position andour rights than realise them in all their consequences.‘Where,’ Saint-Martin asks, ‘is the pilot that will guide us between thesehidden reefs of conceit and false humility?’ Where indeed? Trying to chart acourse between this Scylla and Charybdis is one aim of this book. But if it wastrue in Saint-Martin’s time that man has avoided the belief that he is ‘thehighest in the universe’, it is certainly even more true today. Today anysuggestion that we are in any way ‘special’, that we are significant or somehowcentral to the universe – let alone that it exists on our account – would be metwith sarcastic laughter or self-righteous indignation, depending on who you weretalking to. Yet it isn’t only obscure mystical philosophers who believe we sellourselves short. One reader of Wilson’s The Stature of Man was the humanistpsychologist Abraham Maslow (1908–1970), best known for his concept of the ‘peakexperience’, sudden moments of almost mystical delight that, Maslow argues, cometo most psychologically healthy people. Another of Maslow’s ideas that chimedwell with Wilson’s concern over the loss of the hero in modern consciousness,was what he called the ‘Jonah complex’, after the Biblical prophet who tried toavoid the responsibility God placed on him. Maslow asked his students if theyexpected to do something important, to excel at their work, to make asignificant contribution to psychology or society. All were diffident and noneraised their hand. Maslow looked at them and said, “Well, if not you, then who?”Maslow saw that we invariably feel that someone else will be successful,creative, outstanding, accomplished, but that to expect that of ourselves is akind of egotism, or a foolish overestimation of our abilities, certainly in badtaste.Yet this modesty is of the same false character that Saint-Martin recognised inhis contemporaries, and is really a defence against living up to the demandsmade on us by our higher, better selves. Maslow recognised that although thefear of failure is common and understandable, we also suffer from a ‘fear ofsuccess’, a fear of living up to our full potential, of the responsibilities andobligations this entails, as well as of the ostracising our less exceptionalfellows will direct at us. Like Jonah, we want to avoid any responsibility thatwill set us apart from the average. We reject it, and want to remain ananonymous member of the herd. Yet such sheepishness is just as much a neurosisas any other, and by embracing it we are, according to Maslow, displaying a kindof psychological illness, and blocking our way to ‘self-actualisation’, Maslow’sterm for the process of becoming what he calls ‘fully human’.FULLY HUMAN OR ONLY HUMAN?But as Saint-Martin recognised two centuries earlier, being ‘fully human’ issomething most of us avoid. In our climate of insignificance, we are morecomfortable with the ‘only human’, with associating our humanity with weakness,sickness, mediocrity, and the collection of appetites Maslow calls ‘deficiencyneeds’, our hunger for the three S’s: security, sex, and self-esteem. Being‘fully human’ makes demands on us, it is a kind of existential noblesse oblige,which requires that we apply high standards and aims and values to ourselves andour actions. If we are ‘only human’, as many of us prefer, then not much can beexpected of us. We are let off the hook, can let it ‘all hang out’, and can getby, as the cliché goes, as a ‘good enough’ human. But good enough for what? IfMaslow and Saint-Martin are right, then certainly not good enough to take on theresponsibilities that being fully human demand.Trying to meet the demands of being ‘fully human’, we encounter difficulties,not only from our own reluctance and fear, but also from the ideologicalatmosphere in which we live, from the Zeitgeist. For one thing, science tells usthat the universe is too large and too old for us to be of any significance init. The philosophy that emerges from this belief has some interesting adherents,among who are the horror fiction writer H.P. Lovecraft (1890–1937) and thecontemporary social philosopher John Gray. Science also tells us that theuniverse is meaningless, a pointless product of an accidental explosion, andthat eventually any life within it will be extinguished and it itself willdissipate into an endless cosmic emptiness. If that isn’t bad enough, sciencealso tells us that we ourselves are the product of an equally meaninglessprocess, and that far from being the answer to the riddle of the universe, therewas absolutely no intention in our being here at all.SLIME MOULDS AND GIRAFFESScientists are not the only ones who reject the idea that humanity is in someway special. In recent years, concerns over our ecological crises, our rampantabuse of natural resources, global warming, and other environmental problemshave led some well-meaning people to suggest that rather than a cosmiccaretaker, man is really a blight on the planet. To them the Biblical injunctionthat man has dominion over the earth, has given us carte blanche for the selfishexploitation of nature. Paradoxically, the science that tells us that we aremerely meaningless accidents in an accidental universe, has also produced thetechnology that has allowed us to fulfil that Biblical injunction, and made usmasters of the world. Ironically, in our secular age, man is at once reduced toa nullity and made lord of creation. Yet it is this mastery that manynature-orientated people argue is in the process of killing Mother Earth, andhas made us the most dangerous animal alive. Quite rightly, they say we mustconcentrate on saving the planet, and the best way to do this – the only waysome insist – is for man to ‘get back to nature’, to recognise that he is nobetter or more important than a slime mould or a giraffe, and that any idea thathe is, is precisely the source of our problems.While I have nothing against slime moulds and giraffes, this ‘biocentric’ viewhas its own problems. And if Hermes Trismegistus, Kabbalah, Saint-Martin, andothers are right, it is in fact dangerous. According to them, the only way wecan save the planet – the cosmos, in fact – is by recognising that we aresomething more than nature, something more than animals, and by taking theresponsibilities that come with this seriously. (If nothing else, therecognition that no animal wants to save the planet should give us pause forthought.) By abandoning our humanness and embracing our animal roots – which, nomatter how hard we try, we can never feel completely comfortable with – we aregiving up our one possibility of saving anything. What that ‘something more’ isthat sets us apart from the rest of creation, and what its relation to thecosmos may be, is something I hope to discover in this book. And strangely, oneof the curious things I discovered while gathering my material, is that in manyessentials, science itself shares the Hermetic vision of man as the answer tothe riddle of existence, as a co-creator of the cosmos, although this moreoptimistic vision is usually obscured by the more pessimistic view of ourselvesas insignificant creatures in a pointless, purposeless universe.WHISTLING IN THE DARK?As mentioned, the idea of us having any significance in the universe is bold,perhaps too bold for many of us to swallow. I have to admit that more than oncewhile writing this book I found myself thinking ‘Oh come on, isn’t this a bittoo much?’ and wanting to push the whole idea aside. For some readers the ideamay seem merely one more expression of our inveterate self-importance, atrumpeting of our dubious standing as the most dominant species on the planet,and a clatter of applause at our triumphs over the rest of creation, if it isnot merely a cosmic whistling in the dark. Let me assure readers that nothingcould be further from my intention, and that I share with them their disdain forsuch boorish self-congratulation. Although I do think we suffer from a kind ofcosmic low self-esteem, and have a poor self-image, my aim here is not to rackup reasons to feel pleased with ourselves, or to encourage a session of mutualback patting. I certainly am not interested in hoisting banners celebrating oureminence, although I do agree with Maslow, Wilson, and other writers andthinkers I will look at, that we have come to see ourselves in a false light,one which encourages countless mea culpa’s (in our idiom, ‘my bad’) anddiscourages any feeling of self-confidence and assurance. My aim is to try tosteer a course between the conceit which is often an excuse for complacency, andthe false modesty that Saint-Martin argues is really an avoidance of ourobligations. And having found a way through these hidden reefs, on which morethan one seafarer has found himself wrecked, I would like to discover what liesahead.OUTLINE OF THE BOOKIn what follows I will try to understand what is involved in the idea ofourselves as caretakers of the cosmos, what it can mean in our lives and what,if anything, we can do about it. My starting point is the Hermetic vision ofourselves as belonging to two different worlds, of man as a microcosm, or‘little universe’. These are longstanding ideas in our esoteric ‘countertradition’, yet according to recent developments in neuroscience, they mayactually be rooted in the very structure of our brains. It may be that the‘other world’ we have ‘fallen’ from, have brief haunting memories of, and ayearning nostalgia for, is another mode of consciousness that is our birthright,but which, through our evolutionary development, we have come to ignore at, itmay be, our peril. From this vantage point I will look at how our caretaking canapply to our personal lives, to our relation to society, and to nature. Giventhe uncertain times we live in, it is understandable that this aspect ofrepairing the cosmos may strike most of us as of central importance. Indeed itis. Speculations on our place and significance in the cosmos and other modes ofconsciousness can be thrilling and highly entertaining, but if they don’t leadto actual changes in how we live, they are merely pleasant daydreams and caneven make us less capable of dealing with reality than we already are. Toparaphrase Hermes Trismegistus, we can have the stars in our eyes, but we musthave our feet on the ground. Swedenborg, one of the most grounded of spiritualthinkers, entreats us in our daily lives to ‘do the good that we know’, and itis from that humble beginning that our cosmic caretaking should begin. ApplyingMaslow’s ideas about our ‘hierarchy of needs’ to society, I will look at whatevidence there is to suggest that we may be moving beyond the need forself-esteem into more creative levels, those of the ‘fully human’, and how thisrelates to Max Scheler’s ‘hierarchy of values’. And through the ideas of GustavFechner, Goethe, and others, I will explore how we can better understanding ourrelation to a living nature, without losing our independence as creative agentswithin it.But while what we might call our ‘hands on’ form of caretaking is crucial, andwhile we all need to recognise the preciousness of the world which has beenentrusted to our care, there is another form of our responsibility of which wealso need to be mindful. And being ‘mind full’ of it is indeed its core.As I do in my book A Secret History of Consciousness (2003), in the laterchapters of this book I will explore the ways in which our own minds areinvolved in actually creating the world we experience and subsequently care for.From a variety of different perspectives – quantum physics, neuroscience,phenomenology, the philosophy of language – it is becoming more and more clearthat the universe we live in is a ‘participatory’ one, in which mind and matter,the inner world and the outer one, are not, as our commonsense view suggests,radically different and opposed realities, closed off from each other, but aredifferent aspects of a single shared reality. It seems increasingly clear thatthe barriers between these two worlds are not as impermeable as we havebelieved. Our inner worlds, it seems, are not isolated islands of consciousness,floating on the surface of a dead, material world that is oblivious of them, andon which they have no effect. In some strange, still inexplicable way, our innerworlds participate in the world outside us, something less modern, more‘primitive’ people still experience, but which to us seems fantastic nonsense.Synchronicities, those strange meaningful coincidences, in which some thought orfeeling in our inner world is paralleled by an event in the outer one, and otherparanormal experiences, are one way in which this participation manifests, butthere are others. One idea that runs throughout this book, as it does in myothers, is that at an earlier stage in our evolution, human consciousness wasmuch more ‘embedded’ in nature, as animals are today, and that we did notexperience then, as we do now, separate outer and inner worlds, but a freeflowing movement between the two. Indeed, the separation from nature that weexperience now can be seen as a result of our ‘fall’, not from a heavenlyparadise, but from our evolutionary past. But if this fall was really a leap, itis my belief that nature itself pushed us out of her warm embrace, as birdpushes her chicks out of the nest, in order to get them to fly. At some point inour evolutionary past, consciousness became aware of itself and the world as twodifferent things, and we can say that at that point, humanity and the cosmositself, ‘began’. As Marie-Louise Von Franz, one of Jung’s most importantdisciples and an original thinker in her own right, suggests, most creationmyths are really about the rise of consciousness out of an unconscious,undifferentiated ground. If that is the case, then ‘getting back to nature’ isthe most unnatural thing we can do, as it would be moving in the oppositedirection from nature’s own intentions.I believe that nature, the world, the cosmos, separated us off from itself inorder for it to become conscious of itself through us. It is in this way,through our own increasing consciousness, that the work of creation iscompleted, or at least carried on. Drawing on the work of different‘participatory’ thinkers, it is my belief that our evolutionary task now is toregain an experience of participation and all that it entails, without losingour independence as conscious egos, capable of free will and creative action,something our ancestors, more at one with the cosmos, lacked. Our task, then, isto become more conscious, not less, which means facing the sense of separationfrom the world firmly, and getting through it.Isolated, alienated, feeling adrift in the cosmos, it is understandable that wewould want to return to the nest, to press my mother bird metaphor a bitfurther. But as pleasant and blissful as this might be – and consciousness hasdevised many delightful ways in which to free itself of the burden of itself –it would really be a shirking of our business as caretakers. We cannot return toan earlier stage of our evolution, just as we cannot become children again, tryas we may. Nor can we stay as we are. In a living universe, which I believe oursis, stagnation is just another word for death. We must press forward into whatthe poet Walt Whitman called ‘the unknown region’. It is here that ourcaretaking adopts a more adventurous character, and in the last section of thebook I will explore what this might entail. Here we are no longer taking care ofa cosmos already made nor repairing the cracks and fissures left by aninadequate craftsman, but are bringing new worlds into being. In the lastchapter I will look at what this might mean, and how the ephemeral flicker ofconsciousness – at least as seen from the point of view of materialist science –housed in the insignificant creatures of a transitory planet, may actually bethe key to saving the cosmos itself from oblivion. A fate that, at leastaccording to the latest scientific accounts, is inevitable.Save the planet? Yes, assuredly. But why stop there? Why not save the universewhile we’re at it?INTRODUCTION: SAVING THE UNIVERSE1 [part0005.xhtml#rw-ref-note--1] See Gary Lachman, The Quest for HermesTrismegistus (Edinburgh: Floris Books, 2011) pp. 28–34.2 [part0005.xhtml#rw-ref-note--2] See Elaine Pagels’ classic work The GnosticGospels (New York: Random House, 1979) and Richard Smoley Forbidden Faith: TheGnostic Legacy (New York: Harper Collins, 2006) for an overview.3 [part0005.xhtml#rw-ref-note--3] See my Jung the Mystic (New York:Tarcher/Penguin, 2010) and In Search of P.D.

THE OTHER SIDE [part0001.xhtml]In the beginning was the spill, at least according to the account of creationgiven by Isaac Luria, the great Kabbalist of Safed, in the sixteenth century inwhat was then Ottoman controlled Palestine. What exactly I mean by ‘spill’ willbe explained shortly. Kabbalah is a Hebrew word meaning ‘receiving’ and is thename given to the mystical tradition within Judaism. Kabbalah claims to explainthe nature of the universe and man’s place within it, just as the Hermeticwritings do, and is said to be the esoteric or inner teaching hidden within theexoteric, or outer reading of the Torah. Perhaps its most well known feature isthe Otz Chiim, or Tree of Life, a symbolic mapping of the divine energies atwork in the world, with its ten sephiroth, or ‘vessels’, which has become almostas ubiquitous in popular occultism as the Tarot, with which it is oftenassociated; erroneously, it seems, as most Judaic scholars argue. At Kabbalah’sheart is the relation between creation, the finite, physical cosmos, and itsinfinite, unmanifest source, called the Ein-Sof, which means ‘limitless’ or‘unending’. This is a sphere or dimension of what we can call ‘negativeexistence’, which really means that it is a plane of reality that our finitehuman minds are incapable of comprehending, and not merely a simple emptiness.The Ein-Sof is so ‘other’ than what we normally perceive as reality, that wecannot make positive statements about it. Any positive statement about it,would, by definition, be a limit on it, and as it is limitless, cannot apply.This negative existence has parallels in other spiritual traditions. It is theNeti-Neti (‘not this, not that’) of Hinduism, the sunyatta or ‘void’ ofBuddhism, the Pleroma of the Gnostics. It is even part of the Christian faith.The Athanasian Creed, in use in Western Christianity since the sixth century,declares that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are ‘uncreated’ and ‘unlimited’,and in more than one place in scripture we are told that God ‘has neither bodynor parts’. It is at the heart of the negative theology of Meister Eckhart,forms the Ungrund of Jacob Boehme’s difficult alchemical writings, and can befound in the Nichts or ‘positive nothingness’ of Martin Heidegger’s ‘fundamentalontology’ and his predecessor Hegel’s tortuous dialectic. In more scientificterms, a similar idea, but without the spiritual connotations, seems to bepresent in the way scientists talk about the state of things ‘before’ the BigBang. I put ‘before’ in quotation marks because, according to most accounts,there was no before before the big bang, a confusing situation, to be sure. Akind of non-manifest ground of our everyday reality also seems to be involved inthe ‘implicate order’ of the physicist David Bohm. There are other expressionsof the idea, but I think this will suffice for now.Just as the Hermetic teachings are supposed to have been revealed to HermesTrismegistus at the dawn of time, Kabbalah is said to have been revealed to Adam‘in the beginning’ in Eden, but as with the Corpus Hermeticum, a more wieldydating for its conception is available. Historically, Kabbalah comes to light inthe twelfth and thirteen centuries in Spain and Southern France, emerging fromearlier forms of Jewish esotericism, such as the Merkabah or ‘throne’ or‘chariot’ mysticism, that centres on the vision of a mystical chariot inEzekiel. The Zohar, one of the most important texts in Kabbalah, was said tohave been discovered in 1286 by Moses de León, a thirteenth century SpanishKabbalist. León claimed that it was written in second century Israel by themiracle-working Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai, but most modern scholars believe it waswritten by León himself. Although mainstream Judaism considers Kabbalahnonsense, it is at the centre of Hasidic Judaism, the more ecstatic form of thefaith.ISAAC LURIAIsaac Luria is considered the ‘father of contemporary Kabbalah’, and it hisinterpretation of the mystical tradition that concerns us here. A story has itthat one day, Isaac’s father, an Ashkenazi Jew, was in the synagogue inJerusalem (where Isaac was born) studying, when he was visited by the prophetElijah. He told him that he would have a son who would deliver Israel from theklipoth (‘shells’ or forces of evil) and transmit to the faithful their tikkun(‘reparation’), and that he would make clear many of the mysteries of the Torahand explain the secrets of the Zohar. The story is most likely apocryphal, butit sums up Luria’s short life admirably.By the age of twenty-two, Luria had become devoted to the study of the Zohar,which had only recently been printed for the first time. He became a hermit,living for seven years on the banks of the Nile in a small cottage. During thistime he saw his family (he was by then married) only on the Sabbath, and hadtaken a vow of silence, speaking only when necessary, even to his wife. Legendhas it that during his solitude he was visited on more than one occasion byElijah, who tutored him in the mysteries.In Safed in 1570, Luria became a student of the Kabbalist Moses Cordovero(1522–1570), author of Pardes Rimonin, or ‘Garden of Pomegranates’, an attemptat a systematic presentation of Kabbalistic philosophy, linking it to previousteachings, and trying to bring different variants together into a coherentwhole. Considered a classic and standard text, its presentation was onlysuperseded by Luria’s own ideas. Luria’s tutelage under Cordovero lasted only ashort while, a few months at best, and when Cordovero died, the circle ofstudents looked for new guidance. Their search didn’t take them very far, andLuria accepted the role as teacher. Elijah’s prophecy, apocryphal or not, seemedto be coming true, and for the remaining two years of his life, Luria laid downthe groundwork of a new reading of the revelations.Luria himself did not write much. His literary remains consist of a few poems,but after his death his ideas were disseminated by his disciple Chayyim Vital(1543–1620), who played a kind of Plato to Luria’s Socrates, making notes of hislectures and compiling these into books, such as the eight volumes of his OtzChiim. It was through Vital’s efforts that Luria’s vision achieved theprominence it has.TZIMTZUMLuria’s re-visioning of Kabbalah came about because of problems in answeringcertain basic questions, such as how God or the Ein-Sof, which is infinite,could create a finite world like our own. (A similar and related conundrum ishow God, who is all good, could create a world like ours, that contains evil.)Luria’s answer was ingenious. Luria came up with the concept of tzimtzum, whichmeans ‘concealment’ and ‘contraction’.1 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--1]According to Luria, in order to create our world – the universe – God had to‘withdraw’ or ‘contract’ a part of his infinite being, to create, as it were, a‘hole’ in himself within which a void or empty space could exist. We can, then,think of our entire universe as a kind of hole in God. And as our universe is,by our standards, fairly large – just how large we will soon see – we canunderstand why the Kabbalists believed that trying to grasp the reality of theEin-Sof might be beyond our powers. Once the tzimtzum created the void, AdamKadmon, the Primordial Man, appeared. This idea, of an archetypal human form,which is itself the universe, can be found in other spiritual traditions.Swedenborg, for example, speaks of the Grand Man, an idea that was carried on byhis erstwhile disciple William Blake (1757–1827), who speaks of the ‘Human FormDivine’. The Hindu Vedas speak of Purusha, or ‘Cosmic Man’, from whose body theworld is created. The basic idea is that the universe itself is ultimately inthe shape or form of man, a very early form of what today we call the anthropiccosmological principle, the idea that, as mentioned earlier, the universe isdesigned in such a way that it will bring about the creation of intelligentlife.Out of the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears of Adam Kadmon come flashing lights,emanations of the divine creative energies. These form the sephiroth, orvessels, designed to contain these energies, as well as the twenty-two lettersof the Hebrew alphabet, the holy otiyot yesod or spiritual ‘building blocks’ ofcreation. (Much as the Greek philosopher-mystic Pythagoras believed that theworld was made, literally, of numbers, the Kabbalists believed it was made outof the Hebrew alphabet.) As in many spiritual traditions, in Kabbalah words andlanguage have mystical powers, and this is why the true name of God is never tobe pronounced; instead it is referred to as the Tetragrammaton, the YHVH orJehovah of convention. Were God’s true name spoken, it would, Kabbalah tells us,destroy the world.WHEN THE VESSELS BREAKThe vessels designed to hold the divine energies and archetypal forms with whichthe Ein-Sof will create the world, proved unable to contain them. Just as anelectrical transformer can hold only so strong a current, the sephiroth couldnot withstand the terrific power coursing through them. What happened then isknown as the shevirat-ha-kelim, the ‘breaking of the vessels’ (kelim is anotherword for vessel). In this cosmic catastrophe, the vessels shatter, and thedivine energies are scattered throughout the void. In one version, the divineenergies are seen as waters flowing from heaven. The vessels aren’t deep enoughto contain the waters, and so they spill out into the emptiness, creatingliterally a ‘holy mess’. Hence the opening sentence of this chapter. The sacredletters of the alphabet are also jumbled into a confusing nonsense. A tearappears in the seamless void and the unified divine forces separate into theiropposites, male and female, causing a fracture in God and the Primordial Man. Inthe words of Gershom Scholem, the most respected Judaic scholar of the lastcentury, following the shevirat-ha-kelim, ‘Nothing remains in its proper place’and ‘everything is somewhere else’. That somewhere else is our world.As shards from the broken vessels fall, they capture sparks of the divine light,and these sparks sink into layers of darkness, much like the ‘grim darkness’ ofthe Hermetic account. Tumbling into Sitra Achra, the ‘Other Side’ – the universeas we know it – the shards come together to form husks, or shells, known asklipoth, a kind of negative version of the sephiroth, something like aKabbalistic anti-matter (their designations as husks and shells suggest theirempty character). The result of the breaking of the vessels is that the world,which the Ein-Sof had originally planned to be formed of the highest values –beauty, love, mercy, wisdom, knowledge – is now corrupted by their evilcounterparts. And we too, who are fragments of the androgynous Primordial Man,are infected with the corruption. The klipoth that make up the universe are inus too, and we find ourselves here, separated into opposites, male and female,stranded on the Other Side. Hence our world is one of pain, suffering,falsehood, conflict, and the other evils we are all too familiar with.TIKKUNThis depressing state of affairs is reminiscent of the Gnostic view of ourselvesas trapped in an evil world devised by an idiot god. But, as in the Hermeticaccount, all is not lost. Luria’s dramatic version of the creation story and itssubsequent cosmic catastrophe would be a paranoid’s dream – or nightmare – if itwere not for the possibility that the situation can be saved. In this man playsthe central role. If in the Hermetic creation myth we are caretakers of theworld, for Lurianic Kabbalah, we are its cosmic repairmen, here to clean up themess caused by the spilling of the divine energies. Although the klipoth arewithin us, as in the Hermetic account, we also carry within us sparks of thedivine energies. In fact, everything in the world has within it some heavenlyspark. Mankind’s job is to free the sparks (netzotzim) from the shards, throughwhat Luria called tikkun, or ‘repair’. Through this we will restore theshattered sephiroth, heal the rift between the opposites, and unify thepolarised masculine and feminine aspects of God.The German-Jewish cultural philosopher Walter Benjamin (1892–1940) combined adeep interest in Kabbalah with a commitment to Marxism. In one of his most wellknown essays, Benjamin wrote of what he called ‘the angel of history’.2[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--2] Where we perceive the past as a chain ofseparate events, the angel, Benjamin tells us, sees it as ‘one singlecatastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage’. This ‘singlecatastrophe’ is the result of the breaking of the vessels, and it takes placethroughout history, here, on the Other Side. Benjamin had hopes that a kind ofMarxist redemption would save the world, and ‘make whole what has been smashed’.Yet ultimately he despaired and committed suicide while trying to escape theNazis.3 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--3]Luria, and the Kabbalists who followed him, believed that we can stop thecatastrophe and make whole what has been smashed. But he didn’t think, asBenjamin did, in terms of some Messianic event – a revolution or even divineintervention – that would finally stop the wreckage from piling up.4[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] His approach was more individual. He believedthat in our lives we encounter those trapped sparks, whether in people, nature,or inanimate things, which we are uniquely qualified to liberate, just as weencounter people and situations that can help liberate our own ‘sparks’. Bydoing this, we ‘repair’ the universe. But equally so, our failure to performtikkun only increases the world’s confusion. This being so, mankind has acrucial role to play in the world. As Sanford L. Drob, a contemporary Kabbalist,writes: ‘the restoration and repair of the broken vessels is largely in thehands of humankind.’5 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--5] As mentioned, for someKabbalists, God or the Ein-Sof shattered the vessels on purpose, precisely sothat man could repair them. But in this version, our work is more than repair.‘In freeing the divine sparks from the klipoth,’ Drob writes, ‘and restoringthem to God, and re-establishing the flow of masculine and feminine divineenergies, man acts as a party in the creation and redemption of the world, andis actually said to complete God himself.’6 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--6] Notonly are we entrusted with the responsibility of saving the universe, but, asmentioned earlier, God too.IT’S A BIG WORLD AFTER ALLWe will return to tikkun and how we can clean up the cosmic mess we findourselves in. Right now, let’s take a closer look at that hole in God we callthe universe. What is it like on the Other Side?At the risk of pummelling the reader into submission with numbers, let me relatesome facts and figures about the place we call home. According to the latestestimate, the observable universe seems to be a sphere of about 93.2 billionlight years in diameter; that gives it a radius of roughly 46.6 billion lightyears. A light year, we know, is the distance that a beam of light can travel ina year. Light travels at 186,000 miles per second, so a light year equalsroughly six trillion miles, or just short of ten trillion kilometres. A trillionis a 1 followed by twelve zeros. One light year is a 6 followed by twelve zeros.Six trillion times ninety-three billion would give us the diameter of theobservable universe in miles, or roughly 558 with twenty-two zeros followingit.7 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--7] I say the ‘observable’ universe because,although the portion of the universe that we can actually observe, through theHubble and other powerful telescopes, is large, according to the latestestimates it is only a fraction of the entire universe. That’s assuming there isan ‘entire’ universe, meaning a single, definite object that we could in someway see as a whole, a proposition that itself entails dizzying logicalproblems.8 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--8] We do not know if the rest of theuniverse, which we can’t observe, ends in some way, or if it simply carries oninto infinity, but either proposition is, like the Ein-Sof itself, unthinkablefor us.Exactly why there is an ‘observable’ and ‘unobservable’ universe is complex, butfor our purposes we can say that there is reason to believe that there areobjects in the universe so distant from us and travelling away from us at such aspeed – our universe, we know, is expanding – that their light will never reachus. It is not a question of our instruments not being powerful enough. Therestrictions of time and space themselves and the conditions set by the proposedBig Bang, make it impossible for us to ever detect these objects. One estimateof the size of the total universe, provided by the ‘cosmic inflation’ theory ofAlan Guth, gives us a figure 10/23 times larger than the observable universe. Iwill not burden the reader with the number of zeros this gives us. The‘cosmological principle’, which goes back to Isaac Newton, tells us that thereis no privileged position within the universe from which to observe it, meaningthat from any point in the universe, the universe looks pretty much the same, inwhatever direction an observer may observe it. Given that the notion of an‘observable’ universe is true from any point within it – it is not a measurementof distance itself, but of how much of the universe can be observed from anypoint within it – and the much larger total universe that lies beyond the‘observability barrier’, it seems that the old definition of God as ‘a circlewhose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere’ takes on newmeaning. Each of us is a centre of the observable universe, and were we totravel half the distance to its edge, we would still be a centre of theobservable universe. Only the parts of the universe we could observe would havechanged.Estimates for the number of stars within the observable universe vary from 3 to100 x 10/22, or thirty sextillion to one septillion, with an estimated eighty totwo hundred billion galaxies. This, of course, is only a fraction of the numberof stars and galaxies there may be in the total universe. Within the observableuniverse, of the largest objects so far detected we find what is called theGreat Wall, a sheet or chain of galaxies, known as a ‘galactic filament’, morethan five hundred million light years long and two hundred million wide. An evenlarger structure is the Sloan Great Wall, so named because it was discovered byJ. Richard Gott III and Mario Juric in 2003 using data from the Sloan DigitalSky Survey. It is 1.37 billion light years long, more than twice the size of theGreat Wall. Another large structure is known by the curious name of NewfoundBlob, a kind of cloud of galaxies, super-clusters (groups of smaller galaxies)and gigantic gas bubbles that measures some two hundred million light years inlength. There is also what is known as the Great Attractor, another largeobject, some 150 million light years in size, that is pulling our galaxy and therest of our ‘local group’ – which includes Andromeda, the galaxy closest to theMilky Way – toward the constellation Leo at a speed of four hundred miles perhour.9 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--9] Beyond these no larger structures haveyet been discovered, giving rise to what is called ‘the end of greatness’, aphrase that oddly parallels the ‘fallacy of insignificance’ with which this bookis concerned.At the opposite end from these colossal objects are the ‘voids’, stretches ofthe universe which seem empty of any galaxies, like gigantic cosmic vacant lots.Large voids are called ‘supervoids’, and galaxies that find themselvesinhabiting a void are called ‘void galaxies’. They are the hermits of theuniverse, galactic recluses living lonely existences in what seems sheer emptyspace. Most galaxies are apparently more gregarious, existing as part of acluster, filament, wall, or sheet. I say the void galaxies exist in empty spacebut apparently this is not exactly true, as what appears to us as empty spaceis, according to the latest findings, really full of what is called ‘darkmatter’, mentioned earlier in relation to the ‘grim darkness’ of the Hermeticcreation myth. It is unclear exactly what dark matter is, but the universe seemsfull of it. In fact all of the matter and energy in the known, observableuniverse only accounts for 5% of the mass of the cosmos; the other 95% ismissing. Dark matter, and its counterpart, ‘dark energy’, as well as the equallymysterious ‘power of nothing’, seem to confirm what mystics and occultists havebeen saying for centuries: that the universe, observable or otherwise, teemswith unseen (‘occult’) forces.10 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--10]BIG BANGS OF NOTHINGAnd if the universe is big, it is also old. 13.75 billion years at the latestestimate, although some suggest 15 billion. It began in what is known as the BigBang, a kind of Holy Grail of modern cosmology, although to some physicists thetheory is not entirely unassailable. Unshakeable or not, it is curious that inat least three different creation myths – the scientific, the Hindu, and theChristian, and there may be more – sound plays a central role. In the Gospel ofJohn we are told that ‘In the beginning was the Word.’ For Hindus, in thebeginning was Om, the sacred, mystic syllable. But leave it to us moderns tostart off with a bang. The vessels did shatter, after all.Although current theory takes us to 10/-37 seconds into it – an unimaginablybrief stretch of time, which, we’re told, like space didn’t exist until the BigBang – we still don’t know exactly what triggered the bang. Although manyscientists like to say that we are closing in on the ‘secret of the universe’ –witness the recent excitement about the mysterious Higgs-Boson particle – anytheories about why the bang happened at all remain speculative.11[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--11] If we ask obvious questions such as what wasbefore the Big Bang, scientists shake their heads and explain that we can’t askthat because, as mentioned earlier, according to them, there was no ‘before’.There was also no ‘where’ for the Big Bang to happen, as both time and space‘began’ with it. Yet, as the literary philosopher George Steiner argues, ‘It isintellectually, possibly morally dishonest to rule, by magisterial fiat, thatany question as to time prior to the Big Bang is illegitimate nonsense.’12[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--12] It is doubtful, however, if many scientistsconsider this.The physicist Stephen Hawking tells us that our universe came into being througha ‘quantum fluctuation in a pre-existent vacuum’, which, for non-physicists likemyself, can perhaps best be understood as a kind of ripple in nothing. As theworld’s media announced a few years back, there was no need for God to createthe world, as in his book The Grand Design (2010) Hawking had made clear that‘spontaneous creation’ was all that was necessary to get things going.13[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--13] The universe had apparently created itself,truly a creatio ex nihilo. Hawking’s earlier goal of coming up with a ‘theory ofeverything’ that would tie existence up into a neat bundle and leave nounanswered questions – thus making us privy to the ‘mind of God’ – had, itseemed, now been trumped by a ‘theory of nothing.’ Nothing had started theuniverse, he assures us, and there seems to be nothing we can do about it. It isperhaps from conclusions like these that the astrophysicist Steven Weinbergarrived at his famous pronouncement that ‘the more the universe seemscomprehensible the more it also seems pointless.’14[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--14]But once that nothing got going, boy was it something. Beginning in aninfinitesimally small, extremely hot, incredibly dense state, it – whatever itwas – burst into the mother of all explosions, literally. If the enormous sizeof the universe and of some of the objects in it, as well as the number of them,seems overwhelming, there is equal mystery in the other direction, something thesixteenth century French mathematician and religious thinker Blaise Pascal(1623–1662) recognised when he remarked that man finds himself between twoinfinities, the infinitely large and the infinitely small. Is it possible for usto in any way appreciate 10/-37 seconds? In between the time you read thatquestion and consider it, the universe, according to the ‘inflationary theory’,had ‘inflated’ – like a character’s head in a cartoon – by a factor of 10/50(possibly 10/78) from less than nothing to a very big something. When thisinflation stopped, the fledgling universe then consisted of quark-gluon plasma,or a ‘quark soup’, quarks being perhaps the most fundamental element insubatomic particles, their odd name borrowed from James Joyce’s Finnegan’s Wake(‘Three quarks for Muster Mark!’) by the physicist Murray Gell-Mann, theirdiscoverer. Gluons are particles that hold the quarks together, and plasma issometimes called ‘the fourth state of matter’, to differentiate it from solids,liquids, and gasses. A plasma is a gas at such a high temperature that outerelectrons are stripped from atoms, producing clouds of positively charged nucleiand negatively charged electrons. Although plasmas exist on earth only underlaboratory conditions, most of the matter in the universe – in the atmosphere ofstars and in interstellar space – is in a plasma state, except, of course, for‘dark matter’ (we don’t know what state it is in). It is a curious feature ofquantum physics and modern cosmology that many scientists within the fields givenew entities rather whimsical names – ‘quarks’, ‘Newfound blob’ – a somewhat‘geeky’ habit that accounts for the notion of a ‘theory of everything’ thatwould fit on a T-shirt.15 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--15]After some 380,000 years, the exploding incandescent universe cooled. For somestill unknown reason more matter than anti-matter was created, a glitch in BigBang theory which actually suggests that equal amounts of matter and anti-mattershould have been created. What we know as the matter in the universe is reallythe extra matter left over, after the original matter and anti-matter particlesannihilated each other. Were it not for this excess matter, nothing would exist.In Kabbalistic terms, we can say that there were more kernels than husks leftover after the vessels shattered. As the universe continued to cool, it producedparticles, protons, neutrons, and electrons that fused to form the earliestelements, hydrogen and helium, with lithium running a close third. Clouds ofthese gases condensed through gravity to form our stars and galaxies, andsomething known as ‘symmetry breaking’ put the fundamental forces of physics inplace. Elementary particles reached their present form, with heavier elementsbeing created within stars and supernovae, the spectacular ‘death’ of a star,when it literally burns itself out in a terrific explosion.GIVE LIFE A CHANCEAccording to the latest estimates, our earth itself formed some 4.5 billionyears ago, roughly ten billion years after the Big Bang, from cosmic dust andgas left over from the sun’s formation. It is believed life appeared on earthwithin a billion years after our planet formed. The standard account of the‘birth of life’ suggests that self-replicating molecules accidentally emergedfrom the primordial soup some 3.5 billion years ago, and through an equallyaccidental process, over millions of years eventually turned into myself writingthese words and you reading them – with, of course, quite a few differentorganisms in between. As with the Big Bang, the emergence of life is anotherexample of the ‘something from nothing for no reason’ scenario popular with manyscientists today. According to the same scenario, the consciousness I amexhibiting in writing these words – humble, indeed – and which you are employingin reading them, also emerged purely through accident, as an epiphenomenon ofpurely physical interactions of our brains’ neurons, which are themselves theresult of the purely mechanical process of evolution, the Darwinian version. (Anepiphenomenon is a kind of side show to the main attraction. Steam is anepiphenomenon of boiling water; it has no existence in itself, and without theboiling water, there would be no steam. For many neuroscientists andphilosophers of mind today, our consciousness is little more than a kind ofsteam given off by the brain.16 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--16])To dot the i’s and cross the t’s on this, let me say it in the simplest waypossible. According to the most commonly accepted scientific view, no one wantedthe Big Bang to happen. No one wanted the earth to form. No one wanted life toappear on the earth. And no one wanted life to evolve into us. There is noreason for any of it. It just happened.This is a conclusion that the French Nobel Prize winning scientist Jacques Monod(1910–1976), one of the fathers of molecular biology, put perhaps moreeloquently. Monod writes that:Chance alone is at the source of every innovation, of all creation in thebiosphere. Pure chance, absolutely free but blind, at the very root of thestupendous edifice of evolution: this central concept of modern biology is nolonger one among other conceivable hypotheses. It is today the sole conceivablehypothesis, the only one that squares with observed and tested fact. And nothingwarrants the supposition – or the hope – that on this score our position is everlikely to be revised … The universe was not pregnant with life nor the biospherewith man. Our number came up in the Monte Carlo game.17[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--17]From this insight, which is radically opposed to any kind of ‘anthropicprinciple’, Monod developed a rather bleak picture of our position in the world.‘Man’, he tells us, ‘at last knows he is alone in the unfeeling immensity of theuniverse, out of which he has emerged only by chance. His destiny is nowherespelled out, nor is his duty. The kingdom above or the darkness below; it is forhim to choose.’Although his countryman Jean Paul Sartre (1905–1980), the most well knownexistentialist, had a low opinion of science – according to his lover Simone deBeauvoir, Sartre ‘flatly refused to believe in science’ and believed that‘microbes and other animalculae invisible to the naked eye didn’t exist’ – henevertheless agreed with Monod on at least this proposition.18[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--18] For Sartre, man has existence, but no essence(‘his destiny is nowhere spelled out, nor is his duty’), and is ultimately a‘useless passion’.19 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--19] Like Monod, Sartrebelieves that we must face this grim situation stoically and make the best ofit, but there is absolutely nothing we can do about it. Suffice it to say,neither Monod’s view nor Sartre’s is one that sits well with our beingcaretakers or repairmen of the cosmos.MATTERS DARK AND MEANINGLESSAptly, one character who shares Monod’s gloomy vision of a chance-riddenuniverse and of ourselves as purposeless creatures within it, is the Americanhorror fiction writer H.P. Lovecraft. Although Lovecraft was not a scientist (hewas, though, a keen amateur astronomer) throughout his short life he professedan astringently materialist view of life and the cosmos. To a correspondentLovecraft wrote:I am an absolute sceptic and materialist, and regard the universe as a whollypurposeless and essentially temporary incident in the ceaseless and boundlessrearrangements of electrons, atoms, and molecules which constitute the blind butregular mechanical patterns of cosmic activity. Nothing really matters, and theonly thing for a person to do is to take the artificial and traditional valueshe finds around him and pretend they are real; in order to retain that illusionof significance in life which gives to human events their apparent motivationand semblance of interest.20 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--20]Note that for Lovecraft, we maintain our ‘illusion of significance’ bymaintaining values that are ‘artificial’ and which we only ‘pretend’ to be real.For anyone who embraces the belief that pure chance is responsible for ourexistence – and that includes quite a few of the most prestigious minds of ourtime – it logically follows that ‘nothing really matters’ as our actions canhave absolutely no effect, one way or the other. It is difficult to see howvalues like love, freedom, truth, justice, beauty and others, that we hold givemeaning to life, can have emerged from an existence accounted for by the ‘blindbut regular mechanical patterns’ of ‘electrons, atoms, and molecules’, a visionof things that goes back to the pre-Socratic Greek philosophers Democritus andLeucippus. In such a world, values can have only a subjective and consensualexistence, as fictions we agree on maintaining, as the only real things arepurely physical, and, so far as we know, beauty, love, and other values are notmade of atoms or molecules. If values are real, they exist in some non-physicalkind of reality, of the kind Plato had in mind when he spoke of the good, thetrue, and the beautiful. Although the conclusion, that the values which givelife meaning are really illusions, follows from the premise that chance isresponsible for life and the universe, it rarely gets mentioned by thescientists who accept that premise.Most of Lovecraft’s weird fiction (of which I am a great fan) was published inthe pulp horror magazines of the 1920s and 30s, of which Weird Tales is the bestknown. But while other Weird Tales writers, like Robert E. Howard (the creatorof Conan) and Clark Ashton Smith, still have readers (I myself am occasionallyone of them), Lovecraft’s frankly overwritten stories acquired a seriouscritical cachet denied his friends and colleagues. Perhaps understandably, thiscritical importance was first recognised in the 1950s by the French, who acentury earlier had embraced Edgar Allan Poe, a major influence on Lovecraft,when he was ignored by his fellow Americans.21 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--21]Lovecraft’s acceptance by the French, I would argue, had something to do withthe bleak vision his stories portray, which is in essence the same as that ofSartre’s grim philosophy and Monod’s biological lottery. It is this atmosphereof existential dread, of some dark and terrifying knowledge breaking into ourconsciousness, that gives Lovecraft’s tales a flavour as unmistakable asKafka’s, and which he shares with Sartre, whose existentialism Lovecraft wouldno doubt have turned his nose up at. For both the protagonists of Lovecraft’sstories and Sartre’s novels, knowledge is a trigger for a cosmic pessimism.NAUSEAFor Sartre this cosmic pessimism is the ‘nausea’ of his most famous work, hisfirst novel Nausea (1938), which I first read as a teenager. The hero of thisnovel has come to the startling recognition that things exist. But theirexistence has nothing to do with him, or with the stories or ideas he tells orhas about them. They exist aggressively, in their own right; the names andcategories and meanings we usually use to understand them – tree, stone, cloud,star – are simply falsehoods we tell in order to keep their strangeness atbay.22 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--22] But now he knows, and the knowledgeparalyses him. At one point in the novel, Roquentin, the protagonist, looks atthe root of a chestnut tree and is perplexed by it. ‘I no longer remembered thatit was a root’ he tells us.23 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--23] Its existencefrightens him. Like everyone else, he had taken existence for granted, and nowit suddenly presses in upon him. It has lost its ‘harmless appearance as anabstract category’. It had become the very ‘paste’ of things, and he cannot getaway from it. At another point in the novel he is about to open a door when helooks at the strange thing in his hand and has no idea what it is. It was thedoor knob. Sartre’s ‘nausea’ is not unlike states of mind associated withschizophrenia, when the connection between perception and feeling is unhinged.It is also suggestive that much of the inspiration for Nausea came from a badmescaline trip Sartre had in 1936, in which he was attacked by devil fish andfollowed by an orang-utan, and in which umbrellas turned into vultures and shoesinto skeletons.24 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--24]THE MISANTHROPIC COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLELovecraft’s protagonists are also discomfited by knowledge. But while for Sartrea root or a doorknob spells doom, Lovecraft’s dark insights are occasioned bymore eccentric items. What knowledge means for Lovecraft can be best expressedby quoting the opening paragraph of his most famous story, ‘The Call ofCthulhu’, first published in Weird Tales in 1928. ‘The most merciful thing inthe world’, Lovecraft writes:… is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on aplacid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was notmeant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its owndirection, have hitherto harmed us little; but one day the piecing together ofdissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of ourfrightful position therein, that we shall go mad from the revelation or fleefrom the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.25[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--25]The theme linking the stories making up Lovecraft’s ‘Cthulhu Mythos’, a literarymythology that Lovecraft’s fellow Weird Tales writers contributed to and towhich contemporary writers still add today, is that in dim ages past, wellbefore man appeared, the earth was inhabited by strange, monstrous creatures,The Great Old Ones, who were expelled from it but who ‘yet live on outside everready to take possession of this earth again.’26[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--26] The Great Old Ones are terrifying indeed.Cthulhu him – or it – self is usually described as ‘blasphemous’, ‘eldritch’,‘loathsome’, or another string of evocative adjectives, and is usually depictedas a kind of winged, tentacled, squid-like monstrosity of enormous size, whoresides in the lost city of R’lyeh, sunken beneath the South Pacific. But whilethe actual beings of the Cthulhu Mythos – Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep,Shub-Niggurath, ‘the black goat of a thousand young’, and the rest – aredisturbing indeed, what is truly frightening about Lovecraft’s cosmos is thatthese entities are not, as in traditional horror tales, supernatural, but merelyproducts, like ourselves, of the chance work of accidental evolution in a‘wholly purposeless’ universe. In our case, the ‘boundless rearrangements ofelectrons, atoms, and molecules’ that constitute the ‘blind but regularmechanical patterns of cosmic activity’ gave rise to us, and our ‘artificialvalues’ that allow us to live give us the false idea that, all in all, thecosmos is a relatively friendly and cosy place. But there we’re wrong. The sameblind forces that gave rise to us – and to Beethoven, Plato, Leonardo da Vinci,the Buddha, and Mother Teresa – also gave rise to these loathsome beings forwhom we are negligible insects, when we are not mindless slaves or a tasty horsd’oeuvre. What is scary in the best of Lovecraft is this sense that we areignorant of the truth about reality – like Sartre’s Roquentin – and if we onlyknew, we would be afraid.Lovecraft called his philosophy ‘cosmicism’, by which he basically meant that ifwe truly grasped the size, age, and sheer strangeness of the universe – an ideaof which I tried to present earlier in this chapter – we would recognise thathuman life can play no important part in it, and that we are only temporaryresidents on a planet whose previous occupants are planning to return.27[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--27] Possibly the earliest proponent of ‘cosmicism’,although he didn’t use the term, was H.G. Wells (1866–1946), whose novel The Warof the Worlds (1898) tells us that our world was ‘being watched keenly andclosely by intelligences greater than man’s’ – the Martians – ‘and yet as mortalas his own … minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts thatperish, intellects vast, cool, and unsympathetic…’28[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--28] When Lovecraft wrote ‘The Call of Cthulhu’, noone had yet thought of a Big Bang – the astronomer Fred Hoyle, an opponent ofthe idea, coined the phrase in 1949 – although Einstein’s relativity was seepinginto popular consciousness and quantum theory was raising its head. One canimagine contemporary Lovecrafts having a field day with our current cosmologies.And we can say that if there is an ‘anthropic cosmological principle’ thatsuggests human life – or at least life like ours – is somehow necessary to thecosmos, Lovecraft’s ‘misanthropic principle’ suggests the exact opposite.Of course not all fiction written from a ‘cosmic’ view is as dark asLovecraft’s. His contemporary Olaf Stapledon (1886–1950), for example, took asimilar theme, yet didn’t use it to scare his readers. Stapledon’s Last andFirst Men (1930) and Star Maker (1937) are vast, cosmic future histories, inwhich different races, species, planets, and galaxies, arise from and sink intothe cosmic depths. But reading Stapledon produces a sense of wonder andexhilaration, not terror. To be fair to Lovecraft, in his last work he toobegins to see that the awareness that it’s a big universe can lead to someinsights more productive than the need to ‘flee’ into the safety of a ‘darkage’, as his story ‘The Shadow Out of Time’ (1936) makes clear. Some of hisother misanthropic views also seemed to have softened with time. Sadly, by thistime, Lovecraft was dying, and the insight came too late for him to make muchuse of it.IT’S A TOUGH COSMOS OUT THEREMention of a ‘misanthropic cosmological principle’ leads us to an insight intoLovecraft’s character. He was by all accounts an eccentric type, and for most ofhis life he lived in Providence, Rhode Island, where he was born, doted on bytwo aunts and surrounded by the remnants of his childhood. A brief marriage andlife in New York proved disastrous. The asexual Lovecraft was not cut out formarried life, and the immigrant population of New York offended his primsensibilities. Lovecraft always fantasised himself as an aristocratic Englishgentleman of the eighteenth century, and to share the streets and subways ofBrooklyn with Jews, blacks, Italians, Spaniards, and who knows who else was anaffront to him. This aristocratic self-image was associated with a sense of anintellectual, or at least a cultural and aesthetic superiority. Lovecraftloathed the modern world, and as one critic has pointed out, we can read hisghoulish stories as a full out assault on it.29 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--29]He knew that the values that make life meaningful for most of us were sheerillusions. He knew that our sense of being at home in the world was born ofsheer ignorance. But unlike the ignorant fools who needed God or some othersupernatural reality, and who believed that meaning and purpose were at work inthe universe and not mere chance, he was tough enough to face this truth. Hedetested those fools who weren’t, and so he wrote stories of cosmic terror toscare them.The idea that those who embrace chance as the sole force at play in existenceare tough enough to do without the illusions the rest of us enjoy, is a themethat comes up again and again. Even Lovecraft himself was accused of not quitemaking the grade. Of one story, ‘The Whisperer in the Darkness’ (1931), hisbiographer, S.T. Joshi, remarks that in it, Lovecraft couldn’t ‘quite bringhimself to admit that human penetration of the unknown gulfs of the cosmos isanything but an appalling aberration.’30 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--30] Oftenthose who reject meaning and purpose accuse those who look for it of wanting theworld to be that way – who wouldn’t, they concede – but of not being strong (orhonest, or hard, or brave, etc.) enough to face the truth. But it strikes methat the opposite can be just as true, although it rarely gets a mention: thatthose who embrace meaninglessness and chance want to be seen as tougher (or moreintelligent, honest, brave, etc.) then those who ‘need’ meaning and purpose.Frequently the search for or expectation of meaning is seen as a weakness. Yetagain, the opposite can be just as true. The embrace of meaninglessness can bean expression of a hunger for superiority, the need to feel more intelligent andstrong than the rest of us fools, just as it can be seen as a form ofmisanthropy, of a dislike of human beings. Both motives seem to me to be at playin the work of John Gray, considered one of the most important socialphilosophers of our time.SHADES OF GRAYAs in the case of Stephen Hawking’s pronouncements on how the universe began, Ifind myself perplexed as to why John Gray’s philosophy has acquired the aura ofimportance it has, at least for some readers. Prestigious names have sung hispraises. For the late novelist J.G. Ballard, Gray’s Straw Dogs: Thoughts onHumans and Other Animals (2002) was ‘the most exciting book since RichardDawkins’ The Selfish Gene’. James Lovelock of Gaia fame tells us that Gray‘forces us to face the mirror and see ourselves as we are’. And for the criticBryan Appleyard, whose opinion on other matters I’ve found cogent, Gray’s bookwas ‘unquestioningly one of the great works of our time’. Others have expressedsimilar appreciation. It may seem aberrant to fly in the face of such universalcelebration, but as far as I can tell from reading Gray’s books, he is basicallya misanthropic pessimist, whose pro-nature and pro-animal remarks express littlemore than an emotional dislike for human beings. This misanthropy is somethingwe’ve already seen in Lovecraft and is obvious to anyone who reads Sartre, hischampioning of human freedom notwithstanding.I say I am perplexed by the importance Gray is given, because his philosophyseems as grim as Schopenhauer’s, who also believed existence was meaningless,and expresses a ferocity toward human values reminiscent of the Marquis de Sade.I would even go as far as to say that remarks similar to Gray’s anti-humanrhetoric have been used in other contexts to justify murder, although I don’tbelieve Gray himself intended his own comments for that purpose. Yet Gray’sdislike of human beings leads me to suspect that he would not be too troubled ifsome of them quietly disappeared. Sadly, his animosity toward humans ispredictably welcome because of our environmental concerns and guilty conscienceabout the planet. We have such a bad conscience about ourselves that one couldsay practically anything negative about human beings and be applauded for it asa deep thinker. Concern for the planet, however, can lead to some troublingplaces.In Straw Dogs Gray remarks that from ‘Gaia’s’, or the earth’s, point of view‘human life has no more meaning than the life of a slime mould’.31[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--31] When I wrote an article about Gray’s idea someyears ago, I pointed out that a similar assessment of human importance waschampioned by Charles Manson, currently serving a life sentence for the murdersof Sharon Tate and Rosemary and Leno LaBianca in 1969.32[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--32] Of the many pseudo-philosophical remarks Mansonmade and which were taken seriously by otherwise intelligent people, one wasthat a scorpion’s life was more important than a human’s.33[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--33] While in prison, Manson had time to reflect onthis insight, and to elaborate on its application. According to Manson, peopleand the ‘system’ were killing the planet. When Manson’s ‘Family’ killed SharonTate – eight months pregnant – as well as Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, accordingto Charlie they ‘gave their lives’ and ‘took lives’ in order to ‘clean up ATWA …the whole life of the earth, in love and concern for brothers and sisters ofsoul’.34 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--34]ATWA is Manson’s acronym for Air, Trees, Water, Animals (sometimes All The WayAlive), the name Manson gave to his radical ‘ecological movement’, shepherded byhimself and two members of his Family, Lynette ‘Squeaky’ Fromme and SandraGood.35 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--35] It may seem unbelievable, but asNicholas Goodrick-Clarke points out, in recent decades Manson has beenre-invented as an ‘eco-warrior’, and much of his rhetoric is eerily resonantwith that of influential eco-groups such as Earth First!, the Animal LiberationFront, the Greens, and a good portion of New Age philosophy.36[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--36] The Earth First! founder Dave Foreman declaredthat ‘we are all animals’ and agreed with Manson that human life is of noparticular importance. ‘An individual human life has no more intrinsic valuethan an individual Grizzly Bear (indeed, some of us would argue that anindividual Grizzly Bear is more important …).’37[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--37] Although Gray would probably agree with this, Idon’t believe he would go to the lengths Manson did to make his point. But someof Gray’s remarks make clear that being nature-oriented is not all sweetness andlight. Whether we want to recognise it or not, there is a dark side to Gaia.Gray’s central idea is that ‘humans think they are free conscious beings, whenin truth they are deluded animals,’ a borrowing from Friedrich Nietzsche(1844–1900), who, in his Genealogy of Morals (1887) said that ‘man is the sickanimal’.38 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--38] (Nietzsche’s Zarathustra called usthe ‘cruellest animal’ as well, a sobriquet with which Gray would no doubt alsoconcur.)39 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--39] Free will, morality, and otherspecifically human concerns are for Gray simply illusions, just as they are forH.P. Lovecraft and the neuroscientists who believe consciousness is merely anepiphenomenon. We are, for Gray, fundamentally a rapacious species, intent oneradicating other forms of life, and we should own up to this, and forget allthe nonsense about being anything other. Rather than call ourselves homo sapiensGray suggests homo rapiens. Of course, not everyone agrees with this, and notall critics of this position are weak-kneed spiritual types. At the New Humanistwebsite – where one finds ‘ideas for Godless people’ – Raymond Tallis, a secularhumanist philosopher, takes Gray to task for arguing that we are nothing morethan animals, a symptom of what Tallis calls ‘Darwinosis’.40[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--40] A similar sensibility informs the historian ofscience Kenan Malik’s book Man, Beast, and Zombie (2001). Yet both Tallis andMalik would, I suspect, be surprised to find themselves in the company of aspiritual thinker like the poet Kathleen Raine (1908–2003), who agrees with themand against Gray that ‘nowadays the term ‘human’ has been inverted to the pointof signifying precisely what is least human in us, our bodily appetites…and allthat belongs to natural man.’41 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--41]All our problems, and those of the planet, according to Gray, stem from ourmisconceptions about ourselves, and from our inveterate fantasy about being ableto ‘transcend’ the ‘human condition’, which, as far as I can tell, is for Grayof the ‘only human’ character spelled out in the Introduction. Gray apparentlyhas no capacity to grasp human greatness, and any reference to it is merely thecue for some remark to cut us down to size. What Maslow’s ‘fully human’ wouldelicit from him I can only guess. ‘A glance at any human,’ he tells us, ‘shouldbe enough to dispel any notion that it is the work of an intelligent being’.42[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--42] This remark would not be out of place in thewritings of the Romanian arch-pessimist and one-time fascist enthusiast EmilCioran (1911–1995), the titles of whose books – The Trouble with Being Born, AShort History of Decay, On The Heights of Despair – would not be incongruentwith Gray’s own.43 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--43] ‘In every man sleeps aprophet, and when he wakes there is a little more evil in the world,’ ‘By allevidence we are in the world to do nothing,’ ‘So long as man is protected bymadness, he functions, and flourishes’ – these are all taken at random from AShort History of Decay (1949). Cioran’s misanthropic reflections are on firstglance effective, because their aphoristic style has a shock effect, like asharp jab to the ribs. Prolonged reading, however, reveals their basichollowness. The same, I think, can be said of Gray’s work. Cioran’s misanthropyand cynicism about human values paved his way to a profoundly anti-democraticpolitical philosophy that had no qualms about eradicating undesirable humanbeings, like Jews. The flipside of not liking human beings is not always savingthe planet.What seems to raise Gray’s ire is the idea that we can in any way be ‘masters ofour destiny’. In 1957, Julian Huxley (1887–1975), brother of Aldous Huxley, andone of the most important biologists of the twentieth century, said that theuniverse was ‘becoming conscious of itself … in a few of us human beings’, andthat we had been appointed ‘managing director of the biggest business of all,the business of evolution …’ He made these remarks in an essay entitled‘Transhumanism’, in which he expressed his belief that ‘the human species can,if it wishes, transcend itself.’ For Huxley this meant ‘man remaining man, buttranscending himself, by realising new possibilities of and for his humannature’, a sentiment with which I, and this book, are in accord – althoughHuxley’s term ‘transhumanism’ has been adopted by proponents of a ‘man-machinemerger’ with which I am not in sympathy.44 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--44]Huxley even spoke of ‘the cosmic office’ to which we find ourselves ‘appointed’,a phrase with obvious similarity to the idea of ourselves being cosmiccaretakers. Gray will have none of this and would, I suspect, greet any ideathat we can direct our evolution with derisive scorn. Like Jacques Monod andLovecraft, Gray sees little but chance at work in ourselves and the world. Notsurprisingly, at the beginning of his chapter headed ‘The Human’ in Straw Dogs,Gray quotes Monod on mankind’s desperate efforts to deny its ‘contingency’, afavourite word of Sartre’s, which expresses, for Sartre at least, the fact thatwe are in no way essential to the world.GRAY’S DRIFTAccording to Gray, ‘epidemiology and microbiology are better guides to ourfuture than any of our hopes and plans.’ We are, he tells us, only a ‘current inthe drift of genes’.45 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--45] ‘Drift’ is a favouriteterm of Gray’s. He uses it frequently in a more recent book, The ImmortalizationCommission (2011), a bewildering attack on the idea that we can in any way‘cheat death’, a theme already well explored in Ernst Becker’s equally dourDenial of Death (1973). Gray repeatedly tells us about the need to learn the‘lesson of Darwinism’, a lesson, apparently that Darwin himself didn’t quiteaccept. ‘Darwin never fully accepted the implications of his own theory’ – anexample of Gray being more royal than the king, of his ‘cosmic toughness’, and areference to Darwin’s concerns about the human consequences of his ‘dangerousidea’.46 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--46] Alfred Wallace, who arrived at thetheory of evolution independently but at the same time as Darwin – and who wasalso one of the first proponents of an anthropic cosmological principle – was‘highly credulous’, because he ‘concluded that the human mind could not havedeveloped simply as a result of evolution.’ Wallace believed in a ‘non-humanintelligence’ and a ‘spiritual world’ – he was interested in spiritualism andpsychic phenomena – and so must of course not have had the nerve to accept thetruth.47 [part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--47] (Freud, for his part, could never‘cure himself of his fascination with telepathy’.48[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--48] Once again, even a reductionist like Freud wasnot quite reductionist enough for Gray, and was in need of a ‘cure’ for hisaberrant interests.) What is important for Gray isn’t whether Darwin’s view ofevolution, or the canonising of it by today’s neo-Darwinians like RichardDawkins, is true, or can account for all the facts, but its ‘lesson’, which issomething we should learn, as if we were naughty children. That lesson issimple. Genes drift, like sand dunes, and the difference between a slime mould,a scorpion, and myself is merely the way the sand has shifted. In my case itproduced me; in H.P. Lovecraft’s, squid-faced Cthulhu. As human beings are thegreat vandals of the planet, the idea that we could in any way do anything otherthan ‘go with the flow’ infuriates Gray. The fact that only a human being canthink that his life is less important than a scorpion’s or a slime mould’s seemsto have escaped Gray. No scorpion or slime mould can think this, and one doubtsthat they would if they could.The central argument against Gray’s anti-human animus, however, is this, if itis the case that we can never be masters of our fate – if we can only ‘drift’ –then why bother to write a book about it? What possible good could readingGray’s books do, if they can’t change our destinies, which, according to him,are written in terms of epidemiology and microbiology? If, as he tells us,‘humans are animals ruled by blind selection’ and can never hope ‘to control theprocess of evolution’, why bother to point this out?49[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--49] (Or better still, if that is the case, then howcan we possible save the planet or ‘do as Gaia says’?) Or is it that the geneticdrift has simply made Gray write his books, as it makes his readers read them?But if that is the case, then drift is drift, no matter what shape the sanddunes are. They are all sand. Or is it that in Gray’s case, the drift hasmiraculously drifted into a dune that happens to be true?This is the problem with all theories that want to explain human action andpurposes in terms of blind, chance elements, whether it is ‘genetic drift’, ‘theceaseless and boundless rearrangements of electrons, atoms, and molecules’, or‘the Monte Carlo game’. If chance is behind everything, it is also behind theidea that it is behind everything, as well as the person or persons who believethat. Which suggests that, in all the possible arrangements of things, in yourcase, chance just happened to hit upon the arrangement that is true. But whyshould your chance arrangements of atoms or genes or anything else be anymoretrue than mine? The Nobel Prize winning molecular biologist Francis Crick(1916–2004) – co-discoverer of the structure of the DNA molecule – wrote that‘you, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and ambitions, your sense ofpersonal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behaviour of avast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules’.50[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--50] With all due respect, if that is the case, thenit is also true of Crick’s sorrows, memories, ambitions, identity – and hisbelief that these things are ‘no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly ofnerve cells and their associated molecules’. If my memories are ‘no more’ thanmolecules, and Crick’s belief that this is true is also ‘no more’ thanmolecules, then why are his molecules ‘more true’ than mine? Molecules aremolecules, just as sand is sand and drift is drift. The philosophers andscientists who make these kind of sweeping statements seem unaware that theyundermine any possibility of their being true – which is the only reason weshould give them a moment’s thought.MORE THAN ANIMALSThis sort of muddle is not the only thing wrong with Gray’s argument. I say‘argument’, but in fact, Gray does not argue. He simply asserts, and in ourtime, when it is ecologically-correct to have a guilty conscience about beinghuman, making the kinds of statements he does has the Zeitgeist behind it. Wefeel so bad about being human that it is difficult to say anything positiveabout ourselves, or to question the kind of bad-mouthing we receive. I havefound that if I do I am invariably accused of having something against animalsand not wanting to save the planet, neither of which is true. In our anarchictimes, filled with very real ecological, social, and political threats, it issatisfying to have a scapegoat on whom to pin the blame. For Gray that’s us. Butit is also dangerous; we’ve seen how close some of Gray’s remarks are to thoseof an ecologically-correct convicted killer. I agree that we face enormouschallenges – I’d be an idiot if I didn’t – and that many of our crises are ofour own making and that we need to grow beyond our short-sighted selfishness.But I don’t think throwing our humanity out with the bathwater is the best wayto go about this.One of Gray’s mistakes is to believe that we were all happy with being animalsuntil Christianity arrived. That is not true. As soon as we becameself-conscious, we realised we were somehow different from the other creaturesaround us, and the history of the human mind as been, more or less, an unpackingof that intuition. For thousands of years, human beings have felt and acted asif they were something more than animals – every religion is, in some way, aboutthis, and there were religions before Christianity. We always knew we had ananimal nature – that isn’t in doubt. But we didn’t believe it summed us upcompletely. It is in fact only since the rise of science, and specifically ofDarwinian evolution, and the crude, materialist reductionism born of them, thatwe have had the idea that we are only animals force fed us, with the bestintentions, no doubt. Whether it is selfish genes or naked apes, it is only inthe last few centuries that we have come to see ourselves as sick, deluded,cruel, rapacious – you can pick the adjective of your choice – animals, formed,not in the image of God, Nous, or the Ein-Sof, but of drifting matter. And asKathleen Raine has pointed out:The world has never been more hideous, more uninhabitable, than the worldcreated by an ideology that proclaims that this world is all, which gives tomatter a primacy, an all-importance unknown to other civilisations’.51[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--51]With the corollary that, as Colin Wilson writes, speaking of today: ‘it isprobably true to say that there has never been a point in human history whenhumankind had a more depressing view of itself.’52[part0006.xhtml#rw-num-note--52]1.

A DWELLER ON TWO WORLDS [part0001.xhtml]In the last chapter I tried to give an idea of the size, age, and sheerstrangeness of the universe we live in, and to present some of the scientificaccounts of how we and it got here, and the impact those accounts have had onour idea of ourselves and our place in the cosmos. But before I continue Ishould clarify one point. Although we use the terms interchangeably, there is adifference between a ‘universe’ and a ‘cosmos’. We use ‘universe’ or ‘world’ torefer to everything, to the ‘all’, or to the ‘space’ in which the galaxies,stars, planets and other stellar objects exist. Our word ‘universe’ comes fromthe Latin universum, which can be understood to mean ‘the one turning’ or ‘theone rotating’. Cosmos, however, has a more specific meaning. It comes from theGreek kosmos, which means an orderly or harmonious system, and is the oppositeof khaos – our ‘chaos’ – which for the Greeks meant a formless void, the stateof existence before creation. This is the tohu bohu or ‘trackless waste andemptiness’ of Genesis, before God said ‘Let there be light’. It is also the‘grim darkness’ of the Hermetic creation myth, and the ‘void’ created by theEin-Sof’ s ‘contraction’ in the tzimtuzm. (We can also think of the‘pre-existing vacuum’ in which, according to Stephen Hawking, a ‘quantumfluctuation’ led to the Big Bang.) The idea of harmony and order, or beauty, inrelation to a cosmos, comes through in our word ‘cosmetic’, which in theoriginal Greek meant something that beautifies, or enhances beauty, such as anornament, but which in our time has come to mean a superficial or false kind ofbeauty. We think of cosmetics as ‘make up’, something which provides glamour,but only deals with surfaces, not reality, and which is then considered false ornot essential. (The fact that when we tell a falsehood, it is something we ‘madeup’, just as when we pretend or invent something we ‘make it up’, also seemssuggestive.)The first person to speak of the world as a cosmos was the Greekmystic-philosopher Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century BC. Most of usremember learning the Pythagorean Theorem in school, in which, in a right-angledtriangle, the area of the square of the hypotenuse, equals the sum of the areaof the squares of the other two sides (a2 + b2 = c2), and many of us cannotforgive Pythagoras for discovering it. In the last chapter I mentioned thatPythagoras believed that the world was made of numbers. What this means is thatPythagoras recognised that there was an order within nature and the world, andthat this order is mathematical, an idea that can be found championed today inthe work of the scientist Roger Penrose.1 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--1]Pythagoras is also credited with discovering the musical octave, the fact thatdifferent musical notes are related to each other harmoniously because there isa simple ratio between the notes and the length of string making them. It wasfrom this insight that Pythagoras arrived at the notion of the ‘music of thespheres’, the idea that the planets and stars moved according to a similarmathematical equation, and in doing so produced a kind of cosmic harmony. It wasthis recognition of an order and of the beauty that it produced, that ledPythagoras to call the world a cosmos.Although scientists still use the word, and speak of ‘cosmology’, the kind oforder and beauty that Pythagoras recognised, and which informed our ideas aboutthe world for most of human history – a similar notion can be found in culturesother than in the west – is no longer the way in which we perceive the universe.With Big Bangs, black holes, colliding galaxies, and dark matter, if there is amusic of the spheres today, it must be much more along the lines of atonal music– Arnold Schoenberg comes to mind – or Stravinsky’s raucous Rite of Spring, thanBach. Perhaps the aleatoric or ‘chance’ music of John Cage is even more apt.Although we may find a strange beauty in photographs of distant galaxies andexploding stars, the universe we inhabit is much more turbulent, explosive, anderuptive, than the one Pythagoras knew. And as our own earth-bound world is alsomore turbulent than the one Pythagoras knew – the sheer increase in populationand the complexity of life suggests this – we can perhaps find new meaning inthe old Hermetic axiom ‘as above, so below’.THE END OF BEAUTYIt is curious that in many ways, changes in our ideas about art and beauty haveparalleled changes in our ideas about the universe. In postmodern and conceptualart, beauty itself is considered a false idea, merely ‘cosmetic’. The idea of awork of art having an immediate sensuous impact is suspect. I should say an art‘piece’, as it is usually referred to today, emphasising its broken orfragmented character.2 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--2] Today art, like life,consciousness, and the cosmos, must be ‘explained’, hence the often obscurewritings that accompany much contemporary art, and which are also equally inneed of explanation. As the psychiatrist and philosopher Iain McGilchristremarks, ‘it was not the norm, until the advent of modernism, for people to findnew styles of music unpleasant or incomprehensible’, thus exploding the myththat if we find some piece of postmodern music unlistenable, then it must be awork of genius, because all new works must sound strange to mere philistines.3[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--3] Nearly half a century ago, Kathleen Rainelamented that in the modern world, ‘the word beauty and the idea of thebeautiful, has ceased to count for anything,’ a sentiment echoed by the culturalhistorian Jacques Barzun, when he wrote that ‘not until the flowering of modernart did uncontrolled rage in vituperation and…spluttering sophomoric insult …find their way into works of artistic pretensions …’.4[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] Barzun’s remark was in response to the work ofAlfred Jarry, creator of the nihilistic Ubu plays, paragons of what thesurrealist André Breton called ‘black humour’, and his slogan that ‘We will nothave brought down everything in ruins until we also destroy the ruins’.5[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--5] A look at the unmade beds, dissected sharks, andcanvases smeared with animal dung that adorn our museums and galleries suggeststhat the profitable work of bringing down the ruins is still going on. EchoingRaine and Barzun, McGilchrist concurs that today ‘beauty has been effectivelyairbrushed out of the story of art’ and that it has become ‘unsophisticated’ tospeak of it.6 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--6]At the risk of being unsophisticated, I will say that for there to be a cosmos,there must also be beauty, an insight recognised by the Russian religiousexistentialist Nikolai Berdyaev. In The Meaning of the Creative Act (1916), anexhilarating book sadly little read today, Berdyaev wrote that ‘in everyartistic activity a new world is created, a cosmos, a world enlightened andfree.’ Even more, Berdyaev argued that ‘the cosmos is just this: beauty asbeing’. ‘Cosmic beauty,’ he tells us, ‘is the aim of the world process: it isanother kind of being, a higher being which is in the process of creation’.7[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--7] Neither Steven Weinberg’s purposeless universenor the one that emerged from Stephen Hawking’s vacuum can be said to be acosmos, at least not in the sense that Berdyaev means. And although Berdyaev andPythagoras are in many ways worlds apart – the one an ex-Marxist Christianexistentialist, the other a pre-Socratic mathematical mystic– they both sharethe sense that, for there to be beauty in the cosmos – which means that forthere to be a cosmos at all – man must be present. For Berdyaev, man is acreative agent at work in the world, and his work is likened unto God’s. Forhim, ‘the cosmos is being created; it is not given, it is a task set’, and it iswe who must complete it.8 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--8]CHAOSKAMPFFrom the little we know about him, Pythagoras seems a less romantic, lessdramatic character than Berdyaev. He was much more of a scientist, and he sharesthe ancient belief in a cosmos already completed and perfect, unlike Berdyaev,whose philosophy of human freedom and creativity is much more aligned with theKabbalistic idea of tikkun. Yet this perfect, harmonious cosmos would beunknown, were it not for the mind that knows it, a mind that, in order to knowit, must in some way be of the same character as the cosmos. It too must havethe same order and beauty that Pythagoras recognised in the cosmos. We can saythen, that for Pythagoras, if there is no mind, there is no cosmos. Thisequation can be seen in the many creation myths in which a hero-god battles a‘chaos monster’, a struggle that in comparative mythology has come to be calledby the German term Chaoskampf or ‘chaos struggle’. Elsewhere I have writtenabout this in the context of Egyptian mythology and the sun god Ra’s battle withthe demon of chaos Apophis.9 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--9] The struggledepicts both the emergence of order out of chaos, and the rise of aself-conscious, individual ‘I’ out of what the historian of the psyche ErichNeumann called the ‘ouroboric’ condition, named after the Ouroboros, analchemical image of a snake biting its own tail, a symbol of a self-enclosedunity. This ‘chaos struggle’, this rising of order out of a undifferentiatedstate, is something we all go through in our third year of life, when we breakout of the ouroboric egg of infancy into the light of being an individual ‘I’.This is why we speak of the ‘terrible twos’, because it is at that age that webegin to gain a separate identity, which is expressed in our ability to say‘no’, a difficult development, as every parent knows.10[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--10] It is at this point too, that a ‘world’ emergesfor the first time, for it is then that we start to grasp the difference betweenour own self and the surrounding environment, in which, up until then, we hadbeen completely immersed. Up until then, for us, there was no ‘world’ becausethere was no ‘self’ to be set apart from it. So, at a fundamental level, theemergence of a world, a cosmos, out of chaos, depends on the emergence of an‘I’, a mind, out of an unconscious, undifferentiated state.LOST IN THE COSMOSAre we justified then in asking if the purposeless universe emerging fromHawking’s pre-existing vacuum can be considered a cosmos? The question is notwhether the Big Bang and other mysterious features of this scenario are true,but whether such a scenario can give rise to the order and harmony thatPythagoras and other ancient cosmologists recognised as essential to a cosmos.We know that the pre-Copernican world, which lasted until only a few centuriesago – until 1543 in fact, when Copernicus published his On The Revolutions ofthe Heavenly Spheres – was indeed a cosmos. Copernicus changed everything whenhe showed the earth and the other planets revolved around the sun, and not, ashad been believed, that the sun, planets, and everything else revolved aroundus. For pre-Copernican man, the fixed stars suggested an eternal order, and thecelestial crystalline spheres, each carrying a planet in its graceful orbitaround the earth – the centre of everything – made, as Pythagoras believed, abeautiful cosmic music. In that world, the eternal order of the heavens wasreflected in the life of man on earth, and in this way, the lower, sub-lunarmaterial plane, participated in the higher regions, which were believed to havebeen made of a more spiritual substance. Today we know that the matter here onearth is the same as that of the stars, and that the stars are subject to thesame physical laws as the earth is. From this perspective we can turn theHermetic axiom around this time and say ‘as below, so above’.An early sign of the disquiet that comes to the unfortunate protagonists of H.P.Lovecraft’s fiction when they realise just how big the universe really is, canbe found in an oft quoted remark by Pascal, who we mentioned briefly in theprevious chapter. Pascal was a young contemporary of René Descartes, and wasthere, we can say, at the beginning of our modern world.11[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--11] Regarding the vast, strange universe thatCopernicus’ theory revealed to us, in his posthumously published Pensées (1669)Pascal wrote that ‘the eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me’.Note that Pascal’s emphasis is on silence. As I’ve argued elsewhere, it was notmerely the size of the new Copernican universe that troubled Pascal. TheAlexandrian Hermeticists spoke of a ‘space beyond heaven where there are nostars’, a perhaps early intuition of the notion of an ‘observable universe’, andthe Renaissance Hermeticist Giordano Bruno argued for an infinite universe,filled with innumerable worlds.12 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--12] Both ideassuggest a large universe, one much bigger than the reigning Ptolemaic one.(Ptolemy – ad90–168 – was an Alexandrian astronomer whose complicated system of‘nested’ planetary spheres dominated astronomy until the arrival of Copernicus.)What frightened Pascal is that this new universe seemed, as far as he couldtell, oblivious of him. It was alien, and its reality seemed to negate him, muchas the reality of a door knob or tree root negates the hero of Sartre’s Nausea.These vast, empty depths seemed to have nothing to do with him, and they lefthim floating, lost in space. More than two centuries later, in 1885 Nietzschecaught the tone of Pascal’s cosmic fear when he wrote in his notebooks that‘since Copernicus man has been rolling from the centre toward X.’13[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--13]EVERYBODY KNOWS THIS IS NOWHEREA more contemporary soul who shared Pascal’s cosmic disquiet is the mysticalpoet and diplomat O.V. de Lubicz Milosz (1877–1939). Milosz is a remarkablecharacter. Of Polish, Lithuanian, Jewish, and Italian descent, Milosz wrote inexquisite French – he lived much of his life in France and is considered aFrench poet – and his polyglot talents were put to good use in the years hespent as a member of the Lithuanian delegation to the Peace Conference of 1919,following World War I. Later he was the Lithuanian representative to the Frenchgovernment and then the Lithuanian delegate to the League of Nations. In 1931,in recognition of his service, he was made a chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur.For most of his early poetic career, Milosz was a typical decadent of thefin-de-siècle. At one point he was an acquaintance of Oscar Wilde during thedisgraced playwright’s last days in Paris. The ennui and febrile atmosphere ofthe decadents, however, exhausted Milosz, and in 1901 he fumbled a suicideattempt. The major crisis of his life came in 1914, when a profound mysticalexperience led to an audience with ‘the spiritual sun’, an encounter he sharedwith his fellow poet, William Blake, of whose work Milosz was unaware. Blake wasa reader of Swedenborg, and Swedenborg it seems had a similar experiencehimself. Blake told his friend Crabb Robinson that he had ‘conversed with thespiritual sun’ on Primrose Hill in North London.14[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--14] And in The True Christian Religion (1771),Swedenborg tells us that ‘The Lord is the Sun of the angelic heaven, and thissun appears before the eyes of angels when they are in spiritual meditation. Thesame thing happens with a man in this world, with whom the Church abides, as tothe sight of his spirit’15 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--15].In his encounter with the ‘spiritual sun’ Milosz found himself ‘soaring freelythrough space’ until he landed on a mountain peak, which itself continued torise to the heavens. He reached a dense cloud, whose consistency he compared to‘the freshly discharged seed of man’. Then a gigantic reddish ‘egg’ was hurledtowards him. It then became a golden lamp which grew in size until it had theshape of an ‘angelic sun’. Hovering above his forehead, this ‘sun’ then lookeddeeply into his eyes.16 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--16] A decade later Miloszpublished his first metaphysical work, a long Hermetic prose poem called ArsMagna (1924). The Arcana, another long mystical prose poem, followed in 1927.After this, Milosz abandoned poetry; he returned to it only once more, nearly adecade later, to write his last poem ‘Psalm of the Morning Star’ (1936).Milosz was a lifelong reader of Goethe, Plato, and Dante, and his metaphysicalpoetry shows their influence. Although the exact metaphysics of Ars Magna andThe Arcana is difficult, it is clear that Milosz has inherited the Romanticrejection of the materialist account of the universe. As he was for Blake andGoethe – who argued against his theory of optics – Isaac Newton (1642–1727) isMilosz’s target. Or to be more precise, Newtonian space, the kind thatfrightened Pascal. It was with Newton that the idea of an ‘absolute’ space andan ‘absolute’ time came to dominate western consciousness. In this sense spacebecomes sheer empty distance, and time mere forward flow. Rather than a vastcathedral of celestial spheres, arcing over the earth, space since Newton hasmeant an abstract extension in all directions. Likewise time for Newton meanseternal succession, a temporal parallel to infinity, ‘one thing after another’.Both embody what Hegel called a ‘bad infinity’, a kind of straight line foreverstretching out into emptiness (a ‘good infinity’ for Hegel was like a circle,forever returning to itself, like the alchemical Ouroboros). If we take theco-ordinates ‘here’ and ‘now’ and draw a line from them extending infinitely inany direction – which would take an eternity to do – we will never reach an end.If we continued that line for a billion years, the distance ahead of us wouldstill be as infinite as when we began, just as the time remaining to us wouldstill be eternal, with as much eternity left as when we started. If you thinkabout this for a minute, Pascal’s angst becomes quite understandable.Milosz had his own frightful experience of Pascal’s infinite spaces, although inhis account, they were not silent, but filled with a barbarous cacophony. In avision Milosz found himself on a vast, deserted plain. Overhead was a ‘universeof terror’, jammed with billions and billions of ‘tormented cosmic systems’turning in endless rotation. Rather than a harmony of the spheres, these stellarwheels emitted an ‘odious criminal noise, the enemy of all meditation, of allcomposure’, rather like today’s i-Pods. What these oppressive stellar perpetualmotion machines said to Milosz was that ‘you must multiply and divide theinfinite by the infinite during an eternity of eternities’.17[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--17]This nightmare of an immense, threatening blackness in which vast cosmic systemsturn incessantly reminds us of William Blake’s dark visions of ‘starry wheels’and, as mentioned, of Pascal’s angst about infinite space. Repelled by thiscrushing cosmic futility, Milosz attempted to find the ‘place’ of mankind. Inhis dark vision Milosz had seen that our ‘place’ had been lost, annulled in theinfinite emptiness of abstract space, where, in the words of one of hiscommentators, we ‘proclaim ourselves sovereign for a day of a lump of mattersentenced to slow decay in the darkness of a death without beginning or end.’18[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--18] We were, it seemed to Milosz, literallynowhere, or, if it was a ‘where’, it was hell.The problem, Milosz saw, as did his predecessors Blake and Swedenborg, was thatin the Newtonian world, we identify infinity and eternity with abstractextension and succession. But the truly infinite and eternal are outside spaceand time. By identifying the infinite with the dark emptiness of Pascalianspace, we had literally lost our ‘place’ in the cosmos, because in a universewithout borders, there can be no ‘place’, no difference between ‘here’ or‘there’. In Newtonian space, there is no ‘up’ or ‘down’, ‘left’, or ‘right’,‘forward’ or ‘backward’. And if we had lost our place, so had the cosmos. Thequestion ‘Where is space?’ came to obsess Milosz, and he found he could notanswer it. Given a Newtonian universe of abstract infinite extension, no answerseemed possible. In such a universe, there is no ‘where’ for space to be.Anything that could ‘contain’ space would itself only be more space. Everythingis ‘in’ space, but space itself is ‘in’ nothing, it seemed. So wherever we were,it was, in a sense, no ‘where’.UNIVERSAL MANMilosz found help in asking his questions through a reading of Hermetic,Kabbalistic, alchemical, and mystical writings, which, he tells us, he wasignorant of until his experience. He also found some support in the work ofAlbert Einstein (1879–1955), which, in 1914, was still relatively new andobscure. Milosz tells us that he was as ignorant of Einstein’s ideas then as hewas of mystical literature. In Einstein’s relativity, Milosz felt he had found abeginning of an answer, because Einstein made space and time relative to anobserver-that is, to man. For Milosz this meant that although Copernicus hadunchained the sun from the earth, and Newton had sent us drifting throughabsolute space, we were with Einstein back at the centre of things – at leastthe individual observer was.But Einstein’s ideas were only a mathematical, scientific rendering of truthscentral to the whole western esoteric tradition. As mere specks of matter, it istrue that we are insignificant motes of cosmic dust, floating in empty space.But this is to see ourselves in our fallen nature. Blake and Swedenborg knewthat the truly infinite and eternal are not ‘there’, outside, but ‘here’, withinman, within his imagination, which for both, and for all poets and seers, is notthe ‘fancy’ we refer to when we say ‘that’s just your imagination’ – that is,something untrue or, as mentioned earlier, ‘made up’ – but the creative energyand origin of the cosmos itself. It is the imagination in the sense that HenryCorbin (1903–1978) writes of it when he speaks of an ‘Imaginal World’, themundus imaginalis, a world of archetypes, forms, images, and intelligences whichare neither purely physical nor purely ideal, but exist in an intermediate realmof their own. For Swedenborg, space and time are ‘states’, forms ofconsciousness, not absolute realities in themselves. When the doors ofperception are cleansed, Blake famously said, we will see all things as theyreally are, infinite. ‘Every space larger than a red Globule of man’s blood isVisionary, and is created by the Hammer of Los: And every space smaller than aGlobule of Man’s blood opens Into an Eternity of which this vegetable Earth isBut a Shadow’ (Milton, 1810). We, then, are not ‘in’ space; space, andeverything it contains, is within us, within our imagination.It is in this sense that man is a microcosm, a little universe. Earlier Imentioned Swedenborg’s idea of the Grand Man, a theme Blake continued in his‘human form divine’. It is the same as the Kabbalistic Adam Kadmon, who we metin the last chapter, and from whom the energies of the divine create the cosmos.It is also the same as the Hermetic belief that ultimately, the cosmos itself isin the form of man. Not man the animal, man the rapacious despoiler of nature,but the man of imagination, within whose infinite inner spaces the entire outerworld exists.What has happened, Milosz tells us, is that we have fallen from our originalstate. Like Hermetic man embracing nature, or the shattering of the sephiroth,for Milosz some primal cosmic crisis has brought us to this hell of empty spaceand time, this desert of mechanical, ever-turning starry systems, StevenWeinberg’s purposeless universe. Somehow, through what Milosz calls ‘Adam’sprevarication’ – that first sin in the Garden of Eden – we have been separatedfrom the original spiritual universe, and we find ourselves here, stranded in aworld of pointless matter. We have, in a sense, been turned ‘inside out’, andwhere, in our primal state, we were free, infinite beings, sharing in divinelove and wisdom, containing a world, we are now mere lumps of flesh, lost in adark, oblivious universe whose oppressive reality negates us. But as withHermetic man and the Kabbalistic ‘sparks’, something remains of our originalstate, and from time to time a vague memory of where we have come from rises upin us, and we suffer from that ailment known to all true poets and philosophers,homesickness.ADAM STRANGEWhen I was young one of my favourite comic book heroes was a character namedAdam Strange who, aptly enough, appeared in a magazine called Mystery in Space.He was not a super-hero per se. He didn’t have super powers, although he didsport a rocket pack and enviable ray gun, but his life was in some ways morefascinating than Superman’s, Batman’s, and the other heroes whose adventures Igreedily absorbed. Adam Strange was an archaeologist, and on a trip to theAndes, while escaping from some Indians – admittedly he had discovered theirsecret treasure – a remarkable thing happened. Leaping across a chasm, Adam washit by a strange ray – he later discovers it is called the ‘zeta beam’ – andfinds himself transported to the planet Rann, an earth-sized world orbitingAlpha Centauri, the closest star to our own sun. In an instant, he is shot 4.3light years – or 25 trillion miles – across space to another world. Adam meets awoman, has adventures, saves the planet, and becomes a hero. But then suddenly,the effect of the zeta-beam wears off, and he finds himself back on earth. Buthe discovers where and when the zeta beam will strike the earth again – ithappens to be on the Malayan coast, south of Singapore – and he is determined tobe there, and to return to Rann. And so it went, for the rest of the series:Adam Strange cutting through jungles or climbing mountains in order to catch thenext zeta beam, only to be sent back to earth once again when its effects wearoff. But he is determined to become a citizen of his new world, and one day, hewill discover a way to remain on Rann forever …I don’t know if Julius Schwartz, Gardner Fox, and Mike Sekowsky, who started theseries, realised it, but they had hit on a perfect metaphor for man’s dualnature: that he is a dweller on two worlds: one of everyday, commonplace fact,where he spends most of his time, and the other of something much moremysterious and adventurous, which he enters only briefly. It is of course acommon theme in Romanticism but the fact that this insight had filtered downfrom ‘high culture’ to the lowlands of comic books, suggests that it issomething inherent in us, perhaps even a Jungian archetype. (It also suggestsonce again that popular culture is often a medium for deep philosophicalthought.)19 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--19]PLANETS OF A DOUBLE SUNAs I say, not surprisingly, the two worlds theme is something we find inRomanticism. Romantics, like no one else, are dissatisfied with the grim, ‘real’world of mundane necessity and have a hankering for another world, a land morein harmony with, in Yeats’ phrase, ‘the heart’s desire’. One of the mosteffective and entertaining expressions of the two worlds can be found in theGerman writer E.T.A. Hoffmann’s glittering fable The Golden Flower Pot (1814).The theme runs through all of Hoffmann’s work – as it did through his life – butin this tale, generally regarded as his greatest work, he embodied perfectly theenduring tension between the everyday world and that of ‘magic’.Hoffmann (1776–1822) was a curious soul, who seemed to live two radicallydifferent lives: by day a respected juror and Prussian civil servant, by night apoet, musician, artist, and critic. His stories, which read like a meetingbetween Hans Christian Andersen and Edgar Allan Poe, have never really made thetransition to English, in spite of excellent translations, and for Englishreaders he is most known today as the inspiration for Offenbach’s Tales ofHoffmann and Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker.20[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--20] Hoffmann would have been pleased with this;although most of his music is lost, Hoffmann composed some ten operas, as wellas two symphonies, several cantatas and many other works. Music for Hoffmann wasthe clearest evidence that we are natives of another land. Hoffmann was one ofBeethoven’s earliest champions and was also central in promoting instrumental or‘absolute’ music, at a time when vocal music was supreme. In an essay onBeethoven Hoffmann wrote: ‘Music reveals to man an unknown realm, a world quiteseparate from the outer sensual world surrounding him, a world in which heleaves behind all precise feelings in order to embrace an inexpressiblelonging’.We will return to this idea of an ‘inexpressible longing’, but it seems morethan coincidental that Pythagoras should speak of a ‘harmony of the spheres’ andHoffmann and innumerable others should regard music as a portal to ‘otherworlds’. In the kind of world fashioned by genetic drift and evolutionarynecessity, music plays no such role, as evidenced by the Darwinian evolutionarypsychologist Steven Pinker’s remark that music is an indulgent but inessentialby-product of adaptive behaviour, on a par with, and as meaningful (or less) aspornography and fatty foods.21 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--21] (In Pinker’scosmos, then, we could say that we would hear the ‘muzak of the spheres’.)Beethoven once asked their mutual friend Bettina von Arnim to tell Goethe ‘tohear my symphonies and he will say that I am right in saying that music is theone incorporeal entrance into the higher worlds of knowledge’.22[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--22] How Beethoven would have responded to Pinker’sremark requires little imagination.The plot of The Golden Flower Pot involves a young, poetic, but clumsy student,who is troubled by a recurring vision of a glittering green snake. The snaketurns out to be Serpentina, the daughter of the Archivist Lindhorst, who ishimself secretly an elemental salamander, exiled to earth because of atransgression committed ages ago, Hoffmann’s allusion to the primeval ‘cosmiccrime’. Anselmus, the student, is betrothed to Veronica, who is beautiful butworldly, and who wants him to become a Hofrath at court and lead a dutiful,sensible life. But the Archivist hires Anselmus to copy out a magicalmanuscript, which tells the story of Lindhorst’s own fall from grace, and of theongoing battle he continues against the forces of darkness. The tension of thenarrative, which is full of initiatory trials and strange, mystical adventures,lies in Anselmus having to choose between the two worlds: that of the practical,down-to-earth Veronica, with whom he is bound to have worldly success, or themysterious but tempting Serpentina, who makes him dream of strange but beautifulworlds. I can give only the barest outline here and readers are advised to enjoyHoffmann’s delightful and enlightening tale themselves. One of the importantelements in The Golden Flower Pot is that, unlike earlier Märchen, or ‘fairytales’ written by his fellow Romantics Goethe and Novalis, Hoffmann’s takesplace in an everyday world, Dresden, in fact. It is precisely the contrastbetween the world of magic (Serpentina), and that of the commonplace (Veronica),that gives the story its power. In the earlier tales, which take place entirelywithin a ‘fairy land’, the essential opposition between the two worlds islost.23 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--23]A more recent but equally effective expression of the ‘two worlds’ principle canbe found in the writing of the Scottish novelist David Lindsay (1876–1945), bestknown for his remarkable Gnostic work A Voyage to Arcturus (1920). In A Voyageto Arcturus, the protagonist, Maskull, is, like Adam Strange, transported fromearth to another planet, this time Tormance, which orbits Arcturus, thebrightest star in the constellation. Appropriately, Arcturus is a double star,and in choosing it as the setting for his masterpiece, Lindsay seems to havedisplayed an acute intuitive grasp of the ‘two worlds’ problem. As Colin Wilsonremarks, all artists are planets of a double star: one is ‘the world’ which weaccept as given and resign ourselves to, and the other is that strangelyfamiliar but mysterious place for which we sometimes feel a poignanthomesickness.24 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--24] On Tormance Lindsay’s heroMaskull sets out on a kind of Gnostic ‘pilgrim’s progress’, encountering aseries of strange beings and creatures all of whom claim to posses the answer tolife – love, sex, power, knowledge – but who all in the end prove false. The‘muspel fire’ that Maskull seeks, driven by the drum beats of Surtur – a symbolof the evolutionary urge to transcend himself – is a symbol of an almost totalrejection of the world and its hollowness, an austere Buddhist denial of whatthose less fastidious than Maskull accept as reality, but which is itself areality of uncompromising value and meaning. Again, the plot is simple, but areader soon finds himself absorbed in Lindsay’s utterly convincing imagination,his ability to create ever more fantastic encounters which at the same timeembody profound philosophical questions.It is, in fact, Lindsay’s deep feeling for ‘other worlds’ and their metaphysicalmeaning, and his lack of sympathy for this one that is one of his problems as awriter. After Arcturus, which garnered some critical acclaim but littlecommercial success, Lindsay felt he needed to keep his novels more ‘down toearth’, in order to attract more readers, and so his remaining five metaphysicalfantasies – he wrote one romantic pot boiler in a failed attempt to be popular –are all set on earth. Alas, while Lindsay can write powerfully about deepmetaphysical dimensions, his facility to depict the everyday is severelylimited, and these novels, too, were commercial failures. In his novels, TheViolet Apple, Devil’s Tor, The Sphinx, and the unfinished The Witch, there arelong stretches of everyday reality which, to most readers, are barely readable;unlike Hoffmann, Lindsay seemed unable to bring them to life. But thesestumbling excursions into the common light, which Lindsay mistakenly felt wereobligatory, are more than made up for by the sudden eruption of the ‘otherworld’.STAIRWAYS TO HEAVENPerhaps this contrast between the everyday and the ‘other world’ is bestdepicted in Lindsay’s second novel The Haunted Woman (1922). The heroine, IsbelLoment, is a woman of artistic temperament who leads an empty existence, movingfrom hotel to hotel as a companion to her aunt. She is engaged to a decent butordinary man she does not really love yet can find no inner strength to breakoff the engagement and give her life some real direction. By chance she isinvited to a strange house and there meets Henry Judge. Both discover that theyhave had a similar strange experience in the house. A mysterious stairway,apparently unknown to the other guests, has appeared to them, and when theyascend it they find themselves in a strange room, which has the inexplicableeffect of transforming them into who they really are; it is a kind of‘self-actualising chamber’, to see it in Maslovian terms. The conventions ofeveryday life, and the fears and feebleness that constrain us, have disappeared,and for a brief time they are both their ‘true selves’. They agree to try toascend the secret staircase again and meet in the room. They do and find thatthey are in love with each other, although our conventional idea of love doesnot convey the experience of spiritual attraction and the power of true‘meeting’ that they undergo. In The Witch Lindsay wrote ‘While bodies, in aphysical world, might join, spirits never could. For bodies were in their ownhome, but spirits were exiles and captives in a strange land’. The passion thatIsbel and Judge feel is not physical or even erotic, in a Platonic sense, but ahunger for something else, some reality their normal lives cannot provide. Outof the window of the room, in the distance, they hear a painfully beautifulmusic, and see a bright, spring sunshine, although in reality it is a mistyautumn day. The music draws them, but somehow they cannot get to it, and whenthey leave the room and descend the stairway – which they inevitably must – theyimmediately forget their experience, and return again to their smaller, ordinarylives.The stairway is a clear symbol of an ascent to a higher realm, and in thebeginning of the book, there is a reference to music with which Hoffmann wouldhave agreed. Isbel hears someone playing the opening of Beethoven’s SeventhSymphony on the piano. The music, she feels, was like a curtain being drawn,‘revealing a new and marvellous world’ and with the ‘famous passage of giganticascending scales … she immediately had a vision of huge stairs going up.’25[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--25] Lindsay refers to the piece as ‘that fragmentof giant-land’, and throughout his work, music plays an important role. Acentral motif in his last, unfinished novel, The Witch, is something he calls‘the third music’, a metaphysical insight that cannot be expressed in words, butwhich is conveyed unmistakably in music.THE TWO WORLDSI should at this point clarify what I mean when speaking of ‘two worlds’. Thereis, of course, only one world. I don’t mean planet or galaxy, but the reality inwhich we find ourselves. I cannot walk into another world in the same way that Ican walk into another room or another house. I am here, in this universe, andthere doesn’t seem to be any exit doors, unless you consider death one, and weare not even sure about that. We are here, now, and no amount of wishing orwilling will send us to Rann or Tormance or Mars, where John Carter goes in theEdgar Rice Burroughs novels I devoured in my childhood. The idea of an actual‘other’ world we can escape to, is a literal interpretation of what is really ametaphysical distinction. Many a Romantic has taken to the road, in search ofsome other place, where life will be much better than it is wherever he startedout from. The grass is always greener on the other side, until you get there andyou see it is exactly the same shade as in your own garden. We all know that nomatter where we go physically, ‘we’ are still there. If there is another worldthen, it isn’t ‘out there’, but ‘in here’, and it consists of seeing this worldin a different way than we ‘normally’ do. I put ‘normally’ in quotation marksbecause we will look at exactly how normal this is.As Kathleen Raine put it: ‘the imagination does not see different things, itsees things differently.’26 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--26] This is why themeaning content of many mystical experiences is a kind of ‘oh yes’ or ‘ofcourse’ and seems to be something you already know, but are seeing ‘for thefirst time’. This is something I’ve written about in the context of ‘cosmicconsciousness’ and ‘gnosis’ in the mystical experiences of William James, R.M.Bucke, and P.D. Ouspensky.27 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--27] Ouspensky, forexample, had a tremendously powerful mystical experience looking at an ashtray –admittedly he was on nitrous oxide at the time – and William Blake, we know, sawheaven in a wildflower. Ouspensky had seen ashtrays before and Blake had seenflowers, but at the time of their mystical experiences, they were seeing theseeveryday things in a non-everyday way. The mystical experience, then, is notabout what you see but how you see it.THE LIFE WORLDThe everyday world is the one we live in most of the time. It is the world ofnewspapers, television, and the internet. It’s the world of politics, pop stars,and celebrities, of advertising, social networks, and sports figures. It is analmost exclusively human world, but mostly of the ‘only human’ variety. Thephilosopher Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) coined the term ‘life world’ to describethe particular environment in which an individual lives. I, as a writer, live ina particular ‘life world’, one different from, say, a bus driver’s or a pastrycook’s, although the three of us share a great deal of the larger, outsideworld. We may, for example, all take the same bus or eat at the same café orshop at the same market. Husserl borrowed the term ‘life world’ from the BalticGerman biologist Jakob Johan von Uexküll, who spoke of an Umwelt. By UmweltUexküll meant the perceptual world of an organism. Uexküll describes, forexample, the Umwelt of an amoeba, a jelly fish, or a sea urchin. An Umwelt(German for ‘environment’) is an organism’s own particular ‘world’. Husserldeveloped this idea into what he called the ‘communal life world’. This is whatwe mean by the everyday world.When millions of people watch the same television program or the same videothat’s gone ‘viral’ on the internet, they are all living in the same communallife world. When we read the papers or listen to the news on the radio, we aresharing a communal life world with millions of people we will never knowpersonally. As our world becomes more and more global, this communal life worldgrows in size and as more and more people’s lives are fed with content comingfrom the communal life world, there is a real concern that their lives willbecome little more than a reflection of the communal life world’s values. Mostof these are of a trivial character, as a look at newspapers, television, theinternet, and other sources show. Increasingly we seem to be living in acommunal life world that reflects almost exclusively the ‘only human.’28[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--28]The other world is one outside this communal life world. It, too, is a humanworld, but it is more of the ‘fully human’ variety, which, by definition, meansit extends beyond our immediate, personal concerns. Its essential difference isthat, while we are in it, we see things differently. They take on a deeper, moresignificant meaning and intensity. Values are greater and seem to revolve aroundobjective meanings, not the subjective, strictly personal, often trivial onesthat inform the communal life world. (How important is it, really, to know thelatest gossip about some celebrity?) In the other world we seem to be in touchwith a reality far more powerful than the one we know in the communal lifeworld. The simplest things, like a wildflower or an ashtray, can convey anentire universe of significance. Most of us live in the communal life world mostof the time, and it has to be said that many of us are quite happy there andwould feel disorientated anywhere else. But there are some who find itclaustrophobic and suffocating and go to great lengths and often dangerousextremes to escape it. They are those Colin Wilson calls ‘outsiders’. Where theywant to get to is not always clear, but they all share the knowledge that, asseen from the other vantage point, the values of the communal life world areunimportant and ultimately diminishing.HEIMWEHEarlier I quoted E.T.A. Hoffmann’s remark about music’s ability to stimulate inus an ‘inexpressible longing’ and its relation to an ‘unknown realm’ quiteseparate from the ‘outer sensual world’. What Hoffmann refers to is Sehnsucht, aterm that, more than any other, expresses the essence of German Romanticism.There really is no strict English equivalent of Sehnsucht, which is defined byLangenscheidt’s German-English Dictionary as ‘longing, yearning, hankering,pining, languishing, nostalgia’. ‘Unfulfillable’ or ‘inexpressible’ longing – asabove – comes closest, although for our purposes, ‘nostalgia’, with its sense of‘homesickness’ is most apt. As I’ve written elsewhere, ‘Sehnsucht conjures uphorn calls far off in the dark forest, the poignant glow of the sunset, which wewill never reach, no matter how quickly we race to the horizon, the snow-cappedpeaks of a distant mountain range.’ It speaks of ‘beauty, distance, and thesense of something infinitely desirable just beyond our grasp’.29[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--29] The German poet most associated with Sehnsuchtis Georg Friedrich Phillipp von Hardenberg (1772–1801), better known by his penname Novalis, who captured the essence of ‘unfulfillable longing’ in the symbolof the elusive ‘blue flower’ from his unfinished novel Heinrich von Ofterdingen.Novalis, a deeply Hermetic thinker, felt Sehnsucht for most of his short life –he died at the age of twenty-eight – and he encapsulated the pull it had on hisconsciousness in his best known aphorism ‘All philosophy is homesickness’. Thisis an insight with which many of the thinkers looked at in this book wouldagree, and this homesickness wasn’t felt only by nineteenth century Romantics.In the 1960s and 70s, it sent quite a few twentieth century Romantics on themystic trail. In The Journey to the East (1932) Hermann Hesse wrote about agroup of travellers from all times and places, some real, some fictional,perennially on the move toward ‘Home’; he even quotes Novalis: ‘Where are wereally going? Always home!’30 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--30] Along with hisother novels that became hugely popular during the Hesse ‘revival’ of the 60sand 70s, The Journey to the East became a favourite among the many who had felta sense of homesickness in those decades, and who took to the road, looking fora cure for itOne thinker who would agree with Novalis was his older contemporary, the Frenchtheosophist Louis Claude de Saint-Martin, whose early life in many waysresembles Novalis’ own.31 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--31] Both were sicklyyouths who spent a great deal of time on their own.32[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--32] For Saint-Martin, homesickness, or, in German,Heimweh is ‘the nostalgic desire for the heavenly fatherland’. Man, Saint-Martinsaid, ‘has a mind which is not satisfied by this world, not satisfied toruminate upon dregs of matter’, and which ‘would be badly served by a wisdomwhich rests only in visual and material nature …’33[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--33] Like the Kabbalists, Saint-Martin believed thathis mission was to remind man of his proper task, which he saw as that ofminister of the creative word, as a collaborator with God in perfectingcreation. Like Milosz, Saint-Martin believed that through some primal crime, manhad lost his true place in the cosmos, and was now trapped in a fallen world.Saint-Martin expresses the ‘inside out’ character of our existence in his maximthat ‘It is necessary to explain things by man and not man by things’, whichmeans that we should regard the cosmos as an expression of man – Adam Kadmon,the primal Man – and not man as a product of the cosmos, of the physical forcesat work in it, which is, of course, how materialist science sees us. ForSaint-Martin, our place in the cosmos is unique. As mentioned, it ‘differs fromthat of other physical beings, for it is the reparation of the disorders in theuniverse’. This and other ‘counsels of the exile’ – a general title given toSaint-Martin’s writings – place Saint-Martin clearly in the tradition of tikkun.It is unclear how versed in Kabbalah Saint-Martin may have been, if at all, andthe figure of ‘the Repairer’ is for him associated with Christ. But as we’veseen with the Hermetic teachings, the idea that man has a responsibility here,unlike any other created being, is not the property of one spiritual teaching,but seems to be an archetype shared by many. The Baal Shem Tov, the eighteenthcentury mystical rabbi and founder of Hasidic Judaism, said ‘truth is always inexile’. As noted above, Saint-Martin called his collected writings ‘the counselof the exile’. This suggests that both, in different ways, shared the sameinsight about mankind.We should point out that the Kabbalistic tradition has it own sense of Heimwehor Sehnsucht. Reshimu is the impression of the Divine Light left behind afterthe Ein-Sof contracts itself in the tzimtzum necessary for creation. In thissense, we can see reshimu as a spiritual equivalent of the ‘cosmic backgroundradiation’ astrophysicists believe is conclusive evidence for the Big Bang. Wecan think of the cosmic background radiation as the faintest physical tremor,the furthest ripple away from the initial explosion. In the case of reshimu, theradiations, however, are holy. One poetic description of reshimu is that it islike the fragrance of wine left behind in a glass after it has been emptied. Inourselves, the reshimu manifests as a sense that we have forgotten something,and it also prompts us to look for what that is. A helpful analogy is that of atune we can’t quite remember. If some other tunes come to mind, it’s the reshimuthat tells us they aren’t the one, rather like a inner music critic who makessure we don’t confuse muzak with the music of the spheres.34[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--34]This sense of having forgotten something is at the heart of the westernphilosophical tradition. All knowledge is recollection, Plato tells us. MartinHeidegger (1889–1976), whose task it was to bring western metaphysics, begun byPlato, to its end, lays the blame for our modern nihilism on our ‘forgetfulnessof being’, an assessment he shared with Gurdjieff. Heidegger’s ‘fundamentalontology’, his analysis of our ‘being-in-the-world’, centres on the idea ofSorge, which, for the existentialists who followed him, meant ‘anxiety’ butwhich in our context is better translated as ‘care’. For Heidegger we are ‘theshepherds of being’, the trustees of the irreducible fact that we and the worldare. Our loss of wonder at this miracle is the evidence of our forgetfulness,our ‘fallenness’ into what Heidegger calls the ‘triviality of everydayness’, histerm for Husserl’s ‘communal life world’.35 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--35](The idea that the Higgs-Boson or any other elementary particle could ‘solve’the secret of the universe would for Heidegger be but another manifestation ofour amnesia.) But whether it is the reshimu, Sehnsucht, Heimweh, or what GeorgeSteiner called ‘the nostalgia for the absolute’ – ‘We are the creatures of agreat thirst,’ Steiner says, ‘bent on coming home to a place we have neverknown’ – there is something in us that makes us dissatisfied with ‘the world’and leads us to look for that elusive something else.36[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--36]What that is, however, may be closer to home than we think.TWO WORLDS, TWO BRAINSEarlier I mentioned the psychiatrist and philosopher Iain McGilchrist, andquoted from his book The Master and His Emissary (2009). In it he provides anenormous amount of evidence suggesting that our experience of living in twoworlds has a neurological and anatomical basis. This is the fact that we havetwo brains, each of which perceives the world very differently. The thesis ofMcGilchrist’s book is that ‘for us as human beings there are two fundamentallyopposed realities’.37 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--37] One is the worldpresented to us by the left brain, the other is the world presented to us by theright brain. I would add to McGilchrist’s two opposed realities a third,conciliatory one, which McGilchrist himself includes as his argument unfolds:the world presented to us when both brains work together. This rare and somewhatmiraculous unity is, I suggest, at the heart of moments of insight, of mysticalexperience, poetry, creativity, and the peak experiences that Abraham Maslowargued come to psychological healthy people, the ‘fully human’ who achieveself-actualisation. It is a kind of ‘Goldilocks moment’, when, rather than beingat odds with each other, the two opposing sides collaborate and achieve the‘just right’ state of creative balance. They ‘complete the partial mind’, asW.B. Yeats argues happens in moments of crisis and intensity.38[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--38] This collaboration between two opposedrealities housed in the opposite sides of our brains is, I suggest, aneurological expression of the coincidentia oppositorum, or unity of theopposites, by which, according to the Kabbalistic, but also the alchemical,neo-Platonic, Hegelian, Jungian, and other systems of thought, the shattereduniverse is repaired.39 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--39] There is a goodargument, then, for the idea that both the fractured, shattered world we live in– Sitra Achra, the Other Side – and the means of healing it, are containedwithin our heads.McGilchrist contends that what is important about the fact that we have twobrains, or two cerebral hemispheres, is not what each hemisphere does, but howit does it. We are all familiar with the popular literature on the right andleft side of the brain, how the left is a ‘scientist’, geared toward logic andlanguage, and the right an ‘artist’, attuned to feeling and intuition. This neatseparation, in which certain ‘functions’ are localised in one side of the brainor the other, is, however, misleading. By the 1990s, ‘hard’ neuroscience more orless abandoned the split-brain as a serious subject for study because ongoingresearch had discovered that, in fact, both sides of the brain are involved inpractically everything we do. Both sides, it turned out, do the same thingsafter all, although one side may be more involved in an activity than the other.So, rather than a scientist and an artist living in separate flats, havingnothing to do with each other, the two actually share a two-bedroom bungalow,with each pretty much having the run of the place. This recognition, coupledwith the fact that the ‘scientist/artist’ divide had been appropriated by a hostof popular New Age and self help books, was enough for official neuroscience toback away from the split brain and turn itself to other matters. The fact thatwe have two brains turned out to be not important after all, it seemed, and someresearchers even joked that we have a second brain as a kind of spare in casesomething goes wrong with the other one.Yet McGilchrist contends that there is an importance difference between thehemispheres, but it is not, as mentioned, in what they do but in how they do it.In a nutshell, McGilchrist argues that the two brains each have a veryparticular ‘take’ or attitude toward the world, and that these are radicallydifferent from each other. The right brain presents us with reality as a unifiedwhole, a gestalt. It gives the ‘big picture’ of a living, breathing, ‘other’ –whatever it is that exists outside our minds – with which it is in a reciprocalrelationship, bringing that ‘other’ into being through our consciousness of it,while being itself altered through the encounter. It is essentially gearedtoward working with living things and with perceiving overall patterns andmeanings. One myth about the split brain that McGilchrist punctures, is the ideathat the left brain is ‘dominant’, while the right is a kind of helpful, but notessential, sidekick. The truth, he argues, is the exact opposite. The rightbrain, he says, is primary, it is the ‘master’, who provides us with ourfundamental connection to reality. It is through it that we ‘participate’ withthe world. The left, he tells us, is the right brain’s ‘emissary’. It’s job isto manipulate that primal reality, to analyse it, and break up the whole intowell-defined parts, that it can then control, and its basic way of doing this isby representing the ‘other’ in a form like itself. Unlike the right brain, theleft feels more comfortable with mechanical things, with bits and pieces that itcan take apart and put back together into something it is familiar with. Itsrelationship to the world is much more ‘detached’ than that of the right. Whilethe right brain seeks out the new, the unfamiliar, and the living – whatever ispresent to it now – the left is geared toward what it already knows, and what itknows best, McGilchrist tells us, is the machine. We can say that one gives us aworld to live in, and the other the means of surviving in it. And although weneed both the big picture and the small detail in order to be fully alive andfully human (not ‘fully functioning’ as ‘functions’ are themselves an expressionof the left brain’s tendency to mechanise experience), the two opposed ‘takes’often clash, as if we tried to look at a panorama and through a microscope atthe same time. We need to see the forest and the tree, and this sometimes provesdifficult. It would be impossible for one brain to do this simultaneously, andso we have two.40 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--40]Throughout our history, the two brains have been engaged in a more or lessfriendly but serious rivalry, McGilchrist tells us, inhibiting and restrainingeach other’s excesses in a neurological embodiment of Blake’s dictum that‘Opposition is true friendship’, and evening each other out in a processresembling the give-and-take of Hegel’s dialectic. The right brain needs theleft because its picture, while of the whole, is fuzzy and lacks precision; itsees the world, say, with the warm glow we enjoy after a glass of wine, whenthings take on a indefinite but strongly felt significance, which we would behard pressed to put into words, which are the left brain’s tools in trade. The‘emissary’s’ job, then, is to unpack the gestalt the right brain presents, andthen return it to the right, increasing its definition and clarity.The left needs the right because while it can focus on minute particulars, indoing so it loses touch with everything else and can easily find itself adrift.We can think of it as an obsessive who, fixated on some fine but negligiblepoint, forgets why he was doing something in the first place, or as someonesuffering from a perpetual tunnel vision, powerfully focused on a tiny detail,but blind to the surrounding field. A right brain imbalance would, say, providethe kind of consciousness that animals may have, a warm, general, butinarticulate sense of the great surround, in which we would be embedded, with nosense of detachment or distance. (Nietzsche once remarked that it was no goodasking cows the secret of their happiness, as they forget the question beforethey can answer it.) A left brain imbalance would present a world made up ofbits and pieces, a kind of jig-saw puzzle of independent parts, with which wewould feel no connection and which would appear to us as lifeless, each bithaving a crystalline clarity but without relation, other than mechanical, to anyother. The left brain’s insistence on clarity produces an exacting attitude of‘either/or’, an insistence on something being either ‘black’ or ‘white’, ‘true’or ‘false’, as opposed to the right brain’s openness to metaphor and an attitudeof ‘both/and’. (The right brain, McGilchrist tells us, has a sense of humourwhile the left is adamantly literal.) A left brain imbalanced world would be aworld, say, in which Sartre’s ‘nausea’, when objects take on a strange,threatening foreignness, and seem disconnected from their context, would be thenorm. This is the kind of world, McGilchrist argues, that schizophrenics livein, in which there is an acute separation between perception and feeling, and itis the kind of world, he believes, in which we increasingly live today.What has happened in recent times – since, McGilchrist suggests, the IndustrialRevolution – is that the left brain, the emissary, has usurped power from themaster, the right brain, and has become, as mainstream neuroscience contends,dominant. This is a kind of neurological expression of the Gnostic myth of anidiot demiurge who believes he is the true god and within whose world we aretrapped. This has happened in other periods, just as there have been periodswhen the two sides reached an exceptionally creative accord. McGilchristsuggests that pre-Socratic Greece, the Renaissance, and the Romantic movementwere such times of creative ‘progress through contraries’, to paraphrase Blake.But although other left brain imbalances were evened out, our own modern periodis different, McGilchrist argues, because since the Industrial Revolution theleft brain has been busy, steadily building a ‘world’ that is like itself –modern cities, factories – with the result that there is less and less of any‘other’ for the right brain to present.We can say that for the last two centuries the left brain has been erecting itsown ‘communal life world’ at the expense of the right, and this itself canaccount for the kind of low status the right brain has been accorded bymainstream neuroscientists. Most neuroscience is conducted under the aegis of‘scientific materialism’, the belief that reality and everything in it canultimately be explained in terms of little bits, whether atoms or genes. Werecall Francis Crick’s remarks in the last chapter. Yet materialism itself is aproduct of the left brain’s tendency toward cutting up the whole into easilymanipulated parts, so it is not surprising, then, that materialist-mindedneuroscientists would see the left as boss and the right as second fiddle. It isalso not surprising that in such a world we would find ourselves in apurposeless universe that emerged for no reason when less than nothing exploded,and whose infinite extension can be cut up into an infinity of parts. As the‘other’ that the right brain ‘presences’, in McGilchrist’s coinage, isincreasingly fashioned to the requirements of the left brain – precision,clarity, definiteness, and of parts, not wholes – we will increasingly findourselves inhabiting a self-enclosed reality, an hermetically sealed ‘communallife world’, from which it will be increasingly harder to escape, asincreasingly there will be no ‘where’ to go. As McGilchrist makes clear, thisleft brain hegemony informs practically everything in our life: the arts,society, education, even sex and personal relationships.THE OTHER WORLDThe ‘where’ we could go to, would be that other world, that other reality,housed in the other side of our brain. And we already have an intuitive sense ofa world that is much more of a whole, that is much more connected, that is muchmore alive and related to us in an immediate, organic way. It is a world weinhabited much more when we were children and which we have a Proustian sense ofwhen, say, we listen to music or read poetry (right brain ‘media’) or simplyrelax on a summer’s day. It is also a world much more amenable to the insightsof imagination – again, in the sense that Blake and Swedenborg and poets likeKathleen Raine, who spoke of a ‘learning of the Imagination’, understand theterm. The problem is that this other world is not immediately communicable inlanguage, or at least not in the kind of language that the left, the usurpingemissary, will accept, the factual prose of logic or quantitative measurement.(We live, as the literary philosopher Erich Heller remarked, in an ‘age ofprose’.)These meanings are implicit, given, self-evident. They exist in and arise fromwhat the philosopher Michael Polanyi called ‘the tacit dimension’ and are anexpression of the truth that, as Polanyi remarks, ‘we can know more than we cantell’. This is another example of the idea that the content of mystical, poetic,or spiritual experience is often no different from the content of our everyday(left-brain dominant) experience. What makes the difference is how that contentis experienced. People experiencing that sense of wholeness which the rightbrain provides find it difficult to convey this experience to someone else,because all they have to do this with are the words the left brain uses to getabout its daily business. Unless you have had the experience as well, thesewords will say nothing more to you than what they usually do, and you will haveno idea what your friend is talking about. Or if the experience is conveyed,through poetry or philosophy, the left brain’s reaction is ‘That’s all very nicebut this is what’s really important’, and it will get back to work manipulatingand controlling the world. McGilchrist cites philosophers like Hegel, Heidegger,and Wittgenstein, who all had an intuition of this and who all had immensedifficulty expressing it clearly, because they are trying to do something withlanguage which language – a predominately left brain tool for ordering the world– wasn’t made to do. Hegel and Heidegger frequently tie themselves in dizzyingdialectical and ontological knots, and Wittgenstein gave up, concluding that wecannot say the truth, only show it.TWO MODES OF CONSCIOUSNESSAs I read The Master and His Emissary I became increasingly excited at the newavenues of thought McGilchrist was opening up, only a fraction of which I cantouch on here.41 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--41] One thing that excited meimmensely was that the distinction between the different ‘takes’ or attitudestoward the world exhibited by the left and right brain was already familiar tome, through the work of other thinkers that I had written about in earlierbooks. In A Secret History of Consciousness and The Quest for HermesTrismegistus, I discuss the ideas of the maverick Egyptologist René Schwaller deLubicz (1887–1961). A central theme in Schwaller de Lubicz’s work is thedistinction between what he calls ‘cerebral consciousness’ and the ‘intelligenceof the heart’. ‘Cerebral consciousness’, which Schwaller de Lubicz associateswith our own modern mentality, operates by ‘granulating’ reality, turning itinto discreet bits and pieces, and severing the connections that run through it,like the fibres in a spider’s web, the links that allow William Blake to see aworld in a grain of sand and heaven in a wildflower. These links make possiblewhat Colin Wilson has dubbed the ‘relationality’ of consciousness, its abilityto spread out into a tapestry of meaning. If we think of consciousness as a poolinto which ideas or impressions are dropped, and the ripples from them radiatingout and lapping against other ideas and impressions, and creating furtherripples, we will get a picture of what he means.42[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--42] ‘All in the universe,’ Schwaller de Lubiczwrote, ‘is in interdependent connection with all’.43[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--43]It is the ‘intelligence of the heart’, Schwaller de Lubicz argued, that allowsus to perceive and feel this ‘interdependent connection’. This is a‘participatory’ mode of consciousness, of the kind related to how the rightbrain perceives the world, and which allows for us to have a living connectionto it, unlike the left brain’s detached, analytical stance. For Schwaller deLubicz, the intelligence of the heart ‘allows us, in love, to be the thing, tobe inside the thing, to grow with the plant, to fly with the bird, to glide withthe serpent …’ It allows us, as he writes in his gnomic work Nature Word, to‘tumble with the rock which falls from the mountain/Seek light and rejoice withthe rosebud about to open’ and ‘expand in space with the ripening fruit’.44[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--44] It is also a mode of consciousness that allowsfor what Schwaller de Lubicz calls ‘the simultaneity of opposite states’, anability to perceive two different realities simultaneously, without the need todecide on one or the other being true, an idea Schwaller de Lubicz absorbed fromhis study of quantum physics, specifically Werner Heisenberg’s ‘uncertaintyprinciple’ and Niels Bohr’s ‘complementarity’. ‘Complementarity’ tells us thatlight can act both as a wave and a particle, which are mutually exclusivestates, at least to our ‘cerebral’ consciousness, and the ‘uncertaintyprinciple’ tells us that we can know only the speed or the position of anelementary particle, not both, again a situation our ‘cerebral’ consciousness,with its demand for exactitude and clarity, finds difficult. The right brain, asremarked above, has an attitude of ‘both/and’, which allows it to appreciatemetaphor, the linguistic sleight of hand in which one thing stands for another,and which to the literal ‘either/or’ minded left brain is incomprehensible. Thissuggests a connection between Schwaller de Lubicz’s ideas and McGilchrist’sfindings.In my earlier work I remarked that Schwaller de Lubicz’s ideas about thesedifferent modes of consciousness are similar to ideas about consciousnesspresented by the philosopher Henri Bergson (1859–1941), and I suggested that, asSchwaller de Lubicz had been a student of the painter Matisse, and Matissehimself was influenced by Bergson, the connection was natural. Bergson was animmensely influential philosopher in the early part of the last century, butsadly is little read today. Bergson argued that our brains and nervous systemserve an essentially eliminative function; they are designed to keep stimuli andinformation out of consciousness, and to allow only as much of it into awarenessas is necessary for us to survive; in other words, to ignore 99% of the‘interdependent connections’ everything has with everything else. This makesperfect sense, as a consciousness constantly awash in an awareness of everythingwould prove unhelpful, to say the least. As I’ve remarked elsewhere, Jorge LuisBorges’ story ‘Funes the Memorious’, in which a character is paralysed throughsuch an overload of knowledge, makes this clear. This reduced, highly editedconsciousness presents us with a solid, stable, three-dimensional ‘world’ thatit has ‘carved’ out of what is really a continuous, ever-changing flow, thestreaming flux of becoming. This edited picture allows us to survive admirably –it has, indeed, made us the dominant species on the planet – but the picture ofthe world it provides is by definition incomplete. What it shows us, Bergsonargued, is the ‘outside’ of things, their surface. It cannot show us their‘insides’. In order to perceive this, we need a different form of consciousness,which Bergson called intuition. By intuition Bergson means ‘the kind ofintellectual sympathy by which one places oneself within an object in order tocoincide with what is unique in it and consequently inexpressible’.Analysis, our everyday form of consciousness, which I referred to in my earlierbooks as ‘survival consciousness’, is, Bergson says, ‘the operation whichreduces the object to elements already known, that is, to elements common toboth to it and other objects’.45 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--45] That the leftbrain is geared, McGilchrist tells us, to what it already knows – to thefamiliar – and that the right is geared toward the new and living –with which ithas a reciprocal relationship – suggests to me that what Bergson and McGilchristare talking about is the same thing.MEANING PERCEPTIONThis insight into the character of our two modes of consciousness was discussedat length in a short book, Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect (1927), by theAnglo-American philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), again, anotherbrilliant mind little read today. Whitehead argued that we possess two distinctways of perceiving the world, what he calls ‘presentational immediacy’ and‘causal efficacy’, which, for ease of comprehension, we can translate to‘immediacy perception’ and ‘meaning perception’. Immediacy perception gives usthe bare facts, the discreet things that populate our awareness, the surface ofBergson’s analysis and the ‘granulated’ bits and pieces of Schwaller de Lubicz’s‘cerebral’ consciousness. Meaning perception is the glue that holds theseseparate items together to form a whole and allows them to make sense. It is aform of Schwaller de Lubicz’s ‘intelligence of the heart’ and Bergson’s‘intuition’, which allows us to get into things, to know their ‘insides’.If we think of what happens when we read a book we can get an idea of how thesetwo different ways of perceiving the world operate. You, now, are looking atthis page. In each sentence you perceive individual words, and in those wordsindividual letters. You do not, however, consciously add the letters together tomake a word, or the words together to make a sentence, and, eventually, thesentences together to make this book. You perceive these things as wholes, andit is through this that you absorb the meaning I am trying – no doubt clumsily –to express. If you perceived these words or sentences solely with immediacyperception they would make no sense. The individual words would appear in sharpclarity and definiteness, but they would have no meaning – aside from theirdictionary definition – which is a kind of aura that hovers around a sentence orbook, but which could not be discovered by adding all the individual wordstogether. We experience this if we are tired and try to read. We read a sentenceor two and fail to ‘grasp’ its meaning, even when we re-read it again. This isbecause our meaning perception has broken down and is not linking the individualwords – the bits and pieces – together into a whole. When Sartre’s protagonistin Nausea is frightened by a door knob or the root of tree, it is because hismeaning perception is failing to provide the context – the atmosphere – in whichthese things are usually perceived. Meaning perception is most apparent in ourappreciation of music. We known Beethoven’s String Quartet Op. 132 meanssomething – indeed something profound – but we would be hard pressed to pin thisdown exactly, because this meaning exceeds language’s ability to express it inany specific way. Such a specific meaning would, indeed, seem totallyinadequate, just as we would be hard pressed to say what the meaning of a sunsetis, although we would know it was beautiful, moving, poignant.Science, the form of immediacy perception par excellence, can never answer thisquestion. It can never tell us why a sunset or a string quartet is beautiful.This is no argument against science, merely an acknowledgement of its limits. Itcan analyse the sunset into wavelengths of light and the effect of refraction onthem as they pass through the earth’s atmosphere, just as it can analyseBeethoven’s music into vibrations in the air, which is what music is. But itwill never arrive at how these purely physical phenomena can produce in asensitive consciousness a mystical feeling of beauty and awe. (Indeed, inneuroscience, this is known as the problem of qualia, how ‘qualitative’phenomena – colour, sound, beauty, awe – can arise from quantitative ones –neurons or molecules.) The same would be true if I could somehow run to thehorizon and grab hold of the sunset – which, indeed, I often would like to do.Even if I had it in my hands, I could not find its meaning that way, becausealthough I perceive the physical qualities that convey the beauty to me throughmy senses, the beauty itself is something beyond the senses. And again, it ismeaning perception that gives to the content of mystical experiences theirpeculiar quality; it adds another dimension to what we normally perceive in themode of immediacy. This is why we feel we are seeing something for the firsttime. We are, or at least we are seeing it with our meaning perception crankedup a bit.EXACT FAKEIn fact, Whitehead developed his ideas about our two ways of perceiving inresponse to what he called the ‘bifurcation of nature’, the splitting of realityinto ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ qualities, which began with Galileo (1564–1642).Primary qualities are everything that is amenable to scientific quantificationand measurement, and, since Galileo, whatever meets this criteria has come to beseen as the ‘really real’. Secondary qualities are everything that give value ormeaning to our experience, such as colour, sound, smell. (This is the essence ofthe ‘fact/value’ divide.) What is really real in primary terms about a sunsetare the wavelengths of light and the index of refraction, both measureable andquantifiable and amenable to being analysed into separate parts. What ismeaningful or valuable to us about a sunset is its beauty and grandeur, neitherof which can be quantified or broken down into constituent parts. What should beclear from all of this is that Whitehead’s immediacy perception is a left brainaffair, and that meaning perception is right brain business.46[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--46]Whitehead’s agreement with McGilchrist, Bergson and Schwaller de Lubicz is clearin a statement he made in regard to ‘the absurd trust’ we place in the ‘adequacyof our knowledge’, left brain knowledge, that is. The exactness that scientificthought prides itself on, and which it pursues in its analysis of the universeis, Whitehead says, a ‘fake’. We cannot arrive at ‘an adequate description offinite fact’ – the bits and pieces – because such a description relies on a‘background of presupposition which deifies analysis by reason of itsinfinitude’ – in other words, its ‘interdependent connection’ with everythingelse. We understand how each fact fits into the context under examinationthrough common sense, the implicit meanings understood by the right brain, whicharise from Polanyi’s ‘tacit dimension’. But there can be no analysis of commonsense, Whitehead tells us, because it ‘involves our relation to the infinity ofthe universe’. To grasp reality – which is what philosophers aim to do – wecannot, Whitehead tells us, ‘rely upon any adequate explicit analysis’, on thecrystal clear part separated from the vaguer whole. Logic, the application of arigorous either/or, which provides these parts in matchless clarity – Schwallerde Lubicz’s ‘granulation’ – is a ‘superb instrument’, but it needs a backgroundof implicit self-evident truth – common sense – in which to work. ‘The finaloutlook of Philosophic thought,’ Whitehead concludes, ‘cannot be based upon theexact statements which form the basis of special sciences.’47[part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--47]GUARDIANS OF THE WORLDIt may seem that in speaking about the two sides of the brain and two modes ofconsciousness we have moved quite a bit away from trying to understand ourselvesas caretakers of the cosmos. But in fact the connection is quite clear. And Ishould point out that McGilchrist and the other thinkers I have discussed inrelation to his work are not saying that the left brain is bad and the rightbrain good, or that immediacy perception is a villain and meaning perception ahero. The point is not to favour one at the expense of the other, but to seewhere one mode has been developed and has gained a kind of superiority andacceptance in our experience, while the other has been relatively ignored, ifnot actively discouraged. In our time we have erred, I believe, on the side ofimmediacy, but too much meaning perception can be just as much a problem as toolittle. As happens, I believe, under the influence of psychedelic drugs, to letthe ‘taps of meaning’ run full force often results in a flood. We need bothsides of our brain as well as both modes of consciousness in order to be fullyhuman. And we should not be too concerned about localising the two modes toorigidly in the two cerebral hemispheres. Although I believe there is a stronglink between them, what is important is to recognise that we do have these twodifferent ways of relating to reality and that they operate in us already. Sowhether or not they can be localised in one or the other brain is, in a sense,irrelevant. They are part of our experience. In fact, they are the way in whichwe have experience, and it behoves us to see this and understand itsimplications.Yet, there is a link between how our brains work and our relationship to thecosmos. McGilchrist points out that while the left brain is geared towardcontrolling reality, gaining a mastery of it, and, more or less, subduing it toits purposes, the right brain is more geared toward caring for and about it. Ifthe one provides us with the ability to be ‘exploiters of the world and oneanother’, to be detached manipulators of its bits and pieces, the other helps usto be ‘citizens one with another and guardians of the world’, to participate inits coming into being. And, as I hope to make clear further on, also in itson-going evolution.48 [part0007.xhtml#rw-num-note--48] Let us take a look now athow this might be done.2.

DOING THE GOOD THAT YOU KNOW [part0001.xhtml]In his book Kabbalistic Metaphors, Sanford L. Drob quotes the Talmudic scholarRabbi Adin Steinsaltz who remarked that we live in ‘the worst of all possibleworlds in which there is yet hope.’1 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--1] Readersfamiliar with the seventeenth century philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz(1646–1716) will recall his belief that, contra Rabbi Steinsaltz, we live in thebest of all possible worlds. Leibniz believed that God could not have created aninferior world, and Leibniz devoted his considerable logical powers toexplaining why there is evil in the world, a theological effort known astheodicy, or ‘justifying God’s ways to man’. Leibniz’s somewhat optimisticassessment was famously parodied by the French philosophe Voltaire in hiscomedic work Candide (1759). Voltaire was only too aware of the evil in theworld, and his satiric character Dr Pangloss (his name says it all) isperpetually explaining why some horrible situation is actually the best thatcould be hoped for. In a sense, Rabbi Steinsaltz’s remark is a combination ofLeibniz and Voltaire. We could say that it brings together the best and worst ofboth possible worlds, the overly optimistic, and the overly pessimistic.In an interview, Steinsaltz explained what he meant by his remark. ‘If I want totest a new car, the way that I test it is not on the smoothest of roads, underthe best conditions. To have a real road test … I would have to put it under theworst conditions in which there is still hope. I cannot test it by driving itoff a cliff, but I can test it on the roughest terrain where I must come to theedge of the cliff and have to stop’.It may seem a homely analogy, but Steinsaltz’s view of creation isn’t far fromhis ideas about testing cars. Creation, he says, is ‘an experiment inexistence’, an ‘experiment in “conquering the utmost case”’. Like testing cars,creation, he believes, ‘would have been pointless unless it was precisely underthese difficult circumstances’. Our world, Steinsaltz believes, ‘is on the brink… If it were to be slightly, just slightly, worse than it actually is, then itsbasic structure would become entirely hopeless’. But Steinsaltz does not believethis is a pessimistic view. ‘If a person sees the world as all pink and glowing,he is not an optimist, he’s just a plain fool. An optimist, on the other hand,is one who in spite of seeing the terrible facts as they are, believes thatthere can be an improvement’.2 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--2] In theKabbalistic view, this effort of improvement is the work of tikkun.Why God, who is supposed to be all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving, wouldcreate a world in which evil is rife, in which life is difficult and full ofsuffering, is a question that has plagued man practically since he began tothink. To many, the answer to this conundrum is that there is no God. To others,of a particularly rosy bent, the answer is that there is no evil or suffering;they are, they say, an illusion, a sentiment enjoyed by many New Agers today.Neither conclusion seems satisfying, at least to me. I see too much good in theworld not to feel that there is something behind it – exactly what, is somethingI am trying to articulate by writing this book. But I also see too much evil,pain and suffering to accept that they are simply illusions, to be swept away bymy enlightenment, or that they are kinks in the human machine, to bestraightened out by science and pharmacology. Earlier I mentioned theKabbalistic belief that in creating the world, God or the Ein-Sof shattered thecosmic vessels on purpose, that the mistakes made in the beginning were part ofthe plan, and that all along the secret aim of the Big Spill – hidden even tothe Ein-Sof itself – was for man to arrive and put things straight.3[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--3] All the king’s horses and all the king’s men maynot have been able to put Humpty Dumpty together again, but as far as Kabbalahis concerned, man’s raison d’être is precisely that. But by repairing the brokenpieces of existence tikkun does not return the world to a previous perfectstate. On the contrary, it is only through man’s work in this fallen world thatcreation itself is complete, and that the Ein-Sof’s work is accomplished. Inthis sense, the Humpty Dumpty we put back together is a better version than theoriginal. From this point of view, the Ein-Sof’s initial handiwork would haveremained inferior if the vessels hadn’t shattered and man hadn’t been sent todeal with the mess. Here, the repairman does a better job than the creator.That the difficulties in existence, its pain, suffering, and evil, are inflictedupon us not as a punishment for Adam’s sin, or because of the warped mind of anidiot demiurge, but because it is only through our grappling with them that thework of creation can be fulfilled, that the meaning of existence can berevealed, is an idea shared by different schools of thought. They all centrearound the recognition of the necessity of struggle, of effort, and theunderstanding that it is only through working in a difficult world that any truevalue can be achieved. A block of stone is a difficult medium to work with. Itis obdurate and resistant, and requires a great deal of effort to get somethingout of it. But every sculptor knows he can do nothing with a cloud. Creationneeds resistance, otherwise it can’t ‘land a punch’. A bird in flight may seemto move through a perfectly ‘free’ space, but its graceful motion depends on thepressure of its wings against the air. ‘The world we live in,’ Sanford Drobtells us, ‘is absolutely necessary for the “completion” of God’. By being‘exiled’ into a fallen world, Drob says, the Ein-Sof, in its form as humanity,must face the ‘material, intellectual, spiritual, and moral adversity’ thatenables it to fully actualise the values at its centre.4[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] ‘Only in a material world of chaos, toil, andtrouble’, Drob tells us, can ‘the values, which are mere abstractions in theheavens … become fully real’.5 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--5]Every artist, every creator of any sort, knows this: that an idea is only asgood as its expression. As long as they remain solely in the freer, ideal realmof the mind or imagination (in the negative sense), ideas, insights, and visionsmay retain a certain perfection, but they lack effectiveness. They can onlyacquire this if they come down from the ideal heights and enter the lowlands ofreality, and this is not easy work. This is why many people who have a hankeringto be creative never get around to actually doing it. They are afraid that theirbeautiful idea will lose its perfection in the frustrating attempt to captureit, and they are reluctant to make the effort to try. They prefer to keep theirbrilliant idea safe. But as long as it remains solely in their head, or istrotted out occasionally in conversation – we all know would-be writers who cantalk a good book – it remains unreal. This is something we will return to inother thinkers we will encounter in this book: the need for spirit to embodyitself in matter, for values to be actualised in life. In a sense we can saythat creation is an attempt on the part of God to self-actualise, in Maslow’sterm.) The good, the true, and the beautiful remain pleasant abstractions untilthey are forced into the resistant medium of reality. There is no escaping this.Our business is to make values real and the only place we can do this – the onlyplace it can be done – is here, now, in our fallen world. As the philosopher MaxScheler, who we will return to further on, remarked, ‘An assimilation of theforms of being and value with the actual effective energies can take place onlyin the raging tempest of the world’.6 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--6] Gurdjieffonce told Ouspensky that the earth is in a very bad place in the universe,almost the worst, the equivalent of Outer Siberia.7[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--7] Everything here is difficult and costs a greatdeal of effort. But it may be the only place where we can get things done.SAVING GODScheler’s remark may seem dramatic, but some actualisers of value have foundthemselves in ‘raging tempests’ that were more than metaphorical. The Cretanpoet and novelist Nikos Kazantzakis – best known in English speaking countriesfor his novels Zorba the Greek (1952) and The Last Temptation of Christ (1960) –wrote his philosophical credo The Saviours of God: Spiritual Exercises (1960) inBerlin in 1923, during the collapse of the Weimar Republic, an economic cave-inthat makes our recent ‘credit crunch’ seem like a picnic. Photographs from thetime show people pushing wheelbarrows full of worthless currency in order to buya loaf of bread. At one point a US dollar was worth 4,200,000,000,000Deutschmarks, a figure more reminiscent of astronomical distances than rates ofinflation.8 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--8] Kazantzakis tells how before writingthe work he was afflicted with a strange malady, that the Freudian psychologistWilhelm Stekel, whom Kazantzakis had consulted in Vienna, explained to him wasknown as ‘the saint’s disease’. Kazantzakis wrote to his wife, telling her thathe was confined to his bed, dosed in antiseptics, his face wrapped in compresseshe had to change by the hour. He told her he was suffering from eczema, but thiswas not really true. His face had swollen to a ‘loathsome blubber of flesh’ andhis lower lip oozed a peculiar yellow liquid.9 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--9]Atnight he would awaken, crying in pain. Any attempt at a social life, atattending a concert or lecture, only made things worse. All he could do wasremain in his room and work on his verse drama about the Buddha and hisrenunciation of the flesh, a work he was to abandon and recast as his Savioursof God.10 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--10]Doctors he consulted could provide no help; they had no idea what was wrong withhim. But Stekel offered a clue. He told Kazantzakis that he had ‘a spiritual andmental energy beyond the normal’ and that his body suffered from this. He alsotold Kazantzakis that his affliction was known to the monks of the Middle Ages,that it would come to ascetics who were on the brink of breaking their vows.‘When they found the temptations of the flesh too much to endure,’ Stekel toldthe poet, ‘they would run howling toward town for a woman. But on the way, totheir great horror, their bodies broke out in sores and boils, their facesbecame flushed and bloated, a yellow liquid dripped from pores until they fellon their knees in repentance …’11 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--11]Although he kept it from his wife, Kazantzakis knew why this medieval sicknesshad come to him. One evening in Vienna he had gone to the theatre and by chancefound himself sitting next to a beautiful woman. His fiery, impassioned writingssuggest the opposite, but Kazantzakis was a shy man, a paradoxical charactertrait he shared with one of his heroes, Nietzsche. (Nietzsche famously said thathe was not a man but ‘dynamite’, yet he was too shy to propose to Lou-AndreasSalome, and had to ask a friend. Understandably, she rejected him.) Kazantzakiswas surprised that within a short while he found himself talking to hisenchanting neighbour. Bored with the play, they left together and spent the restof the evening walking. To his surprise, Kazantzakis found himself inviting hisnew friend to his room. She excused herself, saying she could not come thatevening, but would be happy to the next. Kazantzakis returned to his room,excited by his encounter and anticipating the next evening’s delights. But whenhe awoke the next morning, his ‘eczema’ had broken out; his chin and lips hadswollen enormously. He sent word to the mysterious woman, apologising for havingto cancel their assignation and arranging it for the next night. But hiscondition worsened daily, and he had to keep putting her off. After days ofsuffering and solitude, his face wrapped in bandages, he went to the opera torelieve his boredom, and it was there that he met Stekel. In the end, Stekelexplained that, as with the medieval monks, his affliction was caused by hisbreaking his vows, not to his wife, but to his spirit. ‘Your body,’ he told thesuffering poet, ‘is suffering from remorse of spirit’. Kazantzakis haddetermined to write his play about the Buddha and had become obsessed with thequestion of asceticism. Now this temptation threatened to interfere with this.Stekel told Kazantzakis that unless he renounced his ‘lady of the theatre’ andleft town, his condition would only worsen. At first Kazantzakis could notaccept this, and continued to see dermatologists. Eventually he took Stekel’sadvice. Almost as soon as he did, his ‘eczema’ was cured.Understandably, Kazantzakis resented the suffering he endured, but within it healso felt a strange kind of joy. ‘Because of my illness,’ he wrote, ‘my soul wasfilled with heroic bitterness. I understand those heroes now who worked amidbodily wretchedness. To endure bitterness, yes – but at the same time, out ofpride, not to enlarge your bitterness but to reach the opposite extreme – toinvoke joy and health as though they were the general law. Never before have Ibeen so prepared to perform a valiant deed as in these days when I am filledwith loathing as I look on my face …’ ‘A mystical joy,’ he wrote, ‘penetrates mylife … because I am testing my endurance …’12 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--12]Less than two months after this, Kazantzakis destroyed the three thousand verseshe had written on the Buddha, and devoted himself to a new work, which, he said,would state the terms of his own salvation. This was The Saviours of God. It isa powerful declaration of his faith in man as the agent of ‘creative evolution’,something along the lines of Julian Huxley’s ‘transhumanism’, which weencountered in Chapter 1, but which Kazantzakis approached in a more mysticalmanner. Kazantzakis was a believer in the philosopher Bergson’s élan vital, or‘life force’, which he saw at work in the world, creating God. ‘If we are to seta Purpose,’ he wrote, ‘it is this: to transubstantiate matter and to turn itinto spirit’ (italics in original).13 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--13]Kazantzakis realised he was a ‘weak, ephemeral creature made of mud and dream’.But he also felt ‘all the powers of the universe whirling within me,’ astatement that has a striking similarity to the Hermetic idea of man being acreature of two worlds.14 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--14] The essence of thiswork, of ‘saving God’, Kazantzakis tells us, is ‘struggle’. ‘My God’, he says,‘is not almighty. He struggles, for he is in peril at every moment; he tremblesand stumbles in every living thing’ ‘God is imperilled’ and ‘he cannot be savedunless we save him with our own struggle’. Contrary to the teachings of theestablished church, Kazantzakis asserts that ‘It is not God who will save us –itis we who will save God … by transmuting matter into spirit’. This salvagingoperation is not easy and there are no guarantees: ‘If we all desire itintensely, if we organise all the visible and invisible powers of earth andfling them upward, if we all battle together like fellow combatants eternallyvigilant – then the Universe might possibly be saved’.15[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--15]These last remarks are reminiscent of how David Lindsay, who we met in the lastchapter, views the ‘muspel fire’, symbol of the ‘true’ reality, that Maskull,the hero of his Gnostic novel A Voyage to Arcturus, seeks. ‘Muspel,’ Lindsaywrites, ‘was no all-powerful universe, tolerating from pure indifference theexistence side-by-side with it of another false world, which had no right to be… Muspel was fighting for its life.’16 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--16] ForLindsay, like Kazantzakis and other thinkers encountered in this work, the‘muspel-fire’ – or whatever you want to call the drive within us that compels usto go beyond ourselves and become something more – is not all-powerful orall-mighty but needs our help, an idea that the established church, as well asmany ‘alternative’ spiritual teachings, not to mention materialist science, doesnot accept.RESPONSIBILITYThe struggle to save God, to transmute dense, resistant matter into living,creative spirit, produces, Kazantzakis tells us, ‘two superior virtues’. Theyare ‘responsibility and sacrifice’. ‘Love responsibility,’ Kazantzakis commands.‘Say: it is my duty, and my duty alone, to save the earth. If it is not saved,then I alone am to blame.’17 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--17]Another actualiser of values who also viewed responsibility as central to ourwork in the world was the psychologist Victor Frankl (1905–1997), originator ofthe school of ‘logotherapy’, a form of existential and humanist psychology whichsees meaning – not sex, power, or self-esteem – as the ‘primary motivationalforce in man’.18 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--18] Frankl saw responsibility asso important and fundamental a virtue that he believed a Statue ofResponsibility should be erected on the west coast of America, to balance outthe Statue of Liberty that stands on the east. Freedom is, of course, important,but Frankl believed that it is ‘in danger of degenerating into merearbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness’.19[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--19] In a time when people’s ‘rights’ areincreasingly enlarged to include wider and wider areas of life – from the rightto have the state provide us with a living and keep us healthy, to the right tohave children, whether we are biologically capable of it or not – Frankl’s ideamay seem reactionary, but there are plans to make his statue a reality.20[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--20] Whether or not the Statue of Responsibilitygets off the ground – and if it does it is unclear if it will make a difference– Frankl’s philosophy is clearly an example of Rabbi Steinsaltz’s belief thatvalues must be tested in ‘the worst possible world in which there is yet hope.’The actual world – life world – in which Frankl developed his ideas may havebeen one in which even Rabbi Steinsaltz’s austere optimism would have beenseverely tested. Steinsaltz remarked that ‘there are indeed worlds below ours inwhich there is no hope at all’.21 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--21] In 1942, whenFrankl, his wife, and his parents were sent to the Theresienstadt concentrationcamp, he could have been excused for believing he had entered such a world.Certainly by the time he was transferred, first to Auschwitz, then to Kaufering(associated with Dachau), and his wife was sent to Bergen-Belsen, where she died– his parents were murdered in Auschwitz’s gas chambers and his brother diedthere too – he could not have been blamed for believing he had entered ahopeless world. In 1945, Frankl was liberated from the Türkheim camp by theAmerican army, and practically the first thing he did was write his book,Trotzdem Ja Zum Leben Sagen: Ein Psychologe Erlebt das Konzentrationslager(1946) (‘Saying Yes to Life In Spite of Everything: A Psychologist Experiencesthe Concentration Camps’). Originally published in English as From Death Camp toExistentialism, it later achieved world acclaim as Man’s Search for Meaning: AnIntroduction to Logotherapy (1959). At the time Frankl died, the book had soldten million copies and was translated into more than twenty languages. If anyoneknew about living in the worst of all possible worlds in which there is yethope, Frankl did.Given the conditions under which he lived for five years, it would have beeneasy and understandable for Frankl to have arrived at a philosophy of despair,of hopelessness, and to have developed a conviction that life was surelymeaningless.22 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--22] Many of his fellow inmates didprecisely that. But Frankl discovered that precisely the opposite was true: thatlife retains meaning even under the worst possible conditions, and thatsuffering, rather than something we should avoid or deaden through drugs, ‘maywell be a human achievement’.23 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--23] (By ‘suffering’Frankl does not mean the pointless neurotic complaints many of us bring uponourselves, nor does he mean we should seek out suffering in some masochisticself-flagellant way, but the real, ‘existential’ suffering that life unavoidablybrings to us.) Frankl recognised that those inmates who possessed a sense ofpurpose, of some goal lying ahead in the future, were more likely to survive,and that their physical health was directly related to this as well. Withoutgoals, without some purposeful anticipation, we live, Frankl said, only a‘provisional existence’, a kind of marking time which is really a death in life.Yet what is important about this sense of anticipation isn’t necessarily adefinite goal set for a specific future date, but an attitude, a ‘way of being’,that sees the world as one in which goals, purposes, and meanings are worthpursuing and can be achieved. It is precisely the opposite of the scientificview of man as a ‘lumbering robot’ housing a collection of ‘selfish genes’ or achance outcome in the ‘Monte Carlo game of life’ It is essentially a belief infree will and in a world in which meanings are real, not ‘projected’ by our owndeluded subjective minds. It is an acceptance of ourselves as active agents, notpassive stimulus response machines, acted upon by outside forces.Frankl turns around the standard question ‘what is the meaning of life’, whichwe address to the universe, demanding it respond before we agree to participatein it. Instead, Frankl argues that ‘each man is questioned by life; and he canonly answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respondby being responsible.’ What is demanded of us, Frankl says, is not ‘to endurethe meaninglessness of life’ as Jacques Monod, H.P. Lovecraft, John Gray andothers would have us do, ‘but rather to bear [our] incapacity to grasp itsunconditional meaningfulness in rational terms’. This is the kind of meaning wefind in music, in sunsets, and in love, none of which are amenable to ‘rationalterms’. ‘Thus,’ Frankl wrote, ‘logotherapy sees in responsibleness the veryessence of human existence.’24 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--24] There is meaningin everything, but it is up to us to draw it out.INTENTIONSIn Kabbalah the work of tikkun is carried out through what are called kavannot,or ‘intentions’. Although there are specific acts, rituals and prayers –mitzvoth – required by the faith, tikkun itself can be performed while doingpractically anything. What is important is not so much what you do as how you doit, a theme we have encountered a few times already. In fact, as IainMcGilchrist suggests, the kind of attention that we bring to the world,determines the kind of world we will encounter. ‘Through the direction andnature of our attention, we prove ourselves to be partners in creation, both ofthe world and of ourselves’.25 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--25] This is because‘the kind of attention we bring to bear on the world changes the nature of theworld we attend to.’26 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--26] The ‘patient anddetailed attention’ that, according to McGilchrist, is characteristic of theright brain, will reveal a world very different from ‘left brain attention’,which is geared toward control and manipulation.27[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--27] (We can say the same of Whitehead’s meaningperception and immediacy perception or of Bergson’s intuition and intellect orof Schwaller de Lubicz’s intelligence of the heart and cerebral consciousness.)The kind of attention that sees a world in a grain of sand is different from thekind that sees the same grain of sand as a troublesome thing in your shoe.Performing mitzvoth without the appropriate kavannot means going through themotions of an empty ritual, and it doesn’t take much reflection to recognisethat most of our actions in the world lack the appropriate kavannot orattention. Most of our actions and encounters with others are really sociallubricants, whose purpose is to make things move along smoothly. We ask someonehow they are, but we don’t really want to know, just as the cheery ‘have a niceday’ is repeated so many times at the checkout queue that it becomes a mindlessmantra. Shop managers want their employees to give the appearance of having asolicitous concern for the customers’ welfare, and of course some do honestlywish us a nice day. But much happy service is really routine, the act withoutthe intention. It is empty, like the husks of the klipoth, or like the absurd‘thank you’ we are given by automated ‘self-serve’ machines. A machine cannotthank us, it can only make the sounds of the words ‘thank you’, just as it makesother sounds. (And if we ever start replying ‘you’re welcome’, or, more apt forour time, ‘no problem’, we will really be in trouble.)Luckily, as Daniel C. Matt remarks, ‘since all material existence is animated bythe Divine, even the most mundane activity can serve as an opportunity todiscover God’.28 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--28] There is no special act oftikkun nor a special person entrusted with its pursuit. As Gershom Scholemexplains ‘it is not the act of the Messiah as executor of the tikkun, as aperson entrusted with the specific function of redemption, that bringsRedemption, but your actions and mine.’29 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--29]Therefore it is once again up to us. And bringing attention to our acts,especially the little ones, has a double effect. In the first place having atrue intention when you say ‘thank you’ – that is, really meaning it – can befelt, both by the person we address it to, and by ourselves. It is surprisinglyrefreshing to be ‘real’, as difficult as it may be in a huge megalopolis, filledwith millions of people. It doesn’t mean loving the other, in a Christian sense;we may never see the person again. But recognising that they are a person, andnot an obstacle to be overcome, or a trouble to fend off, or a competitor tobeat, reminds us of their reality and our own. But focusing on the littlethings, on the small stuff, effects a change in the quality of our consciousnesstoo. In The Journey to the East, H. H. (Hesse’s alter ego) remarks that ‘I,whose calling was really only that of a violinist and story-teller, wasresponsible for the provision of music for our group, and I then discovered howa long time devoted to small details exalts us and increases our strength’.30[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--30] A similar insight came to Samuel Butler(1835–1902), most known for his utopian fantasy Erewhon (1872), but who was alsoone of the first intellectuals to launch a concerted attack on Darwinianevolution, starting with his book Life and Habit (1878). ‘When fatigued,’ Butlerwrote, ‘I find it rests me to write very slowly with attention to theformulation of each letter. I am often thus able to go on when I could nototherwise do so.’31 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--31] Why should this be so? Myown suggestion is that by making the effort of focussing, of consciously ‘payingattention’ (the phrase itself suggests the effort and value involved) we compelthe left brain – or, if we want to avoid localising these distinctions in aspecific part of our anatomy, our immediacy perception – to slow down, so thatit begins to operate at the same speed as the right. Our immediacy perceptionbegins to harmonise with our meaning perception and so both gives whatever weare focussing on more depth (an added dimension) and draws on reserves of power(strength) that we are usually not aware of.THE GOOD THAT YOU KNOWAlthough he does not speak of tikkun, Emanuel Swedenborg captured its essence inhis notion of ‘doing the good that you know’. As the psychologist Wilson VanDusen (1923–2005), a modern day exponent of Swedenborg’s ideas, puts it, ‘theLord suffers a stillbirth until man acts by the good that he knows’.32[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--32] As with Kazantzakis, God, or the Lord, needs tobecome real through human actions, and the most effective way of achieving this,for Swedenborg, is by doing the good that we know. But how do we know what isgood? We live in a time when common sense is at a premium and hitherto sharedideas about goodness have become a rarity. Our moral and ethical sense has inmany ways been eroded by notions of ‘cultural relativism’, which argue that thegood is not an absolute, objective reality outside of ourselves – as allreligions maintain – but a product of culture, that is, man-made. The old adagethat ‘one man’s meat is another man’s poison’ has become a rule of thumb bywhich we avoid imposing our subjective notions of the good onto people who donot share them.33 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--33] We do not, however, ask whydoing this is good, if, that is, the belief that it is good to tolerate valueswe do not share is itself only a relative good? There may be cultures that donot value toleration. Should we be tolerant of them, or should we maintain thattoleration of relative values is an absolute good, even if doing so underminesthe notion of cultural relativism? Our obsession with rights has also obscuredour sense of the good. It is common today to find almost daily a tabloid rantabout how concern for his ‘human rights’ has led to a serious criminal beinggiven a very light sentence, or for his case to be thrown out of court, whilethe victim or his family has in no way ‘received justice’. Our sense of the goodis also muted by a science that tells us that altruism and other supposedselfless values are really products of the evolutionary struggle for survival,and are not really altruistic or selfless at all. Or it explains that oursupposed acts of choice, in which we choose to do what is right, are really anillusion, because we are unavoidably programmed to act the way we do.In any case, the only kind of good that science or cultural relativism can pointto is a utilitarian one, in which something is good if it helps us achieve someend, that is, if we can utilise it. So a hammer is good if I want to bang in anail, but neither it nor anything else is good in itself. One wants to ask whybanging in the nail is good. If we say ‘to build a house’ we are still left withasking ‘to what end’? ‘In order to live’. ‘Yes, but to what end’? And so onuntil ultimately we arrive at some good for which we cannot posit a furtherutility and must simply accept as good ‘because’. Utilitarian ideas about thegood, then, ultimately rest on some good that is not utilitarian. Nietzscheremarks somewhere that confusion over ideas of good and evil is a sign that aculture is in decline and these sorts of conundrum suggest he may be right.In such an atmosphere of uncertainty and purely functional thinking, it may seemthat doing the good that we know will not be particularly easy. Yet one of thecharacteristics of self-actualisers, Maslow argued, is that they have ‘far lessdoubt about right and wrong than average people do,’ and self-actualisers, morethan anyone else, will be concerned about tikkun and ‘doing the good that weknow’. It is as if, Maslow said, self-actualisers ‘were perceiving somethingreal and extra human’.34 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--34] This is an expressionof Maslow’s discovery that self-actualisers ‘are better cognisers andperceivers’ and are ‘more acute about differentiating fine hue differences’,which makes them ‘better perceivers of reality’.35[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--35] It is not, as a politically correct criticmight suggest, that self-actualisers have no qualms about imposing their ideasof right and wrong on other people, although, to be sure, some of the mosthorrific events in history – the Reign of Terror following the FrenchRevolution, for example, or Stalin’s forced collectivisation of farms – cameabout through the best intentions, through people doing what they believed wasgood. This is not the case with self-actualisers for the simple reason thatself-actualisers are not interested in other people, but in their own struggleto develop. What it means is that self-actualisers are less likely to getconfused about these things because they are more in touch with their ownfeelings and instincts – perhaps with the intelligence of the heart thatSchwaller de Lubicz speaks of – and are less susceptible to the diffidence thatcomes with such confusion. Which is itself another version of the ‘falsehumility’ which Saint-Martin believed enfeebled us.USES, MEANS AND ENDSSwedenborg himself had no doubt that the good is extra-human, that its origin isin the spiritual realms that are above the physical and which inform it, givingit meaning. The good has, at heart, what Van Dusen calls a ‘general impulsetoward existence’; it manifests as a necessity to actualise itself and aninsistence on being embodied. As with Victor Frankl and Rabbi Steinsaltz,Swedenborg’s good is made of values that require human action to be made real,and this making real begins, not with metaphysical or psychological orsociological ideas about the good, but with acts, whose simplicity andobviousness remove them from all the confusion of our moral dilemmas. Doing thegood that you know does not require doleful soul-searching or philosophicalsophistication. It does not ask ‘what is good?’ Instead it tells us that if weknow a good, we should do it, and all of us know some good. This is part ofSwedenborg’s concept of ‘uses’. ‘The good that is in us,’ Van Dusen writes, ‘isnothing until it comes into existence as uses.’36[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--36] These uses are as simple as sweeping the floor,washing the dishes, or doing the laundry. In fact, they can mean doing any job,however tedious, as long as it is done well and for its own sake. As thesociologist Richard Sennett makes clear, this is the essence of craft, ‘thedesire to do a job well for its own sake.’37 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--37] AsMaslow wrote, ‘practically any means-activity [utilitarian] can be transformedinto an end-activity … Even the dullest, dreariest job, as long as it isworthwhile in principle, can be sanctified..’38 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--38]While we can perform these tasks mechanically and some good will have beenachieved – a clean floor, dishes, and clothes are not to be sniffed at – theycan also be performed with kavannot, the kind of attention that brings theirreality to life and also increases our own, as Samuel Butler and Hermann Hessediscovered. The Divine Love wants to be real, Swedenborg tells us, and it ismade so through our actions. ‘The proof that we are regenerated’, Saint-Martinsaid, ‘is that we regenerate everything around us.’Swedenborg also recognised that our actions and efforts require difficultconditions – Max Scheler’s ‘raging tempest’ – for them to be of value. Just asJean Paul Sartre did, Swedenborg recognised that freedom is terrifying. But itis a necessary terror, because it is only through struggling with it that we canfind our own way. ‘Only what we accomplish with our own freedom,’ Van Dusenwrites, ‘lasts to eternity’.39 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--39] As Kazantzakis,Rabbi Steinsaltz, Victor Frankl and others recognised, ‘it was not,’ Van Dusentells us, ‘meant that existence would be all smooth and simple, like beingbottle fed on divine pablum’. We are not, as many New Age and other spiritualteachings tell us, supposed to ‘go with the flow’. As Victor Frankl learnedunder the worst possible conditions, it is through the trials and tribulationsthat life sends us, that we learn what is most meaningful. If everything washanded to us, we would never find out. Our path is that of most achievement, notleast resistance. Our own existence, here and now, is the door to everythingelse, Swedenborg taught. We do not enter the spiritual realms through any otherportal. This makes human reality once again the ‘centre’ of the universe, andwith it comes a cosmic responsibility. It is through us that reality grows. Thephysical universe may be expanding, as scientists tell us. But the inneruniverse is also getting bigger. The ‘saved’, for Swedenborg, experience realityenlarging, getting bigger, opening up to the good that is larger thanthemselves. They participate in life’s effort to discover and act on its highestmeanings and possibilities. In effect, they help life do the good that it knows.By contrast the ‘damned’ live in an increasingly shrinking world, an existencethat constricts by the day. If the ‘general drift of the hierarchy of heaven istoward joining with others, toward the unitary oneness of the Lord’, the ‘driftof hell is toward separation, division, cutting off …’40[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--40] The saved are those who act by the good thatthey know, and they formed for Swedenborg the Church of the New Jerusalem. Thisneed not be an actual physical building or an actual congregation. All that isrequired for membership is that one acts from the good that one knows. And if welook sincerely enough, we can find this almost anywhere. In fact, one good thatwe know, is to look for the good, so we may know it.SEXIt may seem odd to bring sex into a discussion about tikkun and doing the goodthat you know. But for Swedenborg and Kabbalah, as well as for other spiritualthinkers and teachings, sex is a central means of repairing the universe.Needless to say, it is one good that practically all of us will have preciouslittle hesitation about doing. In fact, we will more than likely go out of ourway in search of it.I believe we live in one of the most highly-sexed times in history, certainly inthe modern period. Clearly people have always had sex; we would not be here ifthey hadn’t. But sex in our time has in many ways become the sole unquestionedgood; in the absence of any spiritual values, this isn’t surprising. Certainlymoney, possessions and power are still highly prized. But sex seems to be theone uniform answer to our unhappiness. If we are feeling low and depressed, thenwe should have an affair. That will make us feel alive. And it also seems to beeverywhere, with little of the modesty and intimacy that at an earlier time madesex mysterious and powerful, even transformative. Our electronic media keeps itpretty much on tap; it is, in fact, difficult to avoid. Because of this, if weare modest about it, and not ‘open’ or ‘transparent’, we are, according tocontemporary lights, ‘in denial’, ‘repressed’, or ‘neurotic’, certainly nothealthy. We should loosen up and relax. Viagra, and other ‘performanceenhancements’ ensure that we can have a potent, commendable sex life, even intoold age. The number of orgasms we have, as well as those we can elicit in apartner, are a sure gauge as to whether or not we are sexually well. Once again,quantity, not quality, is the key point, so go for it.But as with everything else, sex without kavannot, without the attentionrequired to make something real, is simply another empty act, a hollow husk, acoital klipoth which, although many of us will deny it, leaves us feelingunfulfilled, certainly not with the ultimate satisfaction that having avigorous, even athletic sex-life is supposed to provide. Or so we are told.Postmodern sex – if I can coin an ugly phrase – is perhaps most baldly expressedin the work of the French novelist Michel Houellebecq. In novels like Atomized(1998), Lanzarote (2002), and others, Houellebecq presents sex in our time as acommodity, a product of capitalism, totally goal-oriented and utilitarian,obsessed with performance and available only to those who can afford it. Sextourism features centrally in his work, as do internet sex chat-lines and otherforms of cyber-eroticism, which require no contact between people at all. Love,tenderness, and the vulnerability which used to be an element in eroticencounters have evaporated in this world of empty coital coupling, of vigorousbut vapid ‘shagging’. Houellebecq’s deadpan descriptions of sex acts have beencalled pornographic in their detail and intent, yet ultimately they are notreally sexy and are more like clinical or technical reports than the kind ofliterature ‘one reads with one hand’, as the novelist Angela Lambert said ofpornography. Some characters don’t ‘do penetration’ but are into ‘oral’. Othersdevote themselves to other specialities or simply allow their bodies to be used,indifferent to being an object. Houellebecq’s graphic descriptions of mechanicalsex, combined with his characters’ lack of emotional investment – the Englishtitle of his debut novel, Whatever (1998), says it all – give his work an air ofmisanthropy reminiscent of John Gray. In this regard it is curious thatHouellebecq is a great reader of H.P. Lovcecraft, who also looked at humanbodies as machines.41 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--41] Houellebecq’s early essayH.P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life (written in 1991, translated in2005) is a late contribution to the French appreciation of Lovecraft’s nihilism.It is a vehement form of literary criticism, but its thesis that Lovecraft’swork forms a critique of modernity (‘Absolute hatred of the world in general,aggravated by an aversion for the modern world in particular. This summarisesLovecraft’s attitude fairly accurately’) was anticipated by Colin Wilson’s TheStrength to Dream (1962) by decades.COSMIC SEXAgainst the kind of consumer, functional sex depicted in Houellebecq’s novels(which, to my mind, skirt microscopically close to affirming the kind of inhumaneroticism they are ostensibly supposed to be criticising), sex as an element oftikkun presents a very different picture. For Kabbalah, ‘the entire cosmic orderis interpreted in sexual erotic terms.’42 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--42] Asmentioned earlier, when the sephiroth containing the divine energies shattered,the primal androgynous Man, Adam Kadmon, was split in two, fractured intoseparate halves, male and female, who forever seek their other self, in order toheal the rift. This is a motif widely shared; Plato used it in the Symposium.Loving eroticism between man and wife is a central theme in Kabbalah; itrepresents on the earthly plane the creative act of the Divine, and unites themale and female energies, polarised by the Big Spill. In Kabbalah, God isforever seeking to reunite with his Shekhinah, his female better half. The Treeof Life itself is polarised into two opposing pillars, that of Severity andMercy, whose integration results in the balanced Middle Pillar, where thesephiroth Tiphareth (Beauty) holds a central place. Whenever a man and womancome together in loving union, this reintegration is achieved, and a part of theuniverse is repaired.This reparation continues, even in heaven, if we are to believe Swedenborg. Inone of his last books, Conjugial Love (1768), written in his eighties,Swedenborg tells us that angels have sex lives too, which, by his account, aremuch better and more fulfilling that ours on earth. In heaven angels are in‘continual potency’ – a bad break for Viagra investors – and there is noweariness after lovemaking, nor post-coital sadness. Rather a cheerfulness ofmind and eagerness of life. In heaven, married angels ‘pass the night in eachother’s bosom’, and the wife receives unreservedly ‘the virile sentiments of thehusband’.43 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--43] This form of ‘doing the good thatyou know’ may have come to Swedenborg via Kabbalah. During a stay in London in1745, Swedenborg came into contact with the Moravian Brethren, followers ofCount Zinzendorf, who included in their worship meditation on a kind of mysticaleroticism focused on the passion of Christ.44 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--44]Some of the Moravian worship included elements of the doctrines of SabbataiZevi, the ‘false Messiah’, which also included sex. During this time, Swedenborgalso came into contact with the mysterious Rabbi Samuel Jacob Hayyim Falk. Falkwas a Kabbalist from Galicia (Poland) who incorporated aspects of Sabbatianpractice in his teachings. Falk ran an ‘esoteric school’ from a house inLondon’s East End, and it is here that Swedenborg met Falk. It is possible thatit is through Falk that Swedenborg developed his ideas about angelic eroticism.Swedenborg himself was highly sexed, and in his writings he advocates, incertain circumstances, keeping a mistress, and pre- and extramarital relations,in order to avoid ‘the damage that can be caused and effected by too strict arepression of sexual love in the case of those who are troubled with asuperabundance of sexual drive.’45 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--45] MostSwedenborgians avoid the thought, but a superabundance of sexual drive wasapparently a problem for Swedenborg.THE MEANING OF LOVEFor tikkun, it is the erotic union, and not the product of it, that isimportant. This is to say that the ecstasy of the coincidentia oppositorum, andnot the outcome of it, is what matters. The ecstasy is the sign that brokenhalves of the cosmos have been united. And again, the ecstasy is not simply amatter of having a good orgasm, or a sufficient number of them. Ecstasy is notthe same as pleasure. Sex in human life is not a function, like digestion. It isat the core of our being. The ecstasy is not simply a physical reaction, likesending some powerful solvent through us, to ‘clean out the pipes’. It involvesparts of ourselves that we are ‘normally’ unaware of; I put ‘normally’ inquotation marks because our normal is subnormal for the ‘fully human’. This iswhy Nikolai Berdyaev, who we met in Chapter 2, can argue that ‘It is quitepossible to say that man is a sexual being, but we cannot say that man is afood-digesting being’.46 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--46] Obviously sex involvesphysical organs, just as digestion does. But it is not limited to them; itreaches beyond them to permeate our entire life. (This is why onlineadvertisements promising ‘increased performance’ and ‘better tools’ – i.e.larger genitals – miss the point.) Utilitarian views about sex focus on itsproduct, on reproducing ourselves, or on ‘improving’ the race through breeding.This is as much a functional view of it as that depicted in Houellebecq’snovels. Against this practical view of sex, mystics and spiritual thinkers arguethat what is important in sex is the change in consciousness that accompaniesit. In his book The Meaning of Love (1892), the Russian mystical philosopherVladimir Solovyov (1853–1900), an older contemporary of Berdyaev, argued againstregarding sex as essentially a means of reproduction or improving the race.These utilitarian views reduced what was essentially a cosmic phenomenon tomundane, ignoble ends. As in Kabbalah, Solovyov saw the task of love as the workof creating ‘an absolute ideal personality out of two finite ones, to integrateopposites.’47 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--47] To become, that is, ‘fully human’or ‘actualised’.Love – by which Solovyov meant sexual love – is, he said, the ‘visiblerestoration of the Divine image in the material world, the beginning of theembodiment of true ideal humanity’.48 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--48] This‘restoration’ has, according to Solovyov, no other means to perfect itself apartfrom us, and our own regeneration, for Solovyov ‘is indissolubly bound up withthe regeneration of the universe and with the transfiguration of its forms ofspace and time,’ something Saint-Martin knew when he said that the proof of ourregeneration is that we regenerate everything around us.49[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--49] We cannot achieve our full individuality in avacuum. It can only be accomplished within ‘the corresponding development of thelife of the universe’, which – in a statement that anticipates the anthropiccosmological principle by a century – ‘from time immemorial has been interestedin the preservation, development, and perpetuation of all that is reallynecessary and desirable for us’.50 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--50] ‘We are justas necessary to the world as the world is to us,’ Solovyov tells us. And the‘failure to recognise [our] absolute significance is equivalent to a denial ofhuman worth,’ which, according to Solovyov, is ‘the basic error and the originof all unbelief’.51 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--51]COMING HOMEAs we’ve seen, the significance of sex in human and cosmic life did not escapeSolovyov’s countryman Berdyaev. His chapter on sex in The Meaning of theCreative Act is one of the most powerful statements on the cosmic status of theerotic ever written. ‘Sex,’ Berdyaev tells us, ‘is a cosmic force and may becomprehended only in its cosmic aspect’.52 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--52] ‘Notonly in man alone, but in the cosmos as well, there is the sexual division intomale and female and their sexual union’.53 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--53] Asmany thinkers, poets, and mystics have felt, Berdyaev sees the feminine as themore cosmic side of the divide, with the masculine energies being predominantly‘anthropological’, that is, human. Much rhetoric has been exchanged over the‘sexist’ bias of such remarks. Yet while I can appreciate that, being a man, myviews may be biased – and fully realising the criticisms I am leaving myselfopen to – I can only say that both my experience and my study confirmsBerdyaev’s view. Man relates to the cosmos, to nature, through woman – at leastI do. Man, as a sexual being, is a part of nature, of the cosmos, while woman,for man at least, is nature, is the cosmos. Just as, and in the same context,sex is a part of man’s being, but woman is sex.54[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--54]Which is not the same as saying that woman is only sex, or has no role or partto play in things except for a sexual one. Yet the notion of woman as cosmos isa dim, obscure insight into the significance woman has for man, in his dim,obscure hunger for cosmic union. This polarity is also, Berdyaev tells us, atthe heart of the ‘sex war’, the bitter, sometimes ferocious antipathy that fallsbetween the sexes. Just as a dim memory of our primal androgyny attracts us toour opposite, the primal catastrophe that ripped the original unity in twopushes us apart. It is this tension, this ‘love hate’, which gives relationshipsbetween the sexes their peculiar atmosphere. It is also why, for all the macho,predatory bluster about performance and potency, man finds a strange sense of‘home’ in woman, and why woman is such a powerful trigger for Sehnsucht in men.(It is the ‘eternal feminine’ after all, that ‘draws us onward’, as Goetherecognised long ago.) Feminists may reject the idealisation of women by men,seeing in it really only another form of dominance. But I think they miss thepoint. Very little of the cosmos, I think, could be repaired under a strictlyfeminist rule, about as much as would be under a strictly ‘masculinist’ one,although in both there could still be plenty of sex. Under either, sex wouldremain purely functional, aimed at reproduction, pleasure, or as part of a‘healthy’ regimen, giving a new meaning, perhaps, to our current dictum of‘five-a-day’. When a man admits it, and when he is not pressured by ‘performanceanxiety’, and is not fixated on having an orgasm – which he can easily do, andwith perhaps greater efficiency, by masturbating – he knows there is some senseof ‘return’ when he makes love (which is not the same as ‘having sex’) with awoman.PHENOMENOLOGICAL LOVEBerdyaev’s idea that sex is a form of cosmic union was shared by Max Scheler.Scheler is little read today, but he was enormously influential in the earlyyears of the last century, his wide ranging ideas on ethics, consciousness, art,sociology, and many other subjects informing the work of Martin Heidegger,Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Ortega y Gasset, Scheler’s student the Catholicphilosopher and saint Edith Stein, and Pope John Paul II, to name a few of hisreaders. At the centre of his work was his exploration of the nature of love,which he saw as not only a human emotion, but as a means of inquiry into thefundamental essence of being.Love, for Scheler, was the sine qua non of phenomenology, which, in itsessential form, is a way of allowing the world to be what it is, withoutinterference by human concepts or aims. It is, in a sense, a way of listening towhat the world has to say to us, from which follows the recognition that it hassomething to communicate, and is not simply a vast, inanimate machine. As astudent of phenomenology soon discovers, however, there are as manyphenomenologies as there as phenomenologists. Scheler’s own approach differedfrom phenomenology’s founder, Edmund Husserl, on a central point. Dismayed bythe undermining of philosophy by variety of developments, mostly in science andpsychology, Husserl wanted to secure philosophy as a rigorous discipline byarriving at a strict methodology. Scheler, however, saw phenomenology as more ofan ‘attitude’ or ‘way of seeing’, than a method. It was a way of ‘being withthings’ that would allow for them to show themselves as they are. It was aGeisteshaltung, a ‘disposition of spirit’, or ‘spiritual stance’, that one tooktoward the world, as one waited for it to show itself. In this sense, Scheler’sphilosophical approach shares much with Iain McGilchrist’s suggestion that thekind of attention we bring to the world determines the kind of world we willattend to.55 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--55] If love between people creates anatmosphere in which one can ‘be oneself’, then love directed at things willallow them to be themselves as well. After all, philosophy is the ‘love ofwisdom’. Through love we can know things that we would be unable to know withoutit; it has a real cognitive purchase. It is not only an emotion we feel aboutthings; it is a way – the way, for Scheler – for us to know them as they are.Love opens the world to us, as it opens ourselves to the world, whereas hate,for Scheler, was a closing off, a shrinking away from things (it is unclear ifScheler ever read Swedenborg, but this seems very similar to Swedenborg’sdistinction between the ‘saved’ and the ‘damned’ mentioned earlier).Scheler believed that it was not enough to apply a strict methodology to ourexperience in order to understand its structure. Without the phenomenologicallove that he speaks of, we would not have the experience itself. In this sense,philosophy is not a detached, objective observation, but an encounter. Again,this love is not showy or expressive or overtly demonstrative; we do not dophenomenology as Scheler sees it by hugging a tree. But it does participate in a‘patient and detailed attention to the world’ – which is more akin to poetry –rather than an aggressive attempt to ‘uncover’ its secrets, which we associatewith materialist science.UNITY WITH OTHERSThrough his investigation into the nature of sympathy, the bond of feeling wehave with others, Scheler saw that ‘man’s sense of unity with the living cosmosis in general so bound up with the sense of union in sexual love that the latteris, as it were, the “gateway” to the former’. It is, he believed, ‘the means,prescribed by Nature herself, of arousing in man a capacity for identificationwith the cosmos …’56 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--56] With Berdyaev andSolovyov, Scheler was critical of the idea that the purpose of sexual love wasreproduction. He castigated the ‘subordination of the values of life to those ofutility’, and ‘the monstrous delusion that man can ‘produce’ men at his own willand pleasure (like so many cardboard boxes or machines) …’57[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--57] Sexual love for Scheler, as for Berdyaev andSolovyov, was essentially creative, and was not satisfied with merereproduction. ‘The qualitative peak of organic life’ – sexual love – ‘cannot besubordinated to the mere quantitative multiplication of human lives’ he wrote.58[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--58] ‘True sexual love,’ for Scheler, ‘is a creativelife-force, the nobility of life eternally blazing the trail upwards andoutwards from its present level towards a higher form of existence’.59[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--59] (Berdyaev agreed; he speaks of love as ‘thesource of an upward movement of personality’ a ‘creative upsurge into anotherworld’.60 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--60])What this love creates are values, and deeper perceptions of meaning. Scheler infact turns around the standard utilitarian view of the value of sex as a meansof reproduction. He argues that, rather than see the transformative power ofsexual love in the individual as an unintended by-product of a necessary meansof continuing the race, reproduction itself should be seen as a good because itprovides the individual with the opportunity of this transformation. As hewrites, ‘Rather than allow that this love exists simply for the sake ofreproduction, we should proclaim it already entailed in the vital meaning andvalue of reproduction itself, that as many human beings as possible shoulddiscover the crowning-point of their lives in the experience of sexual love.’61[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--61] Sexual love, then, isn’t good because it givesus life. Rather, life is good because it gives us sexual love and theopportunity to experience the ‘qualitative peak of organic life’. Schelerhimself, it seems, enjoyed this qualitative peak fairly often. As his biographerJohn Raphael Staude points out, Scheler had a reputation as an eroticist, amongother things, and that ‘whenever he had to choose between his devotion to atranscendent God and the warm body of a woman, with pangs of conscience butunable to do otherwise, he chose the woman.’ 62 [part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--62]This sense of unity and the fundamental fact of love as a means of experiencingreality informed Scheler’s ideas about society. One problem that troubledScheler was how we know other people’s minds, what in the phenomenologicalliterature is called ‘intersubjectivity’, a conundrum that troubled Husserl inhis last years, and gave rise to his notion of the ‘life world’. We have directsensory experience of other people’s bodies, but not of their minds. Generallythis does not trouble us; we take it for granted that, just as we have an ‘innerworld’, metaphorically located inside our heads, so too do other people. But ifyou stop and think about just how we know this, things become a bit lessobvious. After all, as we know from dozens of science fiction films, a robot orandroid could be made so life-like that we could believe that it was human, justlike ourselves, yet it would be just a machine. In fact, some forms ofschizophrenia manifest in precisely this way, in a belief that people are notreally people, but incredibly life-like robots. People suffering from thisdelusion have lost whatever it is that allows the rest of us to accept thatthose around us are human, just as we are, although we cannot ‘prove’ this inany ‘scientific’ way.Scheler came to the conclusion that we have a direct perception of other selves,just as we have of our own. We do not infer that someone is feeling pain becausetheir actions are like those we associate with pain. According to Scheler, weactually see their pain in their tears. We do not, as it were, observe theother, taking note of his behaviour, then tally up the various actions and cometo the conclusion that, ‘He is in pain’, the ‘bits and pieces’ approach. Weintuit it. In Bergson’s sense, we ‘get inside’ the other, or, actually, arethere to begin with. Scheler believed that originally, there was no differencebetween our inner world and that of others. Or more precisely, originally therewas no such distinction between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ or ‘self’ and ‘other’. AsHerbert Spiegelberg writes, in his monumental study The PhenomenologicalMovement (1976), for Scheler ‘originally our social consciousness contains onlya neutral stream of experiences, not yet assigned to either ourselves or toothers’. ‘The self and other’, for Scheler, ‘are discovered only as a result ofa process of differentiation in the neutral primordial stream’.63[part0008.xhtml#rw-num-note--63] (Which is another way of saying, as I do inChapter 2, that our ‘I’ develops out of an initial ‘ouroboric’ unity with theworld.) So rather than having to explain how my separate consciousness, locatedin my head, or more precisely, my brain, can know that you, too, have a similarseparate consciousness housed in your brain – which is more or less the standardscientific view – Scheler argues that our sense of separateness is the result ofa differentiation of an original primal unity. We are, in the deepest sense,parts of each other. If we are going to repair the universe, we won’t be doingit alone.3.

Nietzsche suffered from a collection of physical andneurological complaints that kept him constantly in search of congenial climate.He was also the loneliest man in Europe. Yet he developed a philosophy of sheeraffirmation. Schopenhauer, his erstwhile mentor, was as pessimistic aphilosopher as can be imagined, embracing a Buddhistic denial of life. Yet hehad a comfortable, cosy life, was relatively well off, and enjoyed sensualpleasures without guilt. It is as if the effort needed to endure difficultconditions pushes us into an appreciation of things from which we do not easilysink into taking them for granted.23 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--23] Frankl p. 108.24 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--24] Ibid. pp. 113–14.25 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--25] McGilchrist p. 28.26 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--26] Ibid.27 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--27] Ibid. p. 7.28 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--28] Daniel C.

But what if these liberated values are, in thetraditional sense, ‘evil’, as, say, the values of Nazi Germany were? UnderHitler, it was good to arrest, torture, and murder Jews as well as various other‘sub-humans’. Faced with this, is it still good to be a cultural relativist? Oris it good to oppose these goods, as most people would? Indeed, how can acultural relativist argue about opposing goods? If all criteria are cultural,what does he use to judge the value of different goods? It is good to recognisethat ideas about the good are cultural, but is that idea itself cultural? If itis, then there can be a culture which rejects it, and a cultural relativist canhave no argument against this. It is good for Nazis to kill Jews, but non-Nazissay it isn’t. What right do non-Nazis have to prevent Nazis from doing the goodthat they know? If we say that the Nazis’ killing of Jews isn’t really a good,but is motivated by hatred, fear, greed, and other ‘negative’ values, what do weoppose to these and why are they not ‘good’? Of course I am not in any waysuggesting that Nazi values were ‘good’, merely showing how difficult it wouldbe for a cultural relativist to say they weren’t. While it is clear that ideasabout an ‘absolute’ good and evil are problematic, it is also clear that arelativistic approach to these matters is itself rather shaky.34 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--34] Abraham Maslow The Farther Reaches of HumanNature (New York: Penguin, 1976) p. 9.35 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--35] Ibid. p. 6.36 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--36] Van Dusen p. 213.37 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--37] Richard Sennett, The Craftsman (London:Allen Lane, 2008) p. 9.38 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--38] Maslow, 1976 p. 113.39 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--39] Van Dusen p. 215.40 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--40] Ibid.41 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--41] See note 21 Chapter One.42 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--42] Drob p. 65.43 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--43] See my Swedenborg: An Introduction to HisLife and Ideas (New York: Penguin, 2012) pp. 30–1 and throughout, for more onSwedenborg’s erotic spirituality.44 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--44] For more on Count Zinzendorf, the Moravians,and Rabbi Falk, see my Politics and the Occult (Wheaton, Il: Quest, 2008) pp.53–65.45 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--45] Ibid.46 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--46] Berdyaev 1962 p. 168.47 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--47] Vladimir Solovyov, The Meaning of Love (WestStockbridge, MA: Inner Traditions/Lindisfarne, 1985) p. 55.48 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--48] Ibid. p. 60.49 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--49] Ibid. p. 10.50 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--50] Ibid. p. 105.51 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--51] Ibid. p. 43.52 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--52] Berdyaev 1962 p. 171.53 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--53] Ibid.54 [part0008.xhtml#rw-ref-note--54] In his novel Strange Life of Ivan Osokin(London: Arkana, 1987) P.D.

THE GOOD SOCIETY [part0001.xhtml]One of the discoveries I made while researching this book is that the work ofMax Scheler and that of Abraham Maslow have some very central themes in common.Although Scheler scholars and Maslovian psychologists will be quick to point outsubtle important differences, Scheler’s concept of a ‘hierarchy of values’ andMaslow’s notion of a ‘hierarchy of needs’ are so similar to each other that, forall practical purposes, we can consider them, if not identical, then certainlyinformed by the same insight into human nature and reality. I don’t know ifMaslow was aware of Scheler’s work, but I doubt it. Scheler’s name doesn’t showup in Maslow’s books, and in the 1940s, when Maslow was laying the foundationsof his psychology, interest in Scheler’s work suffered in the United Statesbecause of a critical article forging a doubtful association between Scheler’sideas and National Socialism.1 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--1] Scheler was notalone in suffering this fate; at the time, in America and Britain, Nietzsche,Hegel, and other German philosophers were all mistakenly tarred with the Nazis’brush, and required a subsequent critical rehabilitation.2[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--2] In Scheler’s case this was doubly ironic, as hewas one of the first German intellectuals to warn of the coming fascism and hisbooks were among the first that the Nazis banned. Because of this, Schelersuffered from an obscurity in Germany even greater than that in America.3[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--3] Scheler, of course, could not have known ofMaslow’s work, as Scheler died in 1928, before Maslow had published anything.What excites me about this sort of serendipity, which I’ve experienced withother thinkers, is the suggestion that what each thinker is focussed on is real,that is, it is an objective discovery about reality, not a subjective opinion orpoint of view.4 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] This sort of independentcorroboration is needed, especially when dealing with spiritual matters, whichelude the kind of sensory or experimental confirmation enjoyed by positivistscience. Two scientists dealing with a problem in molecular biology can performidentical experiments and receive confirmation of their theories there, ‘beforetheir eyes’. Philosophers and psychologists studying man’s inner world or theworld of meaning, do not have this option, and when two independent thinkers,separated by time, language, nationality, and the barriers of war, seem to betalking about the same thing, there is good reason to suspect that it is indeedjust that, the same. And this suggests that it is real.Just as Scheler believed that we have a direct perception of another’s mind healso believed that we have a direct perception of values, that we see them inthe same way that we see colours – not, however, with our eyes, but with ourmind.5 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--5] I don’t decide that something is green,or yellow, or blue. I see that it is. The green, yellow, or blue is there, inthe world, and I recognise it. In the same way, I don’t impose a value onthings, through a subjective act of valuation, providing what is really aneutral substrate with a spurious coating of significance or meaning, which ishow a Lovecraft, Sartre, or Jacques Monod sees it. The value is there and I seeit, just as I see the colour. (In the case of a sunset, mentioned in Chapter 2,the colour and the value seem interfused, as Wordsworth knew.6[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--6]) ‘There is a mode of perception,’ Schelerwrites, ‘whose objects are totally beyond the grasp of the intellect, and forwhich the intellect is as blind as the ear and the source of hearing are forcolour – a mode of perception nonetheless, which presents to us real objects andan eternal order among them – namely the values and their hierarchy’.7[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--7] ‘Values are not only valuations but alsovalue-facts,’ Scheler’s interpreter, Werner Stark, tells us, ‘that can be seenby our mental eyes in the same way in which our physical eye sees colouredsurfaces’.8 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--8] This insight led Scheler to speakabout a ‘realm of values’ that we can enter, an objective, really existingworld, like the physical world, that we can explore with our minds.What was important about this insight for Scheler is that it provided anobjective grounding for our values, for what we hold important and significant.And this was important because of the rise of the moral, ethical and other kindsof ‘relativisms’ that, as mentioned in the previous chapter, are so much a partof our modern and post-modern world. By declaring the world of values andmeaning unreal – that is, not susceptible to quantification or measurement –science, or a particularly aggressive form of reductionist scientism, opened thedoor on the ‘anything goes’ school of values. Beauty, and everything else, wasnow in the eye of the beholder, not in any kind of objective stratum of realmeaning or value. Like many other thinkers of the time, Scheler recognised thatthis was a dangerous development, which led, as mentioned earlier, to utilitybeing the sole gauge of any good.THE HIERARCHY OF VALUESScheler saw values ordered in a hierarchy, reaching from the immediate butfleeting goods of the senses to the universal and eternal goods of the sacred.At the lowest rung of this ‘ladder of values’ is sensual pleasure, whethersomething feels or tastes good to us, is agreeable or disagreeable, whether wederive some immediate enjoyment from it or not, and whether or not it is of anyuse to us in achieving this enjoyment. This is the level of values that most ofus are occupied with most of the time, and it is the level of values thatinforms utilitarian notions of the good and the ‘consumer consciousness’ thatderives from them. At this level, our values are basically self-centred. Onedifference between the bottom and top rungs of Scheler’s hierarchy is thatsensual values are, as mentioned, transitory. We only feel pleasure as long asthat which provides it lasts. Once we finish the chocolate bar or cigarette, thevalue it contains vanishes. Sacred values, however, continue long after whatinitially triggered them is gone. The force of a mystical or religiousexperience continues to be felt in our lives even though we may no longer be inimmediate contact with whatever triggered it. Another difference is that sensualvalues are atomistic, meaning they can be divided into parts and shared. I canshare a bottle of wine with a friend, and my half of the wine provides the samedegree of sensual enjoyment as his. If I drank the whole bottle myself, Iwouldn’t get an increase in enjoyment, just more of the same. Sacred values,however, are holistic and cannot be divided. I can’t have half a mysticalexperience, nor can I share it with someone else. It is an essentially private,inner experience, although the meaning of the experience can be shared. This isprecisely what happens in religions, when the meaning of one person’s experience– Christ’s passion, Buddha’s enlightenment – becomes the source of a way of lifefor others.Above the sensual Scheler sees what he calls vital values, levels or degrees oflife. These values inform the community or society we live in. One’s life can benoble, heroic, and self-sacrificing, or it can be base, cowardly, andself-seeking. It can be healthy and vigorous, or sickly and decadent. One can dothe good that one knows, or one can avoid it. One’s relationship with others isinformed by which of these is true. Positive vital values build a strong senseof community and social responsibility, while negative ones undermine our socialand communal bonds. One of Scheler’s concerns was that with the rise ofutilitarian notions of value, which he believed were on the increase in themodern age, ideas of nobility, heroism, and self-sacrifice would lose theirsignificance, and an ethos of self-seeking, in which everyone was out forthemselves, would dominate. As altruism today is increasingly explained in termsof the ‘cunning’ of ‘selfish genes’, we can see that Scheler’s concern waswarranted.Next in Scheler’s hierarchy are intellectual or spiritual values. These arespiritual in the sense of the German Geist, the things of the spirit, or mind.Broadly speaking this is culture. These values are concerned with things thatare goods or ends in themselves, the Platonic goods that inform the variety ofdifferent things that embody them. A landscape, an orchid, and a Rembrandt areall different but they are also all beautiful, and it is the beauty they share,rather than their particular expression of it, that is the concern of this rungon Scheler’s ladder of values. These values are the opposite of utilitarianvalues, in which things are good only insofar as they help me to achieve an end.I do not listen to Bach’s B Minor Mass with any end in view, nor do I appreciatebeautiful scenery because of the potential value of the land. I listen to Bachand enjoy a mountain view because by cultivating my appreciation of them, Ibecome ‘more’, my experience of being increases.We may listen to music in order to relax; indeed, there are numerous collectionsof ‘light classics’ aimed at helping us do precisely that. But this would be autilitarian appropriation of what is really a non-utilitarian, or spiritualgood. One of Scheler’s bêtes noires was precisely the invasion of the culturalworld by the utilitarian sensibility, which promoted the cultivation of the artsand literature, provided they served some purpose, that they helped business insome way, much as meditation and other spiritual practices are today promoted asa means of increasing productivity. And while science, with its emphasis on‘know-how’ and discovering the way in which things work, in order to be able tomanipulate them, is an outgrowth of the lowest level of values, philosophy seeksto know things in themselves, their essences. It is driven by a sense of wonder,not a need to control and use. The value it embodies is again the opposite ofthe utilitarian. Trying to grasp the essence of being will in no way help me tocontrol, manipulate, or in any other way use a particular being. My own being,though, can deepen and become more mysterious to me by doing so. This is anexample of what George Steiner calls pursuing ‘the sovereignly useless’, anexpression of a drive unique to humans: ‘to be interested in something for itsown enigmatic sake,’ which, Steiner argues, ‘may be the best excuse there is forman’.9 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--9]At the top of his hierarchy, Scheler places the sacred, the values of the holy.These values are involved in one’s salvation. They answer questions about theultimate meaning of existence and one’s place in it. Here, the wonder andcuriosity of the spiritual/cultural level give way to feelings of awe andreverence for the source of all being. And whereas at the spiritual/culturallevel one can still maintain a certain detachment, at this highest rung on theladder of values, one is inescapably oneself, that unique personality,encountering the ground of its being. And it is precisely through this encounterthat one is saved.FILL IN THE BLANKSMaslow was not a philosopher, but a psychologist and he spoke not of ametaphysical realm of values, but of human needs, evidence for which he believedhe discovered in the human psyche. He was, in this sense, as empirical as anyscientist, a claim he shared with his fellow psychologist Jung, who alsobelieved he observed characteristics of the human psyche as demonstrably evidentas the behaviour of elementary particles. In Jung’s case, these empiricalpsychological facts were the archetypes of the collective unconscious, theexpression and understanding of which, Jung believed, led to psychologicalmaturity through a process he called ‘individuation’, how we ‘become who weare’. In Maslow’s case, they were what he called our ‘hierarchy of needs’, thesatisfaction of which led to self-actualisation. I won’t explore the connectionshere, but as any reader of Jung and Maslow soon discovers, individuation andself-actualisation are in all essentials practically identical.Maslow believed that human beings have a set of psychological needs, of psychicrequirements, that are as biologically inherent as our need for oxygen. Theyare, Maslow said, ‘instinctoid’, meaning we come supplied with them from thestart. This notion of a kind of psychological blueprint for human beings, a setof innate goals that define what it is to be human, is out of sympathy with thetone of our time, which is more inclined to see nurture – the environment –rather than nature, as the key to human behaviour. This is, in fact, a dogma ofmodern political and social theory. All egalitarian politics is based on thisidea, that at bottom, there is no inherent difference between one person andanother, and any differences that do exist, are the result of outside, externalforces – forces which, of course, man can learn to control and order.Philosophers as different as John Locke (1632–1704) and Jean Paul Sartre argued,in different ways, that man’s inner world is essentially empty, that it is likean unfurnished room, waiting to be filled up with things from Ikea. For Locke,when we are born we are tabula rasa, a blank slate, until our psyches arewritten on by experiences brought to us via the senses. Nothing is in the mind,Locke said, that was not first in the senses. Our inner flat is empty, until oursenses deliver the furniture. For Sartre, as we’ve seen, man has existence butno essence; we are, for him, a kind of hole in things, and the project of humanfreedom – a negative state for Sartre – is the process of filling this hole withour choices. There is no human nature for Sartre, only a human condition. It iswithin human power, however, to change conditions, and we do so through ourchoices. But as Sartre denies any meaning to human existence, these choices areultimately arbitrary. After he gave a rousing speech about human freedom and ourresponsibility to exercise it, Sartre was asked by some students for adviceabout what exactly they should do with their freedom. ‘Whatever you like’ washis reply. Not surprisingly, his students were not quite inspired by this.Maslow disagreed with this ‘empty’ view of ourselves. He agreed with Sartre thatwe are free, but this freedom is not an emptiness. We are not free to make ofourselves whatever we want, forming ourselves out of whole cloth. Nor are weblank slates, waiting for experience to write on us. Although in different waysboth Locke and Sartre champion human freedom, they also contribute to the ideathat man can be made into anything, provided the requisite conditioning isapplied, a doctrine that informed the Behavioural school of psychology. JohnWatson, Behaviourism’s founder, claimed that as it was not susceptible tomeasurement and quantification, consciousness didn’t exist. At least he hadnever seen it, and given this, it should be left out of any scientific accountof human psychology. All we can look to, Watson said, was behaviour, and thisinsight led to seeing human beings as stimulus-response robots, flesh and bloodvending machines which, supplied with the necessary coin (stimulus) wouldprovide the required item (response). Neither Locke nor Sartre desired thisconclusion, but their ‘blank’ vision of human psychology supports itnonetheless.THE HIERARCHY OF NEEDSMaslow disagreed with Sartre and argued that there is indeed a human nature,which we ignore at our peril. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs parallels Scheler’shierarchy of values in some very key respects.10[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--10] One very important observation shared byScheler and Maslow is that ‘higher’ needs or values do not appear until after‘lower’ ones are satisfied. This is not to say that a higher need or valuecannot take precedence over a lower one. This is the essence of any kind ofself-disciple, and is behind the virtue of ‘delayed gratification’. In order topursue the spiritual/cultural value of writing this book, I must put asidesensual values (eating and drinking too much), vital ones (going to a party withfriends) and even other cultural ones (listening to music). If I am starving ordying of thirst, I can’t write at all, but once those values are satisfied, thenthe lure of the higher ones appears, or at least it can. People who remain atthe pleasure level of the hierarchy of values, as well as those whose highestvalues are vital, aimed at social goods, seem inadequate, precisely because theyhave not moved on to a higher value, once the lower one has been achieved.At the bottom of Maslow’s hierarchy are the basic needs for food, drink, andshelter. We all need to eat, we all need to drink, and we all need somewhere tosleep. These are the most primitive needs, shared by practically all livingthings; even plants need a bit of soil in which to grow. Above these needs isthe need for security, for some emotional connection, for love, for some senseof belonging, for family of some kind. A starving man may not care about a roofover his head, but after he has been fed, the desire for some kind of home comesto him. Likewise, a homeless person may believe that all his problems would beover if he could only find a little perch somewhere, a small room he can callhis own. But when that need is met, the desire for company, for a companion,arises, and he looks for someone to share his home.If we meet these needs a new need arises, the need for self-esteem, the need forour worth to be recognised by others, by our friends, or workmates. My love needcan be met by one other person or by a family, but my self-esteem need requiresa larger group. So my workmates, the gang at the pub, the football team I playwith on the weekend: these are the necessary sources of my self-esteem, my senseof worth, and I, in turn, serve the same function for them. Solitary types suchas writers may receive self-esteem at a distance, from their readers and fromreviews of their work (all too rarely, alas) but this is not quite the same asreceiving it from others immediately around you. Sartre believed that most of usget our sense of ourselves, of who we are, from other people. This is oneinsight with which Maslow agreed, at least as it applied to the lower levels ofhis hierarchy.META-NEEDSMaslow saw that the first three levels of his hierarchy were concerned with whathe called ‘deficiency needs’. They are all needs based on something we lack. Ineed food and drink to live. I need shelter for protection and some sense ofphysical security. I need love for emotional security and to avoid loneliness.And I need self-esteem to give me a sense of worth, of identity, and the feelingthat I ‘matter’. And without too much trouble, and allowing for a certainoverlap, we can see how Maslow’s deficiency needs parallel the lower rungs onScheler’s hierarchy of values. The pleasure values seem to equate with Maslow’smost basic needs, for food and drink, and to some degree with the need forshelter and love, or more appropriately, sex. The vital values seem to parallelMaslow’s needs for emotional security and self-esteem. When we reach thespiritual/cultural level of values, the pursuit of things which are ends inthemselves, on Maslow’s hierarchy we pass beyond the deficiency needs and moveinto what Maslow called ‘being needs’, and what I refer to here as ‘meta-needs’.These meta-needs are inherent in each of us and each of us can, potentially atleast, actualise them, just as each of us can pursue the spiritual/culturalvalue of being interested in something for its own sake. And yet, not all of usdo.All of us die if we don’t eat or drink. We are all exposed to the elements andfeel physically insecure if we don’t have a home of some kind. We all feel alack of human warmth if we don’t have someone to love and who loves us. And weall feel insignificant and lack an identity if we do not possess the recognitionof our peers. But not all of us feel that something is missing in our lives ifwe don’t pursue the spiritual/cultural values. In fact, only a small number ofus do. In Maslow’s terms, that small number have passed beyond merely fulfillingtheir deficiency needs, to discovering an entirely different kind of need. Thisisn’t a need based on something we lack, but one that arises from a desire tofocus our energies on something more than satisfying our deficiency needs. Andwhile we can see that the first three rungs of Maslow’s hierarchy all fall underthe umbrella of utility, in which our actions and choices are based on ‘gettingsomething’, this is not true of these being needs. These needs are not aimed atgetting or doing something ‘useful’, something that will help me meet the demandof the lower needs, but at things that are ends in themselves. In fact, meetingthese being or meta-needs often involves saying no to our deficiency needs, justas pursuing spiritual/cultural values often involves postponing those ofpleasure and life.These being needs are essentially creative and are aimed, not at acquiringsomething we don’t have, but at precisely the opposite: at giving something ofourselves. They express an overflow of our own being. It is at this level ofMaslow’s hierarchy that we enter the sphere of self-actualisation, that we beginto become, in his term, ‘fully human’, and hence able to perform tikkun and totake care of the cosmos. While we are primarily occupied with ‘getting andspending’, with fulfilling our collection of wants and desires, we are in somesense ‘less human’ and are concerned solely with taking care of ourselves. Whenwe recognise that animals occupy only the lower rungs of Maslow’s ladder ofneeds – those for sustenance, shelter, and some form of social life (but ofcourse not all animals belong to groups) – we can see what this means. We areonly fully human when we pass beyond these, as the being or meta-needs that lieahead can be pursued only by us, or by beings like us. There is little evidenceto suggest that animals can be interested in something for its own sake, canfeel what George Steiner calls the ‘speculative lust’ for the ‘drug of truth’.11[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--11] What animal is concerned with truth at all? Wespeak of the curiosity of a cat, but this is not the same as the curiosity ofsomeone fascinated with, say, styles of decorative ornamentation in earlyEgyptian pottery, and who will pursue this interest, often to the detriment ofhis ‘creature (animal) comforts’. As far as we know, no animal wonders why itexists. Or, to put it another way, we are the only animals that do, and thatwonder is precisely the threshold between our being only animals and being fullyhuman. Whoever asked the first question about his existence was, by thisreckoning, the first human.This is not to speak ill of animals, but to recognise our difference from them.In our ‘biocentrically correct’ times, this is something we are loath to do, butit is, I believe, necessary so that we can grasp our responsibility to thecosmos. H.G. Wells (1866–1946), who we will return to shortly, made this pointwhen he remarked that, for most of history, human beings have been ‘up againstit’, focussed on fulfilling the demands of Maslow’s lower needs (although ofcourse Wells didn’t use Maslow’s terminology). During most of our existence wehave been occupied with getting enough to eat, a place to live, a mate, and somesense of social rank, even within the primitive, proto-human hordes. But, Wellssays, in recent times – the last few centuries – something new had entered thepicture. A new kind of person had emerged. Wells calls him the ‘originativeintellectual worker’, and with him came new demands, that have nothing to dowith the deficiency needs that had driven human life so far. Now we can asksomeone a question that would have made no sense in earlier times. ‘Yes,’ Wellssays, ‘you earn a living, you support a family, you love and hate, but – what doyou do?’12 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--12] Wells recognised that fulfilling ourdeficiency needs was no longer enough, at least for some of us, who had movedbeyond them into an entirely new territory. He recognised that precisely becauseas a species, we have been so adept at meeting our deficiency needs, we now havea surplus of time and energy to devote to ‘originative intellectual work’, worknot driven by the utilitarian aims that occupied us for millennia. Hence eating,mating, and social bonding were no longer enough to define us as humans. A newkind of human had emerged, one that was pulled toward values rather than pushedby needs.13 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--13]SETTING THE NORMMaslow shared with Scheler his concern with values, but where for Scheler theyexisted in a metaphysical reality, for Maslow they were rooted in our verybiology. Both, however, saw the need for a normative, not relativistic, approachto values, which means that for both values were objectively real and set astandard which we could either meet or fall below – set, that is, a ‘norm’. Forboth there were criteria for deciding how well individuals met those standards,which were as real as anything materialist science could require. ‘The questionof a normative biology cannot be escaped or avoided’, Maslow wrote. ‘Thevalue-free, value-neutral, value-avoiding model of science,’ he said, ‘is quiteunsuitable for the scientific study of life.’14 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--14]Such a ‘value-free’ approach wanted to observe human life as if it were a thing,like an elementary particle or a chemical reaction, an expression of physicallaws and necessities, or, at best, a collection of drives and appetites. But asMaslow, Scheler, and many other thinkers knew, such an approach distorts thevery thing that it wants to study. Humans, Maslow recognised, were not onlyphysical objects, stimulus-response robots, or a set of appetites, but free,creative beings with consciousness, aims, purposes, and the will to pursue them.If you omitted these characteristics or actively negated them – as Behaviourismdid and much of contemporary cognitive science does – then, indeed, you couldstudy people as if they were things, but whatever it was you were doing, it hadlittle to do with human psychology, as you had excised everything human fromyour study. One virtue of this approach, however, is that if you treatedeveryone as if they were a stimulus-response robot or a mere physical object,with no regard for the values, meanings, or purposes that informed their lives,then clearly the question of whether or not someone failed to meet a norm orrose above it, would never arise, as there would be no norm by which to judgethis. (Behaviourism saw people as basically machines, and there are, it is true,machines that work and those that don’t. But machines that don’t work we callbroken, we don’t say they have failed to meet the norm.)After all, we don’t set norms for how electrons should behave or for how ironshould oxidise. We merely observe how these processes take place. Thestimulus-response or object approach could apply equally in all cases, in thatof a sinner or of a saint, in that of a child molester or a philanthropist. Itdidn’t matter whether the person you were studying achieved something of valuewith their life or simply wasted it, as their behaviour, whatever it may be,was, from this perspective, simply the result of the physical forces or stimulusapplied to them. Values, meanings, purposes, aims, were all nice things to thinkabout, lovely stories we told ourselves, but in reality – at least for thisapproach – they were illusions. What was real was that when you did this to aperson, he reacted in that way, and this would be true whether the person inquestion was a genius or an idiot, Mother Teresa or Hitler.What was different about Maslow’s approach to human psychology was that, unlikehis predecessors, Maslow wasn’t interested in what was wrong with human beings,but in what was right with them. He wanted to study psychological health, notsickness. Maslow in fact started out as a Freudian but eventually rejected Freudbecause he grew tired of studying damaged people. It is remarkable but when youthink about it, up until Maslow began his work, practically all ideas abouthuman psychology were based on material derived from psychologically ill people,from neurotics, psychotics, schizophrenics, and other forms of damaged psyches.This is rather as if all our ideas about health were based solely on studyingsickness, and that health itself was defined as the absence of disease. But weall know that some people are healthier – more vital, more alive – than others,even if none of them is suffering from any specific illness. If we applied thesame scheme to business, this would be like saying that if we break even with aninvestment, then we were doing well. But there is no idea of a profit here, onlyof not having a loss, and any business run on these lines would soon seempointless.Maslow grew disgusted with this scenario and decided instead to study healthypeople. What he discovered is that, once people satisfy their lower, deficiencyneeds, they enter areas of human reality that range beyond our standard ideas ofhealth. In fact with Maslow we arrive at a new idea of psychological health, the‘fully human’. Anything that falls below this we can consider as unhealthy, orat least as seriously lacking in some essential nutrients.EUPSYCHIAOne question that profoundly troubled Maslow in his last years was that of ‘thegood society’, another concern that he shared with Scheler, who devoted a greatdeal of his energy to the problems of sociology. Maslow’s writings on the peakexperience have led some critics to see him as concerned solely with theindividual. Indeed, the notion of self-actualisation seems to suggest this, andMaslow’s work has been seen by some critics as an expression of a negative sideof the ‘human potential movement’, as a hedonistic focus on the development ofthe self at the expense of others. A similar criticism has been made againstJung’s concept of individuation. Martin Buber famously remarked that Jung wasinterested in an ‘I-Me’ relationship, not an ‘I-Thou’. Maslow and Jung wereconcerned with the problems of society, yet both recognised that a society isonly as good as the people within it.15 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--15]Political movements aimed at changing the social structure would fail, they bothsaw, if the people within society did not change, that is, develop themselves.Yet both saw that self-actualisation and individuation can be severely hamperedby a society that placed no value on these efforts. ‘The actualisation of thehighest human potentials is possible,’ Maslow wrote, ‘only under “goodconditions”. Good human beings will generally need a good society in which togrow.’16 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--16]Although both Maslow and Jung recognised that self-actualisation andindividuation can take place under adverse conditions – indeed, in some casesadverse conditions positively foster it – both also recognised that thesituation the world faced required more individuated and self-actualised peoplethan the ‘natural method’ –for sake of a better term – could produce. In hislast years Maslow devoted himself to the question of how best the process couldbe helped along.‘The good society,’ Maslow wrote, ‘is defined as ‘that society … which fostersthe fullest development of human potentials, the fullest degree of humanness.’17[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--17] If it is fair to equate being ‘fully human’with embracing the responsibilities that come with this, those of tikkun and of‘taking care of the cosmos’, then the good society will be one in which thevalues associated with these obligations will be promoted.Clearly the society in which most of us live now does not. We live in a societythat, for the most part, promotes exactly the opposite. We live in a societythat promotes not the ‘fully human,’ but the ‘only human’. Society as it is, our‘life world’ as it is does not foster what is necessary for us in order toachieve our full humanity. This is clear. We are working at a handicap. Associety and the world are, from the evolutionary point of view, still ‘works inprogress’, this is understandable, and can only be expected in a ‘worst possibleworld in which there is yet hope’. Nevertheless, it is still a problem. Maslowrecognised this, and, like other social visionaries, he speculated on what asociety that did foster our full humanity would be like. He called such acommunity Eupsychia, a coinage of Maslow’s meaning ‘the good psyche’ or ‘thegood soul’.If, as Maslow believed, ‘the Good Person can equally be called the self-evolvingperson, the responsible … fully human, self-actualising person’, then the goodsociety would also be informed with these values. The two go hand in hand; afeedback operates between them. Each needs the other. Maslow agreed with JulianHuxley that humanity had reached the point where it was responsible for its ownevolution. ‘We have become self-evolvers,’ he wrote. ‘Evolution means selectionand therefore choosing and deciding, and this means valuing’18[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--18] A self-evolving society will have to emphasisethose values that promote its evolution. Maslow’s Eupsychia is a place wherethat happens. Maslow’s ideas led to important innovations in the workplace, asexpressed in his classic work Eupsychian Management (1965).19[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--19] His ideas about a ‘eupsychian society’ and onthe anthropologist Ruth Benedict’s notion of ‘synergy’ can be found in theposthumous collection of essays The Farther Reaches of Human Nature (1971).Anyone who reads these will find little to fault Maslow with, and it isdifficult to disagree with him, that a society based on these lines would bepreferable to one that ignored them.Yet, although Maslow said that ‘by Good Society I mean ultimately one species,one world’, he also recognised that such a society would, at least in itsbeginning, be a ‘subculture’. It would, at the start, be made up of ‘onlypsychologically healthy or mature or self-actualising people and theirfamilies’.20 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--20] This suggests that, after all,some of us can self-actualise, can become ‘fully human’, outside of a eupsychiansociety, otherwise where would these people come from? (Maslow himself grew upunder very difficult conditions.21 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--21]) This is atension that runs through Maslow’s late work: whether, given the properconditions, society as a whole can self-actualise, or whether there is aninherent distinction between self-actualisers and those who do not reach thelevel of being needs. Why is it, Maslow asked, that more people do notself-actualise, do not pursue being needs, when their deficiency needs are met?Is it because of the way society is structured, or is it because of someinherent difference in people?OR UTOPIA?Earlier I remarked that H.G. Wells believed that in modern times, a differentkind of person was emerging, one not satisfied with the occupations that hadpreviously constituted human life. But Wells too was troubled by the question ofwhether this was a sign of a general development in humanity, or the branchingout of a new kind of human, a new species even.22[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--22] In a late science-fiction novel, Star Begotten(1937), Wells even suggests that Martians are bombarding the earth with cosmicrays, in order to alter human evolution.23 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--23]Wells himself was a firm believer in social progress and the possibility ofimproving humanity by creating a better society, and like Maslow, he envisionedhis own kind of Utopia. After achieving fame with his early science fictionnovels, The Time Machine (1895) and The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), whichpresent a curiously pessimistic view of mankind, Wells spent the rest of hiscareer envisioning ways in which society and mankind could be improved.Practically everything he wrote in the twentieth century dealt with thisquestion, but the essence of Wells’ vision can be found in his first ‘futuresociety’ work, A Modern Utopia (1905).In A Modern Utopia Wells develops an idea that will obsess him for the rest ofhis life, that of the World State. It is a global government that has jettisonedall the petty squabbling that characterised politics in Wells’ day, as in ourown. The world is run by intelligent, efficient men, who are dedicated topromoting the common good. Nationalism and its wars are a thing of the past. Thecompetition bred by capitalism is abolished, and a scientific socialism is thenorm. Under the World State, men and women enjoy equality. The taboos of theVictorian Age – mostly those concerning sex – have disappeared. Hunger isunknown, poverty a memory. The cramped, filthy cities of nineteenth centuryEngland are replaced with gleaming spacious metropolises. Sickness has beenpractically eliminated and old age is no burden. Culture, education, sport areavailable to all. The practical, rational mind, no longer encumbered by therestraints of custom and tradition, has got to work and created a heaven onearth. Everyone is happy.Yet, some of Wells remarks about his Utopia have a chilling ring to contemporaryears. He speaks of a future ‘migratory population’ and of a globalisation inwhich ‘all local establishments, all definitions of place’ were ‘even nowmelting under our eyes’. ‘Presently’, Wells tells us, ‘all the world will beawash with anonymous strange men’.24 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--24] Ourcurrent obsession with security and identification is foreshadowed in Wells’belief that in the future World State ‘there is every reason for assuming itpossible that each human being could be given a distinct formula, a number or‘scientific name’, under which he or she could be docketed’.25[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--25] Wells’ Utopia is a world, much like ours, under‘constant surveillance’, through ‘organised clairvoyance’ producing an‘incessant stream of information’ about its citizens.26[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--26]All of these developments are aimed at providing a ‘universal security’ and ateliminating what Wells saw as a ‘cruel and wasteful wilderness of muddle’.27[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--27] It is this ‘muddle’ that Wells and other socialreformers in the early twentieth century saw as the greatest obstacle toimproving human life, and their answer to it was to apply the scientific method,so successful in other realms, to life itself. We can say that our own world,informed as it is by science as the sole arbiter of truth, is a result of thatbelief. But not everyone was taken with Wells’ vision, and for all its tidiness,reasonableness, and efficiency many readers today find it cold and unappealing.Even in Wells’ day, intellects as reasonable as his own found fault with it.Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World (1932), with George Orwell’s 1984 (1949) themost well known dystopian work, is a satire on Wells’ vision of a future WorldState.An even earlier attack on the idea of a hyper-rational, scientific stateappeared in 1907, the short story ‘The Republic of the Southern Cross’, by theRussian symbolist novelist and poet Valery Bryusov (1873–1924). Star City is amodern ‘rational state’ situated at the South Pole. 28[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--28] It is a perfect community. Everyone is happy,healthy, well-off, and in perfect harmony with each other. There is no envy orcompetition among its citizens. All live in exactly the same modern homes andwear the same modern dress. In Maslow’s and Scheler’s terms, their deficiencyneeds are all satisfied and their pleasure and vital values are allaccommodated. Everything moves like clockwork and there is no muddle. But then astrange malady breaks out, a ‘contradiction sickness’. People suddenly doexactly the opposite of what they intend. Madness quickly ensues, and thescientific city goes up in flames.Most likely Bryusov did not know of Wells’ A Modern Utopia but he would not haveneeded to in order to produce this chilling parable of the dangers of applyingthe gospel of science to life. Bryusov’s story is a long gloss on Dostoyevsky’sdictum in Notes From Underground (1864), that if all of life could be arrangedlogically and rationally, a man would go insane on purpose, just to prove he wasfree. It seems that destruction, chaos, and death are preferable, even in themost perfect state, if through them we can feel we are free.STRANGERS IN A STRANGE LANDWorking out a blueprint for an actual Eupsychia, then, may not be the best wayto approach the question of becoming ‘fully human’. Huxley made his own attemptat a Utopia in his last novel, Island (1962), a kind of reverse image of BraveNew World. It is not particularly successful, either as a novel or as a socialtract, although its advocacy of psychedelic drugs (‘moksha medicine’) as a meansof self-development has endeared it to the counter-culture. Huxley’s island Palahas everything a Eupsychia would want. The inhabitants meditate, enjoy guiltfree love, are non-violent, non-competitive, are spiritual and free of neuroses.Yet there is ultimately something unsatisfying about it, as there is about allUtopias. And while going insane on purpose in order to show you are free is nota viable alternative, there is something in Dostoyevsky’s rhetoric that suggestswhat is lacking.The philosopher and psychologist William James (1842–1910), put his finger on itin his essay ‘What Makes a Life Significant’ (1899). James talks of a week hespent at the Assembly Grounds on Chautauqua Lake, a religious and adulteducation centre in upstate New York, established in 1874. James speaks of the‘sobriety and industry, intelligence and goodness, orderliness and ideality,prosperity and cheerfulness’ that ‘pervade the air.’ He called it ‘a serious andstudious picnic on a gigantic scale … equipped with means for satisfying all thenecessary lower and most of the superfluous higher wants of man.’ ‘You haveculture, you have kindness…you have equality, you have the best fruits of whatmankind has fought and bled and striven for under the name of civilisation forcenturies. You have, in short, a foretaste of what human society might be, wereit all in the light, with no suffering and no dark corners.’Yet there was a problem. ‘Ouf! what a relief!’ James found himself saying onleaving this idyllic setting. ‘Now for something primordial and savage … to setthe balance straight again.’ ‘This order is too tame,’ James wrote, ‘thisculture too second-rate, this goodness too uninspiring. This human drama withouta villain or a pang … this atrocious harmlessness of all things – I cannot abidewith them. Let me take my chances again in the big outside worldly wildernesswith all its sins and sufferings. There are the heights and depths, theprecipices and the steep ideals, the gleams of the awful and the infinite; andthere is more hope and help a thousand times than in this dead level andquintessence of every mediocrity.’29 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--29]What was wrong with this Utopia, James realised, was that it lacked ‘the elementthat gives to the wicked outer world all its moral style’. What was missing wasa sense of ‘the everlasting battle of the powers of light with those ofdarkness.’ It lacked the ‘heroism’ which, ‘reduced to its bare chance’ snatched‘victory from the jaws of death’. ‘In this unspeakable Chautauqua there was nopotent-iality of death in sight anywhere, and no point of the compass visiblefrom which danger might possibly appear. The ideal was so completely victoriousalready that no sign of any previous battle remained, the place just resting onits oars. But what our human emotions seem to require is the sight of thestruggle going on.’30 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--30]In other words, James recognised, as did Rabbi Steinsaltz, that ‘what makes alife significant’ is the sense of challenge offered by the ‘worst possible worldin which there is yet hope’. Utopia is bland, but the struggle for it isinvigorating. In the best of all possible worlds we would achieve nothing, aninsight that those focussed on their deficiency needs and on the pleasurable andvital values find incomprehensible. The philosopher Johann Fichte (1762–1814)expressed this in his saying that: ‘To be free is nothing. To become free isheavenly’. We require a challenge in order to get the best out of us, somethingJames recognised in his essay ‘The Moral Equivalent of War’ (1906), and whichNietzsche expressed in his aphorism that: ‘It is the good war that hallows everycause.’ James and Nietzsche weren’t militarists, nor did they mean to celebratebloodshed and carnage. They recognised that struggle, resistance, effort, werekeys to unlock our vital energies. Wells’ Utopia, James’ Chautauqua, Huxley’sPala, even Maslow’s Eupsychia, may embody the values and aims we want toachieve, but without the actual fight for these, they seem unworthy of ourregard.It may be the case then, that in order to become ‘fully human’, in order toperform tikkun and take care of the universe, we may need to remain in thisprofoundly muddled world, a world in which we are not entirely at home, a worldin which we are strangers suffering from a sometimes painful homesickness, aworld that resists, at practically every turn, our efforts to transform it. Butthis doesn’t mean that we should stop making our efforts. As Victor Frankldiscovered (see Chapter 3), meaning can be drawn out of the worst possibleconditions. If Frankl could find a reason to go on living and to help othersfind meaning in the midst of an Auschwitz and Dachau, we can easily find meaningand opportunities to perform tikkun in our everyday lives. We do not need thegood society to be there, waiting for us, in order to become good, that is,responsible, people. And perhaps it is only by our being so that, at some point,the good society will arise.ACTUALISATION ENVYI mention above that in his last years, Maslow was concerned with the questionof why some people self-actualise, reach the level of being needs, while othersdon’t. In other words, in Maslow’s uncomfortable phrase, why are ‘some peopleare more “human” than others’, more ‘fully human’, that is? In an unpublishedpaper, Maslow voiced his concerns about what might happen when the distinctionbetween actualisers and non-actualisers became apparent.31[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--31] As Maslow believed that at bottom our capacityfor self-actualisation was ‘instinctoid’, then the difference betweenactualisers and non-actualisers was ‘natural’ and not a question of society orthe environment, a view of things that runs against our contemporary thinking.32[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--32] Maslow was concerned that ‘when there is nolonger social injustice to serve as an excuse for one’s own biologicalinadequacies … there might well be a great increase [of] malicious envy of thosewho are more successful in their achievements.’ (Scheler voiced a similarconcern regarding his concept of ressentiment.) Thinking of ways to ‘protect thebiologically gifted from the almost inevitable malice of the biologicallynon-gifted’, Maslow suggested something like a new ‘priestly class to which isgiven less monetary reward and fewer privileges and luxuries than the averagemembers of the overall population,’ given that self-actualisers are lessinterested in material rewards than in the ‘metagratifications’ or ‘intrinsicvalues’ of ‘advancing beauty, excellence, justice, or truth’.In Maslow’s fantasy, non-actualisers, then, would enjoy the fulfilment of theirdeficiency needs without limit, their pleasure and vital values would be metcompletely, while actualisers would be left to pursue their being needs andspiritual-cultural values unhindered. There is no sense in which someone’s‘being needs’ would be deprived. There is no group that ‘gets to do this’ whileothers don’t. No one decides who should actualise and who should not. No one iskept from actualising those needs should they appear. The idea ofnon-actualisers demanding their ‘actualisation rights’ would be ludicrous, asthat would mean, say, that someone with no interest in philosophy would demandthe right to spend his time reading Plato. What Maslow wants to protect in hisfantasy, are the rights of those who do want to read Plato, their right to doso, without being subject to the possible scorn of those that don’t.33[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--33]Maslow uses difficult language for us, and even speaks of a ‘biological élite’,a term that smacks of dark connotations, of eugenics and breeding. But he isreally only speaking of recognising something that is happening anyway, in‘nature’, and of possible ways of avoiding social friction. The term élite,however, disturbs us. But Maslow’s élite are not interested in profiting fromtheir distinctions. As mentioned earlier, self-actualisers, the ‘fully human’,are not interested in expressing their actualisation, their ‘full humanness’,through dominating others. They are too busy exploring their being-needs, theirspiritual-cultural values, and in any case, any gesture of domination would, bydefinition, be one of deficiency, of being ‘less human’. Maslow had no interestin establishing an ‘us and them’ scenario, and if Wells is right, and a new kindof person has appeared in the last few centuries, driven by ‘creative’ needs,then perhaps there are more self-actualisers than Maslow thought.Wells himself, though, recognised the need for a kind of élite to manage thingsin his modern Utopia. He called them the Samurai. Scheler, who devoted a greatdeal of thought to the possibility of a society run along spiritual-culturallines, also believed that it would naturally produce a small group of leaders,who would set the values and guidelines for the rest. Colin Wilson writes of the‘outsiders’, men and women driven by deep spiritual needs who, ignored for themost part by society – if not actually opposed by it – nevertheless producevalues and creative energies that push society to evolve. In one of his lastbooks, Two Sources of Morality and Religion (1935), Bergson spoke of a ‘creativeminority’ whose breakthroughs into new areas of insight and inspiration guidesociety, an idea adopted by the historian Arnold Toynbee in his monumental AStudy of History (1934–1961).THE CREATIVE MINORITYOur egalitarian sensibilities find these notions dubious, but that is no realargument against them. And in any case, our egalitarian world is full of élites,of celebrities, sports figures, millionaires, the people whose lives we envy andwant to enjoy and who we read about in tabloids and gossip magazines. And again,we have to recognise that the creative individuals Maslow, Scheler and theothers speak of are not interested in other people, and certainly not indominating them. This is in fact something that sets them apart. One of thecharacteristics of self-actualisers, Maslow discovered, is that they prefersolitude to gregariousness, and most times prefer their own company to that ofothers. Not out of a dislike for people, a haughty misanthropy, the kind ofanti-human sentiment that informs Lovecraft’s work. But because their owninterests, their being needs, can only be pursued on their own, not in a crowd.They feel more at home in their inner world than in the social one around them.Their dominance is expressed in their creativity, not in lording it over others,and those who need others in order to express their dominance – pop stars,celebrities, politicians, gurus – are, in fact, altogether less dominant,because they collapse without that explicit validation. In The Nature ofSympathy (1922), his work on what binds us together in a community, Schelerwrote that: ‘Gregariousness in animals represents an advance toward the humanlevel, whereas man becomes more of an animal by associating himself with thecrowd, and more of a man by cultivating his spiritual independence’.34[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--34] The more human we are, the less we need otherpeople. There is no such thing as a self-actualising dictator, as by definitiona dictator requires other people, lots of them. This is in line with passingbeyond the sphere of vital or life values and entering the spiritual-culturalone. It is also in line with reaching Maslow’s being needs.I do believe there is a creative minority at work today, trying to become ‘fullyhuman’, looking for ways to repair the universe, and trying to do the good thatthey know. But they are a silent minority. Berdyaev, pre-echoing Kazantzakis,says that ‘the way to all creativity lies through readiness to sacrifice’.35[part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--35] ‘The move to creativeness in the social orderis possible,’ he wrote’ only by sacrificing security and guaranteed well-being’,that is, the pleasure and vital values, the anxiety over deficiency needs. ‘Thisreadiness to sacrifice’, Berdyaev said, ‘has nothing in common with anarchy,with chaos’ – it is not the destruction of the social order – but ‘is alwayscosmic in character’. Such a creative society, Berdyaev believed, is‘subterranean’.36 [part0009.xhtml#rw-num-note--36] Its members work below thesurface and do not draw a lot of attention to themselves. Years ago Wells spokeof what he called the Open Conspiracy. It is something along these lines that Ihave in mind.I agree with Berdyaev and I think Maslow’s ideas bear him out. I think thatsociety as a whole has reached the level of Maslow’s self-esteem needs, at leastin the affluent west, where most people are well-fed and housed. My evidence forthis is the global popularity of social networks. These online communities makemanifest Andy Warhol’s oft-quoted remark that ‘in the future everyone will beworld famous for fifteen minutes’. These, and other developments, such as‘reality TV’, in which ‘real’ people are the celebrities, suggest to me that ourself-esteem need is being satisfied at a planetary level. We post photographs,remarks, quotations, and videos online that, in the past, we could share onlywith our immediate friends. Now they reach around the world almostinstantaneously. A video of someone talking to his dog can go ‘viral’ andcommand world wide attention. People just like us are the focus of millions ofother people’s attention on programs such as Big Brother (again, Wells’‘constant surveillance’, through ‘organised clairvoyance’ producing an‘incessant stream of information’ about his World State’s citizens). We arestars. We are somebody. We matter. It is no secret that many people spend muchtime and effort coming up with gimmicks that will get the online world’sattention. We can have hundreds, even thousands, of close friends, with whom wecan share practically everything about our lives, and so receive instantvalidation for ourselves. I think that with these shifts in our social world,our self-esteem needs and the vital, life values, have reached a kind of apex.We are all somebody now, and everybody knows it.My silent minority, the members of Berdyaev’s subterranean creative society,have moved past this level and have entered that of the being needs and thespiritual-cultural values. They no longer need their self-esteem topped uprepeatedly, nor to feel connected to others constantly. They do not telleveryone about the good they did recently, or about what bit of the cosmos theyare going to repair. They do not occupy Wall Street or anywhere else, but theirminds. They might not know of each other, but that doesn’t matter. There’s workto do, and they do it.4. THE GOOD SOCIETY1 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--1] Max Scheler Problems of a Sociology ofKnowledge (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1980) p. 26.2 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--2] See Peter Viereck’s Metapolitics: The Roots ofthe Nazi Mind (Piscataway, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2003).3 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--3] Scheler, 1980 p. 26.4 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--4] For example, see A Secret History ofConsciousness in which I examine the similarities between the ‘consciousnessstructures’ of Jean Gebser and the ‘spiritual ages’ of Rudolf Steiner.5 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--5]I should point out that by a ‘directperception’ of another’s mind neither I nor Scheler mean that we have a directperception of the contents of that mind. Our perception is of that mind itself,that is to say, we are aware that others have minds, inner worlds, just as wedo. But we are not directly aware of what that mind is thinking, feeling, orperceiving. Which is not to say that we cannot be. I believe telepathy ispossible, and I think Scheler would think so too. But he did argue for an areaof ‘absolute privacy’, an Intimsphäre ‘impenetrable to other people’s scrutiny’.(Spiegelberg p. 262).6 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--6] In Tintern Abbey Wordsworth writes of a ‘joyof elevated thoughts; a sense sublime/Of something far more deeplyinterfused/Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns’.7 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--7] Max Scheler, The Nature of Sympathy (London:Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979) p. xv.8 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--8] Ibid.9 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--9] George Steiner, Has Truth a Future? (London:BBC, 1978) pp. 16–17.10 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--10] Maslow also agreed with Scheler on thecognitive power of love. In his clinical research, Maslow discovered that‘loving perception … produced kinds of knowledge that were not available tonon-lovers.’ It produces ‘interest and even fascination, and therefore greatpatience and long hours of observation’, which reminds us of McGilchrist’s‘patient and detailed attention to the world’. ‘If we love or are fascinated orare profoundly interested, we are less tempted to interfere, to control, tochange, to improve … ‘We can see whatever we are observing ‘more truly as it isin its own nature rather than as we would like it to be … ‘Maslow called thisapproach ‘Taoist objectivity’. (Abraham Maslow The Farther Reaches of HumanNature, New York: Penguin Books, 1976, pp. 16–17.) All of this seems pretty muchin line with Scheler’s ideas about phenomenological love (Chapter Three).11 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--11] Steiner 1978, p. 3.12 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--12] H.G. Wells, Experiment in Autobiography(London: Gollancz, 1934) p.16.13 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--13] Even this contrast is not quite right, as‘pulled’ still has an element of passivity, as an iron filing is ‘pulled’ by amagnet. The idea is that rather than being driven by forces acting upon us andreacting to them out of sheer necessity, this new arrangement is one in which wefreely choose to pursue a goal that has nothing to do with the demands ofnecessity.14 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--14] Maslow 1976, p. 5.15 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--15] See C.G.

See Edward Hoffman The RightTo Be Human: A Biography of Abraham Maslow (New York: Tarcher, 1988).22 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--22] Wells, of course, was not alone in this. InTertium Organum (1912) P.D. Ouspensky suggested that a new type of person wasemerging, one focussed on precisely the kinds of values that Maslow and Schelerspeak of. This notion was also echoed by Hermann Hesse in his novel Demian(1919). In Cosmic Consciousness (1901) the psychologist R.M. Bucke argued thathumanity was evolving into a higher, wider form of consciousness, an ideainforming A. R. Orage’s Consciousness: Animal, Human, Superman (1904). Nietzscheof course spoke of the Übermensch. It is not an idea widely accepted today.23 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--23] Wells had explored this theme in earlierworks such as The Food of the Gods (1904) and In the Days of the Comet (1906).24 [part0009.xhtml#rw-ref-note--24] H.G.

BEYOND NATURE [part0001.xhtml]If the idea of ‘taking care of the cosmos’ or ‘repairing the universe’ elicits aresponse in people at all, their first thought will more than likely be ofnature. What is in more need of care or repair then the planet that we haveripped, torn, and dug into for millennia? What else can we save but it? The ideathat nature is at risk, has been abused, and needs our help has been a part ofmodern consciousness for at least half a century now. We can mark thepublication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of a wide,popular awareness of our ecological and environmental responsibility, aresponsibility that more and more people are willing to embrace. That can onlybe for the good, and only a fool could fail to recognise the immense debt we oweour long suffering Mother Earth. Yet, if our sensitivity to questions aboutsociety, egalitarianism, and élites makes asking certain questions and voicingcertain concerns about the ‘fully human’ uncomfortable and risky, oursensitivity to nature makes expressing certain ideas and thoughts about ourrelation to the natural world even more difficult.We are often self-righteous and defensive when it comes to questions about anypossible ‘natural’ differences between people, differences, that is, that cannotbe accounted for in terms of environment, society, class, privilege, or othercontrollable artificial factors. But paradoxically we are even more sensitive toany comments that question the primacy and importance of nature and ‘thenatural’. It is extremely difficult, in our anti-human times, to voice anyreservations about our celebration of nature and our need to ‘get back’ to it,without them being taken the wrong way. If, as I mention in Chapter 3, sex inour time is an unquestioned good – perhaps the sole unquestioned good – naturehas in many ways been adopted as an almost universally unquestioned noble cause,as well as a cure for most, if not all of our ills.We have lost touch with nature. We have savaged it. We have fallen out ofharmony with it. We have ignored it. We have acted selfishly toward it. We havedespoiled it, we have raped it, and we have, in many instances, even destroyedit. We want more and more nature back in our lives, and human interference insuch things as food (GM) is seen as almost axiomatically aberrant. Nature, formany of us, is seen as all good and the source of all good, while humaninterference with the natural world is seen as almost always bad. Documentariesabout nature, television shows about animals ‘in the wild’, communicate howvital our link to the natural world is, and how we need to find our place withinthe harmonious nature of things, and how we are, after all, only animals, andlike them, just a part of nature. Nature is our friend, and we should do moreand more to be at home with it. At this point I am not asking whether this briefrundown of our ideas about nature is true or not, merely characterising whatstrikes me as a dominant sensibility of our time.How much this celebration and valorisation of nature is born of an accurateunderstanding of it and how much is rooted in our current antipathy to the humanis debatable. We trust nature where we do not trust the human, and in many,perhaps most instances, that trust is justified. Human beings make mistakeswhile nature does not. Poisonous insects and hurricanes are not mistakes; theyare merely parts of nature that do not agree with us. They are natural, as aretsunamis and earthquakes. I mention these somewhat clichéd examples of a lessnice and harmonious nature not in order to argue against nature – that would beas pointless as arguing against clouds – but in order to show that our wholesaleembrace of the natural is actually rather selective. ‘Nature’ is not amonolithic, homogenous something we encounter when we leave the city and head tothe country, but is in many ways a product of our interpretations – as is, infact, practically everything.By this, of course, I do not mean that trees, hills, oceans, stars, algae,nightingales, and other forms of nature do not exist in themselves. But whatthese natural things mean to us depends on our relationship to them, how weunderstand them, our attitude toward them, and the kind of consciousness webring to them. As Iain McGilchrist says, and as I’ve already quoted, ‘the kindof attention we bring to bear on the world changes the nature of the world weattend to’.1 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--1] (Or, as Blake said withcharacteristic clarity: ‘The Sun’s light, When he unfolds it/Depends on theOrgan that beholds it.’) With McGilchrist I believe that ‘there is somethingthat exists apart from ourselves’ – a statement that in one sense seemsunassailably obvious, yet, for the reflective mind is not as easy to prove as itmay seem – ‘but that we play a vital part in bringing it into being’.2[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--2] In this sense there is more than one nature. Wethink it ‘unnatural’ if we modify grains genetically, but we would think it‘only natural’ to want to come up with a means of modifying tidal waves or mudslides so that they would be less dangerous. In one case, pure, untouched,pristine nature is a good, whereas in the other it is not. This is not to saythat nature is bad because of earthquakes and tsunamis – nature is neither goodnor bad, only human beings are – merely that much of our appreciation of natureand our often unthinking championing of it may be born of a kind of sentimentalidea of it, a kitsch version in which those parts that are pleasant andagreeable are emphasised and the less salubrious portions ignored. In many waysthe nature that we enjoy and look to as a panacea of our ills is a nature thatfits in with our human needs and purposes. Although many of us want to get backto nature, the nature we get back to is unavoidably human.THE DISCOVERY OF NATUREWe can even say that the nature we want to get back to is an almost purely humancreation. It is a relatively recent invention, a product, we can say, of theevolution of consciousness. For most of human existence, nature was an unwieldy,difficult and uncertain taskmaster, demanding constant effort with littlereturn. Nature then was tree stumps, boulders, barren soil, locusts, and floods,much more then it was beautiful meadows and entrancing forests. As we saw in thelast chapter, H.G. Wells pointed out that for most of history, human beings havebeen ‘up against it’, and what they have been up against is nature. And althoughnature is a theme in the poetry of earlier times – in Virgil’s Georgics (29 BC),for example, whose theme is agriculture – there was not the kind of love ofnature and disinterested contemplation of it that we associate with our ownconceptions of it. This view of nature began in earnest little more than twocenturies ago, although its roots in the evolution of consciousness reach backsome centuries earlier. We can say that the origins of our modern appreciationof nature go back to 26 April 1336, when the Italian poet Francesco Petrarca(1304–1374), better known as Petrarch, made his famous ascent of Mount Ventouxin France. This event has gone down in history as the first time someone climbeda mountain solely to see the view. Clearly people had scaled heights before, butPetrarch claimed he was the first to do so solely out of curiosity, for what wemight call aesthetic reasons. He recounted his excursion in one of the lettersmaking up his Epistolae familiares (1350), and I write about it at lengthelsewhere.3 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--3]Many thinkers have commented on the significance of Petrarch’s ascent. For thenineteenth century German historian of culture Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897), itwas in Petrarch that nature’s ‘significance … for a receptive spirit is fullyand clearly displayed’, and because of this he was ‘one of the first trulymodern men’. Burckhardt’s choice of words in describing the importance ofPetrarch’s ascent links it to the Sehnsucht that would trouble the poets of alater time. Burckhardt saw in Petrarch ‘an indefinable longing for a distantpanorama’ that ‘grew stronger and stronger in him’ and was the centralmotivation for his excursion.4 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] Ernst Cassirersaw in Petrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux ‘testimony to [the] decisive change inthe concept of nature that began in the thirteen century’ and which led tonature becoming a ‘a new means of expression’ for human consciousness, as wellas to a ‘desire to immediately contemplate nature’.5[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--5] More recently, the late archetypal psychologistJames Hillman (1926–2011) saw in Petrarch ‘the complexity and mystery of theman-psyche relationship’, in which we may ‘turn outward to the mountains andplains and seas or inward to images corresponding with these’. For Hillman,Petrarch is both the ‘discoverer’ of nature and of the reality of the innerworld as well.6 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--6]Whatever the philosophical significance of Petrarch’s ascent, it presaged ourcontemporary delight in mountain landscapes, in hiking, and in trekking out toinhospitable and almost inaccessible locations.It took some time, however, for the practice of seeking out vistas and scenicviews to catch on, and even as recently as the late eighteenth century, natureas we understand it, as an object of aesthetic contemplation, did not reallyexist. In 1773, Dr Samuel Johnson (1709–1784), made his celebrated journey toScotland, chronicled in A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland (1775). Inhis account, Johnson often complains about the numerous lakes and mountains hiscarriage had to circumvent. He said they made the journey tedious and long.Johnson was adamantly urban – famously he said that ‘when a man is tired ofLondon, he is tired of life’ – and he admits that his reason for taking his tripwas to see ‘the wild’, the same reason we give for our weekend campingadventures. But for Johnson it was a one-off and he returned chastened andsomewhat disappointed. We belonged in civilisation, Johnson believed, not thewilderness, and the proper study of mankind, as Johnson’s contemporary AlexanderPope declared, was man, not the wastes. A beautiful garden in that time was awell sculpted topiary.THE ROMANTICSToday people spend a great deal of time, money, and effort going out of theirway to get to precisely the kinds of ‘nature spots’ that a few centuries ago DrJohnson and practically everyone else would have assiduously avoided. WhenPetrarch informed an old shepherd about his intention to climb Mount Ventoux,the shepherd warned him not to, saying the idea was mad, even demonic, and wouldonly bring disaster. ‘Nature’ as we know it, then, has a history. If we want togive a date for its debut, we can say that the nature that we know and love andwhich we make great efforts to embrace first arrived in 1798 with thepublication of the Lyrical Ballads by the poets William Wordsworth and SamuelTaylor Coleridge. Wordsworth and Coleridge’s seminal collection introduced theRomantic sensibility to English speaking readers, and it is no exaggeration tosay, as the literary philosopher Owen Barfield (1898–1997) has, that the holidayindustry, which offers trips to mountains, forests, deserts, and otheruncivilised places, owes a great deal to the shift in human consciousnessexemplified in their work. If you ever doubted the ability of the imagination tochange the world, take a look at Thomas Cook and the Lonely Planet Guide, thenthink of Wordsworth’s ‘one impulse from a vernal wood’.7[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--7]Of course earlier voices celebrated the virtues of nature. In his Discourse onInequality (1754), the Swiss novelist and social philosopher Jean JacquesRousseau (1712–1778) argued that civilisation was the cause of man’s woes; inhis ‘natural’ state, man was good, Rousseau believed, and he became evil onlythrough the influence of decadent society. Rousseau’s ideas spread the myth ofthe ‘noble savage’ – although Rousseau himself never used the term – which isstill popular today, as can be seen in our romantic conceptions about‘indigenous peoples’ untouched by modernity’s evils. (These tell us, I think,more about our own guilty conscience than the reality of these people’s lives.)And Goethe more or less started the Romantic movement with his novel ofunrequited love and suicide, The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774), whose troubledhero is given to sudden fits of ecstasy in the face of the nature that DrJohnson found tedious.In 1796, two years before Wordsworth and Coleridge’s Lyrical Ballads, MaryWollstonecraft (1759–1797), author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman(1792), published a travel book, Letters Written During a Short Residence inSweden, Norway, and Denmark, in which she anticipates the kind of contemplativedelight in nature that Wordsworth and Coleridge would make widely popular.Contemplating the rugged scenery of the northern lands, she speaks of ‘thatspontaneous pleasure which gives credibility to our expectations of happiness’and saw that ‘the sublime often gave place imperceptibly to the beautiful,dilating the emotions which were painfully concentrated’.8[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--8] The ‘sublime’ as contrasted with the beautiful –the terror and awe we feel in the face of something overwhelming – was firstcontemplated by Longinus in On the Sublime (1 AD), and in Wollstonecraft’s dayhad become a popular theme through Edmund Burke’s influential essay APhilosophical Enquiry into the Origins of our Ideas About the Sublime (1756).Where classical beauty was clear and distinct, and its effects generallyagreeable, the sublime partook of the mysterious, the alien, and the weird, andit could terrify; hence its attraction to the Romantics, and to moderns like thepoet Rilke for whom ‘beauty is nothing but the beginning of a terror, which weare still just able to endure’.9 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--9] For Burke andhis readers, the ‘sublime’ was perceived in mountains, thunderstorms, and othermanifestations of wild nature. On approaching the Swedish coast, Wollstonecraftsaw ‘that the sunbeams that played on the ocean, scarcely ruffled by thelightest breeze, contrasted with the huge dark rocks, that looked like the rudematerials of creation, forming the barrier of unwrought space’. ‘This view ofthe wild coast’ – Scandinavia was considered more or less terra incognita then –‘afforded me continual subject for meditation’ a remark that Dr Johnson may wellhave snorted at.10 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--10]NEW OUTER AND INNER WORLDSAs you might expect, exactly why human consciousness ‘discovered’ nature as asource of contemplative delight in the last decade of the eighteenth century, isa complex question. And it should be clear that when I speak of ‘nature’ what Ihave in mind is its scenic, picturesque character, not the nature ‘red in toothand claw’ (Tennyson) that Aldous Huxley took Wordsworth to task over in hisessay ‘Wordsworth in the Tropics’ (1928). Here Huxley argues that Wordsworth’sunquestioned love of nature is possible only where nature herself has beentamed, something I suggest at the beginning of this chapter. This itself tellsus that part of the answer to the question why we discovered nature roughly twocenturies ago, must surely be the fact that, as H.G. Wells remarked, by thenhumanity had more or less won its difficult battle against ‘brute nature’ andcould now step back from it and regard it at leisure. We can say that until thenwe regarded nature solely with our ‘survival consciousness’, as something we hadto deal with or avoid. We were, as Wells says, ‘up against it’. With somemeasure of victory, we could draw back, and brute nature, then, was no longer‘in our face’. We had achieved some distance from it.Not everyone, of course. The farmers who regarded Wordsworth with curiosity ashe gazed meditatively on the fields did not share in his new liberation fromploughs and furrows. But the change had started. Colin Wilson argues that whathad happened with the Romantics is that Western man had discovered the power ofthe imagination, that with them consciousness was no longer ‘stuck’ in thepresent moment, which, for most people, meant being smack up against brutenature. We had found ourselves on the shores of a new, inner world, just as theexplorers of a century or two earlier had found themselves on the shores of newgeographical lands. Of course, as with nature itself, people had been aware ofthe imagination ever since early hunters sat around the campfire and recalledthe excitement of the day’s kill, or listened to old warriors recount battlesfrom long ago. But what seems to have happened is that in the late eighteenthcentury, this ability to enter our own minds was somehow increased, as if aftercenturies of getting by on only slightly fermented grape juice, we were suddenlyintroduced to 80 proof alcohol. It was a powerful new drug, and we took to it.Exactly why this happened is unclear, and the attempts to explain it ineconomic, sociological, political, and other rational, ultimately material termsseem, to me, to fall short. They leave out the possibility that life itself,driven by its own inherent need to grow beyond itself – Bergson’s ‘creativeevolution’ – pushed consciousness into these new spheres, in the same way thatmy inherent curiosity and need to develop pushes my own consciousness into newinterests and desires. Whatever the reason, we can say that in many ways, thediscovery of nature – of the outer, physical world as an object of contemplation– came about because of the new inner territories that had opened up.11[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--11] What happened with the Romantics is the samething that the poet Rilke experienced a century later. ‘I am learning to see,’Rilke wrote in his existential novel The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Briggs(1910), about his time in Paris in the early 1900s. ‘I don’t know why, buteverything enters me more deeply and doesn’t stop where it once used to. I havean interior that I never knew of.’12 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--12]A NEW PERSPECTIVEThe philosopher Jean Gebser also believed that by the time of the Romantics,human consciousness was undergoing a decisive change, and that this affected theway we saw the world around us, had produced, as it were, a new kind of nature.For Gebser, the shift had begun with Petrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux. Withthis, according to Gebser, human consciousness had lifted itself out of theflat, two-dimensional world of the Middle Ages and had discovered ‘space’ forthe first time. In his account of the ascent, Petrarch speaks of seeing ‘theclouds lay beneath my feet’, a sight that only the ancient gods of Olympus hadhitherto enjoyed. From his new vantage point Petrarch could see the mountains ofLyon, the Mediterranean, Marseilles, the Rhone, and in his account he is not alittle terrified – in the grip of the sublime – by the spectacle, which in manyways he believed is an act against God. For Gebser, Petrarch’s experience was an‘epochal event’ which signified nothing less than ‘the discovery of landscape;the first dawning of an awareness of space that resulted in a fundamentalalteration of European man’s attitude in and toward the world.’13[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--13] From Gebser’s point of view, then, the ‘spaceage’ began in 1336, and not in 1957 with the Russian satellite Sputnik. In fact,according to Gebser, the whole metaphor of having a ‘point of view’ could nothave arisen until this change in consciousness had taken place. What began withPetrarch’s ascent, for Gebser, was the age of what he called ‘perspectivalconsciousness’, the perception and representation of the world from a uniquehuman vantage point. If we contrast the tapestries characteristic of themedieval period with the perspective paintings that came to prominence in theRenaissance, we can, I think, see what Gebser means.In the medieval world figures seem ‘embedded’ in the landscape; there is nosense of distance or depth in medieval tapestries, just as there is very littleof it in Egyptian wall paintings. The kind of space that O.V. de Lubicz Miloszdespaired of was not perceivable to medieval man, at least according to Gebser.People of the Middle Ages, he believed, felt they were part of a kind of ‘fabricof being’, and that there was an immediate, almost tactile continuity betweenthemselves and the world around them. In Saving the Appearances (1957), a workdevoted to the idea of an ‘evolution of consciousness’, Owen Barfield gives us aglimpse of what the experience of being in the world may have been like formedieval man. Writing as if he was a ‘medieval man in the street’, Barfieldsuggests that when he looks at the sky, he does not ‘see it as empty space’. ‘Ifit is daytime, we see the air filled with light proceeding from a living sun,rather as our own flesh is filled with blood proceeding from a living heart. Ifit is night-time, we do not merely see a plain, homogenous vault pricked withseparate points of light, but a regional qualitative sky, from which first allof the different sections of the great zodiacal belt, and secondly the planetsand the moon … are raying down their complex influences on the earth …We take itfor granted that those invisible spheres [of the planets] are giving forthinaudible music [‘the music of the spheres’]…We know very well that growingthings are specially beholden to the moon, that gold and silver draw theirvirtue from the sun and moon respectively, copper from Venus, iron from Mars,lead from Saturn, and that our own health and temperament are joined byinvisible threads to these heavenly bodies we are looking at.’14[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--14] It is in this sense that Barfield suggests thatmedieval or ‘pre-perspectival man’ did not feel that he was within space. Hewore his world around him like a garment, rather than moved about it as on astage, or, perhaps more apt for ourselves, rattled around in it as objects in abox. According to Barfield, nature, the world, was something medieval man, andhis ancestors, participated in, not something detached from them and held, as itwere, at arm’s length.With Petrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux, Gebser believes, all this changed.Human consciousness suddenly became aware of distance, of depth, and of what weall take for granted as ‘empty’ space. The closely woven intertwining betweenthings began to unravel. Where before a felt relationship held things in place,and allowed for a flow of being, now vast vistas and chasms had opened up, andin the new ‘empty’ space, human consciousness felt its moorings loosen. In muchthe same way as Copernicus’ heliocentric solar system ‘sent the Earth rollingtoward X’, Petrarch’s daring ascent had unhinged man from his ‘place’ and sethim free to roam. This change in the perceived world was paralleled by changesin how man perceived his place in the wider, spiritual cosmos; hence thecelebration of man and human virtues – of the past and its knowledge – thatcharacterises the period we know as the Renaissance. Whereas medieval man felthimself to be a sinner, corrupt, unworthy, in constant fear of falling into theDevil’s hands, and one creature among many on God’s green earth – although onewith a particular destiny and position – the new dispensation championed man’screativeness, his daring, his freedom and almost godlike potential. Nothingexpresses this shift in man’s sense of himself as forcefully as the title of oneof the most important works of the Renaissance, Pico della Mirandola’s Orationon the Dignity of Man (1486). Human dignity was not something commonly acceptedin the previous tapestry of life, but for the fiery, independent personalitiesof the Renaissance, it was an unquestioned good.A CHANGE OF NATURE‘Nature’, then, is not something independent of human beings, something ‘outthere’ that we passively reflect in our consciousness, as a mirror passivelyreflects the objects in front of it, and which would be there, just as it is, ifwe weren’t observing it. This is the attitude toward the world that Husserlcalled ‘the natural standpoint’: the unreflective acceptance of ‘the world’ asgiven, without an awareness of the mind’s own contribution to it. Husserl calledthe mind’s contribution its ‘intentionality’, its selective, purposive, activecharacter. As Colin Wilson has expressed it, rather than simply mirror what isthere, the mind, according to Husserl, ‘reaches out’ and ‘grabs’ it. No mirroris selective, nor does it reach out and grab the objects it reflects. Thiscontribution takes place at levels of the mind we are not ordinarily consciousof, yet our attitudes and expectations inform it. We are not immediately awareof this and the insight, once grasped, is difficult to hold on to, so strong isthe pull of seeing consciousness as merely a mirror, or a camera, an analogyrooted in our passive, Cartesian habits of thought. For the moment let us acceptthis and try to hold on to it firmly: the ‘nature’ we encounter depends on theconsciousness we direct at it. Or, as Blake put it, ‘in your Bosom you bear yourHeaven and Earth & all you behold; tho’ it appears Without, it is Within, inyour Imagination, of which this World of mortality is but a Shadow’.15[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--15]It may seem a loss to have shifted from a world we wore as a garment to one wemove about in as on a stage, from a continuous, interwoven world, to an empty,disconnected one. But while our earlier ‘participated world’ was more connected,it was also one in which we were less free. A figure on a tapestry, no matterhow beautiful, is fixed. And however much we may feel that the cosier, moreintimate world of the Middle Ages is desirable, it had its drawbacks. Barfield’spicture of how medieval consciousness may have perceived its world may suggest astate of mind preferable to our own, isolated, detached awareness. But it was aworld in which consciousness was embedded. And the same was true of earliertimes. Our contemporary fascination with ‘primitive’ peoples, and with thepeople of ancient civilisations, who, we believe, were closer to nature than weare, is understandable, but it ignores the fact that most likely the people ofearlier times were not able to think about these things in the way that we can,did not, in fact, feel themselves to be an ‘I’ in the way we do. They were notable to step back and regard the world as something ‘other’, at least not in theway that we can. In this sense they existed in the kind of ouroboric embrace weenjoyed as children, but remained in it all their lives. In fact, the kind ofintimacy people of an earlier time felt with the world around them is mostlikely something we feel in our childhood, when everything, even inanimateobjects, seems to be alive and responsive to us. Yet none of us, for all ournostalgia, think it a good idea to remain children all our life – our currentoverestimation of youth and youthfulness notwithstanding. As Barfield says,medieval man – and, by inference, humankind from earlier periods – did notreflect on his experience. He took it for granted. He lived in a much moreliving world, but it was one which we never questioned, and which held himfirmly in place.LEAVING HOMEPetrarch’s ascent of Mount Ventoux, according to Gebser, freed us from thiswarm, but ultimately limiting embrace. But it did so at a price. One of theresults of Petrarch’s daring adventure, Gebser argues, was the kind of universethat frightened Pascal with its infinite silences and vast empty spaces.Gebser’s reading of the importance of Petrarch’s ascent is in the context of hisphilosophy of the ‘structures of consciousness’, decisive shifts in thecharacter of human consciousness that have taken place throughout history.Elsewhere I have written about Gebser’s structures of consciousness in thecontext of other ideas about the evolution of consciousness, includingBarfield’s, and the reader can find a fuller exposition of Gebser’s andBarfield’s ideas there.16 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--16] Here I can only saythat for Barfield, Gebser, and other thinkers I discuss, this separation fromour earlier, embedded relation to the world, into our more isolated,disconnected one, was a necessary step in our evolution, the equivalent, interms of our consciousness, of a child realising it is a separate, independentbeing, no longer completely protected from life’s dangers by its parents. Withthis recognition comes a sense of freedom and adventure, but it also brings withit an often overwhelming fear.In terms of the history of western consciousness, we can see the period of theRenaissance as the expression of the sense of adventure, of the opening up ofnew vistas and broad, uncharted depths, and the confidence to explore them. Butit is precisely those uncharted regions that, as the modern period progressed,fed a growing hint of fear, or at least of disquiet, settling, in our time, intoa profound sense of cosmic inconsequence. For Gebser, Petrarch’s ascent of MountVentoux marked what he called the ‘deficient mode of the mental-rationalconsciousness structure’. The ‘mental-rational structure’, which Gebser believesbegan to emerge at around 1225 BC – Gebser’s dates are always estimates, but hegathers an impressive amount of evidence to support them – is one in whichconsciousness begins to experience the first signs of ‘directed’ or ‘discursive’thought.17 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--17] In the previous structure, whichGebser calls the ‘mythic’, thought was more involved with images; it was morealong the lines of what Rudolf Steiner called ‘picture-thinking’ and which helinks to what he calls ‘old moon consciousness’.18[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--18] (In A Secret History of Consciousness I writeat length about the clear parallels between Gebser’s ‘structures’ and Steiner’s‘epochs’.19 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--19]) Now consciousness begins to feelan independence from the world around it, and the individual begins to stand onhis own, no longer completely supported by the kind of group consciousnesscharacteristic of earlier ages.A DANGEROUS FREEDOMThe clearest sign of this new, mental-rational structure for Gebser is the riseof Greek philosophy, and in many ways his interpretation of this is similar toHeidegger’s, who sees in the rise of Platonic metaphysics the roots of what hecalls ‘the age of the world as view’, the age, that is, of the world assomething to be seen and analysed. Rational, logical, discursive thought, thesearch for answers, for explanations, the roots of science, begin to take holdat this point, and the mental independence necessary for the evolution ofconsciousness is firmly in place. With the rise of the mental-rationalstructure, we emerged as creatures who, for the first time, felt on our own inthe world. This, for Gebser, is both a blessing and a curse, because it at onceprovides us with the necessary freedom to grow and develop, but also makespossible a complete separation from what he calls ‘origin’, the timeless,non-spatial, immaterial, spiritual source of the different structures ofconsciousness (we can say that in essentials Gebser’s ‘origin’ is equivalent tothe Kabbalah’s Ein-Sof) The rise of the mental-rational structure, Gebser says,is the beginning of our estrangement from the world, a loss of connection withit which by now we take for granted. What happened when Petrarch made his madascent of Mount Ventoux, is that the mental-rational structure entered whatGesber calls its ‘deficient mode’. This is when the characteristics of aparticular structure of consciousness, which were previously an asset, become aliability. By the time of Petrarch’s ascent, the detachment from the world thatenabled the rise of philosophy and science – of thought itself – was moving intothe kind of alienation from it common to our own time.As the world was seen more and more as something distinctly apart fromourselves, something we could hold at arm’s length and perceive as an object,its living, vital, participatory character dimmed. We can say that as our owninner world grew – our own sense of being an independent, conscious self – theworld’s ‘interior’, its soul, faded. By the time that Pascal expressed his fearat ‘the eternal silences of the infinite spaces’ the participatory, livingcosmos was on its way to being completely eclipsed by the new, anti-animisticvision (‘world as view’) of the world as a great machine, operating undermathematical law – a vision we still embrace today. In The Quest for HermesTrimegistus I mark the triumph of this ‘modern’ view in the work of the Catholicmonk and philosopher Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), an older contemporary of Pascaland colleague of René Descartes, commonly seen as one of the founders of ourscientific world view. Mersenne is important because he initiated an unequivocalattack on the kind of world medieval man had experienced, and which was stillbeing contemplated in his day by followers of the Hermetic teachings, that is, aliving, participatory world.20 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--20] This ability tostand back and regard the world as something ‘other’ led to an increase in man’sconfidence in his own powers and abilities. Yet while this initially led to apowerful resurgence in Hermetic and spiritual philosophy – the recovery of theCorpus Hermeticum and Plato’s works were responsible for this and were more orless what the Renaissance was about – it slowly transformed into the atrophyingof his new found power to view the world as an object (Gebser’s ‘deficient modeof the mental-rational structure’). This then quickly shifted into having powerover the world, expressed in Francis Bacon’s dictum that ‘knowledge is power’(although Bacon himself apparently never phrased it quite in that way), andwhich we can see as the beginning of the modern dominance of the left-brainapproach to reality. From a garment we wore and a world we participated in,nature and all its works became something we could control through the power ofmathematics.A RULER IN CHAINSWhile this development brought undoubted benefits which we still enjoy – itwould be tedious and unnecessary to list all the advantages we owe to the riseof science and technology – it resulted in a world and a nature that waslifeless, mechanical, and shot through with a cold, implacable necessity. Italso eventually led to the purposeless universe of Steven Weinberg and thepointless drift of John Gray. Nature and everything in it followed irrevocableroutines, whether we wanted them to or not. It was a great clock, ticking away,all its cogs and wheels fitting perfectly into each other. God may have createdit to begin with – if nothing else it was politic to state this – but once hedid, it ran without his interference, much as Stephen Hawking’s universe createditself without help from anything. Physical laws and mathematical necessity tookcare of everything, and by the early 1800s, the French astronomer Pierre-SimonLaplace argued that if we could know the exact location and momentum of everyparticle in the universe we could predict with absolute certainty the futuremovements of both the galaxies and the atoms of which they were composed; thiswas, in fact, an early ‘theory of everything’. The present grows from the pastas unavoidably as the future does from the present; the inexorable chain ofcause and effect ensured this. The notion of free will and the idea that humanbeings were, by divine dispensation, exempt from such inescapable determinism,looked pretty threadbare. Man had freed himself from the superstitions of thepast, had mastered nature, and enthroned himself as the new ruler of theuniverse, but he was a ruler in chains, subject to the very iron laws that hadenabled him to establish control.It was against this new, clockwork nature that minds unhappy with thescientistic view rebelled. I say ‘scientistic’, not scientific, because almostfrom the beginning this new way of seeing the world hardened into a dogma, intoa new religion, ‘scientism’, which professed belief in this new, mechanical wayof perceiving the world as the only valid one and in its results as being thesole criteria for truth. Truth was what you could perceive with the senses, holdin your hands, and weigh and measure. What you could not, could not be proved.Needless to say, most of the truths that make life worth living could not meetthis requirement – how much does love weigh? – and so, as we saw earlier, theywere relegated to the status of un-truths.AGAINST NATUREOne of the most vocal opponents of the new mechanistic vision of nature wasWilliam Blake. In Great Britain today Blake is seen as a national poet. His poemthat prefaces his prophetic book Milton, beginning with ‘And did those feet inancient times’, as set to music by Sir Hubert Parry, is known as the patrioticanthem ‘Jerusalem’. But in his own time Blake was quite literally consideredmad, and his poems were read by just a few followers. Perhaps this was notunreasonable, as Blake was a follower of Swedenborg, and Swedenborg’s own sanitywas questioned; at one point an attempt was made to have Swedenborg declaredinsane and intered in an asylum.21 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--21] Blake’smadness was an expression of his visionary faculty, his ability to see a worldin a grain of sand or heaven in a wild flower. In A Vision of the Last Judgement(1808) Blake writes, ‘it will be Questioned ‘’When the sun rises, do you not seea round disc of fire somewhat like a guinea?” His answer is: ‘O no, no I see anInnumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord GodAlmighty’ – his vision of the ‘spiritual sun’.22[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--22] Blake knew that the mind, or, in histerminology, the Imagination, was responsible for the sun, the stars, the whole‘Outward Creation’, and that, as quoted above, although it appears without, itis within. ‘Mental Things are alone Real’ – I retain Blake’s idiosyncraticspelling and punctuation – ‘what is Calld Corporeal Nobody Knows of its DwellingPlace’. ‘The Nature of Visionary Fancy or Imagination is very little Known & theEternal nature & permanence of its ever Existent Images [Gebser’s ‘Ever PresentOrigin’?] is considered as less permanent than the things of Vegetative andGenerative Nature yet the Oak dies as well as the Lettuce but Its Eternal Image& Individuality never dies.’ ‘This world of Imagination is the World of Eternityit is the Divine bosom into which we shall all go after the death of theVegetated body’. ‘There Exist in that Eternal World the Permanent Realities ofEvery Thing which we see reflected in this Vegetable Glass of Nature.’23[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--23]For Blake, as for Swedenborg, Plato, and innumerable mystics, the outer world isa reflection or symbol of an inner one. For them the real world is this higher,spiritual, interior reality, and the lower, physical universe is merely a signof it, or a kind of language, which we can learn to read. As Kathleen Raine putsit, speaking of Blake and Swedenborg, ‘It is not mind but nature which is themirror, in which objects have only an apparent existence.’24[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--24] As Blake himself says, ‘Where man is not Natureis barren’ (‘Proverbs of Hell’). Yet neither Blake’s nor Swedenborg’s vision isanti-nature in some simplistic sense. Blake tells us that ‘a robin redbreast ina cage/puts all heaven in a rage’ (‘Auguries of Innocence’), and asks: ‘How dowe know but ev’ry Bird, that cuts the airy way, is an immense world of delight,closed by our senses five?’ (‘The Marriage of Heaven and Hell’). It is notnature – which for Blake as for Swedenborg, is the living face of the divine –but the nature that the new, mechanistic view provided, that troubled him.Indeed, the scientistic vision – what Blake called ‘single vision and Newton’ssleep’ – is anti-nature, because it reduces nature to the tedious repetition ofeternally whirling wheels, the terrifying ‘starry systems’ that haunted O.V. deLubicz Milosz. Blake’s phrase ‘the dark Satanic mills’, which comes from Milton,is usually understood to be a reference to the new mills of the IndustrialRevolution. But another interpretation sees them as the ‘starry wheels’, theincessant turning of the Newtonian clock, the great mill of worlds around thepole star that was a sign of cosmic necessity and determinism.25[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--25] These ‘dark Satanic mills’ grind down humanfreedom and enslave men’s minds with the belief that they are mere cogs in somevast, unstoppable cosmic mechanism. It was with something similar in mind thatAlfred North Whitehead once remarked that: ‘Life is an offensive, directedagainst the repetitious mechanism of the universe’. Such a mechanical nature isnot alive, but dead.Blake’s reaction to this dead nature, and his belief in the supremacy of theImagination – again, not simple fancy or novelty, but the creative power behindbeing itself – could be quite vehement. He took Wordsworth to task for what hesaw as the younger poet’s idolatry, his veneration of the transient symbol –nature – over its eternal source, the creative mind. Wordsworth and all naturepoets were, for Blake, sunk in Maya (illusion, although Blake didn’t use thisterm), entranced by beauty as if by a mirage, and forgetful of the divineenergies behind the surface, and within the mind. ‘I see in Wordsworth theNatural Man rising up against the Spiritual Man Continually,’ Blake wrote, ‘&then he is no Poet but a Heathen Philosopher at Enmity against all true Poetryor Inspiration’.26 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--26]Blake’s view of nature is similar to Louis Claude de Saint-Martin’s. For both,man began as the microcosm, Adam Kadmon, the Great Man, but through some cosmiccatastrophe, we fell from the spiritual realms into the world of matter, space,and time and became enslaved by them. Or more precisely, matter, space, time andthe Vegetable Glass of Nature are the result of our fall, of our originalandrogynous spiritual unity fragmenting, shattering, as the vessels shatteredafter the tzimtzum. The ‘lifeless universe outside the human Imagination’ –Kathleen Raine again – ‘is created by the “wrenching apart” of the “eternalmind” resulting, on the one hand, in an externalised “nature” devoid of life,and on the other in a “shrinking” of humanity (‘the fallacy ofinsignificance’?), from the boundless being of Imagination into the “mortalworm” of sixty winters and “seventy inches long”, an insignificant part of theexternalised nature this wrenching apart has created’.27[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--27] This wrenching apart creates what Blake callsUlro, the material world, the mundane egg, whose shell obscures the creativeenergies within it. For Blake, all of creation is human. In a poem to his friendThomas Butts Blake wroteEach grain of Sand Every Stone on the LandEach rock & each hill Each fountain & rillEach herb & each tree Mountain hill Earth & SeaCloud Meteor & Star Are Men seen from AfarBlake voiced this theme earlier in the often obscure mythology of Vala, or theFour Zoas (1797): ‘wherever a grass grows Or a leaf buds The Eternal Man is seenis heard is felt And all his Sorrows till he reassumes his ancient bliss’.28[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--28] As Swedenborg believed, and as the Kabbalistsand Hindu mystics believed, the entire cosmos is human, and when man isregenerated, nature will be too.WAKING NATUREIf he knew of Blake’s work, Saint-Martin would have agreed with it.29[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--29] As Saint-Martin’s biographer, the occultscholar A.E. Waite, writes, ‘The message of Saint-Martin may be fitly termed theCounsel of the Exile … It is concerned with man only, the glorious intention ofhis creation, with his fall, his subsequent bondage, the means of hisliberation, and his return to the purpose of his being’.30[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--30] That purpose, we have seen, is to ‘repair theuniverse’, which, according to Saint-Martin, is itself, like man, fallen. ‘It isin vain that we seek in matter for the real and permanent images of thatprinciple of life from which we are separated unhappily’ Saint-Martin tellsus.31 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--31] ‘The entire universe, notwithstanding allthe splendours which it displays before our eyes, can never of itself manifestthe truly divine treasures’.32 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--32] It was insightslike these that led to Saint-Martin’s dictum that we should explain the world byman, not man by the world. ‘Man’, for Saint-Martin, ‘is an exotic plant of thematerial universe.’ ‘In his true nature he does not belong to the earth, and thedepreciation of his type is the cost of his naturalisation.’33[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--33] Man, for Saint-Martin, is the ‘inhabitant of afar country’ who has come to earth to fulfil a mission.34[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--34] And in exactly the same way as it is stated inthe Hermetic books, Saint-Martin believes that by accepting this mission, manhas become a creature of two worlds. He is ‘at once great and little, mortal andimmortal, ever free in the intellectual, but bound in the physical by lawsoutside his will; in a word, being a combination of two natures diametricallyopposed.’35 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--35] Hence his homesickness, which,Saint-Martin tells us, is the most ‘saving sentiment’ that we can cherish.While this places man in an often uncomfortable, even unbearable position, italso makes it possible that by freeing himself, he frees nature. With Blake,Saint-Martin believed that when man regains the status he enjoyed before thefall – when ‘he resumes his ancient bliss’; when, that is, his consciousness isonce again unified – the fallen world will be redeemed too, will, indeed, berepaired immeasurably. ‘The sin of man,’ Saint-Martin tells us, ‘is the pain ofNature’. ‘The universe is on its bed of suffering, and it is for us, O man, toconsole it.’ One way in which man can waken sleeping nature from her trance isthrough speech. Speech, Saint-Martin tells us, must be restored to the universe.As it is now, the universe is mute, its infinite silence terrifying Pascal andmany less articulate souls. But it is only ‘he terrestrial man who finds naturesilent; for the ‘man of desire’ – desire, that is, to reunite with his source –‘everything sings in her’. The ‘man of desire’ must speak truthfully – say the‘magic word’ – in order to liberate sunken nature from its deathlike coma – areflection that may suggest a different view of the story of Sleeping Beauty.‘We comprehend intuitively that all should speak, and the same intuitioninstructs us that all should be fluid and diaphanous, that opacity andstagnation are the radical causes of the silence and weariness of nature’.36[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--36] (‘Diaphaneity’ is a term Gebser usesfrequently, indicating a form of consciousness in which the ‘ever presentorigin’ is perceived through the various structures in which it is clothed.)Saint-Martin sees that nature is not the reason for man’s own sunken condition,but is a victim of it herself, and that it is only man who can draw her up outof the depths. Nature, he tells us, ‘is conscious of a secret life circulatingthrough all its veins, and through us as an organ it waits the accents of thatspeech which sustains it … It seeks in us the living fire which radiates fromthat speech …’37 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--37]LANGUAGE AND BEINGEarlier we saw how kavannot or ‘intentions’ were one of the main means ofperforming tikkun, and I gave as one example how speaking thoughtfully and withmeaning, rather than our usual empty chatter, is one way of doing this.Saint-Martin agrees. Well in advance of Martin Heidegger, who saw in ourincorrigible taste for gossip, for Gerede (‘talk’), a source of our‘forgetfulness of being’, Saint-Martin knew that ‘between human conversation andtrue speech there is an immeasurable distance’.38[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--38] For Heidegger, ‘language is the House of Being’(Letter on Humanism (1947) and ‘Man dwells in this house’. If that is so, thenfor both Heidegger and Saint-Martin, man has let his house fall into disrepair,in fact, it is even doubtful if it is still inhabitable. Saint-Martin speaks of‘the false and perverted use to which man has put the divine faculty of speech’,one of the fundamental abilities that differentiates us from animals, many ofwhom have systems of communication, but not language, with its power to speak ofabstract ideas, to use a future tense, to posit possibilities, even to speakfalsely. (Can animals lie?39 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--39]) Heideggerbelieved that our incessant flood of chatter – now facilitated demonically bythe miracle of mobile phones – actually alienates us from the ‘word’, from thetrue speech that reaches out to authentic being. Being for Heidegger is rootedin speech, in language, which manifests our ability to stand apart from ‘theworld’ and wonder at it and ask questions, which is the essence of thought. (Ofall beings we are the one being that asks questions about Being, as Heidegger’smesmerising manner of expression would have it.) Such authentic languageHeidegger calls Rede, ‘speech’, as against the empty vocalising of mere ‘talk’.Such talk, as George Steiner remarks, ‘fosters illusion of understanding withoutgenuine grasp’; as mentioned earlier in a more homely context, saying ‘thankyou’ and meaning it is not as easy as we may think.40[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--40] This talk, Steiner says ‘transpires in an echochamber of incessant, vacant loquacity, of pseudocommunication that knowsnothing of its cognates which are, or ought to be, “communion” and“community”’.41 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--41] Saint-Martin agrees. ‘So longas we converse,’ he tells us, ‘either with ourselves or others, only concerningthe things of the world [we could say ‘life world’], we are acting against theword … because we are stooping to the world and naturalising ourselves with thatwhich is void of true speech.’42 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--42] Saint-Martinalso agrees with Rilke when he says that for ‘the man of desire’ ‘everythingsings’ in being. ‘Gesang ist Dasein’ Rilke wrote in the first of his ‘Sonnets toOrpheus’ (1922), ‘singing is being’. ‘We have fallen under the rule of the deadword,’ Saint-Martin tells us, and to ‘advance toward reality and life we mustpart somehow with this enormous concourse of rank, empty, earthly and falseverbiage corrupting the atmosphere of the mind’.43[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--43] To which one can only say ‘Amen!’ By doing thiswe can fulfil the command that ‘the transfiguration of man’s environment mustproceed side by side with the transfiguration of man’.44[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--44] As Saint-Martin said, proof of our regenerationis that we regenerate everything around us.FREEING NATUREI should mention that one of the myths that have gathered around our idea ofnature is that it is ‘free’, and as we’ve seen, both Blake and Saint-Martin wentto great pains to disabuse their readers of this, and to show that, on thecontrary, nature is actually enslaved. ‘Free nature’ is an illusion fostered bythe discomfort of self-consciousness, a price we pay for being human. Years ago,Bob Dylan asked the plaintive musical question: ‘if dogs run free, then why notwe?’45 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--45] The answer to this is that dogs don’trun free. Dogs, like all animals, are laden with the chains of their biology andare hemmed in by systems of instincts they are unable to throw off. But becausedogs aren’t expected to conform to the requirements of civilised behaviour, theycan engage in activities that to us seem free but really aren’t. No dog, or anyother animal for that matter, can choose to react to a stimulus or not, in theway that we can. (And whether we do or not is a different question.) In thissense the most harried nine-to-fiver is categorically more free than any dog. AsMax Scheler said, animals always say ‘Yes’ to reality, even when in pain andtrying to avoid it. This ‘yes’ isn’t born of a conscious affirmation – they arenot ‘yea-sayers’ as Nietzsche’s Zarathustra is – but is rooted in an inabilityto say ‘no’, to stand back from life, put it on hold and decide whether toaccept it or not. If medieval or earlier human beings were, as Owen Barfieldbelieved, ‘embedded’ in the world, animals are even more so.What we envy about dogs and other animals is not their freedom, which isseverely limited, as is that of every other part of nature, but their lack ofself-consciousness, their lack of an ego and its own debilitating concerns. Theplunge into ‘animal consciousness’ sought by some is motivated, I believe, by adesire to escape the human birthright of self-consciousness, the awareness thatparalyses Hamlet, but also allows for us to feel a sense of awe and wonder atthe world, which, as Heidegger tells us, is the beginning of thought. Thispredicament was recognised in the nineteenth century by the German playwrightHeinrich von Kleist in his remarkable fable ‘On the Marionette Theatre’ (1810).In it, the narrator expresses his delight at the perfect movements of thedancing puppets he has seen at the theatre, and laments that no human dancer canmatch such grace. We have it for a time when we are children, but once we becomeself-conscious – aware of ourselves as independent beings, as the puppets arenot – a shadow falls between this early innocence and our actions. Our too acuteknowledge of ourselves spoils the unconscious perfection. Our envy of animals,and other illusory manifestations of ‘free nature’, is rooted in the awkwardnessthat accompanies awareness of ourselves, and this awkwardness is, as readers mayhave noticed, another manifestation of our being ‘dwellers on two worlds’.Kleist, however, knew that in order to regain this grace, man could only moveforward, into a new innocence, a harmony that escapes us now but which hebelieves it is possible to achieve. ‘Grace returns,’ Kleist’s narrator tells us,‘when knowledge has as it were gone through an infinity. Grace appears mostpurely in that human form which either has no consciousness or an infiniteconsciousness. That is, in the puppet or in the god.’46[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--46]This second grace is available to us, not by sinking back into sleeping nature,which, in any event, we really cannot do, although we make many attempts to doso, but by pushing forward into full awareness of our own creative power. Wereally have no choice; it is the only direction open to us. Berdyaev agrees withSaint-Martin, Blake and many others when he says that ‘creativeness more thananything else is reminiscent of man’s vocation before the Fall’ and he echoesKleist when he remarks on ‘the union of grace and freedom which we find increativeness’.47 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--47] (Maslow recorded manyincidences when his subjects had peak experiences during some creative act; forexample, a student who worked his way through university by performing as a jazzdrummer. The student told Maslow of one night when, at two in the morning, hefound himself drumming so perfectly that he couldn’t make a mistake. He hadregained Kleist’s ‘grace’.) Such creativeness, and a creative attitude to lifeas a whole, Berdyaev says, ‘is not man’s right, it is his duty’.48[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--48] ‘Man,’ Berdyaev writes, ‘is a new departure innature’; he is not a ‘fragmentary part of the world, but contains the wholeriddle of the universe and the solution to it’.49[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--49] Man is the ‘enigmatic being which, though apart of nature, cannot be explained in terms of nature.’50[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--50] He is, Berdyaev says, ‘a continual protestagainst reality’.51 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--51] That protest is made byliving creatively.LIVING NATUREHow would a nature liberated from its enslavement, wakened from its trance,appear? Although the idea of a living, conscious nature goes back to theancients, it enjoyed a popular revival in the 1970s with the publication of TheSecret Life of Plants (1974) by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird. Central tothe book was the work of Cleve Backster, an interrogation specialist with yearsof experience working with lie detectors. One day in 1966 Backster had the ideaof attaching his polygraph to one of his rubber plants. Backster wanted to chartthe plant’s absorption of water by registering its conductivity. As he conductedhis experiment and had little success, he wondered at the reading he wasgetting, and felt it was strangely similar to a reading from a human subject,who was trying to withhold information. Backster wondered what he could do toconfirm this, and the idea of posing a threat to the plant came to him, much asan uncomfortable question poses a threat to a human subject, thus triggering atypical reaction. Backster thought that he would burn one of the plant’s leaves,and at this the polygraph responded wildly. Backster had not actually burnt theleaf, he merely thought about doing it. Yet the plant had reacted. Backstercouldn’t believe the plant had actually responded, and he repeated theexperiment. Sure enough, it did. Backster conducted further experiments, all ofwhich confirmed this initial discovery. Backster had chanced upon theastonishing fact that somehow, plants are able to ‘read our minds’. And not onlythat: they are able to communicate with each other, and are aware of the lifearound them, animal, vegetable, human, or microscopic. In further experimentswith a variety of plants, Backster confirmed Blake’s insight that ‘a robinredbreast in a cage/puts all heaven in a rage’. At one point the polygraphreacted when Backster poured boiling water down the drain. He couldn’tunderstand why it should, until he realised that the plant was reacting to thedeath of the microorganisms in the sink. Backster even discovered that plantsreacted to human sex.52 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--52]The details of Backster’s experiments and discoveries are fascinating and theinterested reader is advised to go to Tompkins and Bird’s book, which hasacquired the deserved status of a classic. But one of the most important ideasto emerge from Backster’s work is his notion of ‘primary perception’, a kind ofuniversal ur-sense shared by all living things, but which we are oblivious to.When I read this in The Secret Life of Plants I immediately thought of Bergson’sbelief that our brain and nervous system are essentially eliminative: that is,they are designed to keep information and stimuli out of consciousness. AsTompkins and Bird write: ‘the five senses in humans might be limiting factors,overlaying some kind of primary perception, possibly common to all nature’.53[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--53] And as I say in Chapter 2, this makes perfectsense, as in order for us to function in the world, we need to edit out most ofthe ‘interdependent connections’ linking everything to everything else. (Again,our ‘detachment’ from the medieval tapestry with Petrarch’s ascent of MountVentoux makes the same point: if we were to develop our independentego-consciousness, we needed to ‘lose’ our connections with the participatoryworld.) Yet although we are not immediately aware of this ‘primary perception’,it is still at work in us, and it may account for some phenomena we call‘paranormal’. In a fascinating paper the consciousness researcher andparapsychologist David Luke suggests that ‘our physiology supersedes ourcognition in the reception of psychic information … One interpretation of thisis that we may all be continuously psychic, albeit subtly, and yet we remainconsciously unaware of the fact, even though our body reacts on our behalf’.54[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--54] It may be the case, then, that our body reactsto what it perceives in ‘primary perception’, but we – our conscious selves –are unaware of this. And again, that we are unaware of most of the ‘psychicinformation’ that reaches us makes sense. As Tompkins and Bird write: ‘ifeveryone were to be in everyone else’s mind all the time it would be chaos’.55[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--55]THE PRIMAL PLANTTompkins and Bird’s book draws on many sources for its argument, but two inparticular stand out for our purposes here. Earlier I mentioned Goethe as afounder of the Romantic Movement. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) was onethose embarrassingly multi-talented Enlightenment characters that are no longermade today, and along with making breakthroughs in literature, he was also ascientist. In The Metamorphosis of Plants (1790) Goethe developed an idea thathad been with him for some time, and had come to a kind of climax three yearsearlier, while on a trip to Palermo, in Sicily. Goethe believed in the existenceof what he called the Urpflanze or ‘primal plant’, a living archetype from whichall plant forms emerge. ‘The Primal Plant,’ Goethe wrote, while visitingPalermo’s Botanical Garden ‘is going to be the strangest creature in the world,for which Nature herself shall envy me. With this model and the key to it, itwill be possible to go on for ever inventing plants and know that theirexistence is logical; that is to say, if they do not actually exist, they could,for they are not the shadowy phantoms of a vain imagination, but posses an innernecessity and truth’.56 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--56] Goethe’s ‘primalplant’, then, is in many ways similar to what Blake above calls a plant’s‘Eternal Image and Individuality’, its imaginative archetype. Goethe came to hisdiscovery of the primal plant through an intense participation in theobservation of nature. With Blake Goethe believed that truth is ‘a revelationemerging at the point where the inner world of man meets external reality’,Blake’s ‘sun’ whose light depends on ‘the organ which beholds it’.57[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--57] Goethe showed this to be the case, at least tohis own satisfaction, when, after long hours of patiently observing the growthof a plant, he saw the primal plant. He did not imagine it – in the negativesense – or merely think it, but actually perceived it. He did not observe hisplant though, with the cool detachment of the ordinary scientist, careful toexclude any subjective contribution of his own, but with the imaginative warmthand ardour of an artist – with, in fact, the kind of phenomenological ‘love’that Max Scheler believed was the key to discovering any truth worth knowing.Goethe’s ‘imaginative observation’ revealed the plant to be a living idea, a‘soul’ that revealed itself to the lovingly attentive eye in the process of itsdevelopment.58 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--58] Goethe established that naturewas alive, and that if we are unaware of this, it is through the passivity ofour own perceptions. If our consciousness was more active – participatory,regenerated – then nature would appear to be more alive too. It was on Goethe’snotion of a kind of ‘active perceiving’ that Rudolf Steiner would base his ideasabout what he called ‘spiritual science’. Through Goethe’s revelation of theUrpflanze, Steiner was led to the insight that ‘Man is not there in order toform for himself a picture of the finished world; nay, he himself cooperates inbringing the world into existence’, an insight we have already come across inseveral other thinkers.59 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--59]THE ANGEL OF THE EARTHMost of us are aware of the notion of the earth as a living being, as ‘Gaia’,through the work of James Lovelock. Yet Lovelock himself is at pains to pointout that the idea of a ‘living earth’ is for him really only a metaphor, an‘aide pensée’, an aid to thought, and not to be taken literally.60[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--60] Lovelock’s concern for the health of this aidepensée, however, has led him to make some radical statements. He speaks of humanbeings – for him, the clearest threat to ‘Gaia’ – as ‘a plague of people’, ananimal who had ‘begun the demolition of the Earth’, the species equivalent of …Jekyll and Hyde’, and a ‘planetary disease’, and advises that our work to helpGaia should be carried out ‘as if we were about to be attacked by a powerfulenemy’, a troubling phrase that suggests the possibility of some kind of‘pre-emptive strike’ against the source of the problem – ourselves.61[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--61] Yet an earlier nature-friendly thinker who tookthe idea of the earth as a living being seriously, not simply as a metaphor, andwho first proposed that plants had an inner life, harboured no such negativethoughts about people. For him they are the earth’s sense organs, its means ofbecoming conscious of itself, an idea voiced more than once earlier in thisbook. The earth itself, according to him, was, in the words of his great admirerWilliam James, our ‘great common guardian angel, who watched over all ourinterests combined’, a remark that echoes Vladimir Solovyov’s idea, mentioned inChapter 3, that the universe ‘from time immemorial has been interested in thepreservation, development, and perpetuation of all that is really necessary anddesirable for us’.62 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--62] Not an idea, I think, thatwould go over well with James Lovelock.Gustav Fechner (1801–1887), who I am speaking of above, was an amazinglyprolific and dedicated German scholar and scientist, who spent practically allhis life in the University of Leipzig. He is known as the founder of‘psychophysics’, the discipline that formed the basis for scientific psychology,and Fechner’s research into the relationship between psychological sensation andthe intensity of physical stimuli is still considered important. Freud andEinstein are among the many people influenced by his work.63[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--63] But Fechner was a remarkably versatileindividual, and along with tutoring and translating innumerable scientific worksin order to support himself, he also carried on a separate career as ‘Dr Mises’,a pseudonym he used for a series of humorous, satiric, and philosophical essaysand wise sayings, that are often as insightful and elegant as those of hiscountryman Georg Christoph Lichtenberg. But what is important to us aboutFechner’s work – and the reason he is included in Tompkins and Bird’s book – isthe insight – literally – that came to him after he went through what thehistorian of psychology Henri Ellenberger calls a ‘creative illness’.In 1840, at the age of thirty-nine, overwork and eyestrain sent Fechner into akind of nervous collapse. From looking at the sun in order to observe thephenomenon of after-images, he became almost blind, and had to stay in darkenedrooms, his eyes bandaged because any exposure to light caused him insufferablepain. He couldn’t read and this led to depression and an inner disorientation, aperpetual sense of confusion, with his thoughts running out of control,something Swedenborg, who also endured a ‘creative illness’, experienced.64[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--64] Fechner mistrusted doctors but tried various‘alternative’ remedies, which only made things worse. His body could absorb nofood and he shrank to skin and bones. He also found it almost impossible tospeak, every attempt throwing him into fits of distress.An acquaintance heard of his plight, and dreamt that she had prepared some foodthat he could eat. She visited him and offered her cure. It worked for a timebut did not prove decisive. After three years of this torture, Fechner, in sheeranger, began to speak loudly, ignoring the pain. This seemed to work and hisvoice improved. He then decided to expose himself to the light suddenly, and notgradually, as he had tried before. The effect was astonishing. Visiting hisgarden in full daylight, Fechner pulled off his bandages and felt that he hadbeen given ‘a glimpse beyond the boundary of human experience’. ‘Every flower’,he wrote, ‘beamed upon me with a peculiar clarity, as though into the outerlight it was casting its own. To me the whole garden seemed transfigured, asthough it was not I but nature that had just risen up again’ [my italics.] ‘AndI thought: so nothing is needed but to open the eyes afresh, and with that oldnature is made young again. Indeed, one will hardly believe how new and vivid isthe nature that meets the man who comes to meet it with new eyes.’65[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--65]Along with this vision of the flowers as living, conscious beings, and not mereautomata, a new optimism and confidence filled Fechner, a sense of destiny, ofhaving an important message for mankind, something common to individuals whohave gone through a ‘creative illness’. Fechner had begun as an atheist, but areading of the Naturphilosophie of Friedrich von Schelling had cured him ofthat, and before his illness he had written a short devotional text, A LittleBook of Life After Death (1836) in which he argued that what we take as wakinglife is really only a half-sleep – something Gurdjieff would have agreed with –and that in death we enter full consciousness. What emerged from Fechner’sexperience was the realisation that nature, the whole universe in fact, is aliveand conscious. Fechner expressed his ideas about the inner life of plants in hisbook Nanna: The Soul Life of Plants (1848) and in Concerning Souls (1861) hebroadens this insight to cover the entire cosmos. In a sense, in order to see,Fechner had to become blind, and he would say that we, who still regard theuniverse as a lifeless machine, are the truly blind ones. Fechner thought interms of a ‘continuous, perpetual creation’, and his experience allowed him toshare in the ‘primary perception’ that Cleve Backster believed was enjoyed byall nature. Fechner’s basic theme is that, just as we have an ‘inside’, aninner, ‘soul world’, so too does the universe, and it is only our blindness thatprevents us from seeing this. The earth, stars, and galaxies – which Fechnerconsidered angels – as well as a pebble on the road, is shot through with lifeand consciousness, not the kind of acute self-consciousness we experience, butthe kind of diffuse consciousness Backster’s plants seemed to have exhibited.(In his 1961 novel Solaris, about the discovery of a living planet, the Polishscience-fiction writer Stanislaw Lem (1921–2006) paid homage to Fechner bynaming one of the characters after him. In 1972 the novel was made into adisturbingly beautiful film by the Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky.)Fechner believed that ‘life was primordial and organic matter prior to theunorganic’, the complete opposite of the standard scientific view, which seeslife as an accidental product of matter.66 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--66] Thiswas a view Fechner shared with later ‘vital’ philosophers like Bergson andWhitehead, and the contemporary philosopher of mind David Chalmers seems toagree with Fechner that consciousness pervades the universe.67[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--67] As William James said, for Fechner ‘originalsin’ is ‘our inveterate habit of regarding the spiritual not as the rule but asan exception’.68 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--68] He contrasted what he calledthe ‘day view’ that regards the ‘whole universe’ as ‘everywhere alive andconscious’, with the ‘night view’, that sees life as an anomaly in a dead,mechanical cosmos. For his contemporaries, ‘in the midst of nature as a whole …animated creatures appear like islands in the universal ocean of dead andsoulless bodies.’ This was false, but understandable, since ‘it is in a dark andcold world we sit, if we will not open the inward eyes of the spirit to theinward flame of nature’.69 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--69]Fechner had opened his inward eyes and he saw. ‘The real and vital question,’ hewrote, ‘is, not whether the world has a spirit about which we alone know, butwhether it is Spirit which knows about us’.70 [part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--70]Fechner, however, did not believe that matter was unreal, as idealistphilosophers did; and as we’ve seen, he also didn’t believe that matter was theonly real thing. What was real was the union of matter and spirit. In much thesame way that for an idea or value to be actualised it must have form and berooted in reality, Fechner believed that for spirit to be perceived it must beembodied. Fechner argued by analogy. Just as to the totality of all we see orperceive in man there corresponds a centre, a soul, that we do not see – withthe physical eye – but perceive, as Scheler believed, intuitively, so too to thetotality of all we perceive in nature there corresponds a unified Being which wemay assume is only immediately apparent to itself. And just as we cannot findthe human soul with a microscope – something Swedenborg, a fellow scientist,discovered – we cannot find the soul of the earth or the cosmos with‘telescopes, deep drilling, or measurements …’71[part0010.xhtml#rw-num-note--71] We can find it, however by opening the inwardeye which, as Fechner discovered, makes ‘old nature young again’, and allcreation ‘new’ and ‘vivid’. As Goethe did when he discovered the primal plant,Fechner saw that for nature to be alive, we must be too.Let us take a look then at what that might mean.5.

Seealso Lachman The Dedalus Book of Literary Suicides: Dead Letters (Sawtry, Cambs:Dedalus, 2008) pp. 223–230.11 [part0010.xhtml#rw-ref-note--11] In The Craft of the Novel (1975) ColinWilson suggests that the publication of Samuel Richardson’s novel Pamela (1740)was the starting point of this change in consciousness. There were novels beforethis, Don Quixote (1605–1615) and Robinson Crusoe (1719) for example, but Pamelawas something different, and is considered the first novel in the modern sense.Robinson Crusoe and Don Quixote were about ‘far away places with strangesounding names’, and told of extraordinary adventures in exotic lands. Pamelawas about everyday life, and was an immense relief from the interminable boredomthat most people must have felt, when they were not wrestling with nature inorder to scratch out a living. For many people then, the only source ofentertainment was the weekly sermon. To modern tastes Richardson’s Pamela is anunbearably slow account of the eponymous heroine’s defence of her virtue fromthe repeated and perpetually frustrated attempts on it by her employer. Whatmade it different from Robinson Crusoe and earlier epics is that the readerscould put themselves in Pamela’s – or her would-be seducer’s – shoes, andimagine what their own lives would be like if they were in her situation. (This,of course, is the appeal of every soap opera.) They could spend hours in anentirely new dimension, an inner landscape that the men and women who read thebook were only then discovering. This is something we, who take reading forgranted, find difficult to grasp, simply because we have grown up with it andwith our own sense of having an ‘inner world’, we which take as a given. We haveto go back to our own earliest experiences of the ‘magic’ of reading – or oflistening to music – to get a sense of the tremendous change that had takenplace in human consciousness. Aptly enough, Richardson’s writing of Pamela is an example of one ofMaslow’s ‘means-activity’ becoming an ‘ends-activity’, that I mention in ChapterFour. The book started out as a ‘self help’ text on how girls going into servicecould stay out of trouble (i.e. retain their virtue), and is written in the formof letters. But Richardson became so engrossed in the situation and theresponses of his heroine that the story took on a life of its own. He himselfwanted to know how things would turn out and how Pamela could ward off hersuitor. From being a utilitarian activity with a particular aim in view, writingthe work became for Richardson an end in itself. Likewise, although Richardsondefended the work from criticisms of licentiousness by saying that it waseducational – that it ‘instructed through entertainment’, an early version ofour own ‘edutainment’ – it was clear that its appeal to its readers was lessinstruction (utility) than sheer enjoyment.12 [part0010.xhtml#rw-ref-note--12] Rainer Maria Rilke, The Notebooks of MalteLaurids Briggs trans.

In The Origin of Consciousness inthe Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind (1976), Jaynes argues that until 1250 BC,human beings were not self-conscious, in the way we are. Their consciousness was‘bicameral’, two-chambered, meaning that the communication between the right andleft brain, which we take as natural, had not yet been achieved. Jaynes arguesthat until then, human beings heard voices in their head, telling them what todo. They interpreted these as the gods, but in fact they were listening to theright brain. See Lachman 2003, pp. 143–49.18 [part0010.xhtml#rw-ref-note--18] Steiner’s writings and lectures on theevolutionary stages of consciousness are varied and diverse, but the ideapermeates practically all his work.

Blake was a member of the society, and it is just possiblehe was present when Saint-Martin made his visit. If so and if they did meet, ofthe two, Blake was truly the unknown philosopher.

THE PARTICIPATORY UNIVERSE [part0001.xhtml]As readers of this book may have concluded by now, my ideas about consciousnessand its relation to the world, as well as those of most of the thinkers I’vediscussed, are not those most commonly held by modern science. The basic ideaabout consciousness from the scientific point of view – acknowledging of coursethat this is a generalisation and that scientists quibble among themselves aboutthe details – is that it somehow emerged from matter, and that, as mentionedearlier, quoting Francis Crick, our joys, sorrows, memories, ambitions, sense ofpersonal identity and free will – not to mention everything else in our heads –are in fact ‘no more than the behaviour of a vast assembly of nerve cells andtheir associated molecules’. According to this account, at some time in thehistory of life on earth, what we call consciousness simply popped up, squeezedout somehow by organic matter, and through the application of purely accidentalforces, developed from some minimal state of proto-awareness into my ownconsciousness writing this book and yours reading it. Exactly when and wherethat initial blip of consciousness emerged is unknown, but we must assume itstarted somewhere. The organic matter out of which consciousness is thought tohave emerged was, according to modern scientific accounts, itself a product ofchance forces, and so for consciousness to have done the same is in keeping withthe whole temper of modern science’s explanations for things. In fact, as Iremark in Chapter 1, the basic scientific explanation for the universe, life,and consciousness is that ‘it just happened’. This conclusion is supported byyears of research, by hugely expensive experimental equipment, by stacks ofpapers and by well-honed arguments. But in the end I think my précis of it isunassailable. Give us the fact of the Big Bang scientists say, allow us this,and the rest follows. But if you say ‘All right, but please tell me why the BigBang happened?’, then the scientists will either say that you cannot ask thatquestion – it is not ‘scientific’ – or, as Stephen Hawking does, that it emergedfrom a ‘quantum fluctuation in a pre-existing vacuum’, which, as I remark inChapter 1, is a very abstract way of saying that it came out of a ripple innothing. Or, more briefly, that it just happened.The point here is that no one is in doubt that ‘life, the universe, andeverything’ – as Douglas Adams phrased it – happened. We want to know why ithappened. And by ‘why’ we do not mean ‘through what agency’ but ‘for whatpurpose’. And this is something science cannot tell us. ‘Because’ may be ananswer for children, but not for men and women who want to know why they exist.For all the rhetoric about closing in on the secrets of the universe, aboutcapturing the ‘God particle’ and other dramatic announcements, no one, notStephen Hawking, not Steven Weinberg, nor any other scientist, knows why the BigBang happened. They don’t and neither do I. It would be refreshing if, insteadof obfuscating this fact with rhetoric aimed at blinding us with science,someone would simply admit this. Some scientists do, but they are generallypresented as ‘mavericks’ or ‘outsiders’ or ‘pessimists’. This last tag isimportant, because, for all its fear of science – witness our concerns over GMcrops, nuclear energy, or the MMR vaccine – the public believes in science – BigScience – and wants it to give it directions, wants to know that it has answeredthe Big Questions – or that it soon will – so we can be done with them and justget on with life. But very rarely do scientists themselves explain how tentativetheir assessments of things are, or admit the uncertainty at the root of theideas on which they hope to base a ‘theory of everything’.The reasons for this are many and complex. Some have to do with keeping thingsupbeat, in order to secure funding and have public support. Some have to do withavoiding the opprobrium of their colleagues, with not losing their scientific‘street cred’, and appearing ‘soft’. And some have to do with the fear that, ifscience was shown to be less positive, less secure, then the bogey of God,religion, and the ‘bad old days’ would return. Hence the attention some atheistshave generated in their efforts to broadcast their views to the public.Scientists who have braved these concerns and ‘blown the whistle’ generally meetwith derision from their fellows and are relegated to the lunatic fringe.Witness the biologist Rupert Sheldrake and his important book The ScienceDelusion (2012), in which he argues – convincingly, to my mind – that muchmodern science lives on ‘promissory notes’.The phrase ‘promissory materialism’ comes from the philosopher of science KarlPopper, and by using it Sheldrake questions science’s tactic of assuring usthat, although its strict reductive materialist approach may not have all theanswers now, it will eventually. It will, science tells us, because it is theonly approach available to us, the only approach to knowledge and the onlyapproach to truth. Everything else is pseudoscience or imagination or mysticism;at any rate, something less ‘real’ than what they consider science. Sheldrake’sargument is that this kind of attitude is not true science, which is based onscepticism – that is, on questioning premises and keeping an open mind – butdogma, in the same way that the religious fundamentalism that science wants tosave us from is based on dogma. This is not science but scientism. But thefollowers of scientism still hold most of the cards, and so they can say thatwhat Sheldrake is doing isn’t science, but cranky pseudoscience. And althoughthe public is interested in this debate, any support for Sheldrake’s or anysimilar arguments is easily slotted into the ‘woolly new age’ basket and leftthere. We may be getting closer to the ‘paradigm shift’ more open-mindedthinkers have been talking about for decades, and Sheldrake’s work has certainlyhelped us reach this point. But we’re not there yet.SOME LOOSE STRINGSYet, if you do a bit of research, you discover that many of the certainties onwhich scientism is based are shaky indeed. For example, one of the central ideasin modern cosmology is ‘string theory’, a theoretical model that aims to unifyquantum mechanics and general relativity, two giants of modern physics that havehitherto refused to be wed. Relativity and quantum mechanics are both ‘right’but mutually exclusive. On the macro level of planets, stars, and galaxies,relativity reigns but down with the particles quantum is king, and theirantipathy to each other creates a kind of cosmic crisis, at least amongphysicists. Tying the knot between them with string theory will, many scientistsbelieve, finally wrap the universe up into a neat bundle, with no loose ends.String theory argues that, rather than elementary particles being dimensionless,they are actually one-dimensional oscillating lines or ‘strings’ – an imagethat, for what it’s worth, suggests to my mind both Pythagoras’ octaves and theold occult notion that reality is made up of different levels of vibrations.(Remembering my earlier remarks about dark matter, it does seem that in someways, contemporary science is finding its way to some old occult truths.)String theory and its cousin ‘superstring theory’ are both good contenders forthe still elusive ‘theory of everything’, science’s big push to finally explainit all. Yet according to some scientists, string theory is ‘not even wrong’.This is the title of a book by Peter Woit – Not Even Wrong: The Failure ofString Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law (2007) – showing howstring theory fails to meet Karl Popper’s ‘falsifiabilty test’ for something toeven qualify as a scientific theory. This is a challenge the strings have alsohad to face in Lee Smolin’s The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory,the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next (2007). Both books argue that stringtheory makes no predictions and cannot be tested, begging the question whetherit is a theory at all, and not a form of scientific theology. Nevertheless, itis a fundamental tenet of the ‘standard model’ and commands near absoluteobeisance in physics departments. Commenting on this situation, George Steinerremarks that regarding string theory, ‘So far, not a single new testableprediction has been made; not a single genuine theoretical puzzle has beensolved’, and asks ‘If string theory is immune to either proof or cancellation,if it is nothing but a mathematical game of great beauty and arbitrary license(“it can be made to mean anything” comments one ranking cosmologist) then is ita science?’1 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--1]Another glitch in the ‘theory of everything’ game is a problem known as Gödel’sTheorem. Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) was an Austrian American philosopher andmathematician, and he is famous for his two ‘incompleteness theorems’. Theessence of these is that in any closed system, there are propositions thatcannot be proved or disproved using axioms within that system. To be proved ordisproved, they must refer to axioms outside the system. With Gödel’s theoremsthere are no absolutely closed systems, which, it seems, would make a ‘theory ofeverything’ impossible, or at least turn it into something like those strange,recursive, self-referential works of M.C. Escher, with hands drawing each otheror stairs returning on themselves. A theory of everything would have to includethe theory itself as well as the theoriser and so on ad infinitum and would seemto enter the oddly unreal territories of reiteration, such as we find infractals. I am no physicist but my own belief is that after superstrings, wewill no doubt find something else, as with each of its secrets we uncover, theuniverse will add another one, perpetually pulling rabbits out of its hat, or,like a novel we are reading while it is still a work in progress, addingchapters as we go along.2 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--2] A ‘theory ofeverything’ would also seem to meet Wittgenstein’s definition of the ‘mystical’,and I somehow doubt that Hawking and the others in pursuit of this particularholy grail have this in mind. In the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921)Wittgenstein writes: ‘Feeling the world as a limited whole – it is this that ismystical’.3 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--3] How else, in a ‘theory ofeverything’, would the world be perceived except as a ‘limited whole’, although,as mentioned earlier, this leads to the logical problem of who would perceive itas such, as in order to perceive it as a whole, a perceiver would have to beoutside it, and if he were, then it could not be a ‘whole’ or ‘everything’?Wittgenstein also wrote that ‘even when all possible scientific questions havebeen answered’ – which, one imagines, is what a ‘theory of everything’ wouldwant to do – ‘the problems of life remain completely untouched.’4[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] So perhaps we should leave it at that.CONSCIOUSNESS EXPLAINED?There are quite a few other chinks in scientism’s armour, but the main ones thatconcern us are those regarding consciousness.5 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--5]I’ve already mentioned Francis Crick’s belief that everything passing through mymind as I write these words and everything in yours as you read them isultimately nothing but ‘the behaviour of nerve cells’. But Crick at leastassumes there is something called consciousness, something others in the‘explaining consciousness’ game are less generous about. The philosopher DanielDennett, for example, in his highly influential Consciousness Explained (1992)is much less charitable. Dennett’s five hundred plus densely written pages arededicated to the proposition that consciousness doesn’t really exist, that it isan illusion produced by the brain, and that we are all really robot zombies, whoonly think we are conscious. But as I’ve asked in a previous book, if that isthe case, then who does Dennett want to explain consciousness to? PerhapsNicholas Humphrey, who, like the rest of us, only thinks he is conscious, mayknow, as he too is eager to nail consciousness down. In Soul Searching (1995)and other works, Humphrey is at pains to lay the ghost of consciousness to rest,an aim driven perhaps by something more than scientific zeal. As he admitted atone point, ‘unexplained subjective experience arouses an irritation in me’, asentiment that ranks with James Lovelock’s call for anti-human ‘pre-emptivestrikes’ (Chapter 4) as high on my worry list.6 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--6]As a scientist, Humphrey is determined to reject anything that smacks of thesupernatural, and as consciousness as we usually understand it is immaterial,that is, not perceivable by the senses, it is fair game for this ghost buster.Another thinker with consciousness in his sights is the philosopher John Searle,author of The Mystery of Consciousness (1990) and other works. While critical ofDennett and other ‘explainers’ who want to eliminate mental phenomena, Searlehas no hesitation in reducing consciousness to an ‘ordinary biologicalphenomenon comparable to growth, digestion, or the secretion of bile’, a remarkthat puts him the same league as the eighteenth century French physiologistPierre Cabanis, who first declared, as Searle does, that the brain secretesthoughts as the liver secretes bile.7 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--7] Not onlywould this idea of equating thinking with other bodily functions not be amenableto Nikolai Berdyaev, but it would also mean that my grappling with Searle’sthoughts is on a par with digesting my lunch. Like Nicholas Humphrey, Searle iseager to ‘demystify’ consciousness, to take it down a peg, and to turn the‘mystery of consciousness’ into the ‘problem of consciousness’, a problem thatscience, and its ally reductive philosophy, will no doubt soon solve – anotherexample of Sheldrake’s ‘promissory notes’. To this end Searle is almostreligious in his repeated assertion that the ‘brain causes consciousness’. Weneed, Searle tells us repeatedly, to explain ‘exactly how neurobiologicalprocesses in the brain cause our subjective states and awareness’.A HARD PROBLEMBut that, as they used to say, is the $64,000 question. And no one has theanswer. Just as no one has the slightest idea why the Big Bang happened – if,indeed, it did – no one knows how or even if ‘neurobiological processes causeour subjective states and awareness.’ No one knows this, even though huge,difficult, and highly regarded books by eminent scientists and philosophersargue that pretty soon they will. No one does. It is, as is the case with otherpursuits of ‘promissory science’, an assumption. Yet, one question thatimmediately comes to mind is whether we need a brain at all to be conscious. AsI write in A Secret History of Consciousness, there are cases on record in whichindividuals who led highly active, fruitful, and intelligent lives, did soapparently with no, or extremely little, brains.8[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--8] Yet even leaving aside these difficult andfrankly bizarre cases, the mysterious problem of consciousness itself raisessufficient obstacles to the kind of explanation people like Dennett, Humphrey,Searle, Crick and others are looking for. There is, for example, the ‘hardproblem’ which wedges open what is known as the ‘explanatory gap’.The ‘hard problem’ is easy to state but difficult to answer. It is this. No oneknows how firing neurons become subjective experience, the kind that irritatesNicholas Humphrey. No one knows how Crick’s molecules become curiouslyintangible but highly meaningful things such as our joys, sorrows, memories, aswell as Crick’s thoughts about these. No one knows. No one has ever seen aneuron turn into a thought or a molecule become an idea, or even anythingremotely like that. I haven’t and I don’t believe anyone will. And this isbecause neurons, brain cells, and molecules are one kind of thing and ideas,thoughts, feelings, beliefs are another. I don’t believe that my brain ‘causes’my consciousness just as I don’t believe that my television set or radio ‘cause’the programs I watch or listen to with them. If I took apart my television setand examined every molecule of it, I would never find the ‘cause’ of the programI had just been watching. If I smashed my skull in I would certainly upset myconsciousness, just as if I smashed my television set I would be unable to watchwhat was on – something, I must admit, I am often tempted to do. But while my TVwould be broken, the program I was watching would be unaffected, and would stillbe running on millions of other TVs. I believe that my brain acts in some way asa radio or television receiver. It doesn’t ‘cause’ the consciousness I have anymore than my TV or radio ‘causes’ what is broadcast on them. My TV or radiotunes in to one program by filtering out the others. They are eliminative in thesame way that Bergson believed our brains and nervous systems are. Rather thancause my consciousness, my brain limits the amount of consciousness Iexperience. In this sense, consciousness is more like a radio wave than bile.Years ago the novelist Upton Sinclair wrote a book about telepathy called MentalRadio (1930). One wonders if Searle is working on Mental Bile.EXPLANATORY GAPSSo much for the hard problem which is a problem only if you are obsessed withreducing immaterial things like thoughts, ideas, feelings, and values, tomaterial things like neurons, nerve cells, and molecules. The ‘explanatory gap’is the yawning, impassable chasm between these two kinds of things.9[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--9] It is the unbridgeable gulf between apples andoranges or chalk and cheese, or, more precisely, between the refraction ofelectromagnetic radiation that constitutes a sunset and the mystical awe I feellooking at it. But it is only a gap for those who want to explain oranges interms of apples or cheese in terms of chalk or awe in terms of refraction. Andthis is not a question only woolly metaphysicians are interested in.According to Stuart Kauffman, a renowned theoretical biologist andcomplex-systems researcher who has done pioneering work in self-organisation –the process by which order arises out of disorder, or a cosmos out of chaos –‘nobody has the faintest idea what consciousness is … I don’t have any idea. Nordoes anybody else, including the philosophers of mind.’10[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--10] The German neuroscientist Wolf Singer isequally doubtful about the kind of equation between consciousness and brainsthat excites John Searle. ‘We encounter extreme difficulties’, Singer writes,‘when we attempt to explain how exactly the qualia of our subjective experienceemerge from neuronal interactions’.11 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--11] Asmentioned, qualia is a Latin term used to refer to inner experiences such aspain, taste, or the delight we feel in perceiving colour; it refers to the‘value content’ of mental experience, the difference between electromagneticradiation with a wavelength of 650 nm and the colour red. Particular neurons maybe involved in, say, my appreciation of a glass of wine. But the neurons and theappreciation are not the same thing, just as the words on this page and yourunderstanding of them are linked, but different.NONLOCAL NEURONSSinger’s work has focused on another central question of consciousness, what isknown as the ‘binding problem’. How, out of the mass of sensory and other dataimpinging on it – what William James called ‘the blooming, buzzing confusion’ –does the brain form a whole, a comprehensible unity, that we experience as ‘theworld’? Singer discovered that the answer to the ‘binding problem’ may be foundin the synchronised firing of neurons in different parts of the brain. Theneurons in question are not in physical contact with each other, but temporal.They are separated spatially but are linked by time. As the pioneeringneurophysiologist Charles Sherrington said, ‘Pure conjunction in time, withoutnecessarily cerebral conjunction [meaning not next to each other in the brain]lies at the root of the problem of the unity of mind’.12[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--12]Yet how do the different neurons, located in different areas of the brain,‘know’ when to fire so that they are all in synch? How do they know when to actin unison? Physical contiguity would explain an electro-chemical ‘message’passing from one neuron to another, but the neurons in question are notcontiguous. The effect is rather as if a hundred or so people, scattered acrossthe globe and without contact with each other, all knew when to perform someaction simultaneously, which would produce a co-ordinated meaningful result. Insome ways Singer’s idea is reminiscent of what is known as ‘quantumnon-locality’, the fact that under some conditions elementary particles not incontact with each other and not subject to a connecting force can be correlatedwithout any transfer of energy or passage of time – that is, simultaneously andat a distance. (Einstein didn’t like this idea of some ‘spooky action at adistance’, but failed to disprove it. 13 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--13]) Theidea also seems to have some resonance with ‘synchronicity’, the ‘acausalconnecting principle’ that C.G. Jung posited as responsible for the phenomena of‘meaningful coincidence’, those strange episodes when there is a direct butunexpected correlation between our inner and outer worlds, a connection not ofcause and effect but of meaning.14 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--14]Such ideas usually elicit an impatient ‘harumph’ from most scientists, butSinger is open to the idea of what we usually call the paranormal. Speaking oftelepathy – another form of ‘spooky action at a distance’ – and other suchoddities, Singer says that: ‘If only one of these parapsychological phenomenafinds a convincing scientific validation, then we have to admit that our braintheories miss a really essential ingredient … It is at least theoreticallyconceivable that there is a class of phenomena which are characterised by thefact that they are not repeatable … In this case our scientific approach isbound to fail’.15 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--15] The philosopher DavidChalmers, who has in many ways widened the ‘explanatory gap’ – and who JohnSearle subjects to a particularly robust drubbing – believes that no matter howmuch we learn about the brain, purely physical or materialist theories willnever reveal the secret of consciousness. For this belief, Chalmers and his likeminded colleagues have been dubbed ‘mysterians’ by their more optimisticopponents, as they want to hold on the ‘mystery’ of consciousness and not, likeSearle, to turn it into a ‘problem’. Chalmers’ own approach is much more in linewith the ideas of Bergson and Whitehead, who both posit a kind of‘pan-psychism’, in which everything in some way participates in consciousness,an idea we met with in the last chapter in Cleve Backster’s ‘primaryperception’.16 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--16] It may be that Iain McGilchrist,an expert in neuroimaging, sums up the situation best. ‘The fundamental problemin explaining the experience of consciousness,’ he writes’ ‘is that there isnothing else remotely like it to compare it with.’ This would, I think, excludebile.CONSCIOUSNESS EVOLVESGiven that the kind of definite explanation of consciousness sought for by manyscientists and philosophers does not seem to be forthcoming – or at least is asforthcoming as a ‘theory of everything’ – and that many eminent scientists andphilosophers are actually doubtful that it will ever be found, and given thatscientists such as Wolf Singer, a director at the Max Planck Institute for BrainResearch in Frankfurt, is open-minded about parapsychology, we can, I think,entertain some ideas about consciousness that are off the beaten scientifictrack. One of these is the evolution of consciousness, something we touched onin the last chapter.What I mean by the evolution of consciousness has nothing to do with Darwin’s‘dangerous idea’. I do not mean how consciousness evolved by chance out of ‘un’or ‘non-consciousness’, or how our chance consciousness evolved, under a varietyof environmental pressures, from some dim, vague awareness to our own acutesense of self and the world. As we’ve seen, in these and other mainstream ideasabout consciousness, it is ultimately a chance outcome, an epiphenomenon, ofsome physical or material reality. The evolution of consciousness I am thinkingof takes consciousness as fundamental and irreducible and not solely localisedinside our heads. Consciousness from this perspective did not emerge out ofmatter at some time in the past. Consciousness was there to begin with, and itwould be more correct from this perspective to say that matter emerged out ofit, a point we will return to.Consciousness is the bottom line reality. It is, I accept, a mystery, but it isone I have an immediate, direct awareness of – I am, in fact, immersed in it –and it is one that is inseparable from my having any experience at all.Everything I know comes to me through consciousness, from the most intimatepersonal detail of my life, to my knowledge of what is happening at the furthestfringe of the observable universe, to my questions about the infinitecomplexities of the human brain. Without consciousness there would be none ofthis.But consciousness is not static. It changes over time, both in the individual –me – and in the wider culture. And as consciousness changes, so does the world.As we saw in the last chapter, changes in human consciousness beginning in theRenaissance and carrying through to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuriesradically altered our ideas about and relationship to nature. It is only fromHusserl’s ‘natural standpoint’ that the world and our consciousness of it seemfixed. The kind of consciousness we find ourselves with, and which we believe isjust as ‘given’ as the world we find ourselves in, has developed out of earlierforms. From this perspective, the people of an earlier time did not live in thesame world as we live in, nor did they have the same kind of consciousness as wedo, something we looked at in our discussion of medieval tapestry andRenaissance perspective.Thinkers I have discussed earlier in this book – Bergson, Schwaller de Lubicz,Gebser, and others – have, in different ways, looked at the evolution ofconsciousness. In this chapter I am going to look at some ideas about thatevolution that, I believe, can help us find a way of understanding how we can‘repair’ the universe at a fundamental level. Indeed, these ideas can help us domore than repair it. They can help us take up our responsibility of beingco-creators of reality. As different thinkers have expressed it in this book,the cosmos is incomplete without our contribution to it. By the end of thischapter I hope I will have shown at least some ways in which we can make thatcontribution and what a world in which we are aware of making it would be like.BARFIELD’S PARTICIPATIONOwen Barfield, who we met in the last chapter, first came to the idea of anevolution of consciousness through a study of language. In his first book,History in English Words (1926), Barfield wrote that: ‘In our own language … thepast history of humanity is spread out in an imperishable map, just as thehistory of the mineral earth lies embedded in the layers of its outer crust. Butthere is this difference … whereas the former can only give us a knowledge ofoutward dead things, language has preserved for us the inner living history ofman’s soul. It reveals the evolution of consciousness.’17[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--17] What Barfield meant by an ‘evolution ofconsciousness’ is ‘the concept of man’s self-consciousness as a process intime’, an idea, he believes, that sums up the essence of Rudolf Steiner’sphilosophy.18 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--18] That is to say, it is the processthrough which we have arrived at our present self-conscious. What this means isthat, not only have our ideas about the world changed over time – the study ofthis change is known as ‘the history of ideas’ – but the consciousnessentertaining those ideas has too. An ancient Greek and a twenty-first centuryLondoner certainly have very different ideas about the world, but – as we saw inour discussion of the medieval and Renaissance world views – how they wouldactually see and experience the world would also be different. Barfield came tothis insight through a study of metaphor, how ‘figurative speech’ seemed to makethe world come to life, to make it more meaningful. (As we saw in Chapter 2,metaphor is a right brain way of understanding the world, which the left brainsimply doesn’t ‘get’, and the right brain is geared toward participating in aliving world.)Barfield recognised that this figurative, ‘living’ way of speaking, seemed to besomething more pervasive in the earlier stages of language, and that, bycontrast, contemporary language was much more prosaic; we live, as mentionedearlier, in what the literary philosopher Erich Heller calls ‘an age of prose’.Metaphors, Barfield realised, have an initial power to ‘shock’, to awakenconsciousness to new possibilities, to its ‘relationality’, how something is‘like’ something else. This is why we find great literature and poetry somoving. The first person to recognise that a woman’s face bloomed or that angerburned must have felt something like a mini-mystical experience. Yet over time,metaphors lose this power. They become, as Emerson remarked, ‘fossils’, or, asNietzsche said, like coins whose face has been worn down by use. Our everydaylanguage is full of metaphors we no longer notice, because their use is sowidespread and habitual that we take them for granted. So now, as I am trying tocapture these ideas so that you can grasp them, I no longer feel any ‘shock’ atthe notion that I can ‘capture’ an idea or that you can ‘grasp’ it – twometaphors we use unconsciously. (Ideas are not animals nor are they a hammer, oranything else I can pick up, except metaphorically.)In looking at language from an earlier time, Barfield recognised that it couldproduce this ‘shock’, just as poetry could, and the reason for this is that itwas much more figurative. Just as poetry can induce a sense of the world’shidden possibilities, language from an earlier time can as well, and this wastrue, Barfield concluded, because the consciousness of an earlier time wasdifferent from our own, and this difference is reflected in language. For thisearlier consciousness, he saw, the world itself was more living, more‘figurative’, and less ‘matter of fact’ than our own world is. But Barfield alsorecognised that the history of language seemed to move from the concrete to theabstract. ‘Whatever word we hit on,’ he wrote, ‘if we trace its meaning farenough back, we find it apparently expressive of some tangible … object or someactivity’. ‘The movement of meaning,’ he saw, ‘has been from the concrete to theabstract.’19 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--19] So our abstract concept of‘spirit’ as an immaterial ‘something’ has its roots in the Greek pneuma and theHebrew ruach, both of which designate an ‘indwelling soul’ but also the movementof air.To language theorists like the Oriental scholar and philologist Max Müller(1823–1900), who was extremely influential in the late nineteenth century, thissuggested that early language was made up of very simple literal words andphrases for tangible, sensible objects, and then gradually we began to use thesesimple words mistakenly, to refer to ‘spiritual’ realities. According to Müller,at some unspecified time, our ancestors began to use words ‘metaphorically’,that is, to more or less consciously write ‘poetry’ while describing theirexperiences, and through this ‘poetry’ confused metaphor or ‘turns of phrase’with actual but non-material realities. (This was thought of as a kind of‘disease’ of language, a belief that carried through into modern times, in avariety of ways: logical positivism, linguistics analysis, deconstructionism.)Barfield even jokes that, in order to account for the sudden rise of metaphorout of its literal roots, Müller has to posit a whole generation of poets, who,out of nowhere, suddenly began to spout wonderful verse, and that they passedthis habit on to the next generation and the next. Yet, Barfield thought, thiswould suggest that we, who have inherited this knack several millennia on,should be speaking poetry with every word, and that the poetry from an earliertime should strike us as less poetic. But Barfield saw that the exact oppositewas true: our language is much more prosaic, and, as he found in his studies ofearlier language, poetry from an earlier time strikes us as much more poetic.20[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--20] Modern poetry itself is in many ways reallylittle more than truncated prose, a tendency that began in Barfield’s time withT.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land (1922). What was wrong?The answer, Barfield saw, was that Müller and the language theorists whofollowed him looked at language from an unquestioned Darwinian perspective. Theyassumed that, just as simple organisms became more complex over time languagetoo must follow a similar path. It too must ‘progress’. So simple ‘root’ wordsdenoting sensible, tangible things gradually grew into our abstract, highlymetaphorical language. Yet, as Barfield saw, the evidence from language simplydidn’t agree with Müller. It was not the case that early man accidentally hit onthe clever knack of speaking figuratively, but that the world he perceived was,as mentioned, actually more figurative, more alive. Early man’s consciousnesswas different from our own, and hence the world he lived in was different too.Müller and those like him made the mistake of projecting how they saw the worldback into the consciousness of early man. Because of this, they then had toexplain how language, which they assumed started out as clichéd primitivegrunts, designating a simple this and that, became figurative. Hence theprehistoric poets.Barfield’s suggestion was much more interesting and much closer to what languageitself tells us. Early language is more figurative, metaphorical, and alive,because the world it was spoken in was too. It was a world much more inclined tothe kind of ‘picture consciousness’ Rudolf Steiner spoke of and which hebelieved was the kind of consciousness we experienced before the rise of ourmodern rational consciousness. It was a world, Barfield tells us, in whichconsciousness participated, that is, it ‘lived’ with it. It was not like theworld that Müller knew and which he projected back into the mind of early man, aworld of discreet, well-defined, stable, ‘objective’, ‘external’ things, but amuch more flowing, fluid, and connected world. (Readers will recall that this isprecisely the difference between how the left brain and the right relate to theworld.)THE ORIGIN OF ORIGINLanguage, Barfield tells us, did not arise out of an attempt to understand sucha world as Müller projected back into history, because such a world did notexist prior to language. It was not as if a consciousness like ours, but withoutlanguage, suddenly awoke in a world like ours – but without, of course, all ourtechnology – and hit on making sounds as a way of describing it. The polarity of‘nature/language’, or ‘world/mind’ did not arise one after the other butsimultaneously. It was not world first, then mind, or nature first, thenlanguage. There was no world for language to try to describe because there wasno world before language. This is why Barfield says asking about the origin oflanguage is like asking about the origin of origin.21[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--21] One doesn’t follow the other. Both are twosides of a whole. It is only we, who have become stranded on one side – theOther Side – who think that the kind of world we perceive must have preceded anyattempts to create a language to describe it. We perceive the kind of world wedo because of language.Just as child does not have a world until its consciousness begins to separateitself from everything around it, so too our ancestors did not have a world, didnot have nature, in the way that we do, because their consciousness was not asseparated from everything around them as ours is. As Max Scheler believed, we donot have to guess about someone else’s ‘inside’. We know it exists intuitivelybecause at one point our inside and theirs were the same. Barfield extends thisto nature and the world. Earlier in our evolution, we were as aware of nature’s‘inside’ as we were of our own; with it we shared in Cleve Backster’s ‘primaryperception’. Or, more precisely, our inside and nature’s was the same; we madelittle distinction between the two; certainly we did not recognise the kind ofrigid difference we do now, with ourselves alone having an inside and naturehaving none. Schwaller de Lubicz tells us that with the ‘intelligence of theheart’ we can ‘tumble with the rock’, ‘seek light with the rosebud’ and ‘expandwith the ripening fruit’; that is, with the ‘intelligence of the heart’, we canget inside things. Barfield is saying that what the history of language has toldhim is that, at an earlier time, we all shared in this intelligence. What Müllerand other language theorists saw as metaphor was this ability to ‘see’ nature’sinside. And not only to see it, but to share in it. Folk tales and myths aboutnature spirits, fairies, elementals, and legends of the gods walking the earth,are all echoes of a time when we and the world shared a continuity ofconsciousness, what Barfield called ‘original participation’.REPRESENTATIONTo this idea of an evolution of consciousness, Barfield wedded what he calls‘representation’; I have written about this elsewhere.22[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--22] In Saving the Appearances Barfield asks us toconsider a rainbow. We know that what we see as a rainbow is the result of raindrops, sunlight, and our own vision. Rainbows we know are not illusions, yet wealso know that they are not ‘real’ in quite the same way as other things are –say, a stone. Rainbows, unlike stones, appear only under special conditions. Tosee one, we need a sun shower and our line of vision to be at the right angle toit. Nevertheless, we all agree that rainbows are real. They are ‘really there’and are not an illusion or hallucination. Now Barfield asks us to consider astone, or, for that matter, anything that we all agree ‘really exists’ and whichwe ‘really’ see. We know what a rainbow is ‘made’ of. What about a stone?Even though to our touch a stone is a hard, solid object, science tells us thatit is really made of molecules, which are themselves made of atoms, which arethemselves made of electrons, protons, and neutrons, which are themselves madeof even smaller elementary particles, which are themselves held together by theHiggs boson which, we’re told, is a kind of glue, giving other particles theirmass. And there may indeed be even more elementary particles, or, if stringtheory is correct, oscillating strings or ‘superstrings’. These particles orstrings, however, are not solid things that are merely infinitely small. Theyare ‘probability waves’ ‘quantum fluctuations’, charges of energy, dimensionlesspoints, or other kinds of things which are not really things at all, and arebest described using arcane mathematical equations. The point is that, althoughwhen I reach out and touch the stone it feels solid and has a certain weight,what is ‘really real’ about the stone, according to science, is this fundamentalnon-physical ‘something’ of which it is made. The solid, heavy stone that I pickup is a ‘representation’ of this ‘something’, provided by my consciousness.Years ago, in The Nature of the Physical World (1928), the scientist Sir ArthurEddington explained that the desk he was sitting at was really two desks. Onewas the solid object on which his paper and pencil were resting, the other wasmade of atoms which, at their level, existed as stars do in space, with hugegaps of emptiness between them. Paradoxically, Eddington’s table was made moreof empty space than anything solid. Yet his hand and pencil did not pass throughit. That is because his consciousness very obligingly created the solid tablefor him, just as it very obligingly created his solid hand, and the solid pencilit was holding (they, too, were made of atoms). Or, more precisely, it‘represented’ the non-solid ‘something’ of which the table is made as solid. Itdoesn’t make the ‘something’ but forms a picture of it. Just as ourconsciousness forms a rainbow out of rain, sunlight and our angle of sight, italso forms Eddington’s table, and everything else around us, out of theparticles of which they are made. What we take as nature, the solid, physical,material, phenomenal world around us, is, science tells us, a representation ofthis fundamental ‘something’.23 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--23] Again,consciousness does not simply mirror a world already made, but reaches out andforms a world out of what is ‘there’. As the phenomenologist Paul Ricoeurremarked of Husserl’s ‘intentionality’, ‘seeing itself is discovered as a doing,as a producing – once Husserl even says “as a creating”. Husserl would beunderstood … if the intentionality which culminates in seeing were recognised tobe a creative vision.’24 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--24] In one sense then, theentire observable universe around us is a kind of rainbow. Or, as Eddingtonsaid: ‘The stuff of the world is mind-stuff.’A WORLD WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESSBarfield points out that although scientists agree that this solid world weencounter is really only a picture our minds provide of a world that isfundamentally nothing like it – something they have been telling us for decades– when talking about something like consciousness, they seem to forget this. Forone thing, they tell us what the world was like before there was anyconsciousness like ours around to represent it. But their accounts of this world– the prehistoric world of dinosaurs or even further back before life appeared –are, in all essentials, very much like that of a world with a consciousness likeours around to represent it. They forget that the world we see is arepresentation that our consciousness makes, and assume that such a world ismore or less the same as a world without our consciousness. But we have no ideawhat a world without our consciousness to represent it would be like. (And evenif we could go back to the ‘dawn of time’ to see how things were, it would stillbe our consciousness checking things out.) And, as we’ve seen, when talkingabout the origin of consciousness, they say it emerged somehow out of matter –in this case the brain – forgetting that the neurons and everything else we saythe brain is made of are a representation of the non-physical ‘something’ thatis the bottom line ‘really real’ thing. But if the hard, solid, physical worldis a representation our consciousness provides of something that isfundamentally not hard or solid or anything sensuous, how can it be the originof that consciousness? The physical world cannot be the cause of theconsciousness that creates it. Logic alone tells us that. But scientists andphilosophers like Francis Crick and John Searle seem to have forgotten this.People like Blake, we know, are aware of it, but then, Blake was only a poet.As mentioned, scientists have been aware of the participatory relationshipbetween the world and our consciousness, at least since Werner Heisenberg hitupon his ‘uncertainty principle’. Heisenberg’s principle undermined thenineteenth century notion of the scientist as some detached, objective,recording machine, whose subjectivity has been dutifully subtracted from hisobservation. Heisenberg recognised that the observer and the observed are in aninescapable intimate relationship, at least at the quantum level. He asks us toimagine a microscope able to detect electrons. Assume you want to observe anelectron ‘in the wild’, as it were, as if you were David Attenborough and weretrying to sneak up on it. The light necessary to see the electron travels downthe microscope. But since the light itself is made of particles – photons – thathave a certain energy, it collides with the electron and interferes with it –or, in Barfield’s term, participates with it. Hence your observation of theelectron alone has altered it. There is no such thing as a detached observer, atleast when it comes to electrons.A PARTICIPATORY UNIVERSESome scientists have taken this realisation and built on it considerably. We caneven say that the theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler (1911–2008)borrowed Barfield’s term ‘participation’ and ran with it, bringing it into areasof speculation that Barfield himself may have stayed shy of.25[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--25] Wheeler is responsible for coining such termsas ‘black hole’, ‘quantum foam’, and ‘wormhole’, but what concerns us here ishis notion of a Participatory Anthropic Principle, or PAP for short, an acronymopponents of his views may find consoling. The ‘anthropic cosmologicalprinciple’, we know, argues that our universe is so arranged that intelligentlife – such as ourselves – had to arise in it. Wheeler takes this further andsays that our universe is the way it is because of human consciousness, a notionthat, if expressed by a spiritual, metaphysical, or ‘occult’ thinker would belaughed at, but which, coming from a scientist, seems acceptable, or at leastworthy of consideration. Wheeler speaks of a ‘participatory universe’ and tellsus that the term ‘spectator’ should be stricken from the scientific record and‘participator’ put in its place. Wheeler proposed that not only does ourconsciousness participate in bringing into being the world we experience now –in what is known in particle physics as the ‘collapse of the wave function’, itis the interaction of the observer with the observed that decides whether ornot, say, a photon will behave as a wave or as a particle (Bohr’s‘complementarity’.) It is somehow responsible for bringing the past into beingtoo.26 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--26]In his fascinating book The Labyrinth of Time: The Illusion of Past, Present andFuture (2012) the writer Anthony Peake describes an experiment which supportsWheeler’s view. In 2007, at the École Normale Supérieure de Cachan in France, ateam of scientists shot photons through a device known as a ‘beam splitter’, akind of ‘half-silvered’ mirror. This allows half of the photons to pass throughunaffected, while the other half is reflected off it. Which photon is reflectedand which passes through is unpredictable, and large numbers are needed to getthe 50/50 effect. When unobserved, the photons are in a wave state, and henceproduce ‘normal’ wave behaviour, such as creating interference patterns whenmingling with other electromagnetic waves. As mentioned above, it is only whenan observer is added that the ‘wave function’ collapses, and the photons appearto act as particles. After hitting the beam splitter, both the photons that passthrough and those that are reflected are directed to a series of prisms andmirrors that lead them to a second beam splitter some 48 metres away. Here the‘split’ photons are reunited, and the usual interference patterns are detected.In the experiment, this second beam splitter could be turned on or off randomly,after a photon had already left the first splitter. If the second splitter wasleft on, the two paths taken by the photons were brought together and sent to asingle detector, where they created interference patterns – that is, acted likewaves. If the second splitter was off, the two paths were kept separate, and thephotons were sent to different detectors, where they acted like particles. Thesecond splitter ‘decided’ which path the photons would take and whether theywould behave like waves or particles. But the photons had already started ontheir journey when the second splitter was turned on or off. The future act ofturning the splitter on or off ‘decided’ the past action of the photon’s path.As Peake shows, Wheeler proposed a ‘thought experiment’ to support his‘participatory’ view, involving the results of what is known as the ‘two slit’experiment, but on a cosmic level.27 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--27] In the‘two slit’ experiment, photons are shot at a barrier in which two slits havebeen cut, forcing the photons to pass through them. If two particle detectorsare placed on the other side of the barrier, a photon passes through one or theother of the slits, and is detected by one or the other of the detectors. But ifa wave detector – a screen – is used instead of the particle detectors, thephoton then passes through both slits and leaves an interference pattern on thescreen. In other words, either the photons ‘know’ whether a screen or a detectoris waiting for them, and act accordingly, which seems unlikely. Or the act ofplacing either the screen or the detectors ‘makes’ the photons behave eitherlike a wave or a particle. The experimenter’s decision determines the results.28[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--28]Wheeler took this and applied it to light coming from a immensely distantsource, quasars, quasi-stellar objects that are very far from us but emittremendous amounts of electromagnetic energy. Quasars are so distant from usthat the light they emit and which we can detect takes billions of years toreach us. Wheeler believed that whether photons came from a present light sourceor from quasars, they would behave in exactly the same way as in the ‘two slit’experiment. Yet the photons from the quasar started their journey to earthbillions of years before life appeared on our planet. Just as the observer inthe ‘two slit’ or ‘beam splitter’ experiments ‘decides’ whether a photon acts asa wave or a particle, so too would the observers in Wheeler’s thoughtexperiment. But their observation is now ‘deciding’ on the character of lightthat left its source billions of years before Wheeler or anybody else existed.For Wheeler this led to the conviction that ‘we are participators in bringinginto being not only the near and here but also the far away and long ago. We arein this sense, participators in bringing about something of the universe in thedistant past …’29 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--29]FINAL PARTICIPATIONBarfield would no doubt recognise the significance of Wheeler’s speculation, buthis own concern was more about the phenomenal character of our experience – themacro world of nature – than the quantum, and he was more concerned with thefuture than the past. What concerned Barfield was our ‘representation’ of thatstrange ‘something’ that is not ourselves, what he refers to as the‘unrepresented’. If, Barfield reflected, our picture of the phenomenal world,the world of clouds, trees, stones, and also things like quasars, is a productof our consciousness representing the ‘unrepresented’; and if, as Barfieldbelieved, consciousness evolves, then our current representations werecorrelative to our current consciousness. Which meant that any futurerepresentations were dependent on our future consciousness.Barfield believed that the trajectory of the evolution of consciousness wasshaped like a U, and consisted of a movement from above to below and then backup again on the other side. He believed, as did Max Scheler, Jean Gebser, RudolfSteiner, and other thinkers I’ve discussed in this book, that consciousnessbegan in a unified state with what we call ‘nature’, and then graduallyseparated from this, until, with ourselves, we have reached the bottom of the U,when we are more or less completely separated from it – an extreme example ofthis being the ‘nausea’ depicted in Sartre’s novel. It is not the case, however,that we no longer participate with the ‘other’. We do, but we are unaware of ourparticipation, we are not conscious of it. Earlier we were unaware of it in aconscious sense as well, but we felt it, just as animals are unaware of theirparticipation but are nevertheless ‘in’ it (they always say ‘Yes’ to reality),or as children are unaware of their ouroboric relation to the world, butnonetheless feel it. As we are now, we neither feel it nor are aware of it.Hence our alienation. But, as we’ve seen throughout this book, there are momentswhen we do become aware of it – even if we do not speak of it specifically assuch. And poets, philosophers, artists, and mystics have felt it too. Barfieldbelieved that, having hit rock bottom, we were slowly working our way up theother side of the U, toward what he called ‘final participation’, a kind ofconsciousness in which we are consciously aware of and in control of theparticipation we had hitherto only shared in unconsciously. We are, we can say,slowly making our way to the regained ‘grace’ that Heinrich von Kleist spoke of.And, as Kleist said, this was something like the consciousness of a god.With this, however, comes responsibility, an important obligation for anycaretaker of the cosmos. Once we become aware of our role in representing theworld, a responsibility is incumbent upon us, a responsibility of theimagination.We have to remember that Barfield isn’t saying that we ‘create reality’, as somesuperficial new age teachings suggest, or as the equally superficial frivolityof postmodernism argues. I cannot, now, through an act of will, turn my studiointo a castle or my sofa into a rocket ship. Such an ‘anything goes’ sensibilityis the exact opposite of the responsibility of the imagination I am speaking of.Barfield summed up his concern in an elegant statement the sobriety of whichbelies its importance. ‘If the appearances are,’ he wrote, ‘correlative to humanconsciousness, and if human consciousness does not remain unchanged but evolves,then the future of the appearances, that is, of nature herself must indeeddepend on the directions which that evolution takes.’30[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--30]THE FATE OF THE EARTHThis statement warrants repeated re-readings. If our consciousness isresponsible for the phenomenal world, for stones as much as for rainbows, andif, as Barfield has shown, consciousness has evolved to its present state, withthe understanding that it is evolving still, then it follows that the fate ofthe phenomenal world, of nature and the cosmos, is not only in our hands, but inour minds. If this is the case, then we need to be ‘environmentally correct’,not only through all the ‘outer’ ways we are all familiar with: saving the rainforests, conserving natural resources, avoiding waste, developing renewableenergy, and all the other important and essential efforts through which we canfulfil what Rudolf Steiner called ‘our responsibility to the earth’. These areof course needed and there is no call to avoid them. But we need to think of the‘inner’ ways we can ‘save the planet’ too. This is because, if before weparticipated with the world unconsciously, now, having separated from it inorder to develop our independent consciousness, we are entrusted with the taskof learning how to participate with it consciously. Or, in the terms I usedearlier in this book, to perform tikkun. This means making our own consciousnessmore alive and active, more intentional and purposive, which means takingresponsibility for it. I can no longer rest in the ‘natural standpoint’ andaccept as simply given the world I see, just as I can no longer see myconsciousness as a passive mirror, simply reflecting that world. If the world isgiven, it is given by my consciousness, by that part of my mind that is involvedin ‘representing’, and it is only my ignorance of this fact that allows me to‘accept’ the world without a moment’s thought. But anyone who has followed thisbook so far can no longer claim such ignorance. If anything I have written herehas any value, we have gained some knowledge, and with that knowledge comeconsequences. It presents a good that we know, and as we know it, we should thendo it.One of the most bizarre things Rudolf Steiner said was that the future physicalbody of the earth would be determined by the kinds of thoughts people think now,just as the present physical earth was determined by the thoughts of earlierpeople. (Rudolf Steiner also said that our present Earth was ‘dying’, inpreparation for the next stage in its evolution.) We can take this with severalgrains of salt or chalk it up to madness. But if it is true, as Barfield, Blake,Gebser, Wilson, and others have argued, that our consciousness is intimatelyinvolved with what we call the physical world, in ways we are only justbeginning to grasp – and as I have shown, science itself is to some extent onour side here – then I think it is a reflection we would ignore at our peril.31[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--31] It is also a reflection that argues verystrongly against the idea that nature or the earth would somehow be better offwithout us. On the contrary, it is considerable support for the idea that we areessential to both, that we are, in fact, entrusted with something more than theresponsibility of caretakers, but of co-creators. Earlier we saw that JulianHuxley and Abraham Maslow believed that humanity had reached a stage at which ithad become responsible for its own evolution. Barfield, Steiner, Gebser, Wilson,and others agree. But to this we should add that we have become responsible forthe evolution of the cosmos too. As Barfield wrote: ‘The future of thephenomenal world can no longer be regarded as entirely independent of man’svolition’.32 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--32]This is about as far from the standard materialist scientific position as we canget. But if Barfield is right, then entertaining ideas about ourselves in whichwe are only ‘genetic drift’ or a chance outcome in a cosmic ‘Monte Carlo game’,or of our consciousness as merely ‘the behaviour of nerve cells’ or somethinglike bile, will clearly not do. If we think of our own minds – the seat of‘representation’ – as bile, or any other kind of ‘epiphenomenon’, in what waywill we think of anything else? If we diminish the importance of that which isresponsible for representing reality, what will our representations of it belike? To in any way applaud or revel in our insignificance, finding in that somevirtue, or to see ourselves as fleeting nothings in a meaningless universe that‘just happened’, is to embrace Maslow’s Jonah Complex on as fundamental level aswe can imagine. It would be an expression of the kind of false humilitySaint-Martin warned of, which breeds the laziness and cowardice that allow us toavoid the responsibilities and duties incumbent upon ourselves as repairers ofreality. It would, in fact, be the equivalent of leaving the cosmos in thelurch.COMPLETINGReaders may find the above reflections about participation somewhat extreme, yetthere are other ways in which we can recognise how our consciousness and theworld participate with each other. One of the clearest and most effective waysof experiencing this participation is those strange ‘meaningful coincidences’that C.G. Jung dubbed ‘synchronicities’, and which I mentioned earlier. Anyonewho has ever had a thought in mind and then seen it in the outer world at thesame time, with no causal link between the two, knows what I’m speaking of. On amore existentially immediate level than the quantum, these strange episodes areconvincing proof – at least for myself – that there is some continuity betweenwhat is going on ‘in my head’ and what is happening ‘out there’, that the wallseparating the two is, at least at times, permeable. Indeed quantum physics andother scientific ideas have been offered as aids in explaining or accounting forthis unsettling experience. Jung’s book, Synchronicty: An Acausal ConnectingPrinciple (1952) does precisely this, but to my mind it is ultimatelyunconvincing. Not that I am unconvinced about synchronicities – hardly. I havecollected notes about my own for decades now and am as convinced of theirreality as I am of anything else. But I don’t think bringing in the strangebehaviour of particle physics or postulating some kind of universal ‘acausalconnecting principle’ helps much in understanding them, although these ideas canhelp us understand that there is less of a distance between the inner and outerworlds than we believe. I’m more inclined to accept the idea thatsynchronicities are little taps on the head or pats on the back from someguardian angel, letting us know that, although things seem confused and muddlednow, we are on the right path after all. At least I have discovered that this isa more fruitful way to look at them, rather than as merely anomalous phenomenacalling out for an explanation.Synchronicities are more than mere coincidences, however surprising; they aremeaningful coincidences, and that meaning is usually of a very intimate,personal kind, the kind, Jung discovered, that can make all the difference tosomeone in the grip of a crisis, or looking for some hint of what path to takewith their lives. This means that they are not merely ‘weird stuff’ but have adeeper, more existential import. This suggests to me that in some way, my ownmind is involved in making them happen, that they are not simply something thathappens to me, but that on some level, my own mind reaches out and ‘arranges’events in order to get the message across. How this can take place, thenecessities and logical conundrums involved, are indeed baffling, and to behonest, I do not have a good argument for it. But perhaps this is one of thepurposes of synchronicities, to punch holes in our logic – an essential tool,but sometimes limiting – and to allow something else to arise. Colin Wilsonsuggests that when we are optimistic, living creatively, and are filled with asense of purpose – more ‘fully human’ – synchronicities happen more, and I havefound this to be the case. Most of the ones I’ve recorded in recent years havehappened while I was working on a book; appropriately I noted a few in my bookon Jung.33 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--33] In a way we can see this, as Wilsondoes, as an extension of Husserl’s intentionality, as a more direct andunmistakable way in which the mind ‘reaches out’ and shapes reality.But even in our more everyday experience we can see how our mind adds toreality, how it, as it were, ‘fleshes it out’. In his book Beyond the Occult(1988) Wilson speaks of what he calls ‘completing’. ‘Our minds,’ Wilson writes,‘are inclined to accept the present moment as it is, without question.’ This iswhat Husserl calls the ‘natural standpoint’. ‘In what we might call “neutralconsciousness”’, Wilson says, ‘we accept the present moment as if it werecomplete in itself’.’ [italics in original.] But, Wilson tells us, ‘a littlereflection reveals that this is a mistake of gargantuan proportions’.34[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--34] The truth, Wilson says, is that the presentmoment is always incomplete, and that ‘the most basic activity of my mind is“completing” it.’ Wilson asks us to imagine an alien somehow suddenly findinghimself on a bus in London. The world, which we take for granted as given andcomplete in itself would appear to him as chaos. He would have no idea of whatthings were – the same things that we believe just appear as full and completedto our consciousness. If he saw someone walking a dog, he would have no ideathat the dog was a pet, and that it wasn’t walking the man. If he saw someoneenter a car, he wouldn’t know that it wasn’t going to eat him. If he saw someonespeaking into a mobile phone, he wouldn’t know that it wasn’t conscious, andanswering him back. Our alien would know none of the things we do and which weassume are just there, reflected by our consciousness. But it is our knowledgeof things that gives them their meaning, their depth and reality, and providesthe connections linking them to everything else. (We can say that Sartre’s‘nausea’ is a result of faulty ‘completing’.) Try making the experiment oflooking at something and subtracting from it everything that you know about it.Try, that is, to see it just as ‘given’. It is very difficult and is thebeginning of phenomenology.We don’t even need to invoke an alien. A baby is equally unaware of the meaningsof things that we take as given. This is because a baby’s consciousness andinner world is not yet developed enough to perform the acts of ‘completing’ thatwe engage in all the time. That is precisely what ‘growing up’ and ‘getting aneducation’ is: developing our inner repertoire of meanings with which we cancomplete the world around us. A tourist in London who knew little of its historymay enjoy a stroll along the Thames, but someone who had some background inLondon’s rich past would see more, would grasp the reality of Shakespeare’sGlobe Theatre, as he would that of the Tower of London, or the old docksides tothe east. As Rudolf Steiner said in Goethe’s Theory of Knowledge, ‘When one whohas a rich mental life sees a thousand things which are nothing to the mentallypoor, this shows as clearly as sunlight that the content of reality is only thereflection of the content of our minds’. Philosophers and scientists who want toreduce our minds to the content of reality – the physical world – should re-readthis sentence several times. We do not reflect a reality that is already there.We provide that reality. Again, as Steiner said, ‘We receive from reality onlythe empty forms’. The ‘empty forms’ are the ‘bare facts’ of things, before ourminds complete them. Coleridge said the same thing when he wrote in ‘Dejection,an Ode’ (1802), unaware that he was echoing Blake (whose work he was ambivalenttoward): ‘We receive but what we give/And in our life alone does Nature live’.35[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--35]MAKING THINGS INTERESTINGOur ability to complete reality, however, varies with our own vitality andwillingness to make the effort of imagination required, as well as with ourattitude toward the world. If I am tired or distracted I can read a paragraphseveral times and still not ‘get it’. If I believe whatever I am looking at isuninteresting, then I will certainly make very little effort in contemplatingit. At other times, my mind may be so active and vital, and I may be soconvinced of something’s significance, that I see so many connections betweenthings that I am overwhelmed. This is what Ouspensky felt when contemplating hisash tray, and what we feel to a lesser degree when we are optimistic and ‘fullof life’ and find everything around us ‘interesting’. We are completing things abit more than usual, and sense the hidden meanings hovering around them. That iswhat their ‘interestingness’ is. We find something interesting because we arevaguely aware that, in the old saying, there is more to it than meets the eye,an adage we should make into a mantra, and an example of language itself comingto our aid. This is also what Whitehead meant when he said that we cannot arriveat ‘an adequate description of finite fact’ because such a description relies ona ‘background of presupposition which deifies analysis by reason of itsinfinitude’ – in other words, its ‘interdependent connection’ with everythingelse. To complete something completely would be to spell out its connections toeverything else in the universe. It would, in essence, mean coming up with atheory of everything, which could start with anything at all.Many people only see what is right in front of them; their imagination and willare too feeble, or they are too lazy, to see more than what is just ‘there’. Butimaginative, active people are always seeing the meanings that radiate out ofthe given, and are always connecting them to the rest of reality, either in thepast, the present, and the future. People of this sort can see the consequencesof their actions and can recognise more in things than their duller fellows can.On Primrose Hill, not far from where I live in Hampstead, there is a quote fromBlake carved into a stone curb overlooking the view of London’s growing skyline.It reads: ‘I have conversed with the spiritual sun – I saw him on PrimroseHill’. Many people taking in the view read the quotation and move on. Somewonder what it means. Some don’t notice it at all. But if, like myself, they arereaders of Blake and are aware of his mythology and ideas about perception, andknow that he had his experience with the ‘spiritual sun’ two centuries earlier,right where they are standing, they undoubtedly see more. They can see Blakestanding there, looking out over a London that was very different from the onethey see, and seeing a sun that was also very different from the one they see.And they see more, precisely in the way that Blake saw the spiritual sun: withtheir imagination, that is, with their mind alive and active and doing its jobof completing the world. Bernard Shaw once quipped that a picture gallery is adull place to a blind man. Without making the effort of completing, we are allin that department. We feel dull and bored and make the mistake of assuming thatthe world we are confronted with is dull and boring ‘for real’. It isn’t. By notcompleting it with our imagination we allow ninety per cent of reality to liefallow. Again, Goethe said it long ago. When a bored, exhausted Faust confrontsa world he thought he knew, and is contemplating ending it all, he is told: ‘Thespirit world shuts not its gates. Your mind is closed, your heart is dead.’36[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--36] When the mind is open and the heart alive, thenthe gates to the spirit world – the doors of perception – are flung wide, andeverything is seen as it is, infinite.NEW DIMENSIONSFor some philosophers, the act of completing – although they do not use the term– does its work by adding a new dimension to reality. At least this was whatErnst Cassirer believed. Like Whitehead and Bergson, Cassirer is anotherimportant thinker of the twentieth century who is little read today. His mostpopular book, An Essay on Man (1944), is a work of ‘philosophical anthropology’like Berdyaev’s The Meaning of the Creative Act and Scheler’s Man’s Place inNature (1928). In it Cassirer argued that: ‘as compared with the other animals,man lives not merely in a broader reality; he lives, so to speak, in a newdimension of reality.’37 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--37] This was, Cassirerargued, a symbolic dimension, that is, a mental, spiritual dimension. Man, hesaid, is a symbolic animal. Whereas other animals relate to reality throughinstinct and direct sensory perception, man understands himself and the worldthrough creating a symbolic universe, a universe of knowledge, meanings andideas, something Cassirer spelled out in detail in his magnum opus, ThePhilosophy of Symbolic Forms (1923–1929). Language, science, mathematics,mythology, art, philosophy, religion, literature: culture in all its formsconstitutes the symbolic world in which we live and which is unavailable toother animals.At the beginning of An Essay on Man Cassirer echoes an idea mentioned earlier inthis book: that mythological accounts of the origin of the world are invariablylinked to an account of the origin of man. ‘In the first mythologicalexplanations of the universe’, Cassirer writes, ‘we always find a primitiveanthropology side by side with a primitive cosmology. The question of the originof the world is inextricably interwoven with the question of the origin ofman.’38 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--38] In the mythological mind, Cassirerdiscovered, the world and man are one, something with which Barfield, Gebser,Scheler, Blake, Swedenborg and other thinkers discussed in this book wouldagree.This is once again a recognition that without man there is no world. It is alsoan echo of Saint-Martin’s dictum that we should not explain man in terms of theworld, but the world in terms of man. Cassirer shares with Barfield, Scheler,Gebser, and Rudolf Steiner the belief that we began in a kind of ouroboricembrace with nature and only gradually separated out from it to carve out ‘theworld’. ‘We cannot discover the nature of man in the same way that we can detectthe nature of physical things,’ Cassirer writes. ‘Physical things may bedescribed and defined in terms of their objective properties, but man can bedescribed and defined only in terms of his consciousness.’39[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--39] Like Berdyaev, Scheler, and others, Cassirerknows that the task of creating a ‘philosophical anthropology’ – a true accountof man – is not a mere ‘intellectual’ effort. It is a ‘clash of spiritualpowers’ within which ‘the whole destiny of man is at stake’.40[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--40] To which I would only add, echoing Barfield,that not only the destiny of man is at stake, but the destiny of the cosmositself. ‘If we were to know all the laws of nature,’ Cassirer writes, ‘if wecould apply to man all our statistical, economic, sociological rules, still thiswould not help us to “see” man’.41 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--41]Yet, as has been pointed out in this book, that is precisely what the explainersof man and consciousness want to do and what they persist in declaring to be theonly way in which to see man. But to see man in this way is to not see him atall. Man cannot be explained in terms of the laws of the universe, because thatuniverse and its laws are themselves the work of man. It is through man’sconsciousness, through his power to complete the world that a universe comesinto existence. There is no universe for animals, nor for planets, stars, northe billions of galaxies whose immense size and unthinkable distance from usseem to dwarf our own humble reality. But they dwarf us only if we ignore thatother half of our being, that new dimension that is possible only through thehuman mind, an insight that Cassirer shared with Julian Huxley and H.G. Wells.As we saw, Huxley believed that with the appearance of man, something differenthad entered the evolutionary process. And Wells once remarked that just as abird is a creature of the air, and a fish a creature of the sea, man is acreature of the mind. We share the air and the sea with the birds and the fish,but they cannot share the world of mind with us. It is a completely newdimension, a new world of reality, accessible only to us or to other ‘creaturesof the mind’. This is something so remarkable that to want to deny it seemsincredible. Without us reality would be less. Perhaps this is why, in creatingthe world, God purposefully made a mistake, so that, as some Kabbalists believe,we would be called in to finish the job. Reality needs us. To try to explainourselves in terms of what we share with the birds and the fish – as well as theworms of the earth – may indeed tell us much, but it will not touch the essenceof being human, or at least of being ‘fully human’. This is in fact the keymessage of this book. I do not deny that we share much with other animals. ButCassirer, Scheler, Berdyaev, and other thinkers I have drawn on tell us thatwhat makes us ‘us’ is not what we share with animals, but what is unique toourselves. And it is this uniqueness that people like John Gray, Jacques Monod,Stephen Hawking, John Searle, and other explainers deny.‘Not the material but the human world,’ Cassirer tells us, ‘is the clue to thecorrect interpretation of the cosmic order’.42 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--42]Cassirer explains that this is because speech, language, is at the heart of suchan order, something we have seen in Barfield, Heidegger, Saint-Martin, andPythagoras, who started it all. Language is so fundamental that we cannot evenbegin to grasp its importance. ‘We must … understand what speech means in orderto understand the “meaning” of the universe,’ Cassirer writes. If we fail inthis, if we do not find the way to this meaning through language and ourselves,Cassirer warns, then we will ‘miss the gateway to philosophy’.43[part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--43] Miss, that is, the gateway to wisdom. Thecentral importance of speech is that it is a creative act, and we are the onlyones who can make it. It is Adam who gives names to his fellow creatures in thegarden, not God. In this sense, the meaning of the universe depends on us; wewill not find it in the natural world, nor in the stars bordering the rim of theobservable universe. Only we can ask the question ‘what is the meaning of theuniverse’ and only we can provide an answer. Speech is an expression of mangiving shape and order to the world, something, Cassirer suggests, that alsocomes through in art. ‘Like all the other symbolic forms,’ Cassirer writes, ‘artis not the mere reproduction of a ready-made, given reality. It is one of theways leading to an objective view of things and of human life. It is not animitation but a discovery of reality’.44 [part0011.xhtml#rw-num-note--44] ‘Theartistic eye is not a passive eye that receives and registers the impression ofthings,’ he tells us. ‘It is a constructive eye, and it is only by constructiveacts that we can discover the beauty of natural things.’ This remark leads usback to our discussion of how consciousness itself is responsible for nature andindeed, for the entire cosmos we are endeavouring to save.OUR PLACE IN THE UNIVERSEWe can save the universe, we can repair it, take care of it, redeem it andawaken it from its trance by becoming aware of our creative contribution toreality and by intensifying our consciousness to such a degree that we neverlose sight of this fact. That is our place in the universe, and that, I submit,is the kernel of the work of the thinkers I have discussed. It is not so muchthat there is something particular and specific that we must do to take care ofthe cosmos. As Gershom Scholem says, there is no specific act of tikkun. We cancarry on doing what we normally do, but we must do it more consciously. We mustbecome aware of ourselves as active minds completing the world which, withoutus, would be empty, mute, and, from this perspective, an immense waste of time,nearly 14 billion years by most accounts.I would even go so far as to suggest that the only reason the universe ismysterious or even interesting is because we are in it. Would Big Bangs, blackholes, quasars, and Great Walls mean anything if they didn’t present us with thequestion of how we fit into this picture and why we are here? Without us theuniverse is merely an immense flux of cosmic gas and dust, going nowhere, doingnothing, and to be impressed with that is a delusion, is, in fact, idolatry, thekind Blake attacked in his ‘mental fight’. Or, if it is not this, then merely acollection of mathematical equations that need a consciousness like our own todecipher them. To not be a waste, to not be a failure, it needs us. Each act ofcreative consciousness is an act of tikkun, an act of redeeming the universefrom pointlessness, and we can perform it at any time. We do not need JohnWheeler’s speculations about how we can change the past. We can change it eachtime we become fully human, by making everything that led up to that momentworthwhile, transforming meaningless events into a chain of destiny. That is thealchemical secret of turning lead into gold, or water into wine, or death intolife. We cannot shirk this duty. The universe needs our help and we cannot letit down. In the last chapter of this book I will take a look at what might be instore for the universe, and ourselves, if we don’t get to work.6. THE PARTICIPATORY UNIVERSE1 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--1] Steiner 2008.2 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--2] This, in a sense, can be seen as a version ofthe ‘turtles all the way down’ theory of the universe. There are differentversions of the story, but in one, the philosopher Bertrand Russell gave alecture in which he described how the earth orbited the sun, and the sun orbitedthe centre of the Milky Way. At the end of the lecture an old woman stood up andtold Russell that what he had just lectured on was nonsense. The earth, shesaid, was a flat plate lying on the back of an enormous turtle. Russell smiledat the woman and asked, ‘And what is the turtle standing on?’ ‘You are veryclever, young man’ the woman said, ‘very clever indeed. But I’m afraid itsturtles all the way down.’3 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--3] Ludwig Wittgenstein TractatusLogico-Philosophicus (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1969) p. 149.4 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--4] Ibid.5 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--5] A very readable and fascinating account of theuncertainties inherent in modern science can be found in Lynn Picknett and ClivePrince’s The Forbidden Universe (London: Constable, 2011).

The closest wecome, at least according to science, are the kind of mathematical expressions Imention. If these are indeed what reality is really like, then ourrepresentation of it is an immense falsification, just as the sumptuous coloursof a sunset are a ‘falsification’ of electromagnetic radiations, which, withoutthe eye to interpret them, are colourless. Hence Blake’s dictum that ‘Where manis not, nature is barren’, an insight he shared with at least one philosopher ofscience. Alfred North Whitehead remarked that the materialist picture of theuniverse revealed a nature that was ‘a dull affair, soundless, scentless,colourless; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly’. Agreeingwith Blake, Whitehead said that in their praise of nature ‘the poets areentirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to themselves, and shouldturn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellency of the human mind.’Science and the Modern World (New York: Macmillan, 1925) p. 77.24 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--24] Quoted in Colin Wilson Superconsciousness(London: Watkins, 2009) p. 172. Paul Ricoeur Husserl: An Analysis of HisPhenomenology (Northwestern University Press: Chicago, 1967) p.547.25 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--25] Wheeler began using the term ‘participation’in his account of the universe in 1983. Barfield used it in Saving theAppearances as early as 1957, although the central theme of a continuity betweenthe inner and outer worlds had informed his thought since 1926 and History inEnglish Words. And of course, the notion that the mind and reality were in someway ‘one’ reaches back into our religious, philosophical, and spiritual past.The phrase ‘Tat tvam asi’, ‘Thou art that’, for example, expressing theessential unity between the human mind and the Ultimate Reality, appears in theChandogya Upanishad, which is generally thought to have been written sometime inthe first millennium BC. Wheeler, who, unlike Wolf Singer, had no time for theparanormal and famously called for parapsychologists to be expelled from theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, is naturally considered oneof the great minds of our time, and his ‘participatory’ notions are thought tobe breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe. Barfield, who was therewell ahead of him, is barely known outside of Anthroposophical circles or toreaders of C.S. Lewis (he was Lewis’ great friend). When I mentioned him once toan academic friend, he remarked ‘You mean that Coleridge looney?’ Barfield hadwritten a book entitled What Coleridge Thought (1971). There is no justice inintellectual history.26 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--26] Marshall and Zohar 1997, pp. 221–23.27 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--27] Anthony Peake, The Labyrinth of Time: TheIllusion of Past, Present and Future (London: Arcturus Publishing, 2012) pp.109–11.28 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--28] Marshall and Zohar 1997, pp. 112–13.29 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--29] Quoted in Peake 2012, p.109.30 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--30] Barfield 1957, 144–45.31 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--31] I say to some extent, because althoughWheeler and the scientists who follow his lead use the term ‘participation’ theydo not share Barfield’s, Wilson’s and others’ belief that our own volition – ourwill – can increase our participation. Theirs is a ‘participatory universe’ but,like earlier scientific models, it is a passive one. That our consciousnessparticipates in the universe is for them as much a ‘law’ as is gravity. Forpeople like Barfield, the idea is to consciously increase our participation, andhence freedom. And by consciously increasing our participation, we do not thengain greater control over the things that make up our world, but of our pictureof that world, just as while I cannot control what takes place in a televisionprogramme I am watching, I can control the quality of the picture on the screen;i.e., increase or decrease the focus, clarity, and so on.32 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--32] Barfield 1957 p. 160.33 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--33] See Lachman 2010, p.241 n31, p. 242 n41, pp.246–47 n13.34 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--34] Colin Wilson Beyond the Occult (London:Bantam Press, 1988) p. 327.35 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--35] Coleridge’s friend, Thomas De Quincey, the‘English Opium Eater’ added to this insight when he once remarked, apropos ofopium’s power to elicit dreams, that if a man’s head was full of oxen, he woulddream of oxen too. Meaning that the drug itself – whether opium, LSD, oranything else – did not provide poetic or visionary dreams, but only releasedwhat was already in the drug taker’s mind. De Quincey’s drug experiences areinteresting to read about because his head was full of literature, philosophy,art, history and not oxen, something that is true of Aldous Huxley and otherbrilliant writers who have also written about their drug experiences. Their drugexperiences produced literature, because they had the material for literaturealready in their heads. In heads not so well furnished it may produce merely aninarticulate ‘wow’.36 [part0011.xhtml#rw-ref-note--36] Faust Part One.

AS FAR AS THOUGHT CAN REACH [part0001.xhtml]In the first decades of the last century, the question ‘What is Man?’ took on anew and confusing complexity. Developments in science, in psychology, inanthropology, sociology, history and other related fields had increased at sucha speed and had produced such a wealth of new and complicated data that the ideaof arriving at a complete idea of man, which could accommodate all this newinformation, seemed beyond our grasp. The earlier, simpler definitions of man asthe rational animal, or as a creature of God, or as the bearer of certaininalienable rights, could no longer suffice, and it seemed that there was nosingle answer to the question of who or what we are. There was economic man asseen by Marx, man the pursuer of the will-to-power as seen by Nietzsche, man the‘trousered ape’ as seen by Darwin, man the repressed neurotic as seen by Freud,and many other versions. But there was no agreement among them, and althougheach individual perspective seemed to provide some stable foundation forunderstanding ourselves, one had only to turn to the next to find the firstundermined. If the admonition to ‘know thyself’, the bedrock of westernphilosophy, had always been difficult to fulfil, by the early part of thetwentieth century, it seemed downright impossible. It was in this climate ofself uncertainty that philosophers like Cassirer, Scheler, Berdyaev, and otherssought to anchor our identity in what they called a ‘philosophicalanthropology’.The irony was that it was knowledge itself that had obscured our self-knowing.In a chapter of An Essay on Man entitled ‘The Crisis in Man’s Knowledge ofHimself’, Cassirer wrote that: ‘No former age was ever in such a favourableposition in regards to the sources of our knowledge of human nature. Psychology,ethnology, anthropology, and history have amassed an astoundingly rich andconstantly increasing body of facts. Our technical instruments for observationand experimentation have been immensely improved, and our analyses have becomesharper and more penetrating.’ ‘When compared with our own abundance,’ Cassirerwrote, ‘the past may seem very poor.’ Yet Cassirer also pointed out that ‘ourwealth of facts is not necessarily a wealth of thoughts’ and he warned that‘unless we succeed in finding a clue of Ariadne to lead us out of thislabyrinth, we can have no real insight into the general character of humanculture’ – Ariadne’s thread, of course, being the means by which the Greek heroTheseus was able to escape from the labyrinth of the monstrous Minotaur. Withoutsuch a thread, Cassirer believed, ‘we shall remain lost in a mass ofdisconnected and disintegrated data which seem to lack all conceptual unity’.1[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--1]In saying this Cassirer was echoing a concern Max Scheler had voiced some yearsearlier. In Man’s Place in Nature Scheler wrote that: ‘In no other period ofhuman knowledge has man become ever more problematical to himself than in ourown days’. ‘We have,’ Scheler says, ‘a scientific, a philosophical, and atheological anthropology that know nothing of each other. Therefore we no longerpossess any clear and consistent idea of man. The ever-growing multiplicity ofthe particular sciences that are engaged in the study of man has much moreconfused and obscured than elucidated our concept of man.’2[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--2]In Being and Time (1927), Martin Heidegger, a colleague of Scheler and anopponent of Cassirer, devised his own philosophical anthropology, yet hebelieved much as they did. ‘No other time,’ Heidegger wrote, ‘has had so muchand varied knowledge of man as ours. No other time has expressed its knowledgeof man in so impressive and striking a way. No other time could supply thisknowledge so quickly and easily. But on the other hand no other time knew lesswhat man is than ours. Man has never become so questionable as in our time.’3[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--3]This sense of crisis, of confusion and ambiguity about man and our place in theworld, permeated much of the thought of the first half of the last century.Whitehead wrote about it in Science and the Modern World and even Husserl, whosought to secure for philosophy an unshakeable foundation of certainty,succumbed to the general doubt, as can be seen in his late unfinished work TheCrisis of the European Sciences (1936). If Pico della Mirandola could declare,in his Oration on the Dignity of Man, that what was most worthy of wonder wasman, by the time Cassirer raised his concerns, one could only wonder what manwas.Cassirer believed that this mass of disconnected information about ourselves ledto a complete ‘anarchy of thought’. The ‘modern theory of man has nointellectual centre’, no ‘general orientation’ and left one with a sense ofconceptual paralysis.4 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--4] But such a dizzyingexplosion of unrelated facts, Cassirer believed, posed more than a philosophicalor scientific problem. It also posed a threat to our ethical and cultural life.If we do not know who we are, how can we lead ethical lives? How can we continueto create, to inhabit the symbolic universe that is uniquely ours? What valuescan we uphold and strive to actualise? If we do not know what the human is, howcan we recognise the inhuman? When Cassirer’s Essay appeared, he had left hisnative Germany and had settled in America, in order to escape a brutal regimethat seemed to have taken advantage of our uncertainty about who man is, inorder to actualise its own inhuman version of him. Hitler’s Germany wasn’t theonly place where such a redefining of the human was taking place. In Stalin’sRussia what it meant to be man went through some changes too, and in many partsof the world, the process is still going on.THE LAST MENI do not think it requires a great deal of argument to show that today, afternearly a century of living through this identity crisis, we are nowhere nearresolving it. Which is not to say that we are still troubled by it. If anything,the mass of disconnected information about ourselves and practically everythingelse has increased a hundredfold and we are subject to new revelations about whowe are – or aren’t – almost daily. What Cassirer or Scheler would have made ofthe internet, Wikipedia, Google, and other sources of our increasing ‘wealth offacts’ is unknown, but I suspect these developments would only have motivatedthem to increase their efforts to warn us of the dangers of drowning in a floodof information that does nothing to help us understand ourselves but rather onlyadds to our already weighty burden of confusion. With each new ‘discovery’binding us ever more closely to our selfish genes, to our animal past, to themolecules in our brain’s nerve cells, or to an empty, meaningless universe thesecret of which can be found in an infinitesimal particle – or perhaps in thevibrations of strings – the idea of ‘knowing ourselves’ in the Socratic sense,seems increasingly out-dated, much as the idea of sin already is in our secularworld. Cassirer believed that man ‘is that creature who is constantly in searchof himself – a creature who in every moment of his existence must examine andscrutinise the conditions of his existence.’5 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--5]Yet today, in our post-modern world, it seems we have already discovered who weare, if the ‘scientific’ picture of ourselves that enjoys increasing authorityis anything to go by. And the answer is: nothing special. This redefinition ofman will, I think, be involved in some radically different forms of human lifeas this century moves on.This conclusion may relieve us of the burden of mystery that troubled ourancestors, and the dread and anxiety that distressed existentialists only half acentury ago may no longer be ours. Much of post-modern thought sees the kind ofuncertainty about ourselves that kept angst-ridden earlier generations up atnight as little more than a cosmic joke, and wonders, with much of moderncosmology, what the fuss was all about. We accept that there is no reason forour existence and that the universe is too big to even notice we are here, if itcould notice anything at all. There’s no reason for anything, it tells us, soget over it and have fun. Post-modern thought has set us free. We have beenliberated from the demand to be great and relieved of the obligation to besomething better than ourselves. We can embrace our mediocrity with a goodconscience and sleep better at night. What more can we ask of philosophy?Nikolai Berdyaev had a word for this self-satisfaction. In The Destiny of Man(1937) he speaks of what he calls ‘smugness’. We know of course what smugnessis, but with Berdyaev it takes on a broader, more metaphysical meaning.‘Smugness,’ Berdyaev writes, ‘frees man from fear not through rising to higherspheres but through sinking to the lower.’6 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--6] Itis a way of acclimatising ourselves to a lower place, a kind of metaphysicalsour grapes, a contentment with the banality of life, with Heidegger’s‘triviality of everydayness’. It allows us to be at home in a world withoutmeaning, without significance, without cosmic drama. It finds a cosy place foritself in the commonplace, where it can forget the existence of any kind of‘other’, more important world, and feel thoroughly satisfied that it has doneso. We may have emancipated ourselves from the existential cares of an earliergeneration, but such emancipation ‘brings with it the danger of vulgarisinglife, of making it flat, shallow and commonplace’.7[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--7] Such, I believe, is our post-modern world.Post-modernism ‘ironises’ out all questions of meaning. It reduces everything tothe ‘been there, done that’ mentality, and shrinks the world to a theory ofeverything that can fit on a T-shirt. It lets us off the hook. We no longer haveto be good, just good enough. It lowers the existential bar, and moves themetaphysical goal posts closer, or gets rid of them entirely.In Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883–85) Nietzsche speaks of those he calls ‘the LastMen’ (some translations have the ‘Ultimate Man’). ‘“What is love? What iscreation? What is longing? What is a star?” Thus asks the last man, and heblinks. The earth has become small, and on it hops the last man, who makeseverything small … “We have invented happiness,” say the last men, and theyblink …’ ‘No shepherd and one herd. Everybody wants the same and everybody isthe same. Whoever feels different goes voluntarily into the madhouse.’ ‘One isclever and knows everything that has ever happened; so there is no end ofderision. One still quarrels, but one is soon reconciled …’8[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--8]Earlier Zarathustra had hoped to get the people interested in his idea of theÜbermensch, the ‘overman’ who has transcended himself and become something more.But the people weren’t interested. Instead, they wanted to know more about these‘last men’ and they ask Zarathustra to turn them into them. The last men prefercomfort and pleasure to the hardships ‘overmen’ must pursue. Discouraged,Zarathustra leaves them.Are we the last men? Do we prefer comfort and pleasure to facing up to the tasksof being ‘fully human’, which is really all that being ‘overman’ means?Ironically, today Nietzsche is seen as a forerunner of post-modernism, yet hehas more in common with Blake, Kazantzakis, Berdyaev, Saint-Martin and othersdiscussed in this book than with the thinking of the ‘last men’, who lack thewill to be creators and avoid the challenge of giving meaning to their lives.Such irony isn’t lacking in Nietzsche’s career; we know he was appropriated bythe Nazis, too. And he saw it coming. So perhaps it is appropriate that aprophet who warned us of the last men should be appropriated by the very lastmen he warned us about.THE END OF THINGSThat we live in a kind of ‘end times’, regardless of any actual imminentapocalypse, has been the case for some decades now. Thinkers as far apart asMichel Foucault and Francis Fukuyama have written about the ‘end of man’ and the‘end of history’.9 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--9] Deconstructionism hasdeclared the end of philosophy. Some critics have even written about the end ofscience.10 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--10] Even bastions of western culturehave accepted that things are in decline. In From Dawn to Decadence (2001), acultural history of the west from the Renaissance to the present day, JacquesBarzun (1907–2012), witness to practically the whole of the last century, spokeof ‘the Great Undoing’, western culture’s self-immolation at the hands of chatshows, gangsta rap, and post-modernism, and what he sees as an unravelling offive centuries of progress into a morass of conflicting values. In Grammars ofCreation (2001) George Steiner argues that ‘there is … in the climate of spiritat the end of the twentieth century, a core tiredness’. ‘We are latecomers,’ hetells us, at the banquet of western thought, where ‘the dishes are beingcleared’.11 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--11] Even pop music picked up the cue.In 1987 the band REM released ‘It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And IFeel Fine)’, a post-punk stream of consciousness rap that seems to sayeverything’s going up in flames but it doesn’t matter. When the Sex Pistolsreleased ‘Anarchy in the UK’ a decade earlier, the idea of social collapse wasthreatening. By now it’s a dance tune.But these are local events, related to the provincial affairs of westernculture. What about the cosmos itself? The idea of the end of the world has beenaround practically since civilisation began, but since the nineteenth centuryits traditionally religious or mythical character has been superseded by arigorously scientific one.12 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--12] In 1865 the Germanphysicist Rudolf Clausius introduced the notion of entropy. Clausius hadobserved that over time, in a closed system, organised energy – for example heat– tends to move toward a less organised, uniform state. (This is why a cup ofcoffee cools to room temperature.) As the ‘second law of thermodynamics,’ thissuggested that eventually, the organised energy in the universe would dissipateuntil it formed a kind of lukewarm cosmic puddle, unable to support life. Thisirreversible process was known as the ‘heat death’ of the cosmos. For all theprogress associated with the Industrial Revolution and the nineteenth century, asense of futility had entered things, a feeling for which can be found inMatthew Arnold’s famous poem ‘Dover Beach,’ with its images of ‘ignorant armiesclashing by night’ upon ‘a darkling plain’. The eventual outcome of theuniverse’s ‘heat death’ was perhaps most eloquently, if depressingly, put by thephilosopher Bertrand Russell. Because of it, Russell tells us, ‘all the labourof the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration, all the noonday brightnessof human genius are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solarsystem, and that the whole temple of man’s achievement must be buried beneaththe debris of a universe in ruins – all these things … are yet so nearly certainthat no philosophy which rejects them can hope to stand’. Some years later,Russell made the point even clearer. ‘The second law of thermodynamics,’ hesays, ‘makes it scarcely possible to doubt that the universe is running down,and that ultimately, nothing of the slightest interest will be possible anywhere… So far as scientific evidence shows, the universe has crawled by slow stagesto a somewhat pitiful result on this earth and is going to crawl by still morepitiful stages to a condition of universal death’.13[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--13] The universe may have started with a bang –although when Russell gave his lecture the notion of a Big Bang had yet toappear – but, to take a cue from T. S. Eliot, it will apparently end with awhimper.14 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--14]If this wasn’t enough to suggest there was nothing much to get excited about,more recent ideas about the eventual fate of the universe seem to clinch it. Onesuch is the notion of the Big Crunch. In this scenario, some billions of yearsfrom now, the universe will rebound on itself, like a rubber band stretched toits limit and then let go. The expansion of the universe started by the Big Bangwill eventually slow down, and the gravitational pull of its matter will startthe reverse process, with one possibility being that all the objects in theuniverse will collapse on themselves and create a single black hole – or‘singularity’ – although what it will be a black hole in is unclear. Somescientists believe that this may then restart the cycle, with another bang andanother universe, but by this time we, or anyone like us, will not be around toknow. An even more recent contender, though, suggests that the Big Crunch willnot be the way things go. It seems increasingly likely that, rather than cometogether in a great cosmic hug, all the interminable galaxies will move furtheraway from each other, until eventually each one will be left all to itself,amidst vast black emptiness. This will be the result of what is called ‘darkenergy’, another ‘something’ that science suspects is there, but knows verylittle about. Dark energy is a hypothetical form of energy that scientistssuspect exists, because its possibility can account for otherwise unaccountableobservations about the universe. Its central characteristic is that it isresponsible for an acceleration in the universe’s rate of expansion. Accordingto this scenario, not only is the universe expanding, but its expansion isspeeding up, and dark energy is the reason why. This would mean that eventually,bodies outside what is called our ‘super cluster’ (relatively local galaxies)would move so far away from us and at such a speed that they would becomeinvisible. Our ‘observable universe’ then would empty out, and we would observetruly empty space.While this Big Drift would leave our own Milky Way unscathed, an even darkerinterpretation of dark energy suggests that it would continue to operate,eventually dominating all other forces in the universe, even gravity. This wouldmean that galaxies and solar systems themselves would fall apart, their cohesiondissolved by the ubiquitous dark energy. But it won’t stop there. Dark energycould even corrode the electrical and nuclear forces holding atoms together,disintegrating everything in what is known as the Big Rip, as if a loose threadhanging from reality was pulled until the whole fabric of space and time wasundone.MANY WORLDSAdmittedly, all these possible ends of the worlds are a long way off, and mostlikely we will not be around in any way or form to observe them. Climate change,global warming, overpopulation, loss of natural resources, or even a rogue statemay start the process of our species checking out long before the universe does.But if the notion of a Big Crunch, a Big Drift, or a Big Rip keeps you awake atnight, science can offer some consolation. Throughout this book I’ve mentionedwhat is known as the anthropic cosmological principle, which, in its simplestform, suggests that our universe is one in which intelligent life like our owncan appear – which seems rather obvious, since I am here writing about it andyou are here reading about it. A stronger version suggests that our universe isone in which intelligent life like ourselves had to appear. There are just toomany ‘cosmic coincidences’ necessary for living beings like ourselves to haveappeared, for it to be the case that life ‘just happened’, Jacques Monod’s MonteCarlo game notwithstanding. We seem to live in a ‘Goldilocks’ universe, withconditions being ‘just right’ for us to turn up.Years ago, I worked as a science writer for the University of California, LosAngeles, and I interviewed one of the department’s astronomers who worked onthis question. One of the ‘just rights’, he told me, were gas giants like theplanets Jupiter and Saturn, familiar figures in our solar system but apparentlyextremely rare elsewhere. Jupiter and Saturn, he explained, were important forlife forming on the earth, because they shield our planet from meteorbombardments. Jupiter, he said, is ‘a garbage man of the solar system, shieldingus from objects that would have hit us’.15 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--15]There are many other such ‘just rights’. The expansion of the universe itself isone of them. If the gravitation had been just slightly stronger in the earlyuniverse, the Big Crunch would have happened already and neither we nor anythingelse would be here. But if it was just slightly weaker, then stars and galaxiesmight not have formed, and again, we wouldn’t be here. Our distance from the sunis another ‘just right’. A little bit closer and it would be too hot for life, alittle further and it would be too cold. But just like Goldilocks’ porridge,where we are is ‘just right’. Many books have been written spelling out thevarious other ‘just rights’ – John Gribbin’s Cosmic Coincidences (1989) is agood start – but the basic idea is that, as Danah Zohar remarks, ‘Out of all thepossible values the physical constants of the universe might have had, theyseem, improbably, to have arrived at the narrow range of constants that favourthe existence of carbon-based life forms’.16 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--16]That is, us.Understandably, not all scientists are happy with the idea that we live in auniverse that seems somehow designed to produce us. In the first place it meanswe are not the chance occurrences that traditional science has said we are – nota lucky hit on the cosmic Monte Carlo game or some of Lovecraft’s accidental‘rearrangements of atoms’, but real life natives who really belong here: you cancall us an indigenous species. And in the second place, if these cosmiccoincidences are not simply coincidences, then the unpalatable idea that someintelligence is responsible for arranging them can raise its unwanted head. Didsomeone or thing want to produce us, and so made sure everything was just rightfor that to happen? (Are we, perhaps, a kind of synchronicity?) Swedenborgbelieved that the reason we exist is so that heaven can be populated. Angels, hebelieved, were originally human, and without us and beings like us – he believedother planets had life – heaven would be empty. The entire universe, accordingto Swedenborg, was created so that human beings, from earth and from otherplanets, could serve their cosmic purpose by becoming angels and moving on toheaven. It doesn’t get more anthropic than this. Along with being a religiousthinker, Swedenborg was a scientist, one of the most brilliant of his time,according to his countryman and Nobel Prize winner Svante Arrhenius.17[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--17] So while we may take his ideas about ananthropic universe with some grains of salt, we can’t just dismiss them toutcourt.One way scientists unhappy about an anthropic universe get around the problem ofcosmic coincidences, is through the concept of many worlds, associated withquantum theory. In short, the idea is that our universe is only one of countlessothers, existing in other dimensions. All possible other universes exist, butours just happens to be the one in which we do, and in which the cosmiccoincidences necessary for us to be here took place. Out of all the possiblearrangements of forces, energies, and whatever else is needed to make auniverse, in ours it just happens to be the case that those forces and energiescombined in just such a way as to produce just such a universe that could resultin just such beings as ourselves. And the fact that we are here is actuallyproof of this, as we could only have arisen in a universe that enjoyed ‘thenarrow range of constants that favour the existence of carbon-based life forms’.Our universe happens to be that one, so it shouldn’t be surprising that we arehere. Our universe is one that can produce us. In all those other universes thatcan’t, we are not.While the idea that our universe is only one of an infinite number may consolesome of us when we contemplate the cosmic fate science says is in store, I haveto say that personally, the notion is not appealing. Aside from the circularreasoning involved in this desperate measure to avoid any notion of our beinghere ‘on purpose’, the ‘many worlds’ theory strikes me as suffering from thesame flaw as Francis Crick’s molecules or John Gray’s drift. Just as Crick’smolecules ‘just happened’ to have hit on the truth – that our molecules are the‘really real’ things behind our thoughts, including those about molecules – so,in the ‘many worlds’ theory, our universe just happens to be the one in whichbeings like ourselves can come up with a theory of many worlds, in order toavoid thinking there is some reason for them being here.ONE WORLDClearly, just as with strings or superstrings, there is no way to test thistheory, at least so far. And as far as I know, no one has seen any of theseother universes in which we don’t exist. But what troubles me about this is notthat I can’t test it or can’t see it, but that once again, science has arrivedat another way of avoiding any idea that this world, here and now, with us init, is important. If this world, in which I struggle and am responsible and amobliged to make decisions, is only one world among many, perhaps an infinity ofother worlds, then it seems to me, my actions and choices here are not thatsignificant. If there are other worlds, the difference between this one andanother one may not be as vast as the difference between a world that cansustain human life and one that cannot. The differences can be less drastic.Given the possibility of other worlds, there is no reason why there can’t beother worlds in which human life does appear, but appears differently than itdoes here. As Danah Zohar writes: ‘Quantum many-worlds theory argues that everypossible sort of universe exists’.18 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--18] So theremay be a world in which I am a saint, and another in which I am a sinner. Theremay be a world in which I save lives, and another in which I destroy them. Theremay be a world in which I sacrifice my vital and pleasure values and deficiencyneeds in order to actualise the meta-need of pursuing a spiritual path, and aworld in which I wallow in fleshpots and generally waste my time. Some may thinksuch an idea is good, that it allows for greater variety, possibility, andmultiplicity, and that the idea of only one world is severely limited. But Idon’t see it that way. What strikes me is that in such a many-worlds scenario,any good act I perform in this world may be cancelled out by a bad one performedin another, rather as matter is cancelled out by anti-matter, or the sparks ofdivine light are blotted out by the klipoth. If my efforts to repair theuniverse here are cancelled out by actions that damage it in another, what’s thepoint? If I am a caretaker in this cosmos but a vandal in another, whatdifference do my actions make? If in all the possible universes in which I canexist, I live out all the possible scenarios of my life, why should I doanything in particular here? If I don’t do the good that I know here, I will doit in another world, so there’s nothing to worry about (although I may think thesame thing in the other worlds, too, and so it doesn’t get done there either). Imight as well save myself the trouble and take it easy. Somewhere among theinfinite worlds the good will get done, so relax.Such a belief, it seems to me, subtracts any urgency from this life, in thisworld – subtracts, in fact, any value from it. One of the most dangerous ideaswe can entertain is that our actions do not matter. This, combined with thenotion that ‘someone else will do it’, leads to the very ‘fallacy ofinsignificance’ this book is trying to undermine. It leads to the ‘unbearablelightness of being’, that Milan Kundera wrote a novel about. What I want insteadis the opposite. What I crave, and what I believe any self-actualising caretakerof the cosmos craves, is the weight of being, its resistance, something thatdrifts away if my actions and choices are cancelled out by their opposites. Itis only in a world of limited possibilities that my choices can matter, becauseit is only in such a world that there is any risk and that anything can be atstake.THE INVISIBLE EARTHSomeone who understood this was the poet Rilke. In the Ninth of his tremendousDuino Elegies (1923) – tremendous in the original sense of something that makesus tremble – Rilke writes:Once for each thing. Just once; no more. And we too,just once. And never again. But to have beenthis once, completely, even if only once:to have been at one with the earth, seems beyond undoing.19[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--19]Earlier in the poem Rilke writes that ‘truly being here is so much; becauseeverything here apparently needs us, this fleeting world, which is some strangeway keeps calling to us’. The world needs us because it is through us that itcan be saved. In fact, Rilke’s Ninth Elegy encapsulates the whole philosophy of‘cosmic caretaking’ in so dense and powerful a manner that reading the poem andunderstanding it can be overwhelming. We save the fleeting things of the world,Rilke tells us, by drawing them into ourselves. ‘Perhaps we are here,’ Rilketells us, ‘in order to say: house, bridge, fountain, gate, pitcher, fruit-tree,window … But to say them, you must understand … more intensely than the Thingsthemselves ever dreamed of existing.’ The connection between Rilke’s ‘saying’and that of Heidegger and Saint-Martin is clear. What this saying accomplishes,Rilke tells us, is that it ‘interiorises’ the world, it brings it inside us, andmakes it ‘invisible’. ‘Earth, isn’t this what you want: to arise within usinvisible?’ he asks. This act of ‘interiorising’ is the essence of what Rilkecalled Herzwerk, ‘heart work’, and he explained what he meant by this in aletter to his Polish translator Witold von Hulewicz. (Readers of The Quest forHermes Trismegistus will be aware of this and must, I am afraid, endure somerepetition.)Like many in the early twentieth century, Rilke believed that therationalist-reductive view of life was emptying the world of meaning. This wasespecially true of the mass-produced junk rolling off countless assembly lines.The everyday things of life were increasingly being replaced by what Rilkecalled ‘pseudo things’ and ‘Dummy life’. Where before everyday things, howeverinanimate, had some soul life, now they were inert. ‘Even for our grandparents’,Rilke writes, ‘a “House”, a “Well”, a familiar tower, their very dress, … wasinfinitely more intimate’.20 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--20] In order to savethese things from complete oblivion, Rilke said that we must take them intoourselves, and transform them into the furnishings of our interior world. Bydoing this, Rilke tells von Hulewicz, we become the ‘bees of the invisible’.‘Our task is to stamp this provisional, perishing earth into ourselves sodeeply, so painfully and passionately, that its being may arise again,“invisibly” in us.’21 (We remember that earlier Rilke spoke of ‘an interior thatI never knew of.’) We do this, Rilke tells us, not only for ourselves or onlyfor the things, but for what Rilke calls ‘the Whole’.One possible result of this existential salvage operation, Rilke tells us, isthat by transmuting the ‘visible and tangible into the invisible vibration … ofour own nature’ we may introduce ‘new vibration-numbers into thevibration-spheres of the universe’ – and we remember that string theory is aboutjust such vibrations or oscillations. And ‘since the various materials in thecosmos are only the results of different rates of vibration’ – again, somethingscience itself tells us – ‘we are preparing in this way, not only intensities ofa spiritual kind, but – who knows? – new substances, metals, nebulae, andstars’.22 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--22] By taking the world into ourselvesand making it invisible, Rilke tells us that we may actually be creating newworlds, somewhere in the depths of space. Rudolf Steiner said that the thoughtsof people today will determine the physical form of the earth in the future.Rilke seems to agree – synchronistically, they were both working on these ideasat around the same time – but he takes it a bit further. By saving the worldaround us now – by performing Herzwerk and bringing the world ‘inside’ – wecreate new worlds. Not in the simplistic new age or post-modern sense in whichreality is up for grabs because for them at bottom there is no objectivereality. Reality is not amenable to our whims, but something that makes demandson us. By drawing the world into the black hole of our consciousness – it is a‘black hole’ for the same reason a black hole itself is, because it is invisible– we may be creating somewhere out in space a ‘white gusher’, the proposed otherend of black hole, where all the matter sucked into it comes bursting forth innew forms – nebulae and stars. If, as science tells us, there is a much larger‘unobservable’ universe beyond our ‘observable’ one, could it also be true thatthere is a much larger ‘unobservable mind’ beyond that part of our inner worldwe can observe? I can look into myself only so far until I reach a kind oflimit. I cannot immediately observe what is beyond that limit, but I knowsomething is. ‘I’ seem to emerge like a fountain gushing out of a ‘nowhere’ thatis nonetheless within me. It is as if I reach a kind of horizon, beyond which Icannot see. But I can see ‘things’ – ideas, thoughts, feelings, images – risingup from below that horizon, from, we could say, an inner underworld. I cannothave direct experience of whatever it is that is bringing those things up to thesurface, but I trust it is there because I can see its effects. Perhaps in thatinner ‘event horizon’ there is a place where the unobservable mind and theunobservable universe meet? I do not know, but if such were true, it could helpus to understand what Rilke is saying.THE EIGHTH DAY OF CREATIONSo, we may not need to be so concerned about the universe’s ‘heat death’ or itsinevitable demise through a Big Crunch, Big Drift, or Big Rip. What we do nowwith our consciousness may change all that. You and I, grappling with thesethoughts, may in fact be saving the universe from extinction, or at least addingenough to it to compensate for whatever it loses to entropy or to dark energy.And although Bertrand Russell and many others believe that the second law ofthermodynamics is unbreakable – for Sir Arthur Eddington, if you question it,you have no choice but to ‘collapse in deepest humiliation’ – not everyoneagrees, and not all who have second thoughts are merely lonely poets.23[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--23] In What is Life? (1944) the physicist ErwinSchrödinger – famous for his much abused cat – proposed the idea of ‘negativeentropy’, or ‘negentropy’, to characterise life’s apparent abrogation of thisunbreakable second law.24 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--24] More recent ideasabout ‘complexity’ and ‘self-organisation’ seem to support this.25[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--25] Life is organised energy, organised matter, andit seems to move in a direction against the general flow of matter; we can saythat life flows uphill. This is what Bergson means by a ‘creative evolution’,one that intentionally invades matter and organises it for its own aims andpurposes. These, Bergson believed, were to gain greater and greater control overmatter and hence increased freedom. I suspect scientists would say that Imisunderstand entropy, but I do believe that life is anti-entropic. The smallestamoeba moves against the downward stream, and since achieving this tenuous holdon matter, life has increased its control and its freedom, until today, itconfronts a universe destined for oblivion with the most powerful anti-entropyweapon of all: the human mind. This is why Whitehead saw life as an ‘offensive,directed against the repetitious mechanism of the universe’. For Whitehead andBergson the fundamental character of life is that it is creative. The same istrue for Berdyaev, Cassirer, and Scheler. When we ‘complete’ the world, when we‘represent’ the ‘unrepresented’, when we infuse dead matter with meaning, whenwe fill the empty forms of reality with the living force of the imagination, weare moving against the tide that is carrying the fallen, physical world intonothingness. Each act of imagination, each moment of creative life stands up tothe entire material universe and affirms the reality of meaning against thecorroding solvents of entropy, dark matter, or whatever else may be dragging thephysical world into oblivion. We are still, and will continue to be for sometime, taking part in what Berdyaev calls ‘the Eighth Day of Creation’, theongoing work of tikkun, taking care of and helping to create the cosmos, totransform it from a bleak, meaningless event into a living world. This means tohumanise it, not in the small sense of reducing its vast, mysterious othernessto the triviality of the only human, but to release its sleeping life, itshidden meaning by acknowledging ourselves as the answer to its riddle.Some proponents of an anthropic universe see our future in it as agents of atechnology able to spread the human seed throughout the galaxies. Such seems thenotion behind the Omega Point idea of Frank Tipler, one of the co-authors of TheAnthropic Cosmological Principle (1986).26 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--26] Icannot argue with Tipler’s science, but I do know that for me the universealready is anthropic, in the sense that Swedenborg, Blake, Hermeticism, Kabbalahand other spiritual teachings present it. It does not need to be seeded byintergalactic computers spreading human intelligence throughout its depths. Theintelligence is already there. The beachheads and front lines of its advance areall around us. We do not need to travel to the far flung reaches of space tofind them. We are at the barricades every morning. What is needed is a change inour consciousness, in our understanding of who and what we are.FIRST CITIZENS OF THE COSMOSIn the last decade of his life, Max Scheler developed an idea that is at onewith the theme of this book. With Nikos Kazantzakis, Scheler came to believethat rather than an omnipotent, omniscient creator God, lording it over theuniverse, God, or the spirit, was actually weak. 27[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--27] As David Lindsay said, speaking of themuspel-fire, it was fighting for its life. For Scheler, God, the cosmos, and Manwere all part of one effort of becoming. None were finished or fixed or perfect,but all were involved in an ongoing effort of realisation. With Gustav Fechner,Scheler believed that spirit needs matter, in order to become actual, in orderfor its values and meanings to become concrete. But spirit is weak and matter isstrong and the effort of actualisation requires constant renewal, as Maslow’sself-actualisers know only too well. On its own, spirit is free but ineffective.On its own, matter is enslaved but actual. It is only through the union of thetwo that any development, any evolution is possible. Life is that union, and asfar as we know, it has made its most significant advance in us. Whether we liveup to this reality or not is another question. An important one, clearly, butour failure to fulfil the task given to us is no argument against that taskitself.‘In order to realise … its inherent plenitude of ideas and values,’ Schelerwrites, ‘the Ground of Being [the Ein-Sof] was compelled to release theworld-creative drive. It was compelled … to pay the price of this world processin order to realise its own essence in and through the temporal process’.28[part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--28] In other words, in order for God to becomesomething more than just a good idea, He (She or It) had to plunge into thetough, thick, tangled jungle of matter and master it. Just as any creator, inorder to create, has to give up the freedom of the ideal plane for theresistance of the actual one, God or Spirit had to relinquish freedom in thehigher spheres for the difficulties of this one. Actually, to be more precise,it is only spirit or its embodiment in some living form, that experiences thisworld as difficult. Things aren’t hard for a rock, if I can put it in that way.A cloud has no worries. It is only we and beings like ourselves that find thisworld difficult, because we are straining within it, trying to infuse it withmore life. It is rather as if in coming to this planet we all had to wearclothes that were too tight, and we find ourselves constantly wanting to bursttheir seams. Spirit is that within us that needs to break free of what encumbersit, and it is only spirit that finds things uncomfortable. But it is not in oureveryday ‘good enough’ selves that this realisation of Spirit takes place.Nothing is realised by taking things for granted and accepting the ‘naturalstandpoint’. It is only by questioning this and asking who we really are, thatwe discover ourselves and our place in the universe.It is through this discovery that we come to recognise that we are, in a sense,in the cosmos but not of it. We are, in fact, as Scheler argues, ‘outside’ thecosmos, not in a physical but in a metaphysical sense. Earlier I quotedScheler’s belief that animals always say ‘Yes’ to the cosmos, to life, tonature. This is because they are unable to step back from the press of thingsand ‘objectify’ it, turn it into an object of contemplation, something, as faras we can tell, only humans can do. We are, Scheler says, ‘open to the world’and in this sense Man is a ‘spiritual being … that surpasses himself in theworld’.29 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--29] And it is only by making thisseparation, this surpassing, that we can discover who we are. As soon as weseparate ourselves from the rest of nature and begin to look at it as an object,we begin to wonder about ourselves. “Where do I fit in in all this?” we wonder.“What is my place in the universe?” Yet that which us allows us to do this, thatwhich makes it possible for us to turn the things of the world, and even theworld itself, into an object, cannot itself be an object. Spirit can never be anobject. Spirit as spirit is always an ‘I’, always, in a sense, a ‘person’, andas Berdyaev and others have noted, personality is the most mysterious thing increation. We know this intuitively and it is why we find it wrong to treat otherpeople as things. We are even beginning to feel this way toward animals,recognising in them an interiority that compels our sympathy – our ‘withfeeling’. And of course many ‘primitive’ or ‘indigenous’ people have forcenturies felt the life in all life, in stones, trees, animals, something wetouched on when discussing Cleve Backster’s ‘primary perception’.Our ability to ‘objectify’ reality is what made it possible for us to separatefrom the great surround, to develop as independent beings, and to actualise ourfreedom. Now we also know that it is what has led, in many ways, to the abuse ofthe world around us, and also of other people. We cannot go back to a time whenwe did not have this power. And in any case, the cosmos itself doesn’t want usto, because it needs us to save it. It is only by separating from the whole thatwe can ask who we are, and discover our true relationship to the whole. Whatthat relationship is, has been the focus of this book. What we can do now is totry to understand our power, try to use it responsibly, and actively work atdeveloping it so we can take the next step in our evolution. By doing this webecome, as Scheler said, the ‘first citizens of creation rather than its lordand master’.30 [part0012.xhtml#rw-num-note--30] And when that happens, we willall be caretakers of the cosmos.7.

Rilke’s ‘just once, no more’ has clearresonances with Nietzsche’s notion of the eternal recurrence, the idea that thislife, and our actions and choices within it, is fated to be repeated again andagain without change, for eternity. If things do recur exactly as they happennow, and if they recur eternally, then this recurrence is exactly the same asthe last and the next. And as there is no appreciable difference betweenrecurrences, in effect all we have is now, Rilke’s ‘just once’. Our response tothe eternal recurrence of our lives was for Nietzsche the test of whether or notwe had the potential to become ‘overman’, whether or not we can embrace ourfate, what Nietzsche called amor fati or ‘love of fate’. For an excellent essayon the links between Rilke and Nietzsche see ‘Rilke and Nietzsche with aDiscourse on Thought, Belief, and Poetry’ in Erich Heller, The Importance ofNietzsche (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988) pp. 87–126.20 [part0012.xhtml#rw-ref-note--20] Rainer Maria Rilke Duino Elegies trans.

If the radioactive material decays, theGeiger counter detects it and sends a message to a mechanical device that willsmash the flask, releasing the poison and killing the cat. If it doesn’t decay,nothing will happen. Quantum theory says that at a certain point, quantumindeterminacy tells us that the cat is both alive and dead simultaneously, orrather an indefinite mix of the two. It is not until the experimenter opens thebox and looks in that the cat is definitely one or the other. The observer’s‘participation’ with what he is observing ‘collapses the wave function’ (as inthe twin slit experiment) and ‘decides’ which it will be. For an account of theexperiment see F. David Peat The Philosopher’s Stone (New York: Bantam, 1991)pp. 68–72.26 [part0012.xhtml#rw-ref-note--26] See Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers’Order Out of Chaos (London: Flamingo, 1997).27 [part0012.xhtml#rw-ref-note--27] http://129.81.170.14/~tipler/summary.html28 [part0012.xhtml#rw-ref-note--28] On this note it might be helpful to ask whywe never wonder why there is good in the world. We always ask ‘Why is thereevil?’, but we never ask ‘Why is there good?’ This is because we assume good tobe the ‘default setting’, as it were, the bottom line foundation, and evilsomething that developed out of this, as a corruption of it. But it strikes meas much easier to see a world in which evil – pain, suffering, death – werefundamental, and good something new. The natural world is one in which many ofthe goods we cherish do not obtain. We know that at that level, it is a ‘dog eatdog’ world in which only the strong survive. In that world might does makeright. It doesn’t take much imagination to transfer this world to the human one– indeed, many would say we don’t need to transfer it at all. But if this is thecase, then good would be something very much out of place and in need ofprotection. I would say there is good in the world because it is little bits ofGod or whatever you want to call some idea of absolute value seeping through thecracks of a world, not necessarily evil, but one initially void of good. Good,then, has a history, and I would say it does not appear until human beings beganto actualise it.29 [part0012.xhtml#rw-ref-note--29] Scheler 1978 p. 70.30 [part0012.xhtml#rw-ref-note--30] Scheler 1979 p. 32."},{"pageContent":"SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY [part0001.xhtml]Barfield, Owen (1957) Saving the Appearances, New York: Harcourt Brace & World.—, (1976) ‘Owen Barfield and the Origin of Language,’ Spring Valley, NY: St.George Publications.—, (1985) History in English Words, West Stockbridge, MA: Lindisfarne Press.—, (1986) Romanticism Come of Age, Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press.Barrett, William (1965) What is Existentialism?
