Although she died more than a century ago, Blavatsky’s namestill turns up in serious discussions about “ancient wisdom,” “secretteachings,” and “inner knowledge,” and it is generally agreed that herTheosophical Society (or TS, as it is often called), which she founded in NewYork in 1875, with her colleagues Henry Steel Olcott and William Quan Judge, wasmore or less the official starting point of the modern spiritual revival. By“modern spiritual revival,” I mean our contemporary widespread interest in adirect, immediate knowledge and experience of spiritual reality, and in a moreprofound relationship to the cosmos than traditional religions and mainstreamscience can provide. Represented by a heterogeneous collection of differentoccult, esoteric, or spiritual pursuits, today this revival is popularly, ifoften mistakenly, associated with the “New Age.” This grassroots hunger for asense of meaning and purpose that the official organs can no longer supply canbe traced to the nineteenth century—indeed, in this book I will look at some ofthe sources of it—and can be said, I believe, to have been inspired byBlavatsky. In fact, as early as 1970, in an article for McCall’s magazine, thenovelist Kurt Vonnegut dubbed Blavatsky “the Founding Mother of the Occult inAmerica.”1 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText0]But one doesn’t need to be a Theosophist to have felt Blavatsky’s considerablepresence. Her contribution to modern spiritual thought, and to modern culture ingeneral, is so great that it can easily be overlooked, in the way that someprominent feature of the landscape can be overlooked—that is to say, taken forgranted. Yet if Blavatsky’s offering to our modern spiritual consciousness wasto be suddenly removed, it would drag along with it practically everything weassociate with the very notion of modern spirituality. And those of us who hadtaken Blavatsky’s contribution for granted would certainly notice the loss.To press my point: Anyone who meditates, or considers himself a Buddhist, or isinterested in reincarnation, or has thought about karma, or pursues “higherconsciousness,” or has wondered about Atlantis, or thinks the ancients mighthave known a few things that we don’t, or reads about esotericism, or whofrequents an “alternative” health center or food shop, would be aware of it ifmodern spirituality somehow became “HPB free.” And this, of course, wouldinclude quite a few people who never heard of Blavatsky, or who have only thevaguest idea of what Theosophy is or of its place in the history of Westernconsciousness. Which is to say most people. If nothing else, our endlessfascination with the “wisdom of the East” would not have arrived, or would havetaken much longer to get here, if it were not for her efforts and those of herearly followers. It’s been said that all of modern Russian literature emergedfrom Nikolai Gogol’s short story “The Overcoat.” It can equally be said thatpractically all modern occultism and esotericism emerged from the ample bosom ofhis younger countrywoman and contemporary, HPB.Yet, although she was one of the most remarkable women of the nineteenthcentury, to the general public, Blavatsky is virtually unknown. When I’vementioned her in recent times—when asked what I was working on at themoment—more often than not the response was a shaking head and a baffled look,although a few acquaintances mustered some questions like “Wasn’t she apsychic?” or a “fraud?” or a “charlatan?” Yet, those who are aware of her, andof her contribution to Western thought, have a different view. Like thehistorian of esotericism Christopher Bamford, they wonder why she is not, asBamford believes she should be, counted with Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud as oneof the “creators of the twentieth century”?2[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText1]We may think Bamford pitches Blavatsky’s claims too high, but he does so forgood reason. By the time of Blavatsky’s death in London in 1891, theTheosophical movement had spread from New York to India, Europe, and beyond, andincluded among its devotees some important names, such as Thomas Edison andMohandas Gandhi.3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText2] And by the early years ofthe twentieth century, it was a force, as the saying goes, to be reckoned with,informing major developments, not only in spirituality and esotericism, but inpolitics, art, religion, and much more. Some of the individuals who wereinfluenced, positively or negatively, by the Madame include the poet T. S.Eliot, who lampooned her in The Waste Land, a seminal work in modern poetry4[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText3]; the artist Wassily Kandinsky, whoseabstract paintings are informed by Theosophical ideas5[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText4]; L. Frank Baum, the creator of The Wizardof Oz, who became a member of the Theosophical Society in 18926[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText5]; Abner Doubleday, Civil War hero andpurported inventor of baseball, who became president of the American branch ofthe Theosophical Society in 1878; the composer Alexander Scriabin, whose lush,ecstatic work is rife with Theosophical motifs; and Jawaharlal Nehru, India’sfirst prime minister, who was initiated into the Theosophical Society by AnnieBesant, the socialist and freethinker who converted to Theosophy after meetingBlavatsky, and who, as president of the society, helped India win itsindependence.7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText6] Even Einstein is said tohave kept a well-thumbed copy of Blavatsky’s magnum opus, The Secret Doctrine,on his desk, and some Theosophists have gone as far as to infer that theinspiration for Einstein’s famous formula, E = mc2, came from that dense andweighty tome, a claim many perhaps will find too hard to swallow.8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText7]We may not want to follow Blavatsky’s supporters this far, yet one has to askwhy, having had such a huge effect on modern culture, outside of the “esotericcommunity” Blavatsky’s name is not more well known? Feminists alone, one wouldthink, would have caught on to her long ago. Yet even to use the phrase “wellknown” at all in the context of HPB is something of a misnomer, even within theesoteric community, if by “well known” we mean “accurately known,” and notmerely famous—or infamous.As anyone who has tried to write seriously about HPB discovers, the question“Who was Madame Blavatsky?” isn’t easy to answer, not the least because of theconsiderable difficulties Blavatsky herself puts in its way. To say that HPB isa bundle of contradictions is not only an understatement, it is to repeat whatpractically everyone who has written about Blavatsky has said. Blavatsky spokeabout herself and her life frequently, with great panache and at great length.But as her biographer Peter Washington points out, she “rarely said exactly thesame thing twice.”9 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText8] Rudolf Steiner, whoborrowed more from Blavatsky than his followers would care to admit, tactfullyremarked that she exhibited a “lack of consistency in her external behaviour,” atrait which Steiner accounted for by her Russian soul.10[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText9] It would be relatively easy for a resoluteresearcher to tally up the many discrepancies in her accounts of herself anddeclare that HPB had, at best, a flexible grasp of the idea oftruth—notwithstanding the Theosophical motto that there was “no religion higherthan truth.” Yet, after a time, one begins to wonder—at least I did—whetherthere was some conscious purpose behind the Marx Brothers mayhem and doubletalk, and one understands how one HPB scholar, K. Paul Johnson, came to feelthat she made “a deliberate effort . . . to appear untrustworthy and suspiciousand to render the biographer’s task impossible.”11[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText10]• • •SOME, CONFRONTING THIS PROBLEM, have collapsed in exasperation. The historian ofreligion Maria Carlson, whose study of Theosophy in Russia repeats many of themyths and misconceptions about HPB, concludes that “an accurate and completelyfactual biography of this remarkable woman will never be written.”12[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText11] For James Santucci, a historian moreamenable to HPB and Theosophy, Blavatsky “remains an enigma to any fair-mindedinvestigator of her life and writings.”13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText12]Johnson, perhaps the most controversial HPB scholar of recent times, remarksthat in Blavatsky’s case, “the scholar’s efforts to unravel the truth arefrustrated by the deliberate occultation of history.”14[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText13] Sylvia Cranston, whose enormous but notquite exhaustive account presents the most complete “pro-HPB” view, cautions:“After her departure from Russia, HPB’s life is not easy to document.”15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText14] The historian of esotericism, NicholasGoodrick-Clarke, confirms that it is only after her appearance in New York in1873, at the age of forty-two, that “her career admits of continuousdocumentation,” and that Blavatsky’s references to her “Masters” during what K.Paul Johnson calls her “veiled years” are “almost all retrospective from thelater, Indian phase of her life.”16 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText15]Even Blavatsky’s first biographer, the Theosophist and journalist A. P. Sinnett,ran into quite a few walls when attempting to rehabilitate HPB’s reputationfollowing the initial accusations of fraud that followed her for the rest of herlife, and continue to haunt her legacy to this day. “From seventeen to forty,”she told him, “I took care during my travels to sweep away all traces of myselfwherever I went . . . I never allowed people to know where I was or what I wasdoing.”17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText16] She restated this approach toher past life some years later in a letter to some followers: “To even my bestfriends,” she told her correspondents, “I have never given but fragmentary andsuperficial accounts of [my] travels, nor do I propose to gratify anyone’scuriosity, least of all that of my enemies.”18[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText17]• • •BLAVATSKY’S DECONSTRUCTIVE ATTITUDE to her past may have been informed by asentiment she expressed in one of her last pieces of writing. In The Voice ofthe Silence, a translation of selections from The Book of the Golden Precepts—awork of “esoteric Tibetan Buddhism” that, like the “Stanzas of Dzyan” of hermost famous book, The Secret Doctrine, more than one Tibetan scholar has arguednever existed—she writes: “One single thought about the past that thou hast leftbehind will drag thee down and thou wilt have to start the climb anew. Kill inthyself all memory of past experiences. Look not behind or thou art lost.”19[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText18]A critic might remark that this was a convenient philosophy for someone who hada past worth forgetting, and HPB’s detractors all agree she certainly had. Butit is also an approach to one’s past life that other questionable gurus adopted.The Greek-Armenian-Russian G. I. Gurdjieff—aptly, his real nationality remainsdebatable—had much in common with HPB, and he also went out of his way toobscure his past and to create a legend. More recently, Carlos Castaneda tookpains to eliminate all traces of his life prior to his emergence as abest-selling guru in the 1970s, and did his best to stay incognito until hisdeath in 1998. He also instructed his followers to do the same, with debatableresults.20 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText19] Staying out of the limelightand rejecting one’s past are not uncommon practices on the mystic path. TheNeo-Platonic philosopher Plotinus, with whom Blavatsky felt much accord,famously refused to be painted or to disclose any information about his life,arguing that this “public” side of himself was unimportant, as his “true self”was his immaterial spirit, striving after the absolute. We can admire Plotinus’sdedication, and too many centuries have passed between his time and ours for usto wonder if there was something he didn’t want his contemporaries to know. Butwe generally don’t give the same benefit of the doubt to more recent adherentsof this belief, and when they go out of their way to let us know they’ve madethings purposefully difficult for anyone wanting to trace their careers,eyebrows and alarms are raised.• • •BUT THE PROBLEM isn’t with Blavatsky alone. If Blavatsky’s life becomes subjectto independent corroboration only after her arrival in New York in 1873,accounts of her life prior to this time by others are also equally suspect. Hersister, Vera Zhelihovsky, whose relationship with HPB was rocky at best,provided accounts of Blavatsky’s early years but changed her tune almost asoften as Blavatsky did herself. It may be germane that Vera was a successfulauthor of children’s stories. At one point, having turned against her sister,she supplied damaging ammunition to the Russian Vsevolod Solovyov, a writer ofhistorical fiction and the author of a sensational, slandering, and highlydoubtful tabloid “memoir” of his brief time with HPB in Paris in 1884.21[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText20] Vera then wrote a scathing criticism ofSolovyov and his book. Other early accounts—by Blavatsky’s Aunt Nadya Fadeyev,for example—are equally suspect, and along with several other equally doubtfulreports, her “reminiscences” contribute to what the esoteric historian JoscelynGodwin calls “the host of unreliable witnesses without whom there could be noTheosophical history at all.”22 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText21]Yet family and friends are not the only sources for the difficulty in pinningthe Blavatsky story down. Practically from the beginning of her public career,HPB was the recipient of some pretty bad press, both from hostile journalistsand from those eager to spice up an already recherché story. And withBlavatsky’s eccentric character, practically anything they said about her seemedplausible. So a journalist for the Commercial Gazette of Cincinnati, visitingHPB in London in 1889, informed his readers that “One is told she is fivehundred years old and renews her age in the far east as often as it isnecessary,” and repeats a story that “crisp new bills are improvised by amoment’s thought,” while comparing an afternoon at Blavatsky’s home in HollandPark to an audience with the pope, the ascent of Mount Blanc, and a pilgrimageto Mecca.23 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText22] By this time, Blavatsky was nodoubt tired of correcting these exaggerations and falsehoods, and in any case,on many occasions she did not bother, seeming to agree with the showbiz adagethat there is no such thing as bad publicity, as long as they spell your namecorrectly. Yet such reports, and ones only slightly less fanciful, became thesource material for more lasting accounts of her life and career, and form thebasis of the Blavatsky legend. Colin Wilson once remarked about Rasputin,Blavatsky’s countryman, that he seemed “to possess the peculiar quality ofinducing shameless inaccuracy in everyone who writes about him.”24[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText23] The same could be said for MadameBlavatsky.• • •IT MAY BE assumed that tabloid journalists do not spend much time checking theirfacts, but surely serious scholars are another matter? Yet, even with decades ofTheosophical history to draw on, this seems not to be the case. So, in hisrecent book The Immortalization Commission: Science and the Strange Quest toCheat Death, the London School of Economics Emeritus Professor of EuropeanThought, John Gray—considered one of the most important social and philosophicalthinkers of our time—manages in a brief paragraph to repeat several inaccuraciesabout HPB and to present the sort of “facts” about her that simply thicken thelayers of misinformation making up the standard anti-Blavatsky account.25[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText24]One wonders why, if respected academics, who are supposed to be the guardians ofscholarly accuracy, can spread rumors and take thirdhand hearsay as fact,Blavatsky is lambasted by them for telling stories about herself? Especially asmany of these “facts” have been exposed as inaccurate, and more reliableaccounts are available for the reading? But the answer is clear: the stories aretoo good, and the picture of Blavatsky as a “fraudulent guru” is too ingrainedin the collective consciousness for anyone to bother about it.26[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText25] Except, of course, for Blavatskysupporters, whose efforts will naturally seem suspect to those experts, and“fair-minded investigators” who even trouble themselves to try to arrive at abalanced view.• • •THE CULTURAL HISTORIAN Jacques Barzun once remarked that part of his job was totrace the history of reputations. This meant showing how, say, the “crude,barbaric, ignorant” Shakespeare of the early seventeenth century, who, accordingto the diarist Samuel Pepys, wrote “the most insipid, ridiculous play I eversaw” (A Midsummer Night’s Dream), became the “immortal genius” we know today,and what was involved in the transformation of the one into the other.27[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText26] Entailed in this is showing how somereputations become one-sided and misrepresentative. It’s not a question ofobscurity, of taking a writer, thinker, or artist no one knows about and makingthem better known. On the contrary, it means peeling away the myths andmisconceptions that have accreted around a figure everyone thinks they know verywell, but are actually quite wrong about. The legends, hearsay, and lazyrepetitions collect around the writer or artist like a shell until they arerarely, if ever, seen “in the flesh.” As Barzun writes, “It is the fate ofgeniuses to engender a conventional view, a plausible simulacrum of the truefigure, which the attentive biographer must destroy before he can attempt afaithful portrait. This preliminary labor entails many things, the reorientationof the common mind upon the evidence, and the straightening out of faultylogic.” Yet, even with all this, there is still no guarantee that the old,mistaken picture will dissolve and a more accurate one arise. “Under the strainof taking all this in,” Barzun writes, “the common mind tends to be suspiciousand it soon snaps back into its old groove of belief. That is why conventionalopinion persists in spite of scholarship and critical biography.”28[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText27] “To educate the educated,” Barzun tellsus, “is notoriously difficult,” and once the public and especially the “experts”have made up their minds, it is often a Sisyphean task to change it.To my mind, Barzun has done remarkably well with the reputations he hasrepaired, and I believe Blavatsky shares in the “fate of geniuses” mentionedabove. But I don’t believe Barzun ever had a subject who laid as many traps forher would-be rescuers as she did.But my concern here is not to recount the many inaccuracies that crop up in “theBlavatsky story,” like potholes on a poorly maintained road, nor to excusemyself for not providing the reader with the “truth” about HPB. There areBlavatsky and Theosophical websites dedicated to those pursuits, and along theway the interested reader can find out how to reach them. My job here is to tryto tell “the Blavatsky story” as best I can, and these preliminary remarks areoffered as a general acknowledgment at the start that the following account,taken from a variety of sources, may or may not be true. If this seems like alame excuse for poor research and an inability to “nail Blavatsky down,” so beit. My only defense is that I am not the only one to make it. As many haverecognized, “the facts in the case of Madame Blavatsky” may indeed be doubtful,but without them, there would be practically no case at all.The writer Henry Miller, a reader of Blavatsky, once said that we should “livelife to the hilt.” Blavatsky certainly did that, and more. To take her own wordfor it, throughout her career she was a woman on a mission. Sent into the Westby mysterious Eastern adepts, she was charged with the task of bringing a newspirituality to a civilization perilously sliding into a blind and deadeningmaterialism. Whether she succeeded or not is debatable, but I for one think wecould do worse than to try to understand her message, and to see if it holds outany prospects for us today."},{"pageContent":"ONEFROM RUSSIA WITH LOVEI first came across a reference to Madame Blavatsky in 1975. I was living in NewYork, playing in a rock band, and had just become interested in magic, theparanormal, and what I later learned was called “esotericism,” and was busyreading my way through Colin Wilson’s The Occult. There, amid accounts ofGurdjieff, Nostradamus, Rasputin, Aleister Crowley, and the Hermetic Order ofthe Golden Dawn, appeared Blavatsky. But although Wilson was convinced of herimportance, there was an ambivalence about his account of her that was lackingin his analysis of Gurdjieff or Crowley. He was convinced that she “could nothave held so many disciples entirely by means of confidence trickery”—she had,about midway through her career, been accused of fraud and the tag had stuck—buthe also compared her to the eighteenth-century Freemason, magician, and, by mostmainstream accounts, charlatan Cagliostro, an identification Blavatsky herselfwould have approved of. She had “the same charisma, the same adventurousness,the same mixture of humour, roguery, and genuine psychic ability.”1[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText28] This uncertainty about Blavatsky must havestayed with Wilson. Years later, in a book called The Devil’s Party: A Historyof Charlatan Messiahs, she appears in the company of David Koresh, Jim Jones,and other doubtful characters, and Wilson remarks that “the question of how farMadame Blavatsky was a fraud must be left open.” She was “part genuine, partfraud,” but “unlike most messiahs, she never became paranoid, and alwaysretained her sense of humor,” a trait sadly lacking in many spiritual teachers.2[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText29]After reading The Occult, and practically every other book on magic I could getmy hands on, I went on to study Gurdjieff, Crowley, and many of the otherfigures Wilson wrote about. But to be honest, I didn’t take Blavatsky thatseriously, although “Theosophy” did turn up in a song of mine written at thetime.3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText30] After all, what was one to make ofthe tales of mysterious mahatmas in Tibet, of Blavatsky’s own travels there at atime when it was nearly impossible for a white European male, let alone a woman,to enter that forbidden land, of letters, teacups, and other items strangely“materializing” out of thin air, of stories about ancient Atlantis and Lemuriaplucked from the mystical Akashic Record, not to mention the off-puttingTheosophical jargon and jaw-breaking Tibetan terminology? I was gripped byWilson’s account of the occult because he had linked it to philosophy, history,literature, and science, and Blavatsky’s Tibetan Masters and frankly improbablestories didn’t fit this frame. It also struck me that while, say, Gurdjieff hadattracted several creative, well-accomplished individuals, who had already madea mark on society before they became his followers—the philosopher P. D.Ouspensky immediately comes to mind, as does the brilliant editor, A. R.Orage—there was something about the kind of people attracted to Theosophy thatsmacked of grandmothers’ shawls and tea cozies, of Sunday afternoonconversations about astral bodies and past lives, conducted with the samenonchalance with which one spoke about the weather. It was all very nice,harmless, and “spiritual,” but it lacked the hard edge that led Wilson to equatesome of Gurdjieff’s ideas with existentialism. It wasn’t until some time laterthat I discovered with some surprise that both Ouspensky and Orage had startedout as Theosophists.And there were Blavatsky’s books, the huge, towering piles of Isis Unveiled andThe Secret Doctrine. Their length alone didn’t deter me, but when I peeked intothem, reading bits here and there, there was something about the avalanche ofinformation falling from each page that made my curiosity dissolve. Blavatskyseemed incapable of simply stating her ideas. She had a hectoring, blusterystyle that didn’t want to convince the reader so much as to bowl him over. Icame away from them feeling more bullied than enlightened, and I felt justifiedin avoiding more study when I read that Gurdjieff himself had complained of thetime he had wasted on The Secret Doctrine.So while I understood that it was Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society thathad got the modern occult movement rolling, I felt I could give suitabledeference to this, but save myself the trouble of really grappling with the“root races,” “planetary rounds,” “Manvantaras” and “Pralayas,” that jammed thepages of her gargantuan tomes.Yet as the years went by and my studies grew, I discovered that many of thepaths I traced led back to Blavatsky. It seemed clear that practically everyoneI read about, and later went on to write about, owed something to her.Recognizing this, I finally found myself having to come to serious grips with acharacter and a body of ideas I had successfully avoided for some time.• • •THERE ARE, it seems to me, at least three different Madame Blavatskys, althoughI’m sure this is a conservative estimate; as her contemporary Walt Whitman saidof himself, she contained “multitudes.” And Whitman, we know, was alsountroubled by his contradictions. There is the official “encyclopedia” versionof HPB, the colorful rogue and breezy bohemian who pulled the wool over manyintelligent eyes, but in the end was found out as a foul-mouthed, overweight,chain-smoking charlatan—although, as we will see, the evidence for thisaccusation is itself pretty questionable. Then there is the “pro-Blavatsky”version: the saintly, holy guru steadfastly following her destiny, who fills thepages of more than one hagiography, and is embraced by her uncritical devoteeswho believe that everything she said was the unalloyed truth, and who maintainthe strict letter of her law against any deviation. These two separate campscarry on in their own way, having little if any communication with each other,aside from the obligatory brickbats they fling across the great divide betweenthem. As you might imagine, neither of these Blavatskys is completelysatisfying, and neither does her, or those who would like to know more abouther, much good, although it has to be said that some of the critical accountsare quite entertaining and readable (HPB always provided excellent copy), whilethe hagiographic ones start out on a note of uplift and soon drift off intoincreasingly ethereal realms, quickly leaving the interested, but not entirelyconverted, reader far behind.Then there is the third Madame Blavatsky, the one I discovered as I investigatedher life and times. This was a much more fascinating, exciting, surprising, and“real” character than I, and I suspect most people, thought, and one thatdeserves to be made better known. What follows is my attempt to try to doprecisely that.• • •MADAME BLAVATSKY WAS born Helena Petrovna von Hahn on August 12, 1831, inEkaterinoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk) in the Ukraine, which was then part ofRussia. Although the area had been settled much earlier, the modern city wasbuilt less than a century before, “for the glory of Catherine the Great,” thefreethinking monarch and friend of Voltaire who, readers of esoteric history mayrecall, refused to be initiated into the Egyptian Freemasonry of the Sicilianmagician Cagliostro. Whether this has any bearing on HPB’s later career isdebatable.4 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText31] In the old Julian calendar,August 12 was July 30, and legend had it that those born at this time wouldacquire a power over evil spirits. True or not, from the start Helena causedtrouble, arriving prematurely during a cholera epidemic that had already takenits toll on her grandparents’ household. So many had died so quickly thatcoffins had been left to pile up, waiting their turn to be buried. Helena’steenaged mother, Helena Andreyevna von Hahn (nee Fadeyev), never robust, hadcome down with the disease, and neither she, nor her child, who was born frail,were expected to survive. Blavatsky herself would be plagued with a variety ofillnesses for much of her life, and more than once would find herself close todeath. Her entry into this vale of tears seems to have set the tone for the restof her career.With the godparents and the household in attendance, a priest was called in toperform the baptism quickly, lest the child should die and her soul be forced tospend eternity in limbo. It may have some bearing on HPB’s later attitude to thechurch that as the priest performed the sacrament, Blavatsky’s child aunt, NadyaAndreyevna Fadeyev, a central figure in her story, accidentally set fire to hisrobes with a candle. The infant Helena would not have been aware of it, but I’msure she would have appreciated that, from early on, she made her mark on theworld as a firebrand.When Helena was brought into the world, her father wasn’t on hand, and hewouldn’t meet his daughter until six months later (some accounts say a year). Acaptain in the Royal Horse Artillery (later a colonel), and a descendant ofGerman nobility, Peter von Hahn was one of the many troops that Tsar Nicholas Ihad sent into Poland, then under Russian rule, to stop a nationalist rebellion.Known as the “gendarme of Europe,” Nicholas I was perhaps the most reactionaryof the Russian monarchs, and a few years earlier he had successfully put downthe Decembrist Revolt of 1825, essentially his first act of office. The Polishuprising would be suppressed just as quickly and violently. Russia underNicholas I was a repressive police state, rife with spies, censorship, and rigidcontrol of education, publishing, and public life. He believed in the unlimitedauthority of the tsar and the centrality of the Orthodox Church, and his motto,“Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality,” was a bulwark against any fantasies ofmodernizing—that is, Westernizing—Russia.HPB seems to have taken this conservative credo and, as Karl Marx would soon doto the philosopher Hegel, stood it on its head. She would become in every wayunorthodox, subversive, and cosmopolitan. For all her advocacy of an “ancientwisdom” and “lost tradition,” HPB was very much for the modern world. Thedissonance between the Slavophiles, who envisioned a holistic, “wholly Russian”Russia, steeped in tradition and bonded by a mystical sense of racial unity, andthe modernizers, who looked to Western science and rationality as a path intothe future, would increase as the century moved on, and finally explode duringthe chaos of World War I. In some ways Blavatsky’s later mission—to bring thetruth of ancient wisdom to the awareness of modern rationalconsciousness—paralleled the tension between past and future dominant at herbirth.To get an idea of Russia at this time, we should realize that its first railwaywouldn’t open until Helena was seven years old. It was a primitive, barbaricland, a feudal state still stuck in the Middle Ages, at least according towestern Europeans. It was the Russia of War and Peace and Dead Souls, whoseauthors, Tolstoy and Gogol, were HPB’s contemporaries, along with Pushkin,Turgenev, and Dostoyevsky. It was a Russia of serfs—the vast majority—andaristocrats, and Helena’s family were of the minor nobility. Helena’s mother wasthe daughter of Princess Helena Pavlovna Dolgorukov, who seems a remarkablecharacter. At a time when women were denied education, Helena Dolgorukov taughtherself enough Greek, classical literature, art, botany, and archaeology to belauded by celebrated contemporaries such as Alexander von Humboldt, and to haveSir Roderick Murchison, one of the founders of the Royal Geographic Society,name a fossil after her.5 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText32] HPB, too,wouldn’t receive a formal education, and the stunning erudition and autodidacticpowers she later displayed no doubt had their roots in her maternalgrandmother’s efforts at self-education.Helena’s mother, Helena Andreyevna, would also educate herself and producehighly regarded creative work. Not long after she gave birth to her first childat the age of seventeen, HPB’s mother became a famous novelist, writing underthe pen name “Zenaida R-va.” Her work is said to explore the fate of women inunhappy marriages, as well as other social issues, and it could be argued thather fiction provided a foundation for a nascent “women’s movement.” Nicknamedthe “Russian George Sand” by the literary critic Vissarion Belinsky, andacknowledged the equal of Lermontov, Helena von Hahn was a sensitive, poetic,artistic soul who seems to have chosen for a husband someone of a radicallydifferent temperament. HPB’s father had a cutting, ironic sense of humor, and ano-nonsense attitude that regarded his wife’s literary pretensions with amusedscorn, standard procedure—one would imagine—among captains of the horseartillery. HPB, who, with her sister Vera, would inherit her mother’s andgrandmother’s penchant for writing and learning, also seems to have followed hermother in choosing an unsuitable mate, as well as one who was much older thanshe. We will come to Helena’s misalliance with her first husband, NikiforBlavatsky, soon. Here I note that, as her daughter would, Helena Andreyevna hadchosen an older man. Peter was twice her age, and although the fact that HPBalso married a much older man is often commented on, that her mother did thesame suggests that the practice wasn’t unusual.Reading stories of HPB’s early life, one soon comes to feel that HelenaAndreyevna would have liked to cut her ties and, as her daughter would, take offfor points unknown. It may have only been her children and ill health thatprevented her. A passage from one of her novels, The World’s Judgment, givessome idea of her feelings about her marriage. “The fine, sharp, and fast mind ofmy husband, as a rule accompanied by a cutting irony, smashed every day one ofmy brightest, most innocent and pure aspirations and feelings . . . all that wassacred to my heart was either laughed at, or was shown me in the pitiless andcynical light of his cold and cruel reasoning.”6[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText33] Is it reading too much into HPB’s latercareer, which championed a magical view of the world over that of a deadeningrationalism, to suggest that with it she was in some way defending her mother’spoetic, idealistic temperament against the dismissive, reductive cynicism of herfather? And yet, her fearlessness, her pugnacity, her willingness to take uparms and engage in “mental fight,” as well as her unpretentious camaraderie:Where could they have come from, except from her military father? As with manychildren, HPB was a strange and new combination of two very different worlds.HPB’s mother had other reasons for voicing literary regrets for her marriage. Asa captain of the horse artillery, Peter von Hahn moved about frequently,sometimes over vast distances, and for the most part, this meant that HelenaAndreyevna had to uproot herself too. The constant movement and loss of friendsdrained her already poor health, as did the barrack talk, filthy conditions, andboring company, and although, as all aristocratic families did, she had servantsto help, she tended to much of her daughter’s needs herself. Some biographersassume that, as a novelist, HPB’s mother must have been a “career woman” who hadlittle time for her daughter, and have suggested a distance between them. Otheraccounts suggest that mother and child had as close a relationship as waspossible, given the circumstances. One would think that with a husband who“smashed her brightest, most innocent aspirations” daily, she would find morethan some recompense in her daughter.A year after her father returned from Poland, the family moved to Romankov, anarmy town not far from Ekaterinoslav. Their stay here was brief, and Peter wassoon moved to other places in the Ukraine. HPB’s maternal grandfather, a civiladministrator, was also moved frequently, and as HPB and her mother sometimeslived with her maternal grandparents, this meant that they often moved with themas well. It is a cliché of biographical writing to see in some early experiencea pattern that will be repeated in later life, yet it is impossible to read ofBlavatsky’s early years, when she was hauled across half of Russia, and not seeportents of her wandering life to come. She grew up very much “on the road,” andit isn’t surprising that, when the need and opportunity arose, she took to itand rarely settled down in one place for any length of time.Other pain, beside that of constant movement, visited HPB’s mother. When herdaughter was two, her second child, Sasha, HPB’s first brother, became terriblyill. The family was living in another army town, and the spring rains had madethe roads impassable. No medical help was available and Helena Andreyevna coulddo little more than watch the infant die. In Odessa, on the Black Sea, three anda half years later, HPB’s sister Vera was born. The territory had recentlypassed into Russian hands and Helena Andreyevna’s father had been appointed anadministrator for the colonizers. HPB’s mother had gone there for the birth, butshe soon was back in another god-forsaken part of the Ukraine. Then HelenaAndreyevna was thrilled to hear that Peter had been transferred to St.Petersburg, the most European city in Russia. The 900-mile journey was made in ahorse and carriage and must have been grueling, but Helena Andreyevna would havemade it on foot for an opportunity to escape dull army life and to enjoy acultural paradise. In a letter to her sister Catherine, HPB’s mother told ofseeing Pushkin at an art gallery. She caught up on her reading, devouring worksin German, Italian, and English—as her mother did, Helena Andreyevna had a knackfor languages, something HPB would herself acquire—and she translated some worksof the English novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton for a literary magazine. Her workwas exceptional and she was invited to contribute more. It was the start of herliterary career, and Bulwer-Lytton would later prove an important influence onHelena’s oldest daughter.She knew her time in St. Petersburg was limited, and she dreaded where Peter’sorders would take them next. When Peter finally announced that he was being sentback to the Ukraine, Helena Andreyevna rebelled. And so HPB’s parents separated,at least for a time. It was a fateful decision, and showed the kind ofwillfulness HPB was later noted for. Around the same time, in 1837, when HPB wassix, Andrey Fadeyev, HPB’s maternal grandfather, was appointed a trustee for thenomadic Kalmuck Buddhist tribes of Astrakhan, a semi-Asiatic city at the mouthof the Volga, where the ancient river empties into the Caspian Sea. Andrey hadbeen sent to St. Petersburg to receive his orders, and he arrived while hisdaughter and grandchildren were there. One wonders if Helena Andreyevna wastired of traveling, or of her husband, because she suddenly decided to take herchildren and accompany her father on the 1,000-mile journey to the tip ofCentral Asia. They stayed in Astrakhan for a year, and it was during this timethat HPB had her first contact with Buddhism. The Kalmucks had migrated fromChina in the seventeenth century, and while the von Hahns were in Astrakhan,they visited the Kalmuck leader, Prince Tumen. Here the young HPB was exposed tothe Mongolian lamaic system, and had her first taste of Tibetan Buddhism. Hermother, too, was inspired by the meeting and later wrote a novel about Kalmucklife, which was translated into French. The prince spent his days in prayer in aBuddhist temple he had built himself. The colors, the images, the incense, thestrange words murmured in an unfamiliar language, must have made a deepimpression on the six-year-old, who had already led a remarkably adventurouslife. Blavatsky would later say that her interest in Tibet began at that time.Fate works in strange ways. If her parents got along better, if her father hadstayed in St. Petersburg longer, if her grandfather had not been made a Kalmucktrustee, this introduction to the mysterious East might not have happened atall. It did, and HPB would never forget it, and some years later she would visitPrince Tumen again.• • •SOON ENOUGH HELENA and her family were traveling again, and reunited with Peter.But Helena Andreyevna’s health was failing. After a time in Poltava, where agoverness took over many of her mother’s tasks, HPB and family moved back toOdessa, where her mother could take the mineral baths. Here she found a youngBritish woman to teach her children English, of which HPB would later display apeculiar mastery. But Helena Andreyevna was not getting better. In fact, hercondition worsened. She was tubercular and, because she was expecting anotherchild, a doctor was called in to live with the family. In June 1840, when HPBwas almost nine, her brother Leonid was born. During her pregnancy andincreasing illness, HPB’s mother continued to write, something HPB herself woulddo years later, when illness and other woes pressed on her.The family moved to Poland, then the Ukraine again. Helena Andreyevna’scondition grew still worse, and the doctor urged her to travel to Kharkov fortreatment. Perhaps she knew this would be useless. She decided to go once againto Odessa, where she had friends, and where her family could visit hercomfortably. On June 24, 1842, Helena Andreyevna von Hahn, otherwise known asZenaida R-va, died of tuberculosis. She was twenty-eight. HPB was nearly eleven.The family was devastated, and the outside world shared their pain. The criticBelinsky wrote a moving epitaph, and the loss of the young writer was widelymourned. Medical treatment was primitive at best, and the repeated bloodlettingsher doctors administered certainly couldn’t have helped. She is said to havedied in her own mother’s arms, and her last words to her eldest daughter werethat her life would not be that of other women, and that she would have much tosuffer. Apocryphal, most likely, but they certainly sum up much of herdaughter’s later career.• • •HELENA ANDREYEVNA’S PARENTS had moved from Astrakhan to Saratov, a town on theVolga, and Grandfather Fadeyev had been appointed governor of the area. Twoyears before, the family had spent several months there—it was where her brotherLeonid was born—and now HPB, Vera, and Leonid were sent there again, to livewith their grandparents. It is from around this time that we start to get a“character profile” of the young HPB. Her mother had already despaired over hergovernesses—Helena Petrovna seemed to get the better of them early on—and for atime thought it best to send her to the Odessa Institute, but nothing came ofthat. She was, according to her sister Vera, “the strangest girl one has everseen,” with a “distinct dual nature.” One side of her was “mischievous,combative, and obstinate,” while another was “mystical and metaphysicallyinclined,”7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText34] characteristics that those whogot to know the mature HPB would agree on. Her Aunt Nadya—just a few years olderthan HPB—tells us that from an early age she was sympathetic to the lowerclasses, and preferred to play with the servants’ children rather than withthose of her own class, and often made friends with “ragged street boys.”8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText35] This solidarity with her social inferiorswasn’t uniform, and she once had to apologize to an elderly servant whom she hadslapped.9 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText36] Given to schoolboy pranks, shewas equally obsessed with books, and had the embarrassing habit of tellingpeople what she thought of them right to their faces: all traits that would, inlater life, be part of the Blavatsky legend. Always helpful to the needy andoppressed, she had no capacity for grudges, and any evils done to her would soonbe forgotten. Again, the magnanimous, mature Madame Blavatsky.It was also from around this time that we start to hear about another side ofHelena Petrovna’s personality. According to Vera’s account, the house at Saratovwas old and huge, full of underground tunnels, long-abandoned passages, unusedturrets, and dozens of “weird nooks and corners,” reminiscent of a ruinedmedieval castle.10 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText37] HPB used to haunt theseempty places, sometimes hiding in them to avoid her lessons; even the stories ofan evil caretaker who had imprisoned serfs in the subterranean passages didn’tdeter her. Sometimes she would be found there, or in other unusual places,sleepwalking, or talking to “invisible companions,” or playing with unseenfriends she called the “hunchbacks.” She also told spooky stories to the otherchildren, and would often scare herself. She also seemed to display some unusualpowers, and was able to put pigeons to sleep using “Solomon’s wisdom,” whateverthat might have been. She seems also to have had some odd feeling for the lifeand consciousness in inanimate objects, in pebbles, stones, and pieces ofdecaying wood. Often, lying on a sandy ancient riverbed and looking at fossils,she would tell stories about the life of these strange creatures and those inthe Saratov museum, and forget herself in her visions of some dim, remote past.She also seems to have had a peculiar fascination with the dead, an interestshared by other esoteric thinkers. Jung, Gurdjieff, and Rudolf Steiner allshowed an early obsession with death and the dead. There are stories of her“whispering to herself” and telling of wild adventures, “marvellous tales oftravels in bright stars and other worlds,” which her governess considered“profane gibberish”—much as her later critics would her mammoth books—all ofwhich made her clearly “unlike any other person.”11[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText38]• • •HELENA PETROVNA WAS given the usual education for a girl of her rank, who wasdestined to play her role in the world of drawing rooms, social visits, andafternoon recitals, while preparing herself for the arduous task of finding asuitable husband. She was taught French—the lingua franca of the civilizedworld—and had lessons in art and music, decorative pastimes designed to enhanceher desirability. In the days before television and the Internet, part of awife’s job description was to entertain her husband. Her mother had shown talentin painting and on the piano, and early on had given her daughter instruction inboth. In later life, HPB herself would remain a talented artist and musician.Like her mother and grandmother, Helena Petrovna received no grounding inmathematics, history, science, or the classics, all of which were consideredunsuitable for the feminine mind. She did receive some extracurricular inputfrom her serf, Baranig Bouyak, an aged healer, holy man, and according to someaccounts, magician who lived in Saratov. He knew the occult properties of plantsand the “language of the bees,” and passed these on to the young girl. Bouyakhad a knack for reading the future, and predicted great things for Helena;confirming earlier suspicions, he told Vera that her sister was “quite differentfrom all the rest of you.”12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText39]At Saratov, she had another taste of the mystic East. One holiday was spent inthe summer camp of the Kalmuck Buddhists she had met while in Astrakhan. PrinceTumen welcomed his old friends, and here HPB had a glimpse of the life of thedesert nomads, and a lesson in the use of the Tibetan prayer wheel. In theUkraine she had learned how to ride a Cossack horse, and now she rode out to theKirghiz Steppe, a vast stretch of flatland that eventually led to Tibet. Tartarnomads traveled through the area, and soon Helena Petrovna learned enoughTibetan to ask questions about their life. On another occasion, an uncle tookher to Semipalatinsk, a mining town close to the Siberian and Mongolian border.Here she rode into the country of the Harrachin Lama, and heard a story about amurder in a cave, which years later would be transformed into her own shortstory “The Cave of Echoes.”It was around this time that certain strange experiences seemed to enter herlife. She spoke of a “protector” whom she saw in her dreams, and this isgenerally considered the first appearance of Blavatsky’s “Masters.” She told A.P. Sinnett, her first biographer, that in her early visions, his features neverchanged, and that years later, when she met him “in the flesh,” she instantlyknew it was the same man. She felt she had known him all her life. Even earlyon, this protector, however, could assume a more palpable form, and at the mostconvenient times. Looking at portraits of the Dolgorukov family, the ancestorsof her maternal grandmother, one in particular piqued her curiosity. It was hunghigh on a wall and covered with a curtain, and no one would tell her whom it wasa portrait of. Determined to know, Helena Petrovna pushed a table against thewall, and began to stack other tables and chairs on top of it. Climbing thisrickety heap, she managed to reach the painting and pulled back the curtain.Whatever she saw must have shocked her, for she lost consciousness, and the nextthing she knew she was lying safely on the floor, the furniture was back in itsplace, and the curtain had been drawn across the mysterious portrait. Sheconsidered that it may have been a dream—after all she was known tosleepwalk—but when she saw her handprint on the dusty wall she knew it hadn’tbeen. On another occasion, while she was on horseback, the animal bolted and shefell, with her foot caught in the stirrup. Most likely she would have beenkilled, her head smashed against the ground, except for some “strange sustainingpower” that held her head up until the animal was stopped. She later said it wasa “tall Indian in whole linen” who had appeared to save her, the same figurethat she had seen in her dreams.13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText40]While many might account for these strange visitations by chalking them up totheir guardian angel and leaving it at that, young Helena developed a deep needto understand them. Unlike many people who accept this sort of thing as “weird”or “odd” and quickly forget about it, HPB needed to know what it meant. In aletter about this time to her friend Prince Alexander Dondoukov-Korsakov,written much later in life, she said, “I was in search of the unknown.” At thispoint we can say that Helena’s quest for the answers to life’s mysteriesbegan.14 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText41]• • •THERE’S SOME CONTROVERSY about where exactly HPB was around the ages of thirteenand fourteen. Some accounts have her traveling from Saratov to London and Bathwith her father in 1844–45. She was supposed to have received piano lessons fromIgnaz Moscheles, a celebrated Bohemian composer, pianist, and music teacher whowas based in London at the time; his most famous pupil was Felix Mendelssohn,whom he taught in Berlin. Colonel Olcott, who recounts the story in his OldDiary Leaves, claims that on this trip she performed with Clara Schumann, wifeof the composer Robert Schumann. If so, this would have been a gratifyingtribute to Helena Andreyevna’s work on her daughter’s musicianship. MostBlavatsky scholars doubt the journey. The trip isn’t mentioned in Vera’smemoirs, although if Vera wasn’t taken along, she might well omit it out ofspite, or for other reasons. One biographer suggests that Blavatsky fantasizedit, to compensate for her father’s lack of interest in her.15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText42] Sylvia Cranston believes HPB mixed up thechronology—“she was poor at remembering dates”—and that this trip took place in1850.16 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText43]• • •HPB’S NEED TO understand the strange phenomena happening around her had anopportunity to be satisfied when she discovered the library of hergreat-grandfather Prince Pavel Dolgorukov. In the letter to Prince AlexanderDondoukov-Korsakov mentioned previously, she says that “my great-grandfatherPrince Pavel Vasilyevitch Dolgorouki, had a strange library containing hundredsof books on alchemy, magic and other occult sciences,” and she tells the princethat she had “read them with the keenest interest before the age of 15.” “Soonneither Paracelsus, Kunrath, nor C. Agrippa would have anything to teach me,”she boasted.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText44]Readers familiar with the Western occult tradition will know these names, and ifHPB’s dates are correct, then the library must have been of great importance toher grandmother, as she must have taken it with her for their stay in Saratov.By the time HPB was fifteen, her grandfather was being replaced as governor ofSaratov and awaiting a new assignment.HPB’s great-grandfather appears to have been an interesting character. Amilitary commander during the reign of Catherine the Great, he had beeninitiated into Rosicrucian Freemasonry toward the end of the 1770s, a time whenthe esoteric current in Europe was strong, and many secret societies, such asthe notorious Bavarian Illuminati, were operating. Prince Pavel belonged to theRite of Strict Observance, which was founded in Germany in the 1750s by BaronKarl Gottlieb von Hund.18 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText45] “StrictObservance” got its name because the rite required a vow of absolute obedienceto those whom von Hund called “unknown superiors.” These were high-rankingsecret Grand Masters of an extreme esoteric Freemasonry that, von Hund claimed,had its roots in the Knights Templar of the Crusades.19[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText46] In Russia, von Hund’s rite grew to includehigher esoteric degrees that involved the study of alchemy, magic, and Cabala,and it is possible that Prince Pavel met both Cagliostro and the mysteriousComte de Saint-Germain, the eighteenth-century alchemist, diplomat, and wit,believed to have secured the secret of immortality.In a footnote to what she called her “first Occult shot,” which we will look atmore closely further on, Blavatsky mentions a manuscript given to hergreat-grandfather by Saint-Germain. This purportedly “predicted in every detail”“the thorough metamorphosis of nearly the whole of the European map, beginningwith the French Revolution of ’93,” and which she claimed was “now in thepossession of the descendants of the Russian nobleman to whom he gave it.” The“Russian nobleman,” it is assumed, was her great-grandfather, and, according toColonel Olcott, who refers to this mysterious document in his Old Diary Leaves,the “descendants” were HPB’s Aunt Nadya Fadeyev.The notion of “unknown superiors” became particularly important in RussianFreemasonry through the work of Nikolai Novikov, a writer, freethinker, andsatirist who is often considered Russia’s first journalist. Prince Pavel joinedNovikov’s Lodge Latone in Moscow, and it is possible that he belonged to aninner, secret group called the Harmonia Lodge, formed by Novikov in 1780, theaim of which was the “inner perfection and union of all masons.” This secretgroup consisted of only eight or nine members who were known as “The Brothers ofthe Inner Order.” As with von Hund’s Strict Observance, members were sworn tosecrecy and to absolute obedience to the “unknown” Head of the Order. There werenine “Heads” in all, leading nine Orders, and according to a mysterious document(“The Rosy Cross in Russia,” published in The Theosophical Review in 1906), theylived in Egypt, Cyprus, Palestine, Mexico, Italy, Persia, Germany, India, andEngland: all places that would later turn up on HPB’s world itinerary.In 1792, alarmed by the French Revolution and the belief that Freemasonry andother secret societies were behind it—perhaps justified, given the “thoroughmetamorphosis of nearly the whole of the European map” that the document givento Prince Pavel by the Comte de Saint-Germain spoke of—Catherine the Great hadNikolai Novikov and other high-ranking Masons imprisoned. The fact thatNovikov’s newspaper satirized the Russian aristocracy was surely a factor too.Prince Pavel wasn’t arrested, but that his library contained works on alchemy,magic, and Cabala suggests that he was involved in some of the higher degrees ofNovikov’s order. When Catherine died in 1796, Novikov was released, but he wasso shaken by his imprisonment that he resumed neither his Masonic nor satiriccareers.20 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText47]“The Rosy Cross in Russia,” which provides information on Novikov’s Inner Order,also refers to another mysterious manuscript. Dated 1784, which was not a goodyear for Freemasonry—fearing an Illuminati conspiracy, the Bavarian governmentoutlawed all secret societies then—it states that “true Masonry will arise oncemore in Tibet,” a notion that HPB was apparently aware of. In her introductionto The Secret Doctrine, she speaks portentously of “several documents in the St.Petersburg Imperial Libraries” which show that “in the days when Freemasonry andSecret Societies flourished unimpeded in Russia . . . more than one Russianmystic travelled to Tibet . . . in search of knowledge and initiation in theunknown crypts of Central Asia.”21 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText48] Yet theidea that fleeing a dangerous Europe, Freemasonry sought refuge in the mysticEast, didn’t originate with Blavatsky, nor with the unknown author of “The RosyCross in Russia.” The idea first came from Heinrich Neuhaus, a Rosicrucianpamphleteer who is thought to have collaborated with Johann Valentin Andreae onthe original Rosicrucian manifestos.The “Rosicrucian furor” began in 1614, when a strange document announcing theexistence of the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross appeared in Kassel, Germany. TheBrotherhood proclaimed the coming religious, scientific, social, and politicalreformation of Europe, couched in strange Hermetic and alchemical language, andcalled on those who heeded its message to join it in its work. In an immediatesense, this meant liberation from Catholic and Hapsburg rule, an aim which, asreaders of Frances Yates’s classic The Rosicrucian Enlightenment know, wassoundly trounced at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, at the start of theThirty Years’ War. Many wished to join the Brotherhood, but try as they may,they could not, because the mysterious Rosicrucians could not be found. Even thephilosopher Descartes, father of modern, rational thought, tried to find thebrethren, but couldn’t. This led to their being given the nickname “theInvisibles.” For some, this meant that the whole thing was a hoax. For others,it meant that the Brotherhood only made themselves known to the worthy. Yetafter a time, when the name “Rosicrucian” became a synonym for charlatan, someof their defenders offered a different explanation, and Heinrich Neuhaus claimedthat the reason the Rosicrucians couldn’t be found was that they had left Europeand gone to Tibet.The notion of “invisible” Rosicrucian adepts and Masonic “unknown superiors” isnot that far from that of “Hidden Masters,” and the idea that some of themtraveled to Tibet makes the connection with HPB’s later philosophy all the moresecure. Having devoured her great-grandfather’s library, the young HPB now had aframework in which to understand the strange experiences that had colored herlast few years. And learning of her great-grandfather’s involvement withesoteric groups led by “unknown superiors,” that combined spiritual aims withpolitical ones, she was filled with the conviction that somewhere in the worldthere were men and women who had the knowledge she sought, and who might shareher own sense of solidarity with the oppressed classes. For all its moderncharacter as an “old boys” club, Freemasonry began as an expression of universalbrotherhood and egalitarianism, two ideals that were at the foundation ofTheosophy. The truth was out there, and Helena Petrovna was determined to findit. She was indeed “in search of the unknown,” and now, having absorbed hergreat-grandfather’s library, she had some idea of where to look for it."},{"pageContent":"TWOAROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY WAYSThere’s something in the Russian soul, especially when touching on religious,occult, and mystical matters, that’s unlike any other national temperament. TheEnglish corner the market on ghosts. The Irish are known for second sight. TheFrench have a long, and still active, alchemical tradition. The Germans haveproduced many astrologers, and Americans, always good on “know-how,” inventedthe New Age. But Russia tends to produce what Colin Wilson calls “mages—men orwomen who impress by their spiritual authority.”1[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText49]We can think of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, but also of Rasputin and Gurdjieff. InRussian Orthodoxy there is the tradition of the staretz, elders of the churchwho are seen as spiritual advisers and teachers, charismatic figures who enjoyno authority other than their own personal gravitas. Readers of The BrothersKaramazov will remember Dostoyevsky’s portrayal of the staretz Father Zosima.Many of these holy men took to the high roads and, like itinerant Buddhistmonks, carried their message throughout the land. Often they were believed tohave the power to heal and to prophesize. Perhaps it was this tradition of “holywanderers” that informed the kind of quest that Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and otherRussian seekers embarked on. Rasputin, the “holy devil,” once walked from hishome in Pokrovskoe, Siberia, to the monastery of Mount Athos, in Greece. On thesame trip he also took in Jerusalem. It’s not surprising that one of theclassics of Russian spirituality is the anonymous Way of a Pilgrim.There is an obsession here with things of the spirit unlike that of any otherpeople. The Russian existential philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev wrote that “Russiahas always been full of mystical and prophetic sects and among them there hasalways been a thirst for the transfiguration of life.”2[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText50] Berdyaev himself was a deeply religiousseeker, and he tells a story that characterizes the intensity of the Russianspirit. On one occasion, in the early hours of the morning, after a long,drawn-out religious argument, the proprietor of a café wanted to close up shop.Immediately the men clustered around the table shouted out, “We can’t go homeyet! We haven’t decided whether God exists or not!” and carried on.Berdyaev came from the generation of Russian intelligentsia known as the“God-seekers.” In the years prior to the Bolshevik Revolution—in what is knownas Russia’s “Silver Age”—they were a powerful spiritual force.3[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText51] All were informed with the peculiarlyantinomian character of Russian spirituality, the drive to go “beyond good andevil.” Talk of Rasputin as a “holy devil” encapsulates the idea, and in animportant essay on Dostoyevsky, Hermann Hesse expanded on it. Writing about TheBrothers Karamazov, Hesse speaks of what he calls “Russian Man.” For Hesse,“Russian Man” is a hysteric, a drunkard, a criminal, a poet, and a holy man, allwrapped up in one.4 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText52] He is a “primeval,occult, Asiatic ideal,” at once “murderer and judge, ruffian and sensitivesoul . . . complete egoist and a hero of total self-sacrifice.” Or, perhaps moreappropriate for our context, a guru or a fraud.HPB had a good share of both of these Russian traits—an intense devotion tospiritual truth, combined with a profoundly contradictory character—and bothgrew as she began her own quest for knowledge. But to the two fundamental traitsof Russian spirituality mentioned above, I would add a third. Berdyaev speaks ofwhat he calls yurodstvo, “being a fool for Christ’s sake.” This meant “acceptinghumiliations at the hands of other people” and “acquiescing in the mockery ofthe world, and thereby throwing out a challenge to it,” what in the Sufitradition is known as “the way of blame.”5 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText53]As we follow Blavatsky in her own wanderings, we will, I believe, see each oneof these deeply Russian characteristics come into play.• • •WHEN GRANDFATHER ANDREY was replaced as governor of Saratov, he found a newappointment as director of state lands in the Transcaucasus. Before HPB and hersiblings joined their grandparents in Tiflis (now Tbilisi), the capital ofGeorgia, they spent a year with their aunt Catherine Andreyevna Witte, mother ofHPB’s cousin, Count Sergei Witte. Years later Count Witte, a friend of Rasputinand Russia’s prime minister before the Bolshevik Revolution, provided an accountof his celebrated cousin in his memoirs, published posthumously in 1920 (Wittedied in 1915). They are less than accurate; among other mistakes, he states thatshe founded the Theosophical Society in England, and settled and died in Paris.According to most HPB scholars, they are most likely doctored and in any casesuggest a spiteful temper and a taste for low gossip.6[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText54]After a time in a small town across the Volga, they made the long trip to theCaucasus, the mountainous setting of Lermontov’s Romantic novel, A Hero of OurTime. It was at this time, at the age of sixteen, that Blavatsky says she beganto live a “double life,” which was “mysterious” and “incomprehensible,” even toherself, until she “met for the second time my still more mysterious Indian.”Even by fourteen, she claimed, she lived by day in her physical body, but atnight her astral form took over.7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText55] In amore public form, this dichotomy presented itself as a loss of interest in thesocial life she had earlier enjoyed. A friend of the family, Madame Yermolov,wife of the governor of Tiflis, remembered HPB as a bright, fun-loving,delightful young lady, as many young socialites no doubt saw her. But as shebecame more and more absorbed with the ideas she had discovered in hergreat-grandfather’s library, a more serious cast of mind came over her, and alife of endless parties and social gatherings began to pale. One friend whohelped the young HPB prioritize her interests was Prince Alexander Golitsyn, afrequent visitor at her new home. With him and with precious few others, HelenaPetrovna felt she could talk about the ideas that obsessed her.According to most accounts, Alexander was a Freemason, mystic, and magician whohad traveled in Greece, India, Iran, and Egypt, seeking out sacred places andmeeting men and women like himself, with a passion for the spiritual and theoccult. His grandfather, another Alexander Golitsyn, Minister for ReligiousAffairs and Education under his friend Tsar Alexander I, had predicted thatRussia would be the birthplace of a new universal church, expressing themessianic strain that Nikolai Berdyaev argues is a constant in the Russianpsyche. The first Alexander Golitsyn also seems to have embodied thecontradictory, unpredictable character of the Russian soul. He spent his youthin debauchery, until a reading of the Bible led to a spiritual transformation;this later gave birth to the influential Bible Society.He was also influenced by a friend, A. Koshelev, who was an intimate of many ofthe influential Masonic and spiritual minds of Europe, figures like the “unknownphilosopher” Louis-Claude de Saint Martin and the Christian mystic Karl vonEckartshausen, whose mystical classic The Cloud upon the Sanctuary ironicallyinspired the career of the notorious dark magician, Aleister Crowley.8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText56] That Eckartshausen wrote of a secret“Interior Church,” and that Saint Martin signed his books as “the unknownphilosopher” should suggest a fairly obvious link to “invisible” Rosicruciansand Masonic “unknown superiors.” (Later, with typical humor, for some of herarticles in her magazine Lucifer, Blavatsky’s byline was the “unpopularphilosopher.”)Golitsyn’s friend Koshelev promoted Russian Freemasonry, and as Berdyaev tellsus, this had a powerful influence on Russian politics at the time; theDecembrist revolt, crushed by Nicholas I, was informed by much Masonic thought.Under the influence of Golitsyn and Koshelev, Tsar Alexander I, Nicholas’spredecessor, studied both the writings of Saint Martin and Eckartshausen, andalso the enigmatic metaphysical teachings of the seventeenth-century Silesiancobbler and mystic, Jacob Boehme, with whom the term “theosophy” is alsoassociated, and underwent a religious crisis and conversion himself. As MariaCarlson remarked, Alexander I “surrounded himself with intimates who wereinvolved with Swedenborgians, Freemasons, mystical sectarians.”9[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText57] Koshelev was believed to have had contactwith Swedenborg, or at least with the Swedenborg groups that grew up after theSwedish sage’s death in 1772.10 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText58] And theelder Prince Golitsyn was known to have invited the German esoteric philosopherFranz von Baader to Russia.11 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText59]Not much is known about the younger Prince Golitsyn, except that he is supposedto have encouraged HPB to travel “in search of the unknown,” and one rumor isthat he had suggested the two of them join forces and run off together. Soonafter this, it’s said, he left Tiflis and it is unclear if the two ever saw eachother again. No doubt the prospect of running off with a young prince asinterested in the occult and esoteric as she was piqued HPB’s fancy, but it musthave set off alarm bells among her chaperones. Although by the time of herpublic career HPB had put on weight and photographs of her show a stout, massiveframe—her face, however, retained a certain beauty—in her early years she wasconsidered attractive. She had already run away once from her Aunt Catherine,and was most likely kept on a short rein. But the real trigger for herwanderlust came in a very different form indeed.Exactly why the seventeen-year-old Helena decided to marry the forty-somethingNikifor Blavatsky, vice governor of the province of Erivan, is unclear. Onestory is that she did so to spite her governess, who said that no man would haveso unruly, ill-tempered, and unpredictable a woman for a wife, not even the oldgentleman she had recently taunted and laughed at so much. Faced with such achallenge, the teenaged HPB cast her spell, and her “plumeless raven” wasquickly netted. Another story is that hearing of the plan to run away withPrince Golitsyn, the family felt duty-bound to protect her honor, and its own,and hastily shanghaied the old (by their standards) Nikifor into making anhonest woman of her. A third possibility is that she married Nikifor out ofanger at her father, who had recently remarried, to a Countess von Lange.12[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText60]Yet Blavatsky herself tells a different story. Prince Golitsyn, it seems, wasn’tthe only one who took her mystical passion seriously. In the letter to herfriend Prince Alexander Dondoukov-Korsakov, mentioned earlier, she wrote: “Doyou know why I married old Blavatsky? Because whereas all the young men laughedat my ‘magical’ superstitions, he believed in them!” She explains that hersuitor had “so often talked to me about the sorcerers of Erivan, of themysterious science of the Kourds and the Persians, that I took him in order touse him as a latch key to the latter.”13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText61]This suggests a fairly calculating sensibility for a seventeen-year-old, and akeenly opportunistic one. Blavatsky is eager to make clear, however, thatNikifor did not make out in the bargain. “But,” she tells the prince, “I neverwas his wife.” Nor was she ever anyone else’s. “Never have I been anyone’s wife,as evil tongues have pretended,” meaning that neither this marriage, nor anyother, was ever consummated. This is a point that will come up more than once inHPB’s later career, and she uses a colorful metaphor to make her meaning clear.“Never,” she says, “physically speaking, has there ever existed a girl or womancolder than I. I had a volcano in constant eruption in my brain, and—a glacierat the foot of the mountain.”Readers familiar with the Indian esoteric system of chakras—nodes of spiritualenergy believed to be located in the physical body—may note that Blavatsky maybe referring here to the link between the Muladhara chakra, located in thesexual organs, and the Sahasrara, found at the top of the head. In Kundaliniyoga, the idea is to awaken the energy in the lower chakras, and transmute itinto a finer, more subtle form that will, with persistence, explode in the brainin a sudden illumination, as the sexual orgasm does lower down. As HPB refers toa “glacier at the foot of the mountain,” this suggests that it was not an areaof great stimulation for her—nor, apparently, for her husband. One suspects,then, that unless he was as uninterested in sex as HPB was, young PrinceGolitsyn may have had an unhappy surprise if he and Helena Petrovna had rode offinto the sunset together.In her letter HPB speaks mysteriously about “the marriage of the Red Virgin,with the astral mineral,” and “the marriage of the Red Virgin with theHierophant,” a crucial operation in the alchemical union of the opposites, talkof which she had found in her great-grandfather’s library. And she makes clearthat whatever was needed in the masculine half of the equation for a successfuloperation, Nikifor Blavatsky simply didn’t have it. This could not have beenmere potency, because although old by HPB’s and her contemporaries’ standards,Nikifor, in his forties, would not have been impotent, not necessarily at least.But as she admits the fact that she was “cold,” it wasn’t sex per se that shewas searching for. But one gets the impression she was saving herself forsomething, and depending on whom you believe, she remained celibate throughouther life. Later in her career she will even produce a gynecological reportproving it.But whatever she was saving herself for, it was not the honeymoon with Nikifor.She seems to have had second thoughts about the marriage and tried to get herfamily to call it off. She even asked Nikifor to let her out of it. He was, shetold him, making a great mistake in marrying her, a truth with which he wouldsoon agree. Perhaps Nikifor’s other prospects were not that good, or perhaps hereally was besotted with her; either way, he didn’t relent. She ran away for afew days; where, no one knows, but a romantic escape with Prince Golitsyn wassuspected. Then she returned to make the best of it, reflecting that as amarried woman she would at least be beyond the control of her family. On July 7,1849, they were married; Helena was just short of eighteen. The story is thatwhen the priest said “Thou shalt honor and obey thy husband,” she muttered “Isurely shall not!,” as Galileo did when signing the recantation of theCopernican system forced on him by the Church. (Galileo is said to have mutteredunder his breath “It moves anyway,” meaning the earth around the sun.)No sooner had the knot been tied than Helena tried to cut it. On the day of thewedding, which was a big affair, with Kurdish horsemen riding in to honor thebride of their vice governor, HPB planned an escape. On the way to Daichichag,the summer residence of Erivan officials and where the couple would spend theirhoneymoon, Helena conspired with one of the Kurds to ride off to the Iranianborder. The Kurd informed Nikifor, and after that Helena was put under guard.For the next three months, in Daichichag and Erivan, Nikifor tried to enjoy hismarital rights, but Helena refused. In Erivan, they lived in the sumptuousPalace of Sardar, home to the territory’s earlier Turkish rulers, and with MountArarat looming in the distance, Helena concentrated on her great escape,crossing the Turkish border more than once on chaperoned journeys into thecountryside. Eventually, the frustrated Nikifor let down his guard, and anexultant Helena galloped off to Tiflis alone.Helena swore that she would rather die than return to “old Blavatsky,” and aftermany arguments, the family decided that she should be sent to her father in St.Petersburg. They arranged for her to meet him in Odessa. But again, HPB hadother plans. With an elderly servant and a maid, she was sent to Poti, on theBlack Sea, where she would board a steamer. Helena made sure they missed thatboat. She persuaded the captain of an English vessel, the Commodore, to go alongwith her plans, and for a hefty gratuity he agreed. Boarding with her servants,they sailed to Kerch, in the Sea of Azof, en route to Constantinople (Istanbul).She told the servants that at Kerch they would get back on the road to Odessa,and sent them ashore to secure lodging, arranging to meet them in the morning.That night she sailed away. At one point the harbor police came on board, and inorder to avoid being caught, Blavatsky disguised herself as a cabin boy. Troublewith the captain arose and when they reached the Bosporus, HPB secretly fledashore in a caïque.• • •IF THE READER feels this sounds like something out of Alexander Dumas and TheCount of Monte Cristo, I’m not surprised. HPB’s “journey into the unknown” hadbegun, and at this point her life becomes a series of adventures, much likethose her contemporary Jules Verne would pack into the pages of his novels.Around the World in Eighty Days was published in 1873, the year that Blavatskysurfaces in New York, and it made Verne an international success. But between1849, when she escaped her crestfallen husband, and that year, HPB embarked on avoyage that even Phileas Fogg would have found impressive. For the next nineyears, aside from her father, who sent her money when he could, no one in herfamily heard from her. She thought that if they did, they would help her“plumeless raven” track her down. Some accounts say that Nikifor himself senther money, so perhaps by this time he agreed with her warning that marrying herwould be a mistake, and bade her well on her Wanderjahre.• • •HER FIRST STOP was Constantinople. It was here that her cousin Count Witteclaimed she became a “circus equestrienne,” and later speculation had it thather celibacy was the result of an injury she received while riding bareback.There’s little evidence for either claim, although later HPB would have a nearfatal fall from a horse. She did have some traveler’s luck though, and met theCountess Kisselev, whom she knew from earlier days. The countess took her underher wing and they traveled together for a while in Egypt, Greece, and easternEurope. Helena was soon to meet more exciting and adventurous companions,although the countess herself seemed to have some peculiar tastes. HPB told A.P. Sinnett that the countess liked her to dress as “a gentleman student.” We’vealready seen Helena disguise herself as a cabin boy, and she also told Sinnettthat in India she wore men’s clothes too, and that at that time she was “verythin,” difficult as that may be to believe. For European women to dress as menin Eastern lands is not unheard of. Perhaps the most well-known example is thatof Isabelle Eberhardt, the Swiss writer and traveler who, dressed as a man,moved unmolested among the Sufis and Muslims of North Africa in the earlytwentieth century. Yet this fetish of Countess Kisselev’s—HPB does not explainwhy she asked her to cross-dress—combined with Blavatsky’s lack of interest inmen, led to suspicions that she was a lesbian and a transvestite, although it’sdoubtful if her glacier was melted by women either. (Aleister Crowley was onesource of this rumor, but then he also claimed that she was Jack the Ripper.14[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText62])We have some idea of what HPB was up to in Constantinople from her article “TheLuminous Circle” about the “Wonderful Powers of the Divining Girl of Damascus,”originally published in The Sun (New York) of January 2, 1876. In Pera, theEuropean quarter of the city, the Mevlevi dervishes, followers of the thirteenthcentury Sufi master Rumi, had a lodge, or tekke.15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText63] In her account, HPB visits a dervish therein search of a lost dog. The dervish induces clairvoyance in HPB and she findsthe dog.16 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText64] HPB was in search of moresignificant knowledge than how to find a missing pet, but the idea of seekingout those who know comes through. Another more dramatic discovery also happenedin Pera. There, Blavatsky would come upon someone who would weave in and out ofher life mysteriously during what K. Paul Johnson calls her “veiled years.”While returning home one evening, HPB was walking through Pera when she suddenlystumbled upon “the apparently dead corpse” of the Italian-Hungarian opera singerAgardi Metrovitch. He had been stabbed several times by a gang of Maltese andCorsican “ruffians,” three in all, who, she said, were in the service of theJesuits. A policeman, for a price, offered to push the body into a ditch, andwhen she saw him eyeing her jewelry, she flashed her pistol at him. She said shethen stood over Metrovitch for hours, until she finally arranged for him to betaken to a Greek hotel where he was known and could be cared for. It is unclearif Metrovitch had any esoteric interests (although he may have been a Mason) buthis friendship with HPB, which lasted until his death in 1872 in Ramleh (an Arabcity now in Israel) after being poisoned by the Maltese in Alexandria—by HPB’saccount, at least; the doctors said it was typhoid—links her to severalsubversive political movements of the time. Agardi was, by Blavatsky’s account,a “Carbonaro, a revolutionist of the worst kind, a fanatical rebel,” who hadinsulted the pope, and who hated the priests, especially the Jesuits, and whoescaped being hung by them in Austria only through the services of herself andCountess Kisselev.Mention of “ruffians” in HPB’s account of her first encounter with AgardiMetrovitch leads the Masonically minded to the foundation myth of Freemasonry,the story of Hiram Abif and his murder by three “ruffians” when he refused toreveal to them the secret “Mason’s word.” And for what it’s worth, the Jesuitswere the main target of the most radical Masonic offshoot, the BavarianIlluminati. (The Jesuits themselves had no love for any form of Freemasonry.)“Ruffian” is an antiquated word, but was still in use in HPB’s time, and she hada peculiar command of the English language. But given Agardi’s political links,one wonders if in telling the tale Blavatsky chose the name and number of hisattackers on purpose, to communicate, to those who might get the reference,Agardi’s and her own spiritual-political affiliations? Coincidence, perhaps. Butgiven the strange world that HPB was moving through, it’s not entirelyunreasonable to wonder.• • •METROVITCH COMES INTO HPB’s life at different junctures, none of them with anydefinitive clarity. According to Count Witte, HPB left Constantinople withMetrovitch for “one of the European capitals,” from which he sent letters to hergrandfather, claiming they were married. Their paths parted and he later turnsup in Tiflis, where HPB has returned for a brief time to her husband. Now on thedecline, Metrovitch is a singer at the Tiflis Opera House and he demands of HPBhis marital rights. Scandal forces them to Kiev, from which they flee afterpoems written by HPB about her friend Prince Dondoukov-Korsakov, at the time thecity’s governor general, appear throughout the city apparently alluding to somepast liaison. They then turn up in Odessa, where HPB gives séances, and triesher hand at an artificial flower factory and the manufacture of ink (likeGurdjieff, HPB seems to have had a knack for “hands-on” work). Then the couplehead to Cairo. En route their ship explodes. HPB survives. Alas, Metrovitch doesnot. . . .We are getting ahead of our story, but Metrovitch’s most controversialcontribution to “the Blavatsky story” is that he allowed her ward, Yuri, whodied in 1867 at the age of five, to be buried with his last name. Exactly whatYuri’s relationship to HPB was has been a matter of much debate. Some have saidhe was her love child by way of the Estonian Baron Meyendorff. Blavatsky herselfsaid that she took the child in because neither the father, Baron Meyendorff,nor the mother, Nathalie Blavatsky, her sister-in-law, wanted it, as it wasillegitimate. Again, we are getting ahead of our story, but during the briefreconciliation with Nikifor—lasting, depending on your sources, either a fewdays or a few years—HPB agreed to adopt the child. A passport issued to HPBmentions her “infant ward, Youri,” and the gynecological report mentioned abovesuggest that the child wasn’t Blavatsky’s. The report, issued in 1885, statesthat she “has never bourne a child.”17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText65]Anti-HPB biographers, such as Marion Meade, think otherwise, and argue that theboy was the product of an adulterous relationship between HPB and Metrovitch.18[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText66] Baron Meyendorff and Nathalie Blavatskywill reappear further on, when we come to examine HPB’s relationship—or lackthereof—with the Victorian medium Daniel Dunglas Home.• • •AFTER CONSTANTINOPLE, HPB went to Greece, and from there Cairo. Although inlater years her mystic compass will point toward India and Tibet, in her earlydays, all occult roads led to Egypt, and we can say that here her esoteric questtruly begins. She was in good company. Legend has it that Pythagoras, Plato,Moses, and other Western greats went to school in the land of the pyramids, andChristian Rosencreutz himself, mythical founder of the Rosicrucians, went theretoo. In her travels, HPB would echo the legendary journeys of earlier seekers.Paracelsus, the Swiss alchemist and sixteenth-century father of alternativemedicine, met shamans in Russia, visited tin mines in Cornwall, studied alchemyin Cairo and the Cabala in Spain, and was a military surgeon in Italy. Laterseekers such as Cagliostro and the Comte de Saint-Germain gave rise to the themeof the “Noble Traveller,” whose “wanderings,” according to the mystical poet O.V. de Lubicz Milosz, “though apparently haphazard, rigorously coincided with theadept’s most secret aspirations and gifts.”19[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText67] As chroniclers of HPB’s adventures soonrealize, her itinerary coincided with quite a few interesting things.One character she met in Cairo was the American artist, scholar, and travelerAlbert Rawson. Like HPB herself, Rawson is one of these dizzyingly accomplishednineteenth-century figures, who no longer seem to be made in our time. He wasborn in Chester, Vermont, in 1828, so was only a few years older than Helenawhen they met. He had studied theology and medicine, and had published his firstbook, The Divine Origin of the Holy Bible, at seventeen, and went on to writemany more, on themes ranging from religious history to Eastern geography andlanguage, Freemasonry and occultism. He also wrote fiction, and made some threethousand engravings. He was a much sought-after illustrator—his most famoussubjects were Queen Victoria, Louis Napoléon, and the Empress Eugenie. Hereceived doctorates in Divinity from Oxford and in medicine from the Sorbonne,studied law and archaeology, and in his spare time traveled, mostly to theOrient. At one point, as the explorer Richard Burton did, he journeyed to Meccadisguised as a Muslim; in fact, his visit preceded Burton’s.20[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText68] Another of his interests were secretsocieties and the shadowy world of “fringe Masonry.” He was “adopted” by theAduan Bedouins of Moab, and accepted by the Lebanese Druze, and either joined orinitiated several Masonic groups.21 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText69] He wasalso a freethinker and an early member of the Theosophical Society. In K. PaulJohnson’s controversial work on the identity of Blavatsky’s “Masters,” Rawsonplays an important role as one of the “seekers of truth”—in Gurdjieff’sphrase—with whom HPB associated during her “veiled years,” before surfacing inNew York at the start of her “mission.”Rawson described his meeting with HPB in an article he wrote for an Englishmagazine, The Spiritualist, in 1878, following the success of Isis Unveiled. Hewrote another similar account years later, after her death. He records that hemet HPB and Countess Kisselev at Shepherd’s Hotel, a four-star accommodation,which suggests that Blavatsky’s road trip was being financed, either by herfather or by Nikifor. Two items of his account are worth noting. One is that HPBused hashish. This is something that will be repeated a great deal (I’m guiltyof it myself) and, in the 1960s and ’70s (as well as today) made HPB more“relevant” to youthful seekers, who found Theosophy so much more interestingwith the thought of its founder enjoying a joint.The only other reference to HPB using hashish comes in an article by HannahWolff, written during Blavatsky’s early days in New York. This is little morethan an exercise in character assassination; conveniently, it was only publishedafter her death. In it, HPB is also addicted to opium, her complexion is“torpid,” “grimy,” and “pasty,” her nose a “catastrophe,” her hair “wooly, likea negro’s,” and she is a “very stupid and unprepossessing woman,” who would “goto any length to dupe.”22 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText70] Hannah Wolff wasthe wife of John B. Wolff, president of the First Spiritual Society ofWashington, D.C., and at the time, and throughout her career, HPB was PublicEnemy No. 1 to devout spiritualists, for reasons which will become clearshortly.There are dozens of references to HPB rolling and smoking her own cigarettes; itis a set piece in accounts of her, with numerous reports of her “delicatefingers” deftly rolling one cigarette after another. But there are noreports—aside from those of Rawson and Wolff—of her ever adding hashish to hertobacco. And if she did use hashish, at that time it was usually eaten, notsmoked, which meant its effects were much more powerful.23[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText71] This would certainly have been the case inCairo circa 1851, or New York in 1873. She could not, as some have suggested,have written while under its influence, or at least written anything worthreading. Faithful adherents deny that HPB ever touched the stuff, and Blavatskyherself warned against the use of drugs and alcohol—which, of course, does notmean that she never used them.24 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText72] Somewriters have suggested she may have, early on, and then dropped it. I don’tknow, but I’m inclined to think not, just because of the lack of any otherreferences besides those of Rawson and Wolff. Although slightly disreputable,use of hashish and other drugs did not become a sign of moral depravity untilthe early twentieth century, and given HPB’s other eccentricities, one wouldimagine most journalists would have thrown it into their stories. I’m alsoinclined to wonder if Rawson did, precisely because it made for good copy, andit was what was expected of someone steeped in “Eastern mystery.” But of course,HPB may have tried it, and where else to do so but in Cairo? (It was, in fact,from Egypt that the use of hashish spread to Europe, when Napoléon’s troopsbrought the practice back to France.) Some of the occult schools that she cameinto contact with did employ drugs, so in that context it would not be unusualfor her to use them also.The other item of note is that she and Rawson visited a Coptic “magician,”Paulos Metamon, whose address HPB may have got from Prince Golitsyn. Disguisingthemselves as young Muslim men in order to move through Cairo undisturbed, theyvisited Metamon, who quickly saw through their disguise. They explained thatthey had come in order to learn from him. Metamon was happy to oblige, for aprice, and showed them his books of magic and astrology. Rawson remarks thatthey tried to form “a society for occult research” sometime after the visit butthat it was unsuccessful, and Metamon suggested they wait until a better moment.K. Paul Johnson suggests that Metamon may have been involved in the unsuccessfulsociété spirite that HPB started in Cairo twenty years later, in 1871, an ideafirst suggested by the Traditionalist philosopher René Guénon, no friend ofTheosophy, in 1921.25 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText73] Johnson suggeststhat Metamon may be the original of Serapis, one of the earliest of HPB’sMasters to make an appearance, at least to her and Colonel Olcott. JoscelynGodwin suggests he may be the original of “M,” which is usually taken to be thesign of Master Morya, the mysterious Indian of her dreams whom she will soonmeet in the flesh. As HPB’s early occult references tend to be Hermetic andEgyptian, the “M” that she refers to in 1875, when she once again tried tolaunch an “occult society,” may have been Metamon.26[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText74] Called “the Miracle Club,” this attemptalso failed. Apparently in the world of occult societies “three strikes andyou’re out” doesn’t apply; as we will see, it wasn’t until her fourth attemptthat she was successful.• • •FROM CAIRO, IN 1851 HPB crossed Europe and headed to Paris, bringing theknowledge she had learned about magic, occultism, Freemasonry, and relatedsubjects from Rawson, Metamon, and possibly others, with her. In Paris, she issupposed to have “astonished the Freemasons,” at least according to someaccounts. One person whom she impressed was the mesmerist and spiritualistVictor Michal. Michal was familiar with astral projection and crystal-gazing,and used hashish in his work—a possible link to HPB’s own disputed use—and he issaid to have found HPB a wonderful trance subject. He said that while in tranceshe would become a completely different character, but that on returning to her“self,” she would be subject to fits of anger. This seems an echo of HPB’sremark about leading a “double life,” and when we come to the writing of IsisUnveiled and other works, we will look at the idea that Blavatsky exhibited someform of multiple personality. Michal wanted to keep HPB in his employ, and shewas in contact with other spiritualists while in Paris, but, again, she hadother plans, and we will return to HPB’s controversial relationship toSpiritualism further on.From Paris, Blavatsky headed to England, where, as the cliché goes, she met herdestiny. HPB’s first meeting in the flesh with her Master Morya is perhaps themost important moment of her life—although if the accounts of her being savedfrom her early fall from a horse are true, she had met him to some extentalready. Yet, as with practically everything else in her story, there is no onedefinitive version of this fateful meeting. It is supposed to have occurred inLondon in 1851, the year of the Great Exhibition, while she was there as acompanion to her godmother, Princess Bagration-Murransky, although some accountshave her there with her father on their disputed London journey. HPB andPrincess Bagration were staying at Mivarts Hotel, which is now Claridge’s,again, not a budget accommodation. In one version, perhaps the most well known,she sees the “tall Indian” of her dreams in a crowd and he tells her to meet himlater in Hyde Park; he was there, she said, as part of “the first NepalEmbassy.” She told A. P. Sinnett “I cannot, I must not speak of this. I wouldnot publish it for the world.” In another version, told to C. W. Leadbeater, whowould become a high-ranking Theosophist after Blavatsky’s death, she meets himat the Great Exhibition, which was held in Hyde Park, and he was there with adelegation of Indian princes. But in a letter to Prince Dondoukov-Korsakov, shesays that the Master saved her when, in a fit of depression, she consideredjumping into the Thames from Waterloo Bridge.27[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText75] And in another version, recorded in an oldnotebook sent to her companion Countess Wachtmeister by her Aunt Nadya, whilethe countess and HPB were staying in Würzburg, Germany, HPB says that themeeting took place in Ramsgate, an English seaside town popular in thenineteenth century on, of all days, her twentieth birthday. When asked why shehad recorded the meeting at Ramsgate rather than London, HPB told the countessthat Ramsgate was a “blind,” a false clue.28[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText76]Whichever of these is the “real” account—if indeed there is one—the upshot wasthat Morya had sought her out purposefully, for he had a special mission in mindfor her, which suggests that he somehow knew she would be in London. If sheaccepted it, it would require special preparation. She would, he told her, haveto spend three years in Tibet. HPB had no intention of turning this offer down.Who Morya was, what HPB’s mission was, and how she got to Tibet—if she everdid—will be looked at in the next chapter. Right now, HPB decided that the bestway to get to India—in order to get to Tibet—would be to follow Columbus’sroute. So she steered west, and headed to America.• • •BY THE AUTUMN OF 1851, HPB was en route to Canada. She was a fan of JamesFenimore Cooper, and his descriptions of Native American Indians—althoughneither Cooper nor anyone else called them that at the time—led her to want tomeet some real-life examples. In Quebec, she was introduced to some Indians whomshe hoped would share their knowledge of the medicine men with her. Instead,they stole her boots and other possessions. In Isis Unveiled, she laterexplained their actions as a result of the work of Christian missionaries, whoseeffect on other Indians—those of the subcontinent—she would also findreprehensible. Around this time she is supposed to have received a legacy fromPrincess Bagration; exactly how much is unclear, and she is said to have usedsome of it to buy land, to which she lost the deed. But she had enough left totravel. She then thought to investigate the Mormons, but as their first city,Nauvoo, in Illinois, had just been decimated by a mob, leaving the survivorshomeless, she changed her plans. Mexico piqued her interest, but she would passthrough New Orleans first on the way, in order to study voodoo. In a dream,Morya warned her about this dark practice, and she moved on. Passing throughTexas, she reached Mexico, and then headed further south, to Central and SouthAmerica, where she explored the ruins of ancient Incan temples and believed shehad found the location of a lost treasure, which, sadly, she was unable toretrieve at the time. (It was allegedly a ransom that an Incan queen had offeredto Pizarro in return for her husband’s life.)In 1852, it was time to head to India. An Englishman she had met in Germany twoyears earlier was, she knew, on a similar quest, so she wrote to him andsuggested they meet in the West Indies, and from there travel East together.They were joined by a Hindu she had met in Honduras, a chela, or student, of theMasters (by now there were more than one), and the three headed for Ceylon viathe Cape of Good Hope. From Ceylon they reached Bombay (today Mumbai), wherethey separated. Blavatsky told Prince Dondoukov-Korsakov that she stayed inIndia for two years, receiving monthly payments from some unknown benefactor andfollowing an itinerary set out for her. Morya sent her letters, but during thistime she didn’t meet him. It was during this visit that she made her firstattempt to reach Tibet, sometime in 1853.After her first attempt on Tibet, HPB returned to England via Java. (There issome debate over the chronology here; I follow that of Sylvia Cranston and Borisde Zirkoff, editor of the Collected Writings, which seems the most widelyaccepted.) She left India on board the Gwalior, which she says was “wrecked nearthe Cape,” but that she survived with twenty others. By the time she got toEngland, in 1854, the Crimean War had broken out and she was a hostile alien.She remained in England for some time under contract as a concert musician andmember of the Philharmonic Society.29 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText77] Shealso had another meeting with the Master, this time “in the house of stranger.”He was in the company of a “dethroned native prince,” whom most accounts suggestwas Dalip Singh, the recently deposed maharaja of Lahore. HPB and the Masterspoke, but, strangely, when recounting this meeting later, Blavatsky forgot whatthey spoke about. After this, HPB headed to America again, this time New York,where she again met Albert Rawson. His description of her at this time, “supple,muscular and well rounded,” suggests she hadn’t yet started to put on the weightof her later years. After New York, she headed to Chicago, and from there shemade a journey to the West, crossing the Rockies in a covered wagon. She stayedin Salt Lake City with a Mrs. Emmeline Wells, a Mormon, who noted that HPB waswearing men’s shoes in preparation for travel over hard country.30[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText78] Wells thought she was heading to Mexico.It’s unclear if on this trip Blavatsky did go south of the border again, but shedid make it to San Francisco, en route to the Orient, specifically India, whichshe reached via Japan.On this trip to India, it seems HPB may have made contact with the Master,unlike during her first journey. In Isis Unveiled, she speaks of coming intocontact with “certain men, endowed with such mysterious powers and such profoundknowledge that we may truly designate them as the sages of the Orient.” Someaccount of her adventures during this time may be found in her book From theCaves and Jungles of Hindustan, which was originally serialized in the MoscowChronicle under the pseudonym “Radda Bai” from 1878 to 1886. Her editor, M. N.Katkov, later reprinted her accounts in the Russian Messenger, and they appearedin book form in English in 1892. For most of HPB’s career, she was known in herhomeland as the author of these semifictional tales of adventures in themysterious East, and they remain very readable “ripping yarns” today, in manyways setting the mold for later tales of similar journeys. In HPB’s stories, theMaster appears as “Gulab Singh.” This Indian journey, which included anotherattempt on Tibet and travels in Kashmir, Ladakh, and Burma, ended in 1857—justbefore the Sepoy Mutiny, which posed a major challenge to British rule.Receiving “orders” from the Master, HPB left Madras (today Chennai) for Java,and headed again to Europe.• • •ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT, 1858, the doorbell rang at a house in Pskov, not far fromSt. Petersburg. A wedding party was going on, and HPB’s sister, Vera, one of theguests, answered the door. It was HPB. They had not seen each other for nearly adecade. As a wedding had started HPB’s long adventure, it seems appropriate thatone should be at the end of it—or at least at its temporary end. En route toRussia, HPB had spent some months in France and Germany, and had already been intouch with Aunt Nadya, whom she had asked to keep her return a secret. She wasafraid that Nikifor would try to assert his rights again, but he had assuredNadya that those days were over. When Vera asked about her years of travel, HPBwas strangely noncommittal, merely mentioning that she had seen Europe, America,and Asia. It was of this time that she later spoke when she said she had “sweptaway” all traces of her travels, and did not let people know where she had beenor what she had been doing. Her reason was that if her relatives knew she hadbeen studying occultism, they would have been horrified, as though she had soldher soul to Satan. It would have been preferable, she said, had she spent thelast decade as a prostitute. Yet the HPB who had returned to them had strangepowers that suggested a knowledge of the dark arts.“Things” started happening around her. “Raps” were heard on the walls, windows,and floors, and furniture moved of its own accord. HPB tried to avoidresponsibility for these phenomena but eventually she admitted that she wascausing them unintentionally, although she could, if she exerted herself, tosome degree control them. At one point, trying to convince her father and herbrother Leonid, now a university student and typical skeptic of the time, of herabilities, she said she could make an object too heavy to lift. Leonidchallenged her. She asked him to lift a small chess table that stood beforethem. He did so easily. Then she concentrated and looked at it, focusing hergaze intently. She asked Leonid to lift it again. He couldn’t, nor could afriend who got below the table and tried to lift it with his shoulders. When she“let it go,” the table shot up with such force Leonid’s arm was almostdislocated.On another occasion, in St. Petersburg, the family met a friend. Intrigued byreports of Helena’s powers, at his home he suggested that Colonel Hahn leave theroom and write down a word, and that Helena should try to spell it out with herraps, using the code one rap for “A,” two for “B,” etc. HPB’s raps spelled out“Zaitchik.” When her father returned, he was stunned. He had written down aquestion: the name of his favorite horse during his first Turkish campaign. Itwas Zaitchik. At Rougodevo, in a house owned by Vera’s late husband, a pianoplayed by itself, without opening. While there, a mysterious wound under theheart that HPB had sustained in her travels opened, and when a doctor tried totreat it, a strange brown hand appeared, preventing him—perhaps it was the samehand that saved her from the bolted horse as a child? The open wound triggered astrange illness, which lasted several days and involved convulsions and a“deathlike trance,” the first of a series of near fatal attacks that would visitHPB throughout her career.During a visit with Vera to the Metropolitan Isidore in Zadonsk (equivalent toan archbishop), more “phenomena” occurred. Furniture moved, walls creaked andcracked, raps sounded, and the chandelier seemed to take on a life of its own.The Metropolitan asked HPB if her “friends” could answer a question for him;they did. The Metropolitan was not shocked by these things, and said he believedHelena could use her powers for good. Vera relates many other occurrences andalso mentions that on some occasions, when HPB was pressed to “produce,” nothinghappened at all. Blavatsky later said this was because of her disgust “with theever growing thirst for phenomena,” a recognition of their essentialunimportance that would increase as her career moved on.The sisters journeyed to Tiflis to visit their grandmother, who died while theywere there. On this trip, which happened in 1860, HPB is said to have metanother Master, Hilarion Smerdis, a Greek, who will reappear later on in ourstory; Sylvia Cranston has their first meeting at a later date.31[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText79] It was also on this trip that Metrovitchand his wife, Teresina, also an opera singer, came to Tiflis to work in theopera house; in HPB’s notebook, there is a sketch of them as Mephistopheles andGretchen from Gounod’s Faust. Not long after this, in 1862, came HPB’sreconciliation with Nikifor, and their adoption of Yuri. How long she andNikifor lived together is unclear. During this time she supported herself in avariety of ways, through needlework and by rafting logs for the production ofspunk, a porous white substance which is highly inflammable and is used as atouchwood for fires. She noticed that the fungus, which turns wood into spunk,covered many trees in her neighborhood, and she had the brainstorm of floatingthe logs downriver for export.She had acquired a reputation in Tiflis and other places as a magician, a seer,and what we would today call a “psychic” and healer. By this time, she had givenup answering questions by raps, which was tiring and time consuming, and takenup giving spoken or written replies. She later told A. P. Sinnett how she couldread people’s thoughts by seeing them emerge from their heads as a kind ofspiral of “luminous smoke” that formed pictures and images around them, and sheremarked that often these thoughts find a home in the consciousness of otherpeople. She had, it seems, begun to learn how to control the strange phenomenahappening around her.In 1864, in Mingrelia, on the shore of the Black Sea, HPB was thrown from herhorse. She fractured her spine and entered a coma that lasted for months. Shewasted away, and it was feared she would die. She could respond to questions,but most of the time she was, she later said, in a kind of dream in which shewas somewhere else as someone else, another example of the strange “double life”she had entered years ago. She said that while in this state, she had no ideawho Helena Blavatsky was and that she seemed to travel in a far-off country as a“totally different individuality.”32 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText80] Backin Tiflis, she recovered, and along with her health she received something else.She had gained complete control of her powers. Like many other esotericfigures—Steiner, Jung, Gurdjieff, Swedenborg—HPB had passed through what thehistorian of psychology Henri Ellenberger calls a “creative illness,” and hadcome out a changed person.Following her “creative illness,” HPB hit the road again, traveling in Italy,Transylvania, and Serbia. Colonel Olcott claimed that during this time shetoured France and Italy giving music recitals as “Madame Clara,” and this isalso the time that Count Witte said she managed the Royal Choir of King Milan ofSerbia—except that King Milan wasn’t king yet, and so the choir could not havebeen his. It is unlikely, too, that Metrovitch, whose wife had recently died,would have accompanied her, and his work with the opera house no doubt obligedhim to stay in Tiflis. Tiflis, although a cultural center, began to boreBlavatsky, and the hunger for more knowledge and experience drove her out of itagain. Her sketchy travel diary speaks of Odessa, Syria, Lebanon, Jerusalem,Egypt, Greece. She may have studied Cabala with a learned rabbi at some pointduring these travels; Sylvia Cranston records that she corresponded with himuntil his death, and that his picture was one of her treasures. In 1867, she wasin the Balkans, Hungary, Venice, Florence, and Mentana, where on November 3 shewas wounded while fighting against the French and the papal army on the side ofGaribaldi. She later impressed Colonel Olcott with the musket balls stillembedded in her leg and shoulder, and showed him where a saber had broken herleft arm in two places. She was left for dead in a ditch—the battle was a routand Garibaldi himself was captured—and, as with her earlier “creativeillnesses,” this near-death episode, too, helped her gain greater control of herpowers. From Mentana she returned to the Balkans, where word came from theMaster to head to Constantinople; from here she proceeded for the third time toIndia and Tibet.Let us take a look, then, at her time in the land of the eternal snows."},{"pageContent":"THREESEVEN YEARS IN TIBET?Given the itinerary followed in the last chapter, that HPB claimed that in hertravels she also took in the “roof of the world,” may not seem so unusual. Yet,if all she did was to journey to the land of the eternal snows, that alone wouldmake her one of the greatest travelers of the nineteenth century. At that time,no place was more inaccessible than Tibet, and it was not until the Britishexpedition of Sir Francis Younghusband in 1903—which burst open Tibet’s closedborders with military force—that the West had any kind of untrammeled access tothis mysterious land. This was the time of the “Great Game” between Russia andBritain over dominance in Asia, and fearing the Russians were gaining undueinfluence in Lhasa, capital of the forbidden kingdom, the British Lord Curzon,the viceroy of India, sent Younghusband in as a kind of preemptive strike.Although the “White Tsar” Nicholas II did have designs on a “Russian Asia,”Curzon, it turned out, was wrong, but this did not become known until more thana thousand Tibetans lost their lives and the thirteenth Dalai Lama had fled toMongolia, in the company of his tutor, the mysterious Buriat Russian, AgwanDordjieff.1 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText81] Before Younghusband crashedTibet’s locked gates, any travelers who attempted to enter the forbidden landwere turned back, when they were not murdered by bandits, defeated by the cold,unforgiving landscape, or lost on difficult, confusing trails.Surprisingly, many who did try to breach Tibet’s defenses were women, andleaving aside HPB’s disputed attempts, in the late nineteenth century at leastthree other female travelers took their chances on crossing the highly guardedborder. In 1892, Annie Royal Taylor, a Christian missionary, tried to reachLhasa in order to spread the gospel to the Dali Lama. On horseback and indisguise, she got within three days of her goal before she was discovered andturned back by the border guards. In 1895, Mrs. St. George Littledale—as well asher husband, her nephew, and her dog—got within forty-nine miles of the holycity before they were forcibly expelled. And in 1898, the Canadian missionaryand doctor Susie Rijnhart lost her first child and her husband attempting toreach Lhasa. Rijnhart remarried and soon made a second attempt, only to die onthe borderlands, just three weeks after giving birth to her second child.Yet, even after Younghusband’s invasion, entry and travel to the “roof of theworld” was not easy. Accounts by Alexandra David-Neel, who, in 1923, became thefirst European woman to enter the forbidden city of Lhasa, make clear howarduous the trek must have been. Like many who made the perilous journey,David-Neel had to travel in disguise, well armed against bandits and corruptofficials, with maps hidden from covetous eyes and often going for days withoutfood and spending many freezing nights without shelter.David-Neel journeyed to this unearthly realm, where she endured constant threatand physical hardship, because she was driven by a need to understand themysteries of Tibetan Buddhism.2 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText82] And mostof those who made earlier attempts to reach Tibet, before the Britishunceremoniously opened its borders, were also driven by either religious orscholarly concerns. In 1667, the Hermetic philosopher, polymath, father ofEgyptology, and sinologist Athanasius Kircher produced his China Illustrata,which featured illustrations of the Dalai Lama and Lhasa’s Potala Palace, basedon reports by Jesuit missionaries. In 1811, Thomas Manning, a scholar andmedical doctor who had traveled to China and India, became the first Englishmanto enter Lhasa, having arrived there with Chinese troops after curing some ofthe soldiers of illness; he was also the first Englishman to have an audiencewith the Dalai Lama. In 1823, the Hungarian linguist Alexander Csoma de Koros[images/Koros.jpg], reached neighboring Ladakh—often called “LittleTibet”—having more or less walked there from eastern Europe; his journey hadstarted some three years earlier. In 1824, at the Zangla Monastery in Zanskar,Csoma de Koros [images/Koros.jpg] wrote the first English-Tibetan dictionary,and in 1831 in Calcutta, he added a Tibetan grammar to it. Csoma de Koros[images/Koros.jpg] reportedly was fluent in seventeen languages, and is known asthe “father of Tibetology.” In 1842, he planned to journey to Lhasa, butcontracted malaria in Darjeeling, where he died.The French Abbé Évariste Régis Huc entered Lhasa in January 1846, having alreadyendured a treacherous journey across the Ordos Desert, and having spent severalmonths studying the Tibetan language and Buddhist literature at the ancientKumbum Lamasery in China. Because of political developments, Huc and his fellowtraveler, Abbé Joseph Gabet, were forced to leave Lhasa in October that sameyear. Huc’s picturesque account of his travels in Tibet, China, and Tartary(what we now know as Siberia, Turkestan, Mongolia, and Manchuria) appeared in1850; it was extremely popular and was soon translated into several languages.Huc’s sympathy with Tibetan and Chinese culture, and his belief that Catholicand Buddhist ceremony had much in common, led to his delightful work beingplaced on the Vatican’s index of prohibited books, and later critics tookargument with what they saw as his sensationalism—which meant that his work wasread and enjoyed by the general public. Alexandra David-Neel writes that AbbésHuc and Gabet both reported that on the leaves and trunk of the “miraculous treeof Tsong Khapa”—the fourteenth-century founder of the Gelugpa school of TibetanBuddhism—which they saw in the Kumbum Monastery, they could read the words “AumMani Padme Hum,” a Buddhist mantra of compassion commonly translated as “O jewelin the lotus.”3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText83] On hearing of thismiraculous “Tree of Great Merit,” believed to have sprung from the blood of thenewborn Tsong Khapa, the French priests were understandably skeptical; but theirsuspicion soon turned to astonishment when their close inspection discovered nopossibility of fraud. Perhaps it was accounts like this that led some toquestion both their religious affiliations and their veracity.Although HPB’s “Buddhism” was sui generis, the Gelugpa school, which demandsstrict celibacy, is the form of Tibetan Buddhism with which her own practice ismost often related, and on one occasion, a Buddhist scholar is said to haveremarked that HPB was a reincarnation of Tsong Khapa himself.The main reason why Blavatsky’s critics doubt that she ever got anywhere nearTibet is that there is no record of her doing so, except, of course, her own.Some, like her biographer Marion Meade, argue that in the decade betweenabandoning Nikifor Blavatsky and ringing that doorbell in Pskov on Christmasnight, she never reached India, let alone Tibet, and that her tales of travelingin Asia, North and South America, and other points were fabrications, designedto hide the fact that she was really leading a immoral, dissolute life among thedemimonde of Europe’s capitals.4 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText84] For thesecritics, Blavatsky’s account is at best on a par with the implausible tales ofTibetan adventures found in the best-selling books by T. Lobsang Rampa. Rampa,whose real name was Cyril Henry Hoskins, was an Englishman from Devon and wasnever in Tibet, but claimed that he had lived there in a previous life as a lamaand that his present body was the “host” of his previous incarnation. The ThirdEye, Rampa’s first book, sold millions of copies and is still very popular. Hewent on to write nineteen more, one of which, Living with the Lama, was dictatedto him by his cat. In the late 1950s, Heinrich Harrer, author of the classicSeven Years in Tibet, hired a private investigator to look into Rampa’s claims.Subsequent accusations of fraud led Hoskins to move to Canada, where he died in1981. Ironically, in 1997, revelations about Harrer’s own youthful membership inthe Nazi party marred the debut of Jean-Jacques Annaud’s film Seven Years inTibet, based on Harrer’s memoir.While it is true that some, perhaps most, of HPB’s travelogue sounds likeunabashed tall tales, we have to admit that the idea of her slinking through thenightlife of Paris, Vienna, or other European cities as someone’s mistress isequally unbelievable, perhaps even more so, and the only evidence for thissuspicion is itself fairly suspect. Yet while there is some independent supportfor some of HPB’s travels—in a letter published in 1878, Albert Rawson providednames of people who knew Blavatsky in India prior to her relocating there in1879—there is very little corroborating her journeys to Tibet.5[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText85] And although the records of Annie RoyalTaylor, Mrs. St. George Littledale, Susie Rijnhart, and Alexandra David-Neelmake clear that it was possible for women to travel in the forbidden land, weknow that it was because others saw them there and recorded their attempts. Noone saw Blavatsky there, or at least that is what her critics say.And she would, they also say, be hard to miss. Peter Washington, author of thevery readable but often inaccurate Madame Blavatsky’s Baboon, voiced thisreservation succinctly. At a time when “Tibet remained closed to all but a veryfew travellers,” and when “Chinese, Russian, and British missions”—not tomention the Tibetans themselves—patrolled the borders “alert to the presence ofmilitary spies,” the idea that HPB could slip through unseen seems verydoubtful. As Washington writes: “the thought of the breathless, tactless andmassively stout Blavatsky managing to climb steep mountains in brutal weatherwhile concealing herself from trained observers is just too difficult toimagine.”6 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText86] No doubt it is, but the thoughtalso raises a few questions. Blavatsky herself, if she is to be believed,remarked that during her first trip to India, she was “very thin.” If she was,it is less difficult to imagine her scampering up the Tibetan trail. But if shewasn’t, then it is equally—again, perhaps even more—difficult to imagine a“breathless, tactless and massively stout Blavatsky” being the belle of the ballor enjoying herself in Europe’s fleshpots. We can’t have it both ways.• • •BUT WASHINGTON HIMSELF offers some evidence in HPB’s favor. Blavatsky told A. P.Sinnett that her first attempt to reach Tibet failed because she was turned backby the British border guards. Washington remarks that two British Army officersserving in Tibet testified after HPB’s death that they “had seen or heard of awhite woman travelling alone in the Tibetan mountains in 1854 and 1867.” Oneofficer in question, Major-General Charles Murray, met Colonel Olcott in March1893 on a train between Nalhati and Calcutta. During conversation, Murray toldOlcott that while in command at Darjeeling as a junior officer, he had been toldof a white woman at Punkabaree, near the Darjeeling hills, who was trying topass through Nepal to get to Tibet. She was there, she said, doing research fora book. Murray had orders not to let any Europeans cross the border, for fearthey would be slaughtered by bandits. Only recently, two French missionaries hadbeen murdered and Murray did not want another dead European on his hands. Murraydetained Blavatsky and she wound up staying as his guest for a month. When sheaccepted that he would not let her cross the border, she changed her plans andleft, according to Jean Overton Fuller, for Lahore. Olcott wrote Murray’saccount in his notebook, and asked him to sign it. Murray did, and in April1893, it appeared in an issue of The Theosophist. Murray specifically namedMadame Blavatsky as the “white woman” in question—a point Marion Meade leavesout when referring to the story—and the anecdote came up because in conversationOlcott had mentioned his work for the Theosophical Society. Sylvia Cranstonremarks that Murray had ample opportunity to correct the account or to askOlcott to withdraw it; that he did neither suggests that it was accurate, unlesswe want to argue that for some obscure reason, he lied about it. The only thingmissing is a description of the “white woman,” telling us whether she was thinor “massively stout.”7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText87]Other critics argue that in order to travel to Tibet at that time, one wouldhave had to carry a considerable amount of equipment, which Blavatsky, on herown, couldn’t have done. Gertrude Marvin Williams, a hostile biographer, arguesthat as there would be no possibility of getting provisions along the way, atraveler would have to bring along a pack team, interpreters, tents, bedding,food, water, and other rations, a stove and fuel, as well as servants to carrythese things, not to mention everything necessary for the return journey, anargument made against HPB’s Tibetan adventures as early as 1895.8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText88] Critics also speak of an “impassable”terrain. Jean Overton Fuller, whose mother and grandfather made the journeythemselves, argues that there are markets in Tibet where one can get what oneneeds along the way, and that unlike the British, who were there scouting forsecret and unknown paths through which the Russians might descend on them, HPBwould most likely take the easiest, most well-traveled route—which would be theone, indeed, where there would be markets, used by other travelers. We also knowthat HPB could ride a horse—even if she wasn’t a “circus equestrienne”—and thatshe is thought to have learned enough Tibetan from the Tartar nomads she metduring her stay at Saratov to ask questions, buy supplies, and get directions.• • •YET IF MAJOR-GENERAL MURRAY’S account above can be taken as proof that HPB madean attempt at getting into Tibet, it is also evidence that, at least on thisoccasion, she wasn’t successful. On her second try, though, she says she was.This happened in 1856 and her point of entry was through Kashmir, in thenorthwestern part of India; like Ladakh, Kashmir is also sometimes called“Little Tibet.” The story is that while in Lahore, she met a friend of herfather, a German ex-Lutheran minister by the name of Kühlwein, who may have beena relative of one of her governesses. Hearing that his friend was planning anexpedition to Tibet with two other travelers, HPB’s father asked Kühlwein tolook out for his daughter, as he assumed she would be attempting the same thing.HPB and Kühlwein’s group joined forces, and among their guides was a Tartarshaman, who had left his home in Siberia many years ago and now wanted toreturn. The idea was that as a Russian, HPB would be able to help him to dothis.At Leh—once the capital of Ladakh, now a district in the Indian regions of Jammuand Kashmir—Kühlwein came down with fever and had to abandon the journey. Theothers carried on, but soon Kühlwein’s companions also dropped out—either turnedback by the border guards or for some other reason—and HPB was left alone withthe shaman. HPB’s features have been described as “Kalmuck” and “Mongolian,” andSylvia Cranston suggests that it was because of this that she and the shamanwere allowed to continue past the frontier. Something happened though and theylost their bearings. It’s possible that the shaman, who wanted to get toSiberia, not Tibet, finding himself off his route, tried to get back on it andin the process got lost. Eventually they found themselves in a Tartar camp, andthe shaman arranged for them to stay and share their provisions. The Tartars,however, had no idea where they were nor how they could get back on route, andthere is some reason to think that they had meandered to the fringes of the GobiDesert. HPB speaks of the peculiar silence of the region, a reflection that SirFrancis Younghusband himself made when traveling in the Gobi years later.9[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText89]It was during their stay here that HPB witnessed the shaman in action, anaccount of which appears in Isis Unveiled. HPB had noticed that the shaman kepta strange stone under his left armpit. When she asked why he did, he refused totell her, but now she discovered its purpose. Outside their tent, the shamanstuck a wooden peg in the ground, and on top of this he placed a goat’s head.This, he told her, was a sign that he was about to perform magic and that no oneshould disturb him. He then took the stone and put it in his mouth. Almostimmediately, he fell into a trance; his body became as stiff as a corpse, and adeep voice seemed to rise up from the ground, asking what they wanted. HPBrealized that his astral body was now free, and she took the opportunity to gethelp. She asked the shaman to send his soul to the Kutchi of Lhasa, whom sheknew—a Kutchi is a kind of influential Kashmiri merchant—and that he should bemade aware of their situation. He did, and a few hours later, some horsemenarrived. They were friends of the Kutchi. They took HPB to the border and senther on her way back to India. What became of the shaman is unknown. Many yearslater, Colonel Olcott received some independent confirmation of this secondattempt on Tibet. When traveling with HPB in northern India in 1879, they passedthrough the city of Bareilly, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. There Olcott met a“Hindu gentleman” who said he recognized Blavatsky as the European woman whostayed with him many years before, when she was trying to enter Tibet throughKashmir.10 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText90]• • •ON NEITHER OF these attempts did Blavatsky achieve her goal, to reach the secretschool in eastern Tibet where, she believed, the Master and his fellow initiatesoften stayed and where she too could be initiated. On her third attempt, shesays, she was successful.In 1867, HPB was in the Balkans, where she got word from the Master to proceedto Constantinople; from here she would strike out once again for Tibet. JeanOverton Fuller suggests that she met Master Morya there, and with him took the“short, direct, but terrible overland route” across Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan,India, and the Kashmir.11 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText91] Just to get toTibet itself must have been grueling. The “short, direct” route fromConstantinople to Shigatse, where they were headed and where the TibetanBuddhist monastery of Tashilhunpo is located, is just over three thousand miles.It is short when compared to the sea route, which would have had HPB headingwest again, to Marseilles, where she would have boarded a ship that would havetaken her round the Cape of Good Hope to India. Fuller suggests they could havemade twenty miles a day on horseback. At that speed it would have taken themsome five months to reach their destination.Once in Tibet, the demands on the travelers would have increased. A latertraveler in Tibet, the Lama Anagarika Govinda, writes of his own trek across theroof of the world:Imagine . . . toiling for some 200–300 miles over endless mountain ranges,through steaming hot valleys and over cold, cloud-covered passes, fording wildmountain streams, where a slip of the foot means certain death, or crossing thethunderous abyss of a torrential river, clinging precariously to a shakyreed-rope of uncertain age. . . . Imagine . . . travelling through gorges, wherestones are falling from invisible heights and where waterfalls seem to rush downstraight from the clouds. . . . Imagine . . . negotiating overhanging cliffs onnarrow mountain paths and sharp-edged rock ledges which cut into . . . sore andtired feet.12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText92]The idea of a thin Madame Blavatsky, let alone a “massively stout” one, makingthis journey is enough to raise questions about it. But then we rememberRasputin walking from Siberia to Mount Athos, and the Hungarian Csoma de Koros[images/Koros.jpg] reaching Ladakh from eastern Europe, mostly on foot, and werealize it would have been possible, even if, as HPB’s critics believe, highlyunlikely.Although forbidden to most outsiders, Tibet’s borders, it seems, were open topeople of neighboring lands, and traders and pilgrims from Ladakh, India,Bhutan, China, and Mongolia often entered undisturbed.13[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText93] HPB’s “Mongolian” features would havehelped in this case. And while HPB’s critics often refer to her Masters asTibetans, the truth is that they were not. Master Morya was from the beginningher “tall, mysterious Indian,” and another Master, whom she would meet and staywith on this journey, was, at least according to some researchers, of Sikh andPunjabi extraction. In To Lhasa in Disguise, the adventurer and anthropologistWilliam McGovern—often said to be the inspiration for the filmmaker StevenSpielberg’s character Indiana Jones—reported that Kashmiris and Nepalese aregenerally allowed to settle in Tibet, so the presence of two northern Indians inShigatse would not have been unusual. Although it is typically ignored, HPBrepeatedly said that the school near the Tashilhunpo monastery, where she saidshe received her initiation and training, was not the central headquarters ofthe circle of adepts whose agent she had become, and that they had similarlocations in other parts of the world, in South America, Japan, Syria, evenChina. Egypt, too, was another important spot for this mysterious brotherhood.Blavatsky describes being taken to the home of Master Morya’s friend andcolleague, Master Koot Hoomi—his name is spelled in different ways, but forconvenience’s sake I will use this version. At the house he shared with hiswidowed sister, which was situated in a ravine, near a stream with toweringmountains in the background, KH (as he is often called) taught chelas, orstudents, of the Gelugpa, or “Yellow Hat” sect of Tibetan Buddhism. This wasfounded, as mentioned earlier, by the teacher Tsong Khapa in the fifteenthcentury. In Tsong Khapa’s time, the Buddhist teaching had deteriorated andbecome decadent under the influence of the primitive Bön-po religion, indigenousto the region, and had resorted to dark magical practices and animal sacrifice.Neither Koot Hoomi nor Morya were monks of the monastery nor Tibetan Buddhistsproper. But they were closely associated with the monastery, and the monks atTashilhunpo sent them any students whom they thought would be good candidatesfor their own special instruction. One such chela was the fifteen-year-old DjwalKhool (again, spellings of his name differ), who later became the alleged sourcefor the thousands of pages of “channeled” material taken down by theneo-Theosophist Alice Bailey—I say “neo-Theosophist” because most mainstreamTheosophists considered Bailey’s work unreliable.14[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText94] Djwal Khool later made a silk illustrationof the house where he, HPB, KH, and M lived. Jean Overton Fuller argues that thearchitecture depicted in Djwal Khool’s picture is Nepalese, and that thissuggests that Master Morya was from Nepal, and we remember that in one versionof his initial meeting with HPB, he is in the company of “the first Nepalembassy.” The furnishings for the house were spare, if there were any atall—rugs and cushions on the hard floor seem the only concessions to comfort—anda sunken chamber was said to house the Master’s library and museum. Djwal Khooldepicts a stream, and HPB remarked that she would follow this to a lake, whereshe bathed. Fuller remarks that HPB must have taken only short dips as the waterwould have been freezing and “she was not a swimmer,” which raises questionsabout how HPB managed to survive two sea disasters.KH himself was a highly cultured, highly educated individual. He had traveled toLondon, attended classes in Leipzig, spoke fluent French, and his English wasbetter than Master M’s. Both he and Master M were vegetarians—unlikeBlavatsky—yet Master M himself enjoyed some pleasures, such as smoking a hookahpipe. Blavatsky herself, we know, enjoyed tobacco; whether she did while inTibet is unclear. Critics trying to discredit her account point out that smokingwas banned in Tibet, a practice seemingly well in advance of our own health andsafety concerns. Supporters, however, point out that the ban was only nominaland never enforced—as, say, the law against crossing a street against the lightisn’t in many major cities. And in any case, as a Master and ascetic, Moryawould have been able to indulge in it if he liked, a liberality of behaviorenjoyed, we know, by many gurus.Critics argue that the descriptions HPB gives of Shigatse, Tashilhunpo, andneighboring locations, of local customs and manners, and of her life in generalthere, were cribbed from Abbé Huc’s account. But as the good Abbé did not visitShigatse or Tashilhunpo, it is difficult to see how she could have used him as asource for her descriptions of these places, although she could have relied onhis and other accounts to supply some basic information. Abbé Huc, we know, didgo to Lhasa, and did describe it in his book, and HPB would have had better luckpalming off some retouched account of his as her own observations of theforbidden city than in making up descriptions of Shigatse and Tashilhunpo out ofthin air. But even though both her sister and her biographer Sylvia Cranstonsuggest that she did visit Lhasa, HPB never said she did. Yet, if she was tryingto impress and mystify people with accounts of make-believe travel—as hercritics say she was—wouldn’t she have “gone the whole hog,” as Gurdjieff says,and thrown in Lhasa, too? After all, Lhasa is less than a hundred and fiftymiles from Shigatse, there was Abbé Huc’s account to crib from, and she may aswell have been hung for a sheep as for a lamb—if she was going to lie, why nottell a big one?It is possible, though, that she did travel near Lhasa. In 1927, a Major Cross,who had been manager of the tea estates of the Dalai Lama in the early years ofthe last century, gave a talk to the Toronto Theosophical Society. He is one ofthe two British officers mentioned earlier who provided sightings of Blavatskyin India. Cross related that while in his capacity as the Dalai Lama’s agent, hebecame interested in stories told by some of the oldest workers on the estatesof a “white woman” who, while journeying to a lamasery in the far north, hadpassed through their lands, some ten years after the Sepoy Mutiny—that is, in1867 to 1868, when Blavatsky would have been there. Cross believed the woman tohave been Blavatsky. To be sure, this is not an actual sighting, asMajor-General Murray’s is, and is little more than hearsay, but it does add someweight to the possibility that HPB had passed through this territory.15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText95]• • •SOME OF THE other evidence in support of HPB’s being in Tibet will be examinedwhen we come to look at her most “Buddhist” piece of work, The Voice of theSilence. But along with the question of her being in Tibet comes anotherdirectly related to it, namely, what she did while she was there. Master M hadtold her nearly twenty years earlier that he had a mission in mind for her, andthat in order to fulfill it she would have to spend three years in Tibet. Nowshe was there. What was the mysterious “preparation” for her task that he hadspoken about? It could not have been only the study of Tibetan Buddhism, asimportant and worthy a pursuit as this undoubtedly is. Otherwise, why would themonastery send some of its most promising chelas here, to the special school ofKoot Hoomi? It must have been something else. Blavatsky does speak of visitingthe monastery but of not being allowed to enter. She was told, however, that onits altar were curious cube-shaped tablets, on which verses in an unknownlanguage, Senzar, were inscribed. She speaks of “thin, oblong squares,” and“discs or plates” containing these verses, which were preserved “on the altarsof the temples attached to centres where the so-called ‘contemplative’ orMahayana (Yogacharya) schools are established.”16[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText96] Mahayana, or “Great Vehicle,” is the formof Buddhism that by most accounts appeared around the time of Christ, andincludes the notion of the bodhisattva, an enlightened individual who rejectshis own salvation, or passing into Nirvana, until that of all sentient beings isaccomplished. The verses inscribed on the “oblong squares” were recited to her;she memorized them, and some of them would later be translated by her and appearas The Voice of the Silence. The mysterious “Stanzas of Dzyan,” on which hermagnum opus, The Secret Doctrine is an enormous commentary, were also inscribedin the same strange tongue.Part of Blavatsky’s work while in Tibet included learning this mysteriouslanguage which, perhaps needless to say, no one before her had ever mentioned,let alone spoke. Senzar was not the only unknown language to appear in amysterious location in the mystic East. In the late 1890s, the French occultistAlexandre Saint-Yves d’Alveydre met the enigmatic Haji Sharif, who, along withteaching him Sanskrit, also relayed to him the hitherto unknown language ofVattan, which, he told him, was the official language of the “Great AgarthianSchool.” Agartha, like its sister Shambhala (with which it is often confused),was a vast sunken city located somewhere beneath the Gobi Desert, and was thehome of the King of the World, a somewhat sinister variant on Blavatsky’sMasters. While the idea of Shambhala is based in Buddhist legend and isassociated with the Vajrayana and Kalachakra teachings—Blavatsky herself speaksof it—Agartha seems a Western creation, linked to fabled Asgard, home of theNorse gods. In 1871, in his Dialogues et Fragments Philosophiques, the Frenchtheologian Ernest Renan wrote of “Asgaard” being located in Central Asia. In LesFils de Dieu (The Sons of God), the French writer and traveler Louis Jacolliotwrote of “Asgartha,” a 15,000-year-old city in Central Asia that was the sourceof the Aryan race (the Aryans were the “noble” northern Indians, so named by thenineteenth-century philologist Max Müller). Jacolliot heard the story fromIndian Brahmins while serving as a magistrate in Chandernagore, and his workwould be a major influence on Blavatsky’s own.Emma Hardinge Britten, a one-time friend of HPB and an early member of theTheosophical Society, does not mention Agartha in her book Ghost Land (1876),which Blavatsky knew, and which we will look at further on, but does draw on thelegend of the subterranean city hidden beneath the sands. This theme, of a“hollow earth,” would find mass dissemination in Jules Verne’s classic tale AJourney to the Center of the Earth (1867) which, along with being a masterpieceof adventure, is also full of esoteric hints—the popular film version leaves outall of Verne’s references to alchemy, a central thread running through thenovel. And the “hollow earth” and “hidden civilization” themes would be combinedin the early science-fantasy novel The Coming Race (1871) by EdwardBulwer-Lytton, an author whose work, we’ve seen, would be a powerful influenceon Blavatsky.HPB’s talk of a sacred, primeval language was also very much in line withscholarly research into language and its roots at the time, with Sanskrit beingthe most likely candidate for some ur-tongue from which all others descended.Other, more eccentric ideas about a single, primeval language were popular inoccult and esoteric circles going back to the late eighteenth century, and werelinked to a similar notion of some single, primal, sacred revelation, the priscatheologia or “perennial philosophy” associated with the mythic sage and founderof all knowledge, Hermes Trismegistus.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText97]Blavatsky herself speaks of Senzar as “the mystic name for the secret sacerdotallanguage . . . the mystery speech of the initiated adepts all over the world.”This theme of a primordial revelation at the dawn of man is one that Blavatskyherself would revive in her monumental works Isis Unveiled and The SecretDoctrine. It is curious, though, that along with Senzar, HPB’s syllabus in Tibetalso included English, something she was supposed to have been taught already byher Yorkshire governess Augusta Jeffries as a child in Odessa.18[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText98] She had already been in England and hadtraveled across the Midwest, where, one assumes, she had put Ms. Jeffries’slessons to good use. But perhaps there are mystic mysteries hidden in theEnglish tongue as well?• • •BUT ALONG WITH learning Senzar and English, while in Tibet HPB engaged in aperhaps even more difficult study: the development and control of her psychicpowers. The Masters Morya, Koot Hoomi, and others of their school were adepts,men—and one assumes also women—who possessed remarkable abilities. They couldcommunicate at a distance through “thought transference”—the term “telepathy”would not be in use until the psychical investigator Frederick Myers coined itin 1882. They could also read minds. They could project their astral bodies, or“bilocate,” as the phenomenon came to be called, and seemingly appear to be intwo or more places at once. They could “de-materialize” and “re-materialize”objects, and transport them over distances, rather like Star Trek’s“transporter.” They could enter and dominate another’s consciousness, what incontemporary New Age speak is known as “walk-ins.” They were clairvoyant andclairaudient. They could perceive and command occult entities, or “elementals,”the salamanders, undines, sylphs, and gnomes related to ancient elements offire, water, air, and earth.19 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText99] They couldsee “etheric” auras and read the history of objects through the power ofpsychometry. They were precognitive and had other powers as well.If her being in Tibet is difficult enough for Blavatsky’s critics to swallow,the idea that while there she was trained in the use of these remarkableabilities is, to put it mildly, absolutely unbelievable. Whether she was inTibet, Tanganyika, or Timbuktu, this sort of thing, they say, is simplyimpossible. It should be pointed out, however, that other travelers in theforbidden land also encountered individuals with some unusual talents. AlthoughAlexandra David-Neel found no traces of Blavatsky’s Masters, she encounteredenough magic in Tibet to write a book about it. Tibet, she said “seems to offerpeculiarly favourable conditions for telepathy—as well as for psychic phenomenain general.”20 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText100]Lama Anagarika Govinda confirms Alexandra David-Neel’s remarks, commenting on“the frequency of telepathic phenomena among the inhabitants of Tibet,” anobservation also made by the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin, who had noTheosophical bias.21 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText101] Govinda gives anexample of his guru knowing his thoughts at the very second they came to him.22[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText102] Govinda also saw evidence of psychometry,or the ability to mentally “read” the history of an object, and of the power ofa Tibetan hermit to “take possession” of his consciousness. This is known ascreating a “tulku,” and may be related to HPB’s experiences of leading a “doublelife,” and the strange duo-consciousness she experienced during her “creativeillness” in Mingrelia. Govinda relates that while staying the night in a resthouse near the hermitage of Gomchen, he felt that he had “no more control overmy thoughts, but that somebody else was thinking them,” and that he was losinghis identity. Govinda believed that the hermit was doing this unintentionally,simply by directing his powerfully focused attention on him, while he driftedoff into sleep. Significantly, Govinda says that he was “hovering between thewaking and sleeping state” at the time. This is known as the “hypnagogic state,”and there is a huge amount of evidence suggesting that it is a condition ofconsciousness strongly linked to paranormal or “occult” phenomena.23[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText103] It can also be seen as a form ofBlavatsky’s “duo-consciousness.”Another strange phenomenon found in Tibet is that of “lung-gom,” or “trancewalking,” a method of seemingly “walking on air,” of moving across the terrainat great speed and with “the elasticity of a ball.” This may be how HPB managedto cover great distances during her sojourn, but the idea of a “massively stout”Blavatsky bobbing up and down across mountain trails is somehow too comical.But perhaps the most remarkable “power” travelers found in Tibet is that of the“tulpa,” a mental or imaginary image or form that takes on a concrete and livingcharacter. These may happen involuntarily, when one’s own image appearselsewhere and interacts with others, as one would in everyday life; only lateris it realized it was a “phantom” and not the “real” person that was seen. Moreremarkable is the conscious creation of a “thought form,” which is “tangible andendowed with all the faculties and qualities naturally pertaining to the beingsor things of which they have the appearance.”24[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText104] David-Neel writes that “when he fled fromShigatze, the Tashi Lama left in his stead, a phantom perfectly resembling himwho played his part so thoroughly and naturally that everyone who saw him wasdeceived.”25 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText105] (This was in 1924, followinga dispute with the Thirteenth Dalai Lama; the Tashi or Panchen Lama is Tibet’s“second-in-command.”)David-Neel herself had problems with a tulpa of her own. She relates how, afterperforming the “prescribed concentration of thought and other rites,” shecreated a tulpa of a monk. It took her a few months, but eventually his formbecame “fixed” and he became “a kind of guest, living in my apartment.” The formwas mostly visual, she said, but she could also feel “as if a robe was slightlyrubbing against me.” Once she felt his hand touch her shoulder. After a time,the tulpa became an unwanted guest, and it took David-Neel six months to“de-materialize” him.26 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText106] In 1912, theThirteenth Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, told David-Neel thatA bodhisattva is the basis of countless magic forms. By the power generated in astate of perfect concentration of mind he may, at one and the same time, show aphantom of himself in thousands of millions of worlds. He may create not onlyhuman forms, but any forms he chooses, even those of inanimate objects, such ashills, enclosures, houses, forests, roads, bridges, etc. He may produceatmospheric phenomena as well as the thirst-quenching beverage ofimmortality . . . there is no limit to his power of phantom creation.27[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText107]When we remember that “the philosophers of the Mahayana”—the form of Buddhismthat the Tibetan variant is based on—“liken the universe to a magical display, amirage, a flash of lightning, or the ripples of waves on the sea,” then we maynot find it difficult to accept the idea that “Gods, demons, the whole universe,are but a mirage which exists in the mind.”28[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText108] And we may also accept that when the mindis focused powerfully, and achieves full concentration, it can accomplishextraordinary things. It was this concentration of the mind that Blavatskylearned, she tells us, during her time in Tibet.• • •IF BY NOW the reader feels that, for all our reflections, he is no nearer toknowing whether or not Madame Blavatsky was in Tibet, I cannot blame him. In allhonesty, I do not know myself. Blavatsky claimed that, all in all, she spentseven years there. In a rebuttal to criticisms by the spiritualist ArthurLillie, published in Light, a spiritual magazine, in 1884, she said, “I havelived at different periods in Little Tibet as well as in Great Tibet, and thatthe combined periods form more than seven years.” She never said that she hadpassed “seven consecutive years in a convent.” “What I have said . . . is that Istopped in Lamaistic convents, that I visited Tzi-gadze, the Teshi Hlumpoterritory and its neighbourhood, and that I have been further into, and havevisited such places of Tibet as have never been visited by other Europeans.” Andas to visiting the Master Koot Hoomi at his house in the ravine, she writes, “Ihave better proof in store—when I believe it needed.”29[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText109] What that proof was is unclear, but thatlater on in her career she sorely needed it, will become painfully apparent."},{"pageContent":"FOURA HAUNTING IN CHITTENDENIn the curious world of HPB chronology, a letter often sited as the first fromthe pen of the Masters was received by Blavatsky’s Aunt Nadya in Odessa in 1870.It would only be first reported, however, in 1884, when Nadya wrote about it ina letter to Colonel Olcott. It was later published in 1885 in a report of theGeneral Council of the Theosophical Society. The letter was written in French inwhat became known as Koot Hoomi’s handwriting, and it informed Nadya that herniece was safe and that she would return to her family shortly. “The noblerelatives of Mad. H. Blavatsky,” it said, “have no cause whatsoever for grief.”Although Madame Blavatsky had been ill, it went on, she was now well, owing tothe protection of “the Lord Sangyas”—the Tibetan name for the Buddha—and to thedevotion of friends. The letter ended by assuring Nadya that “before 18 newmoons shall have risen”—18 months—HPB “will have returned to her family.”Although receiving a letter from Tibet, hand-delivered by “a messenger ofAsiatic appearance,” was strange enough, the messenger’s manner of departure wasstranger still. According to Aunt Nadya, he “disappeared before my very eyes.”One would think that such an unusual event would have prompted Aunt Nadya tospeak about it straightaway, yet it wasn’t until fourteen years later that sheremembered it and mentioned it to Colonel Olcott. In her letter to Olcott, sheremarks that it is “difficult, not to say impossible for me, to comprehend howthere can exist people so stupid as to believe that either my niece or yourselfhave invented the men whom you call the Mahatmas,” and she goes on to say thatHPB spoke to her about the Masters “at great length, years ago.” As more thanone commentator has pointed out, this seems to contradict some remarks by Verathat none of the family knew anything about the Masters until well intoBlavatsky’s “ministry” and were baffled when they heard her talk about them.This suggests that Aunt Nadya may have been doing some creative backtracking inorder to support her niece, but it could also mean that her memory was poor, orthat she interpreted the young Helena’s remarks about the strange “Indian”visitor in her dreams in light of later developments. And although one wouldthink that having someone—let alone a mysterious Asian—disappear before youreyes would warrant a comment or two, perhaps the experience was so strange thatshe thought no one would believe her, or, being a devout Christian—as her letterto Olcott affirms—that it was a trick of the devil’s. Yet if it was, it broughtwelcome news about her wayward niece, about whom there had been no word for sometime.1 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText110]Not long after Nadya received this letter, which arrived, she said, in earlyNovember, HPB left Tibet—or wherever she had been—and headed out to accomplishher mission. This, along with learning Senzar and mastering her occult powers,was what she had learned during her time with Koot Hoomi. Her mission, it turnedout, was to prove the reality of the spiritualist phenomena that had become acraze on both sides of the Atlantic—but also to show that people were mistakenabout their alleged source, the dead. This was not true. In other words, psychicphenomena were real and offered incontrovertible proof of a spiritual reality,against the rising dominance of scientific materialism. But they were not causedby the spirits of the dead, or at least not by the dead that the many whoparticipated in séances in Europe and America believed they were contacting.This seems like rather an abstruse point on which to focus, and we will examineit in more detail further on. But for HPB and her Masters, it was absolutelycrucial.Before arriving back in Odessa, and thus proving Aunt Nadya’s mysterious lettercorrect, HPB embarked on another tour of eastern Europe. Passing through thenewly built Suez Canal, she reached Greece. While she was away, a lot hadhappened; for one thing, Germany had defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War,a development that brought the French occultist Eliphas Lévi to despair. InGreece, or possibly Cyprus, she met Master Hilarion again, who was part of oneof the Masters’ groups in that part of the world. After learning what she couldfrom Hilarion at Piraeus, the port of Athens, HPB boarded the S.S. Eumonia,heading for Cairo. On July 4, 1871, not far from the island of Spetsai, theEumonia blew up; gunpowder it carried in case of a pirate attack was the cause.Out of four hundred passengers, only sixteen survived, among them HPB. All hermoney and luggage were lost, and she spoke of seeing “limbs, heads, and trunksall falling around me.”2 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText111] As she was not aswimmer, one assumes she was quickly hauled out of the water, although if shewas by this time “massively stout,” this must have been a challenge. She wastaken to Greek land and later accepted passage on another ship to Alexandria.Here she apparently played roulette with some of the money the Greek governmenthad given her for immediate expenses. She came up lucky, and with her winningsmoved on to Cairo.3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText112]At the Hotel d’Orient, where she stayed—when she had the money, HPB liked totreat herself to some comfort—she met a woman who would later prove a key playerin her downfall. Miss Emma Cutting worked at the hotel, and she would later saythat at the time she lent HPB some money, indeed, had taken her in after hershipwreck, although if Blavatsky had been lucky at roulette and was staying atthe hotel, why she needed the money is unclear. Nevertheless, they got to knoweach other, and Emma became involved in an idea HPB had in mind. She wanted tostart a société spirite, much like the one she and Albert Rawson had tried tostart twenty years earlier. She again met Paulos Metamon, and may have alsostudied with Louis-Maximilian Bimstein, also known as Max Théon, an eccentricPolish-Jewish Kabbalist associated with the mysterious Hermetic Brotherhood ofLuxor. Both Metamon and Théon were possibly involved in the new société, whichwould be based on the ideas of Allan Kardec, a successful French spiritualistwho died in 1869. Kardec (whose real name was Hippolyte-Léon Denizard Rivail;the spirits had given him his new one) was an educationalist who had beenconverted to Spiritualism—or “Spiritism” as he called it—at a séance at which hesaw tables and chairs dance around a room of their own accord, or, moreprecisely, that of the spirits who controlled them. Although there are moresubtle differences between Kardec’s Spiritism and Spiritualism—they can be foundin his classic work, The Spirits’ Book, published in 1856—the central one isthat Kardec believed in reincarnation, something that spiritualists and theirclose kin, the Swedenborgians, rejected. After Kardec’s death, what we mightcall “mainstream Spiritualism” came to dominate. Oddly, Kardec’s version went onto become widely popular in Brazil, where it remains one of the country’s majorreligions.In mainstream Spiritualism, after spending time on earth, the soul resides foreternity in the spiritual realm. For Kardec, on the death of the physical body,the soul enters the spiritual worlds but then after a time, it returns to earthin order to continue work on its perfection. In fact, the soul can choose thelife in which it reincarnates, in order to have the best chance of development,leading to the reflection that we should never complain about our lot in life,as we chose it before we were born. Blavatsky’s relation to both reincarnationand Spiritualism will be more than a little ambiguous, but this vision of a kindof cosmic evolution found in Kardec is one with which she would be in accord.HPB’s second try at a société spirite, however, was as unsuccessful as thefirst. Even more so, actually, as some of the mediums involved were caughtcheating. Not surprisingly, there’s more than one account of this fiasco.According to a report given some years later by Emma Cutting—by this time EmmaCoulomb—Blavatsky used a “long glove stuffed with cotton” as a materialized“spirit hand,” and this clumsy device was soon found out.4[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText113] Yet, as will be seen, Emma Coulomb’strustworthiness as a witness is itself highly questionable. Blavatsky’s ownaccount has it that although she was against the idea of contacting the dead,she would allow the mediums to perform—Emma Coulomb (née Cutting) was apparentlyone of these—and then explain to the audience the truth behind the phenomena.What Blavatsky wanted to show was the difference between a passive medium—thatis, someone who was merely the means by which phenomena could occur—and what shecalled an “active doer,” someone who could produce and control the phenomena,and not, as with mediums, be controlled by them. In other words, a magician.This, in essence, is what she learned in Tibet—or wherever she was.Yet HPB seemed to be a poor judge of character, at least at this time. Orperhaps her generous nature was taken advantage of, something that will prove tobe the case down the line. In any case, while she was away, themediums—amateurs, according to her account—decided to try to fleece the membersof the society by staging fake séances. They also drank a great deal, somethingHPB was decidedly against. When she returned and discovered what had happened,she closed the society down—not, however, before a Greek “madman,” “who had beenpresent at the only two public séances we held,” tried to shoot her. She thoughthe must have been possessed by some “vile spook.” Although the society lastedonly two weeks, the attempt on her life—if it was not an exaggeration—in a wayproved her point. What her mediums were contacting were not the souls of thedear departed, but a species of astral hobo, psychic tramps with nothing betterto do than hover near the borderland between the living and the dead, lookingfor some mischief. It was this insight that would lead to the lifelong feudbetween HPB and the major spiritualists of her time.5[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText114]Although Blavatsky was away when her mediums tried to pull a fast one, becauseit was her society she received the blame for the affair and was branded afraud. Yet a letter from a fellow Russian who was in Cairo at the time—a Mr. G.Yakovlef—that her sister Vera claimed to possess, argues for HPB’s authenticity.In it he speaks of Blavatsky being able to tell him whose portrait and whoselock of hair it was that he kept in a locket, which he had possessed for only ashort time and which no one knew about. He also tells a story about how she“magically” caused a glass and a tumbler to shatter.6[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText115]Yet, even if Mr. Yakovlef was a satisfied customer, the situation in Egypt wasunsatisfactory. HPB decided to leave Cairo and once again travel. Before shedid, however, she met the famous French Egyptologist Gaston Maspero at theBoulak Museum, and also a Coptic adept, Serapis Bey, one of the Masters. Later,in New York, Colonel Olcott would receive mysterious letters from Serapis Bey,but now he seems to have been involved with furthering Blavatsky’s occultknowledge. She tells the story of how once, while camping in the desert, sheexpressed the wish for a café au lait, made in the fashion of the Café de laPaix in Paris. Serapis Bey (or, possibly, his “son,” Tuitit Bey, another Master)drew some water from their supply and handed the cup to HPB. It was a steaminghot café, just as she ordered it. Amazed, she began to drink, but as she did, itbecame mere water. Serapis Bey explained that he had created the illusion of hotcoffee.By some accounts, Serapis Bey is Paulos Metamon; Tuitit Bey is sometimes thoughtto have been Max Théon. K. Paul Johnson suggests that, while in Cairo, HPB alsocame into the orbit of two individuals who combined an interest in Freemasonryand esotericism with radical politics, the Sufi and Islamic modernist Jamalad-Din al-Afghani, and the Jewish-Egyptian playwright James Sanua, whom Johnsoncasts in the role of two of HPB’s “Masters.” Johnson’s exhaustive researchplaces Blavatsky as a “fellow traveller” with the Islamic reformer “al-Afghani,”as he was known, on at least five occasions, and although direct contact betweenthe two is still a matter of speculation, the fact that they were both in India,Tiflis, Cairo, India again, and Paris, at the same time—early 1850s and 1860s,1871, 1879, and 1884, respectively—and had very similar agendas, is stronglysuggestive of some connection. Johnson also speculates that the mysterious“Chaldean Book of Numbers,” which Blavatsky claimed was the source of what shecalled the “Oriental Cabala” and which, like her Book of Dzyan, is unknown toscholars, may have come to her through al-Afghani. Blavatsky claimed that thisancient text was “in the possession of some Persian Sufis,” a description thatwould fit him. A few years later, when Blavatsky begins to talk about amysterious “Brotherhood of Luxor,” it is more than likely, as Joscelyn Godwinsuggests, that she is speaking about the loose group of esoteric “fellowtravellers” she knew during this time.7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText116]One of these, Agardi Metrovitch, we know, died during her time in Egypt, eitherfrom typhoid fever, or from poison administered by the Maltese agents of theJesuits. Blavatsky claimed that the Master Hilarion had warned her of his peril,and according to some accounts, Metrovitch was in Cairo searching for her, asher family was concerned, having heard of her near fatal adventure on the S. S.Eumonia. (He was, it seems, in Odessa when word came, and as he was going toEgypt anyway on business, the family asked him to track her down.) As no churchwould bury him, she had to do it herself, and with another pupil of Hilarion,she dug a grave near the sea and laid him to rest.Leaving Cairo, HPB traveled in Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon, where she cameinto contact with the Druze, the highly secret Middle Eastern religious sectinto which her friend Albert Rawson had been initiated. It may have been throughRawson’s contacts that she became intimate with the Druze. It was also at thistime that she met the writer and traveler Lydia Pashkov, a little known but veryaccomplished character who was, among other things, a correspondent for LeFigaro and “the first woman to make travel literature her profession.”8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText117] While on caravan near Baalbek, Pashkovmet HPB’s party, and the two decided to travel together. Pashkov tells the storyof how Blavatsky raised the spirit of a strange monument in the sand, and thedescription she gives of the event makes HPB seem like some magician of old. Atnight, after drawing a circle around herself and uttering many spells, Blavatsky“pointed with her wand at the monument.” A great ball of fire flashed. Jackalshowled in the darkness, incense burned, and Blavatsky commanded the spirit ofthe person to whom the monument was dedicated to appear. An old, bearded manmaterialized and told them that the monument was the altar of an ancient templeof a forgotten god. HPB commanded the spirit to show them how the temple was inits glory. Suddenly they saw a vast, colossal structure and a magnificent city,then all vanished. Like Rawson and a few others, Pashkov would later testify tothe authenticity of HPB’s travels.After her adventure in Baalbek, HPB turned toward home. Again, she arrivedunannounced, turning up in Odessa in July 1872, roughly keeping to Koot Hoomi’sschedule. Her stay was short, though, and by April 1873, she was on the roadagain. She went to Bucharest, and then Paris, where she stayed with a relativeon the Hahn side of the family. Here, she spent her time writing and painting,although later critics claimed that she was once again trawling through thefleshpots and leading a wild life. These claims seemed punctured by a letterfrom a friend of the time, a Dr. Lydia Marquette, who told Colonel Olcott thatHPB’s behavior in Paris was “unexceptional,” and that she considered her “one ofthe most estimable and interesting ladies I ever met.”9[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText118] But her stay here, too, was cut short.Out of the blue a message came from Master M, along with a huge roll of Frenchbank notes—at least according to one account. She was to head to America, toutde suite.And so the next day she did.• • •AT LE HAVRE, Blavatsky booked a first-class passage on a steamer to New York.Just as she was about to board, she noticed a woman and two children sitting onthe pier. The woman was in tears, and when Blavatsky asked her what was wrong,she told her that the tickets she had bought in Hamburg for the voyage hadturned out to be fake, and they were not allowed to board. She had spent all themoney her husband had sent her from America on the useless tickets—she and thechildren were to join him there—and now they were penniless. Blavatsky told thewoman to come with her. At the ticket office, Blavatsky exchanged herfirst-class ticket for four in steerage, and they all boarded. For the next twoweeks HPB huddled with the masses in the overcrowded, rank, and filthyconditions below decks, en route to the new world. Having already survived theEumonia and the Gwalior, to get on board itself was a sign of bravery. Toexchange the comfort of a first-class cabin for steerage misery in order to helpanother was the act of a bodhisattva.HPB landed in New York on July 7, 1873. She was forty-two years old and had lastpassed through some twenty years earlier. She was there on a mission from theMaster, but exactly what to do next was not clear. As Ellis Island had yet to beestablished as a center for immigration control, she would have been processedat the Castle Garden Immigration Depot at what is now Fort Clinton in BatteryPark, and would later submit her naturalization papers. Before leaving France,HPB had written to her father, asking him to send money ahead to the Russianconsulate. Even if she had kept her first-class ticket, she would have arrivedpractically empty-handed, having the equivalent of only a few dollars left afterbooking her passage. (Apparently she had no intention of using any of the banknotes given to her by the Master. These she was later instructed to deliver tosomeone in Buffalo. Who that was or why she was giving him the money isunclear.) When she reached the consulate, she was disappointed; nothing waswaiting for her. HPB found herself in the situation of many of the immigrantsshe had traveled with, and in many ways her adventures in the next few years area kind of American success story, in which a penniless foreigner arrives in thenew world and, through courage, persistence, and determination, makes good.But first she had to find a place to live and a way to make a few dollars totide her over until help from Russia arrived. An article by Elizabeth Holt, aschoolteacher and one of the first people to meet HPB on this journey, publishedin The Theosophist many years later, gives us an idea of what New York was likein those days. Readers familiar with Martin Scorsese’s film adaption of EdithWharton’s novel The Age of Innocence may recognize the milieu. No skyscrapers,of course, and travel was by horse-drawn carriages. The north end of Manhattanwas mostly granite cliffs, “even as far down as Fortieth Street.” “A solidboulder” occupied what is now the space between Second and Third avenues, and onit squatters set up shanty towns. The East River lapped over parts of what isnow First and Second avenues, although Broadway and Fifth Avenue were welltraveled. The main attraction that year was the opening of Central Park, whichdrew some ten million visitors. The boulders and rocky outcrops that children inthe park delight in climbing on today give us a sense of what early New Yorkershad to contend with.A woman traveling alone then was usually turned away from respectable boardinghouses, and in any case HPB’s lack of funds—not to mention her exoticappearance—would make most of these off-limits to her. Someone mentioned a newand, for the time, unique development that at least temporarily provided asolution. A group of forty or so working women who couldn’t afford the more“respectable” rents banded together and established a housing co-operative inManhattan’s Lower East Side. HPB headed to 222 Madison Street, not far from theEast River, and soon her powerful personality made her a dominant figure in theplace. It must have been a comedown for a countess—her cousin, we remember, wasa count and her grandmother was a princess—but as usual, HPB made the best ofit, and her openness and upfront manner led to her becoming a kind of “denmother” for the other residents, who came to her for advice about theirproblems. She had found some work, sewing for a local Jewish shop that sold“fancy” items—nearby Orchard Street today remains a haven for discount clothingstores and tailoring shops—and later spoke well of her employer. She also didleatherwork, and designed and made advertising cards for some of the localbusinesses, along with other piecework. Again, like Gurdjieff, Blavatsky showedimpressive resourcefulness in dealing with what he called “the problem ofroubles.” She also began to gain a reputation as a psychic, much as she didyears earlier in Tiflis. She spoke of being under the guidance of “unseenpowers,” which her neighbors understandably took to mean “spirits,” and told hernew acquaintances about the diaki, or elementals. One woman was stunned whenBlavatsky told her things about her life that no one, outside of herself andsome deceased relatives, knew. But when she asked HPB to make contact with hermother, who had died some years before, Blavatsky explained that she couldn’t,as her mother was now occupied with much more important things and was in anycase outside her reach. Blavatsky also impressed her fellow residents with talesof her exotic past. Miss Holt was surprised when she casually described how shehad decorated the Empress Eugénie’s private apartments.Another person to meet HPB in those days was the journalist Anna Ballard, whoworked for the New York Sun. Ballard had been assigned to write an article on aRussian theme, and a friend had mentioned that she had met an extraordinaryRussian woman recently. About a week after she arrived, Blavatsky wasinterviewed by Ballard. One imagines they met in the common room of the women’sco-operative, which HPB used as a kind of office, and where she sat daily,smoking endless cigarettes. Elizabeth Holt speaks of HPB’s “conspicuous tobaccopouch, the head of some fur-bearing animal, which she wore around her neck,” afashion accessory today’s animal rights advocates and health and wellnessexperts might disapprove of. HPB’s tobacco intake was apparently phenomenal,although the “pound a day,” that Hannah Wolff claimed she inhaled isexaggerated.10 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText119] Her habit also served anadditional purpose. One evening, one of the women came running into the officebreathless and distressed, and explained that a man had been following her; theneighborhood, already rough, seemed to be getting worse. Blavatsky reached intoher capacious dress and produced her tobacco-cutting knife, explaining that ifany man tried to molest her, she had that ready for him.11[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText120]Blavatsky told Ballard that she had no intention of leaving Paris for Americauntil the day before she left. That, to be sure, was surprising enough, but thenHPB added, with special emphasis, “I have been in Tibet.” Ballard wondered why,after telling her about her travels in Egypt, India, and other exotic lands, HPBthought her time in Tibet especially important. We may have some insight intothis that Ballard, who became friends with HPB, lacked at the time. But what isimportant about these remarks is that they seem to be HPB’s first publicannouncement about her travels to the forbidden land. Blavatsky may have been,as Peter Washington writes, a woman “who was to court publicity withoutunderstanding how to manage it,” but she certainly lost no time in nailing hercolors to the mast.12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText121] An article abouther in The Sun—which had counted Edgar Allan Poe among its contributors—tellingof her adventures in the mysterious East certainly wouldn’t hurt her mission,whatever that might turn out to be.13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText122]• • •BY OCTOBER 1874, Blavatsky had moved to another women’s co-operative, this timeon Elizabeth Street near the Bowery, at that time a place of down-market musichalls, brothels, beer gardens, flophouses, and pawn shops, and home to theinfamous Bowery Boys, one of New York’s earliest street gangs. Here Blavatskyreceived word that her father had died, and that her share in his legacy wouldsoon be sent to her.14 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText123] When it arrived,it turned out to be a considerable sum.15 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText124]Hannah Wolff writes that she used the money to move to a hotel on Fourth Avenueand 23rd Street, where she lived lavishly.16[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText125] Other accounts have her meeting aCountess Gerebko, whom she had known in Russia, who persuaded her to invest alarge part of her inheritance in land in Long Island. This would be used as achicken farm and a market garden. Here she could live, work the land, and sellher goods. As HPB had made money as a logger in Tiflis, to profit from chickensin Long Island doesn’t seem too fantastic, but it turned out that the land wasnot as she expected and her trusting soul—or poor business sense—led to legalaction to retrieve her investment. But her unfortunate encounter with CountessGerebko was soon overshadowed by what was probably the most important meeting ofher life, aside, perhaps, for the one with Master Morya.• • •BLAVATSKY KEPT HERSELF apprised of all the latest spiritualist and occult news,and in those days there was quite a bit. We tend to think that popular interestin the occult, the esoteric, and the spiritual started sometime in the 1960s,during that decade’s occult revival.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText126]Yet a look at history shows this isn’t true. By the time of HPB’s arrival in NewYork, Spiritualism had been popular in both America and Europe for decades.Although its roots can be traced back to earlier movements such as Mesmerism andthe teachings of Swedenborg, the nineteenth-century spiritualist “craze” beganin 1848, in Hydesville, upstate New York, in an area known as the “Burned-OverDistrict,” because of the many religious revival movements that had eruptedthere. In March 1848, the Fox family became troubled by weird “knocks” and“raps” that sounded around their farmhouse; they seemed to come from nowhere.Although they searched for a source, none could be found. One evening, hearingthe noises, as a joke Kate Fox, one of the young daughters, called out “Mr.Splitfoot, do as I do!”—Mr. Splitfoot being a name they gave to who or whateverwas making the strange sounds. She snapped her fingers, and immediately heard asnapping sound in reply. Margaretta, her sister, joined in, as did their mother.In order to “test” Mr. Splitfoot, Mrs. Fox asked “him” to tap out her children’sages. Mr. Splitfoot obliged, even throwing in the age of a child who had diedyoung. To make it official, Mrs. Fox said, “If you are spirit, then tap twice.”Two loud bangs rattled the walls. Eventually it turned out that Mr. Splitfootwas the spirit of a man who had been murdered in the house before the Foxeslived there. Excavation in the cellar eventually revealed human hair and bonesburied in quicklime.18 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText127] The living couldspeak with the dead, it seemed, and soon others discovered this fact as well.By the time Blavatsky was mystifying reporters and residents of the Lower EastSide with tales of her adventures, Spiritualism, as this apparent contact withthe dead came to be called, was a major movement. It had even gotten intopolitics. In 1872, the year before HPB arrived, Victoria Woodhull, a medium,magnetic healer, and advocate of “free love,” became the first woman to run forthe U.S. presidency; her Equal Rights Party, a motley coalition of feminists,workers, spiritualists, communists—she was responsible for publishing the firstEnglish translation of The Communist Manifesto—and “free lovers,” challengedUlysses S. Grant and Horace Greeley for the office. Needless to say, she didn’twin, and such was the outrage against “Mrs. Satan,” as the tabloid press of theday named her, that she spent Election Day in jail. I haven’t come across anyreferences to Woodhull and Blavatsky ever meeting, but she seems exactly thekind of person HPB would have liked to have known. A scandal involving thehighly successful preacher Henry Ward Beecher—brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe,author of Uncle Tom’s Cabin—led to Woodhull’s downfall, and she left the UnitedStates for England in 1876.19 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText128]Blavatsky had been following the newspaper accounts of even more impressivephenomena than had amazed the residents of Hydesville. These centered around afarmhouse in Chittenden, Vermont. The first reports had appeared in The Sun, andsoon after, a rival newspaper, The Daily Graphic, had begun a series of articleson the strange events in Chittenden. The illustrations of the weirdmanifestations—spirits of all sorts—by the artist August Kappes had captured herattention, and just about that of everyone else in New York. So popular was thisbiweekly “on the spot” coverage, that copies of the Graphic were going for adollar an issue, which, at the time, was a lot of money. Blavatsky read withgrowing excitement and then had an idea. She would go to Chittenden herself andmeet the man responsible for these articles.• • •BLAVATSKY’S FATEFUL ENCOUNTER with Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, author of theoriginal Sun article and the ongoing series in the Graphic, was, like the verysimilar first encounter between Gurdjieff and his most influential follower, P.D. Ouspensky, an act of premeditation. Certainly, she trusted in fate and aboveall in the Masters, but when she had a good idea, she went for it. She alreadyhad a taste for notoriety and knew what one well-placed article in a newspapercould do. If she wanted an audience to whom she could announce herself and getgoing with her mission, here was one ready and waiting.• • •WHEN HPB ARRIVED in Chittenden on October 14, 1874, accompanied by her friend,Mrs. Magnon, a French-Canadian woman with whom she stayed briefly, she had, itis safe to say, an impressive past behind her. But the man she was purposefullygoing out of her way to meet and bring over to her cause—whatever that mightturn out to be—was no slacker either. Henry Steel Olcott was born in Orange, NewJersey, on August 2, 1832, which made him roughly a year younger than Blavatsky.In his younger years he had been deeply interested in clairvoyance and had somesuccess as a mesmerist, having cured one cousin of inflammatory rheumatism andanother of toothache through magnetic passes. But his interest in Spiritualismhad only recently been revived, and the last few months had seen him rise tonational notoriety through his articles on the Chittenden “haunting.”Before this, Olcott had a string of accomplishments that anyone would be proudto possess. His family roots went back to settlers who arrived not too longafter the Mayflower. An early passion for agriculture, which had him farming inOhio in his late teens, led to his establishing an agricultural school in MountVernon, New York, and a medal of honor from the U.S. Agricultural Society. Amodel farm in Newark, New Jersey, that he worked on was so successful that theGreek government offered him a chair in “scientific agriculture” in Athens, anappointment he declined. After studying farming techniques in England, he becamethe associate agricultural editor for the New York Tribune. Before he wasthirty, he published two highly respected books on farming; and in 1859, hecovered the hanging of John Brown, the abolitionist, in Charlestown, Virginia,also for the Tribune. He fought for the North as a signals officer in the CivilWar, but was invalided out with malaria, and then acted as a war correspondent.This led to his being commissioned to investigate corruption and profiteering inthe army. His rank of colonel and special commissioner of the War Department wasconferred on him through this, and because of his success, he continued hisinvestigations for the navy. In August 1865, Olcott was one of three mencommissioned to investigate the assassination of Abraham Lincoln; he uncoveredat least one conspirator, who was arrested after a raid Olcott had organized. Hereceived special commendations from the Secretary of War and the Judge AdvocateGeneral, and in 1868, after being admitted to the New York Bar, he practicedlaw, specializing in insurance and customs cases. His clients included theTreasury of the City of New York, the New York Stock Exchange, the Gold ExchangeBank, the Panama Railway Companies, several insurance companies, as well assteel and heavy goods manufacturers.I relate Olcott’s résumé at some length because in accounts of his life withBlavatsky, he is often portrayed as a gullible, earnest dimwit, taken in by thecrafty Russian adventuress and his own incorrigible credulity. Yet overlycredulous and gullible dupes do not, as a matter of course, get appointed toinvestigate the assassinations of U.S. presidents, nor do they receive medals ofhonor or requests to head departments of agriculture by the Greek government.A few months before Olcott started covering the haunting in Chittenden, he foundhimself sitting in his law office on Beekman Street, when the thought came tohim that of late he had paid very little attention to Spiritualism. Later,Olcott would wonder whether this thought was really his, or if it had come fromsomewhere or someone else. But then it led to his rushing out and buying a copyof the Banner of Light, a popular spiritualist magazine. In it he read about thestrange doings in Vermont, in which “phantom forms” were said to become“solidified.” The Eddy brothers, whose family had a history of second sight—aScottish great-great-great-grandmother was said to have been a witch—weredisplaying remarkable abilities at their farmhouse. They were known to levitate,which was remarkable enough, but the most incredible display was by WilliamEddy. If the reports were accurate, he could manifest a whole host of spirits.Red Indians, deceased men, women, and children, who sang, danced, played music,and even fought duels with etheric swords: All were “materialized” whileWilliam, and sometimes his brother Horatio, sat within a closed cabinet on amakeshift stage in a room the locals called “the ghost shop.”Olcott was struck. If this was true, he thought, and the people there could“see, even touch and converse with deceased relatives who had found the means toreconstruct their bodies, and clothing so as to be temporarily solid, visible,and tangible,” then it was “the most important fact in modern physicalscience.”20 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText129] He decided to find out forhimself. He did, and wrote about his observations in The Sun in an articleentitled “The World of Spirits, Astounding Wonders that Stagger Belief,” whichwas published on September 5, 1874. Soon after this, the Graphic commissionedhim to supply articles every other week about what was happening in Chittenden,and sent an artist along with him to capture the scenes.One reason Olcott’s interest in Spiritualism had declined and then revived mayhave been because his wife, the daughter of an Episcopalian rector, whom he hadmarried in 1860, had no interest in it at all, and more than likely thought itdevilish. At the time of his reawakening he was living at the Lotus Club—thenlocated at Fifth Avenue and 21st Street—and awaiting divorce papers. It is oftenclaimed that Blavatsky “lured” Olcott away from his wife and family—he had twoteenaged sons—but this isn’t true. The marriage had long ago failed, and Olcott,“a man of clubs, drinking parties, and mistresses,” had recently arranged for avisit to a brothel in order to provide his wife with the required grounds fordivorce; whether he made the best of a necessary evil is unknown.21[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText130] At forty-two, he had already achievedsuccess in several fields and had reached the time of life when the psychologistCarl Jung argued that men begin to think of a more meaningful, spiritualfulfillment. Earlier interests, such as Freemasonry, Mesmerism, and spiritualhealing again began to occupy Olcott’s mind, and the attraction of corporate lawand customs cases no doubt began to pale. The situation is again remarkablysimilar to that of P. D. Ouspensky who, like Olcott, was a journalist who foundhimself increasingly detached from the “real” world around him—in Ouspensky’scase it was current events like the Hague Conference of 1906—and drawn to thestrange world of the occult, an attraction that eventually led to his meetingwith Gurdjieff, as Olcott’s did with HPB.22[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText131] On the eve of meeting Blavatsky, Olcottmay have “lost all sense of direction in his dreary life,” as Peter Washingtonwrites, but this suggests a desperate, confused character, seeking anything tofill an empty existence.23 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText132] Perhaps hisinspiration had more purpose behind it? Perhaps his sudden return to thespiritual world was the result of some inner prompting, a psychic compass Olcotthad lost track of and which had just started working again, pointing him to truenorth? Whatever the cause, that sudden urge to rush out of his office and getthe latest spiritualist news certainly led to some remarkable developments.• • •WHEN HPB ARRIVED in Chittenden, she knew exactly why she was there. She alsoknew how to make an appearance. When Olcott saw her sitting at the communaltable at lunchtime—the family played host to dozens of spectators and charged asmall fee for the show—the first thing he noticed was her red Garibaldi shirt, amilitary tunic in blazing scarlet that had been the height of haute couture fora season or two and was not yet out of fashion. Amid the sober dress of Vermontfarmers it must have been a sight, as must have been the Mongolian features thatmay have helped her in her Tibetan forays. After the shirt, Olcott next noticedher hair, “a thick blond mop” that “stood out from her head, silken-soft andcrinkled to the roots, like the fleece of a Cotswold ewe.” Then the “massiveCalmuck face,” full of “power, culture, and imperiousness,” that contrastedsharply with the dour looks of the other guests. This caught his eye, as musthave the fur tobacco pouch, the many rings that adorned her delicate fingersand, perhaps lastly but most effectively, her eyes, sometimes said to be blue,sometimes blue-gray or azure, but always “magnetic.” Olcott whispered hisamazement to Kappes, and then made a beeline for a seat opposite her, to make acareful, detailed study.Olcott overheard HPB and her friend speaking in French, and following lunch,when the two stepped outside to have the inevitable cigarette, Olcott broke theice with a less than original line. “Permettez-moi,” he said, striking a matchfor her. They started talking, and Blavatsky told him of her travels and searchfor occult knowledge—but not before disingenuously admitting that she hoped thatthe man responsible for those articles in the Daily Graphic wasn’t there, as shewas afraid he might write about her. Since she had arrived in New York, so manyjournalists had. Clearly this bit of reverse psychology was not lost on theColonel, and he admitted that he was indeed the man in question. Ah, well then,it must be fate. But then she admitted that she had come to Chittenden preciselybecause of his articles.• • •SOON OLCOTT REALIZED that here was no run-of-the-mill medium, but a woman ofpower, who apparently had the denizens of the other world at her beck and call.HPB soon gave evidence of this on the spot. While she was there, the “red”Indians, Americans, and Europeans who had been called up from the other side ona regular basis by the Eddys faded away and in their place more foreign “spooks”turned up, all of them hailing from HPB’s own homeland. There was MichalkoGuegidze, a Georgian HPB had known in her childhood and who had died a few yearsback. After exchanging greetings, he obligingly strummed the Lezginka, aGeorgian national tune, on a guitar. A Muslim merchant from Tiflis appeared,along with a Russian peasant girl, and a Kurdish cavalryman, complete withscimitar and lance. One figure, that of a gentleman wearing the cross and collarof St. Anne, turned out to be HPB’s uncle.On another occasion, the materialization of a silver buckle from which amilitary decoration hung, and which was allegedly buried with her father, led tosome controversy. It will take us a bit ahead of our story, but a digressionhere may help clear up at least two ambiguous issues in HPB’s career: herrelationship with the medium Daniel Dunglas Home, and that of her ward, Yuri.Olcott reported the appearance of these strange etheric figures, and HPB’sability to conjure them at will, in his book People from the Other World,published in 1875. The medium Daniel Dunglas Home, then the reigning king of theafterlife on both sides of the Atlantic, read his account and took some offense.In a letter to a Dr. G. E. Bloede of Brooklyn, Home pointed out that theRussians do not bury military decorations with the dead, but return them to thegovernment, basing his assertion on the remarks of his friend Baron Meyendorff,whom we met in Chapter 2 as the possible father of Blavatsky’s ward.24[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText133] HPB therefore, according to Home, couldnot possibly have materialized the decoration from the grave, and was then afraud. And anyway, Home added, she had already tried the same kind of tricks inParis in 1858.Although the controversy, as well as the decoration, hung on the buckle, thatwas the easiest point to clarify. In reply, HPB stringently pointed out that itwas only the buckle, and not the decoration—which, indeed, was returned to theRussian government—that had materialized. But the business with Home ran deeperthan this. Home’s remarks appeared in an article by Dr. Bloede published in theSunday Herald, a Boston newspaper, on March 5, 1876. On different occasionsBlavatsky said that she had and that she hadn’t met Home. In an interviewpublished in Olcott’s paper, the Graphic, in November 1874, she claims that inParis she “made the acquaintance of Daniel Home, the spiritualist,” and that heconverted her to Spiritualism.25 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText134] Yet inher Scrapbook, Volume 1, where she makes the point about the buckle, she writes“Mr. D. D. Home . . . never knew or even saw me in his whole life,” but addsthat “he has certainly gathered most carefully the dirtiest gossip possibleabout Nathalie Blavatsky.”26 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText135] NathalieBlavatsky, HPB’s sister-in-law, we remember, was the possible mother of HPB’sward, Yuri, by way of Baron Meyendorff.Now, Home’s bad opinion of HPB—which led to a running feud between them—wasn’tbased solely on Olcott’s claims about her unique powers, which Home,understandably, might feel a bit challenged by. He was also piqued because ofwhat he believed was a scandalous affair between HPB and Baron Meyendorff. Thiswas supposed to have happened in Paris in 1858. About this Home is said to havewritten that he had warned Meyendorff about Blavatsky, whom he saw as a cheapadventuress. But Meyendorff was besotted with her—“massively stout” andall—because he was equally besotted with Spiritualism—hence his friendship withHome—and she had palmed herself off as a powerful medium—which she certainly wasnot—solely to ensnare him.Yet Lydia Pashkov, who met and traveled with HPB in Lebanon, later related thatshe knew Nathalie Blavatsky too, and that she had died in Aden in 1868.27[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText136] And so there is at least someconfirmation that there were two Madame Blavatskys—unless we want to believethat Lydia Pashkov was lying for her friend. Jean Overton Fuller examines thissomewhat confusing affair in some detail, and concludes that the MadameBlavatsky in question was Nathalie Blavatsky. Home, hearing of the affair withBaron Meyendorff, and irked by reports of HPB’s “powers,” confused the two, andused the gossip as ammunition against a rival.28[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText137]At any rate, Olcott was so taken with HPB that he did exactly what she had hopedhe would: He wrote about her in one of his reports for the Graphic. After that,she became something of a celebrity, and for the rest of her career, was in andout of the papers regularly. But HPB got something more than publicity fromOlcott. The two became friends, “chums,” as they soon called themselves, andwithin a week they even had nicknames: he was Maloney and she was Jack (orMulligan, Latchkey, and sometimes Old Horse). They formed a kind of metaphysicalMutt and Jeff, if readers are of an age to remember the old newspaper comicstrip about the two mismatched pals. Or perhaps an esoteric Odd Couple ringsmore of a bell: Blavatsky the wild, eccentric, unconventional mystic, wrapped inill-fitting robes, puffing incessantly on her cigarettes, and broadcasting heropinions on all and sundry in often coarse vocabulary, while her magnetic eyescaptivated everyone around her; Olcott, the sober, earnest, respectable Yankeelawyer, his long, flowing beard and stolid demeanor announcing his Victorianpropriety, while he cringes slightly at his chum’s ill manners. Although therelationship was platonic, the “attraction of soul to soul, not that of sex tosex,” as Olcott put it, they were pretty much made for each other, at least atthat time. In later years, their “chumship”—Olcott again—was less solid. Butright now they were on the way to becoming inseparable.Blavatsky showered the Colonel with confidences, showing him the old wound belowthe heart that she suffered from in Pskov, which had opened again because of herexertions in Chittenden. She also showed him where the saber had broken her armin Mentana, and the musket balls still lodged in her shoulder and leg, ratherlike an old swordsman showing off battle scars. More esoteric intimacies came aswell. HPB explained to the increasingly hooked Olcott that the “spirits” he andthe other visitors had seen at the Eddys’ farm were not those of the friends andrelatives who had passed on, but “thought forms” emanating from the livingcombined with the decaying “shells” of the dead, the etheric skeletons, as itwere, left behind when the immortal souls of the departed moved on to higherrealms. Unconsciously the Eddys added some of their own astral matter to thesespiritual automatons—it is, in fact, what all mediums do—who also absorbedpsychic energies from the audience. These etheric simulacra are then innocentlyaccepted by the audience as true visitations by their lost loved ones, but theyare really artificially revivified astral corpses, who enjoy the semblance oflife at the expense of the living. The practice, Blavatsky told Olcott, was darkand base, and she was here to expose it for what it was, and show the path totrue occult knowledge. She was, she told him, “sent from Paris on purpose toAmerica to prove the phenomena and their reality”—because they were irrefutablyreal—but to show “the fallacy of the Spiritualistic theories of ‘Spirits.’”That “fallacy” was the notion of human consciousness as a kind of conduit or“channel” for the dead: In the term originating at the time, it was a “medium”for powers outside itself, which it allowed to dominate it. For Blavatsky, whohad learned to master her own powers in Tibet, this was an abdication of one’sown freedom and responsibility, a kind of psychic slavery, especially as the“spirits” involved were often of a low type, the “larvae” of the astral realm,as she called them, borrowing from Bulwer-Lytton. Linked to this was the notionthat the spirits of the departed, once free of the flesh, lingered on in somenearby phantom realm, a kind of etheric Victorian drawing room, having nothingbetter to do than politely converse with their living relatives. As she wouldspell out in detail later, Blavatsky came to teach that every livingsoul—everything in the universe, in fact—is involved in a vast evolutionaryjourney, a transformative quest through all forms of being, from the lowest clodto the Godhead itself. Her mission was, in fact, to revive and revitalize theancient Hermetic, Neo-Platonic tradition, in which the divine spark sunk intocreation longs to return to its source, and which came to be known in our timeas “occultism.” This was why she told her friend in the women’s co-operativethat she couldn’t contact her dead mother. Her mother’s real self, the immortalpart of her—what Blavatsky would later, borrowing from the philosopher Leibniz,call her “monad”—had indeed “moved on,” and was too busy with the challenges ofher further evolution to have a quick chat with her daughter—who should herselfbe busy with more important things.Fulfilling her mission would turn out to be no easy task, and when it was infull swing, HPB found herself fighting a battle on three fronts. Thespiritualists were having a tough enough time as it was, defending themselvesagainst both the Church—who thought them demonic—and scientists—who thought themabsurd. But not only would she take on both of the spiritualists’ enemies, butthe spiritualists too, causing a considerable amount of confusion along the way.If she had hit the barricades in Mentana, battling against the papal army withswords and bullets, the spiritual scrap she was setting herself up for would beno less perilous."},{"pageContent":"FIVEANCIENT WISDOM FOR A MODERN WORLDAs a seasoned journalist, Olcott recognized good copy when he saw it, and in hisnext article for the Graphic, he introduced his new friend to his readers. “Thearrival of a Russian lady of distinguished birth and rare educational andnatural endowments was an important event in the history of Chittenden,” theColonel announced. In her “eventful life,” “Madame Helen P. de Blavatsky” hadtraveled “in most lands of the Orient.” She had searched for “antiquities at thebase of the Pyramids,” had witnessed “the mysteries of Hindu temples,”and—puffing up his new chum’s achievements a bit—had pushed “with armed escortfar into the interior of Africa.” Olcott assured his readers that he had “nevermet so interesting and . . . eccentric a character.”1[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText138] Although most of his readers wouldprobably never make her acquaintance, HPB would soon do everything she could tolive up to her reputation.Her own first appearance in print, at least in the United States—she claimed tohave written for foreign publications, but nothing prior to this time has cometo light—came in the Graphic too. It was a reply to a letter to the newspaper bya Dr. Beard, who had—at least to his own satisfaction—“proved” that themanifestations at Chittenden were fakes. Beard had read Olcott’s articles and,as HPB did, decided to visit Chittenden and see for himself. His investigationstook all of two days and consisted of poking around in the Eddy brothers’ spiritcabinet and demanding that they hold a galvanic battery he had brought alongwith him. The electric current, he believed, would prevent them from engaging inany trickery. The brothers declined—the battery’s current was rather strong—andthe meeting broke up into fisticuffs. Dr. Beard returned to New York andproduced a letter exposing the whole affair.2[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText139] Blavatsky read it and immediately repliedin a manner that would become familiar to her readers.In a hectoring, table-thumping style, HPB leveled Beard, undermining anyqualification he had to investigate the manifestations. If scientists likeWilliam Crookes (inventor of the cathode-ray tube), Alfred Wallace(co-discoverer of the theory of evolution), and Camille Flammarion (the greatFrench astronomer) could devote years to the study of Spiritualism, and concludethat the phenomena were real, she argued, Beard’s “exposé” after a mere two dayswas pitiful. Blavatsky stayed at Chittenden for another two weeks before shereturned to New York, and in her rebuttal to Dr. Beard, she describes in somedetail the “Russian” spirits that arrived during her stay. She also challengedhim to produce, as he said he could, everything available at Chittenden with“three dollars’ worth of second-hand drapery,” offering a five-hundred-dollarprize if he succeeded.Beard did not take up the challenge, nor did anyone else. Yet from theperspective of understanding HPB’s “mission,” what is most important here isthat from the beginning she made a distinction between the reality of thephenomena and that of their supposed source. Crookes, Wallace, and Flammarionhad argued that even if “the well-known phenomenon of materialization of spiritsdid not prove the identity of the persons whom they purported to represent, itwas not, at all events, the work of mortal hands; still less was it a fraud.”3[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText140] The key phrase here is “did not prove theidentity of the persons whom they purported to represent.” Blavatsky had alreadyexplained to Olcott that the manifestations were not of the dead, or at leastnot of their “immortal souls,” which had moved on to more important business.Yet, although she had made clear to Olcott that her purpose was to reveal the“truth” about Spiritualism—to, in a sense, expose it in her own way—for the timebeing at least, she had to pretend to be a fellow traveler with it. In her replyto Dr. Beard she calls herself “a Spiritualist of many years” standing. But inher Scrapbook, where she pasted her letter as it was printed in the Graphic, shecrossed out the word “Spiritualist” and wrote “Occultist,” and added thecomment: “one who laughs at the supposed agency of Spirits! (but all the samepretends to be one herself).”Blavatsky’s work as an esoteric undercover agent—an occultist in spiritualistclothing—would lead to more than a little confusion, and also to some bitteranimosity toward her by the people whose beliefs she was ostensibly trying todefend. Sylvia Cranston writes that “in view of her real feelings,” that HPBpretended to “champion” the spiritualist cause is “puzzling.”4[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText141] True, but it would make sense for her tomake a name for herself and gain a reputation as an ardent opponent of the kindof narrow-minded skepticism embodied in a Dr. Beard, and then to lead herfollowers into the true light of occultism.Rudolf Steiner, who would become the most famous and influential EuropeanTheosophist of the early twentieth century, performed several intellectualbackflips, lecturing to Marxists and Nietzscheans in a way that slowly led themto his own brand of German Idealism. Yet like HPB, he too was branded a turncoatwhen some of his followers felt he had abandoned the “truth” for a differentpath. (Steiner complicated matters by having an almost pathological need to“identify” himself with an opposite point of view in order to understand it;this “identification” ran so deep that he was often seen, as Blavatsky was, as achampion of the very ideas he was opposing.)5[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText142]It is, of course, true that such tactics can be seen as sheer opportunism. Itisn’t too far from the truth to argue that Steiner himself became a Theosophistin order to gain an audience, and that he had every intention of leading hisTheosophical flock into the new fold of his own Anthroposophy—which, to theunbiased reader, bears a distinct resemblance to Blavatsky’s teaching. Many whobecame followers of HPB started out as spiritualists for the simple reason thatbefore Blavatsky and the Theosophical Society, there was precious little elsefor those unhappy with crude materialism and dissatisfied with mainstreamreligion. To play devil’s advocate, we can say that she had to get her foot inthe door somehow. If temporarily keeping a low profile among the spiritualistswas a way to do it, then it was a necessary fiction. Of course, someone like HPBcould not keep a low profile for long.• • •BLAVATSKY HAD ENOUGH media savvy to deliver her attack on Beard to the office ofthe Graphic personally. After Olcott’s account, she had become something of acelebrity, and the Graphic’s editor took advantage of her visit to interview herfor a feature. It’s not every day that an exotic Russian aristocrat who’straveled around the world walks into your office, especially one dressed like “abadly wrapped and glittering parcel.”6 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText143]Yet even allowing for the mistakes that Jean Overton Fuller argues the reportermade, the interview has more than a little bluster. HPB told the reporter thatshe was sixteen when she married Nikifor Blavatsky, who was seventy-three; shewas really just short of eighteen and her groom was in his forties. She alsolied about her age, shaving off three years; political correctness aside, at thetime this was considered a “lady’s prerogative,” so perhaps we can’t fully faulther for this. But we can see the beginning of “the Blavatsky story” here, andfor the next seventeen years the account of her life “in her own words” will bean often frustrating mix of exaggeration, tall tale, and spiritual seriousness,blended in just the right proportions to raise eyebrows, pique curiosities, andengage questing minds.By the time she delivered her counterblast to the hopelessly outgunned Dr.Beard—it was published on October 30, 1874—HPB had moved house more than once.She eventually settled for a time at 23 Irving Place, just a few doors from theLotus Club, where Olcott was living while awaiting his divorce (it would beofficial by the end of the year). Since their meeting in Chittenden they hadbecome practically inseparable. She had begun to tutor Olcott in the occultismit was her mission to bring to the West. She had already explained that thephenomena she could produce were the work of the elementals, and told him thatif he was willing to accept the necessary rigors, he could master these forcestoo. Olcott was eager to meet the challenge, which required, among other things,celibacy, abstinence from drink, and a vegetarian diet. This last proveddifficult, and HPB herself admitted that she couldn’t as yet give up meat. Hereating habits were, by today’s standards, anything but spiritual, and one of herfavorite dishes was fried eggs floating in butter, which must have made hercholesterol levels scandalous. In any case, as she would point out later, in thelong run “the purely bodily actions and functions are of far less importancethan what a man thinks and feels, what desires he encourages in his mind,” apoint Rudolf Steiner agreed with when he told a follower struggling to bevegetarian that “it is better to eat ham than to think ham.”7[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText144]Her Masters, though, were chaste in all these things, and she reminded theColonel that they were not “spirits” but flesh and blood men who had gainedmastery over themselves, and through this had acquired remarkable powers. Andalthough her own apprenticeship had taken place in Tibet, the Masters were notall Oriental, but came from all races. She spoke of a Greek, a Copt (nativeEgyptian Christian), a Venetian, and also an Englishman. There were others too,but all were bodhisattvas, individuals who had attained enlightenment but whoremained in the world, rather than enter Nirvana, in order to help their fellowmen.Some fellow men—and women—who needed help at the moment were a spiritualistcouple from Philadelphia. Nelson and Jennie Holmes had been publicly accused offraud when the elder spiritualist Robert Dale Owen—a former congressman and sonof the famous Robert Owen, founder of the utopian community New Harmony—admittedto being duped by them. The Holmeses had for a while manifested a spirit knownas “Katie King,” who purported to be the daughter of the famous spirit “JohnKing,” familiar to séance-goers on both sides of the Atlantic. John King hadeven manifested for Madame Blavatsky, and for a time she included him among herroster of Masters. Katie King was a celebrity too, having turned up in séancesheld by William Crookes. But a woman named Eliza White had confessed toimpersonating Katie, and had sold her story to a newspaper. The Holmeses deniedthe accusations, but one of the people taken in by the alleged masquerade wasRobert Dale Owen, and his admission to being fooled was a great blow to thespiritualist cause. The Holmeses read the Graphic articles on Chittenden, andappealed to Olcott to come to Philadelphia and test them.Olcott did, and after several séances held in January 1875, he concluded thatJennie Holmes was a genuine medium. HPB, however, had more inside knowledge ofthe affair. She admitted that Jennie Holmes was sometimes genuine, but notalways. Like many professional mediums, she had little control over her powers,and when an audience demanded results and she was “off her game”—as oftenhappened—she resorted to trickery, a messy expedient that cast much doubt overmore than one otherwise genuine medium. Yet more to the point, in a note byBlavatsky that Olcott found after her death, he discovered that it was HPBherself who “saved the situation,” by using her own powers—supported by those ofMaster Morya—in order to manifest “Katie King,” and thus prove that she was a“real” spirit. In other words, in order to prove that Katie was “real,”Blavatsky had to magically “fake” her. Blavatsky lamented that she “had toidentify myself during that shameful exposure of the mediums Holmes with theSpiritualists.” She was given the mission of proving the reality of thephenomena, and the best way to do that, she concluded, was to supplySpiritualism with ammunition against the skeptics. It was enough for people tosee that there was some reality beyond the material world; the exact truth aboutthis could be revealed later.8 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText145]Blavatsky’s esoteric rescue had little effect on the Holmeses’ reputation, buther involvement in the affair leads to some speculation about what we can callthe “occult history” of the modern world. Jean Overton Fuller writes that “therewas an epidemic of Spiritualism in America at this time,” and another writerremarks that séances, table-turning, and other mystical phenomena were sopopular that one could speak of an “invasion of the spirit people.”9[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText146] But if there was an “invasion,” why didit happen then? Why did the “spirits” pick just then—the second half of thenineteenth century—to invade? After all, people have been dying for ages, andjourneys to the underworld and oracles from “spirits” were a part of the Westerntradition from the beginning. Why did the dead suddenly start talking to theliving in 1848, and carry on for the rest of the century?John Symonds suggests that, although many people were interested in the otherworld—séances were often advertised in newspapers alongside traditional churchservices—there was no real, deep belief in spiritualist philosophy, and that itwas “taken up by the public in general only because it was the latest craze.”10[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText147] But this tells us nothing. Why was it thelatest craze? Some esoteric historians have suggested what may have been at workwhen the spirit people decided to invade.According to a strange theory developed by the British occultist C. G. Harrison,and later taken up by Rudolf Steiner, by the early nineteenth century, certainoccultists were concerned with the rise of materialism, the belief that the only“really real” things in the universe are matter and the forces acting on it.Traditional spiritual beliefs were losing ground, and so the occultists gatheredto discuss a plan of action. One group—the “right wing”—were for keeping theknowledge of the higher world secret, afraid that going public with it wouldonly lead to its being profaned. The “left wing” occultists were in favor ofputting everything on the table, and wanted to instruct society at large in thereality of the spirit. A compromise was found, in which “experiments” would becarried out with certain people of an unusual “psychicalconstitution”—mediums—to see if through them, the wider public could beconvinced of the reality of the spiritual worlds. This experiment wasSpiritualism, and in the end it was deemed a failure, for precisely the samereason that Blavatsky argued it was wrong: the belief that the phenomenaassociated with it were the work of the dead.What is remarkable here is the idea that the “epidemic of Spiritualism” wasn’t afluke, or a product of “social forces,” or of the “threat of modernity,” or ofan economic crisis, or of some other “reasonable” cause. Neither was it a resultof a war, when many people would understandably want to contact lost loved ones,as was the case in the years following World War I, which saw a sudden rise ininterest in Spiritualism.11 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText148] It was,according to this view, the work of conscious individuals, deciding to takeaction. These individuals were adepts, like HPB’s Masters: men and women whodeveloped the kind of powers Blavatsky ascribed to her teachers, and which we’veseen are associated with lamas and gurus in Tibet. This naturally leads to thequestion of who these adepts were, assuming they existed at all and that theidea of a direct “occult intervention” isn’t absurd. The scholar Joscelyn Godwinhas taken the idea seriously enough to research it exhaustively and bringtogether different threads into what he calls “the hidden hand” theory ofSpiritualism. The gist of this is that HPB appears on the scene, not fullyformed as Minerva did from Jupiter’s brow, but at the head of a rich esotericcurrent reaching back at least to the seventeenth century, and possibly furtherstill.12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText149]Two occult groups that predate the founding of the Theosophical Society seem,according to Godwin, to be the best candidates for those possibly pulling theoccult strings behind the “epidemic of Spiritualism.” Both are associated withpeople who would either be involved with the Theosophical Society in its earlydays, or who would have a profound influence on it and Blavatsky. One of thesegroups was known as the Orphic Circle, and in a remarkable book published in1876, Ghost Land, mentioned earlier, we can get some idea of what they wereabout. Some of the material making up Ghost Land was originally published in aspiritualist magazine, The Western Star, in 1872, whose editor, the spiritualistEmma Hardinge Britten, also edited the book version. Although they would laterhave a falling out, Emma Hardinge Britten was at one point friends with HPB and,as mentioned, an early member of the Theosophical Society. The actual author ofthe material is unknown, and both the original “autobiographical sketches” andthe expanded “novel” were published under the alias “Chevalier Louis de B.” Thepsychical researcher E. J. Dingwall believed that the true author was BaronJoseph Henry Louis de Palm, a down-and-out European aristocrat who lived withOlcott for a brief time, and who, when he died, left behind a trunk, which someclaimed contained significant esoteric writings.13[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText150] Some HPB critics—Emma Hardinge Brittenamong them—even claimed that her Isis Unveiled was plagiarized from the baron’swork. The trunk, however, contained little more than some worthless bonds, and afew shirts the impecunious baron had stolen from Olcott; the most significantthing he left behind was a request that his body be cremated. (Olcott fulfilledde Palm’s wishes, and his cremation was the first in America.) As Olcott laterdiscovered, the penniless baron was wanted by the police of several Europeancountries. While this does not necessarily preclude him from being a deepesoteric thinker, it does make the idea that he could have written the GhostLand material seem highly unlikely.14 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText151]Whoever the “Chevalier Louis de B” really was—and some believe he was EmmaHardinge Britten herself—his account of being inducted into the “German branchof a very ancient secret order” remains thrilling. The period covered is theearly 1800s, and to the “secret order” Louis gives the name “the BerlinBrotherhood.” Wishing to study the spiritual worlds scientifically, the orderused a number of methods to initiate a state of “magnetic sleep,” stimulatingthe “animal magnetism” discovered in the late eighteenth century by the SwabianFranz Anton Mesmer (who gave us the term “mesmerized”). This state could beinduced “sometimes by drugs, vapours, and aromal essences; sometimes by spells,as through music, intently staring into crystals, the eyes of snakes, runningwater, or other glittering substances; by intoxication caused by dancing,spinning around [German Sufis?], or distracting clamours.” But the mosteffective method of inducing a “magnetic trance” was through “magnetic passes,”slow movements of the hands just over the surface of the body, sending themedium into what was called “lucidity.” Louis’s account of entering this stateresembles later accounts of “out-of-body” experiences, yet this remarkable shiftin his consciousness brought other insights. A crystalline atmosphere surroundedhim, and he felt that he could see an “almost illimitable area of space.” A“vast realm of perception” opened up, and he felt that he could not only seethrough the walls of the room, but could also “pass through them with perfectease.” And not only that: “the very furniture itself, if it were only broughtinto the solvent of the radiant fire mist that surrounded me, would dissolve andbecome . . . so soluble that it could pass . . . through everything material.”This possibility, of matter becoming infinitely permeable, will return when weconsider the case of the mysterious Mahatma Letters. Louis’s account, however,also sheds light on how the kind of phenomena associated with Spiritualism couldhave been accomplished by the living. He writes of being brought into “lucidity”through the use of nitrous oxide—first synthesized in 1772 by the chemist JosephPriestley—and of his “atmospheric spirit” being taken, with two other “lucidsubjects,” to a castle in Bohemia. There they threw stones, moved objects,shrieked, groaned, and made much noise—exactly the sort of thing associated withpoltergeists and other “spirits.” And although when they awoke, Louis and hiscompanions didn’t remember their “trip,” they were shortly afterward shown anewspaper account of the “haunting” in the very castle they visited.Given the author of Ghost Land’s anonymity, it is best, as Godwin suggests, toconsider it fiction. Yet Emma Hardinge Britten left an account of her owninduction into a secret occult society that closely parallels “Louis B’s.” LikeLouis, she was inducted at a young age because of her somnambulistic abilities.The society’s members were ladies and gentlemen of noble rank, and came from allcorners of Europe. They were one of a number of such societies whose historyreached back to ancient Egypt. They studied Cabala, “philosophical occultism,”and also “Practical Magic.” This consisted of Mesmerism, crystal-gazing, the useof “magic mirrors,” and other forms of evocation—practices designed to bringspiritual entities into physical manifestation and to achieve what we would callaltered states of consciousness. Among the people involved was the novelistEdward Bulwer-Lytton, one of the earliest “scientific” psychical investigators,and author, among other works, of the Rosicrucian classic Zanoni.15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText152] Along with practically every occultist inthe late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Blavatsky was enormouslyinfluenced by Bulwer-Lytton; he is even thought by some to be the Master she metin London in 1851. Like Blavatsky, Bulwer-Lytton rejected the idea thatspiritualist phenomena were caused by the dead; he believed instead that theywere the product of unknown natural forces, which he often referred to as“elementals.” These forces, he believed, could be investigated, understood, andeventually even mastered, and this was precisely what Britten’s Orphic Circlewas about.16 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText153]While the Orphic Circle was exploring these unknown forces, another group wasoccupied with a similar pursuit. Exactly when the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor,mentioned earlier, began is hard to pin down. Their “official” public appearancewas in 1884, a decade after the Colonel met HPB. Yet like many occult societies,they also claimed a lineage going back millennia, and it seems reasonable toassume that an “inner” secret order existed long before the “outer” one brokecover. A more wieldy starting date is perhaps 1870, yet there is reason tobelieve that the group existed in some guise earlier than this; Emma HardingeBritten herself is thought to have belonged to some form of it in the 1850s. Inthe last chapter, I remarked that when HPB begins to speak about a mysteriousBrotherhood of Luxor, she may be referring to people like the radical Sufi Jamalad-Din al-Afghani and the Jewish-Egyptian playwright James Sanua—whom, K. PaulJohnson argues, she made contact with in Cairo in 1871. I think we also have toaccept that it is also possible that the characters Blavatsky had in mind werepeople like Paulos Metamon and his “son,” Max Théon, whom we met in Chapter 4.Théon is a shifty figure who, except for occasional appearances in the light,tends to remain in the background as a kind of mastermind, or “hidden master.”As an associate of Paulos Metamon, Théon would be one of the Brotherhood ofLuxor—along with Albert Rawson, al-Afghani, and the other esotericists HPBfraternized with in Cairo. When the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor—or H. B. ofL., as it was known for most of its existence (even its name was considered animportant secret)—started advertising for members, Théon was referred to as itsGrand Master and was considered in its writings an “exalted adept,” but he hadlittle to do with its actual operation; instead, with his medium wife, hefocused on developing what he called his “Cosmic Philosophy,” and he would laterbe the teacher of Mirra Alfassa, who, as “the Mother,” would become the leaderof Sri Aurobindo’s ashram in Pondicherry. Needless to say, the HermeticBrotherhood of Luxor and the Brotherhood of Luxor sound remarkably similar, andthe two groups, who may or may not have had any connection, are easily confused.It is possible that the H. B. of L. in some way grew out of the Brotherhood ofLuxor, but it is also possible that the two are related by name alone.One of the sources of the H. B. of L.’s teaching—which, when it went “public”was available through an “occult correspondence course,” possibly the first ofits kind—was the work of the eccentric mixed-race spiritualist and occultist,Paschal Beverly Randolph, who probably initiated one of the H. B. of L.’smembers, the Scotsman Peter Davidson, in 1874. Davidson himself tells of how hewas sought out by Max Théon in 1870, when the “exalted adept” was authorized byhis Brother Initiates to take on a neophyte, and train him in his work—much asHPB was sought out by Master Morya. An erratic if charismatic character,Randolph led a life that rivaled HPB’s for travel, adventure, and ambiguity. Hisunstable personality, exacerbated by alcohol and drugs—he used hashish foroccult practices, and may possibly be a source for HPB’s alleged use of it—ledto many crises, and in 1875 at the age of forty-nine he blew his brains outdirectly after informing a stunned neighbor of his intention. A prolific writerand energetic advocate of his ideas, Randolph is most known today for being anearly proponent of the “sex magic” associated with Aleister Crowley and his OrdoTempli Orientis. During his career, Randolph was arrested for promoting freelove—as was his contemporary Victoria Woodhull—and his liberality in this arealed him to abandon his first wife and their children, one of whom died fromneglect. (He later left his second wife, too.) It is possible, as ChristopherBamford suggests, that Randolph founded a form of the H. B. of L. in Boston asearly as 1868.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText154] It is also clear frommost accounts that he was, as Bamford says, “in equal parts authentic and afake.” Something, of course, that was also said of HPB.What places the H. B. of L. in this curious mix is a remark made by theTraditionalist philosopher René Guénon. “From the beginning of the nineteenthcentury,” Guénon writes, “there . . . existed in Germany . . . secretsocieties . . . which were concerned with magic and evocations, and also withmagnetism” and that “it was precisely the H. B. of L. . . . that was in contactwith some of these organizations.” This would place the Brotherhood in theesoteric stream much earlier than its “official” appearance. Guénon claims that“indications of this may be found in an anonymous work, entitled Ghost Land,published under the auspices of the H. B. of L.”18[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText155] Guénon, in fact, was the first to ask whythe Hydesville haunting sparked the spiritualist epidemic, when, after all,there were similar cases of “spirit manifestation” earlier than this. And hedraws attention to the secret occult societies in Germany—Louis B’s “BerlinBrotherhood”?—who were devoted to evocation, and who were operating as early asthe late 1770s—which would put them in the context of the beginning of Mesmerismand Swedenborgianism, both of which, in different ways, sought to contactspiritual entities.19 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText156]• • •AS FASCINATING AS THIS IS, any further digression will take us far from oursubject, or entangle us in details it would take the rest of the book tounravel. Suffice it to say that HPB enters this plot in 1871, during her secondstay in Cairo. In a way, though, she actually entered it at her birth. Accordingto C. G. Harrison, the “aspect of the heavens” when HPB was born, “frightened”the “right wing” occultists.20 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText157] Exactlywhy is unclear, but one assumes the stars portended the arrival of some powerfuloccult figure who would in some way work against their plans. The story is thatduring her second stay in Cairo, one of the “left wing” occultists toldBlavatsky about this. Blavatsky is said to have then rushed to Paris, where shedemanded admission to an occult brotherhood. The brotherhood refused, andBlavatsky left for America, where she made a similar demand upon another occultgroup, thought to be the H. B. of L. Here she was at first accepted, thenexpelled, and in retaliation, HPB threatened to “close up shop” on the Americangroup. It was at this point that certain occultists came together to put her in“occult imprisonment,” a state she remained in during the time she believed shewas in Tibet.21 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText158] She was subsequentlyfreed, Harrison claims, by certain Hindu adepts—her Masters—in whose debt shethen remained.We have to note that fairly soon after the “spiritualist experiment” wasconducted—at least according to Harrison’s account—the “right wing” occultistsrecognized it had failed and stopped their operation. Yet, according to RudolfSteiner, taking his cue from Harrison, the “left wing” occultists carried on,albeit now for their own purposes. Those purposes included discrediting the ideaof reincarnation.22 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText159] We’ve already seenthat Allan Kardec’s “Spiritism” did accept reincarnation, but that with Kardec’sdeath, his teaching lost influence in Europe and America, and that for the mostpart, “mainstream Spiritualism” did without the notion, as Steiner puts it, of“repeated earth-lives.” As with her relationship to Spiritualism, HPB will beaccused of flip-flopping on reincarnation as well, underplaying if not actuallydenying it in Isis Unveiled, and making it a central theme of The SecretDoctrine. By the time the H. B. of L. begins to act openly—around 1884 to1885—they will pursue a rigorously anti-reincarnation program, and will beequally opposed to the Theosophical Society, countering its by thenEastern-oriented teaching with their own peculiarly “materialistic” Westernoccultism. This, according to Annie Besant, later head of the TheosophicalSociety, “was distinctly allied to the questionable practices of the darkerTantric cults of India.”23 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText160]• • •IF THE READER feels a bit dizzy after all this, I can’t blame him, and to behonest I’m not sure that I grasp all the strands of this intriguing scenariomyself. Yet while these mysteries “behind the veil” clearly require deeppondering—and the interested reader is advised to consult Godwin’s originalwork—some of HPB’s more upfront activities are equally mystifying. Such as whyshe suddenly decided to marry the Georgian Michael C. Betanelly, whom she met inNew York in late December 1874. Betanelly lived in Philadelphia, and afterreading Olcott’s Graphic articles had written to him, asking if he could meethis countrywoman, to talk about Spiritualism. HPB agreed and Betanelly traveledto New York. He confessed his deep love and admiration for HPB and followed thisup in letters expressing unstinting adoration. Blavatsky snubbed him. WhenOlcott left Philadelphia, HPB stayed on for a while in the City of BrotherlyLove. Betanelly renewed his assault and must have been persistent. Mistakenlybelieving Nikifor to be dead—her sister Vera had said so, but he was, in fact,still alive—and impressing upon her suitor that sex or other intimacies were outof the question—she did not, she said, wish to live as a married woman—shechanged her mind. The fact that Betanelly threatened suicide if she refused musthave had something to do with it, although it is difficult to think of a womanwho had fought on the barricades and trekked across Tibet falling for suchneurotic tactics. Olcott rightly pointed out that Betanelly was in every way herinferior, and that his Russian import business was about as solvent as herchicken farm (she would, however, win her court case over this and recover herinvestment). She agreed, but answered that marrying him was a “misfortune” shecould not escape. Exactly why is not clear, and one can wonder if it hadanything to do with trying to get the “astral mineral” she alchemically andunsuccessfully sought in her first husband? Perhaps the relief of speaking inRussian was the attraction, but if Betanelly was as unsuitable as Olcott says,what could they have talked about? In any case, Betanelly proved incapable ofresisting his animal urges, and after fending off his advances, HPB finally lefthim (as we can see, HPB had no time for P. B. Randolph’s ideas about “sexmagic”). He later sued for divorce and eventually returned to Georgia.One incident during her bigamous union stands out. When she exacerbated analready injured knee, her doctor thought it was so far gone that amputation wasthe only remedy. Blavatsky disagreed and, taking her cue from Francis Bacon, fortwo nights slept with a puppy—some accounts have a white dog—straddled acrossher leg.24 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText161] Three days later she wasbetter, and soon after returned to New York.By this time, Olcott had gathered his research into Spiritualism and produced abook. In March 1875, People from the Other World appeared, a work put togetherfrom his Graphic articles. Needless to say, it featured HPB and, as mentioned,it was Olcott’s account of her powers at Chittenden that aroused D. D. Home’sire. Sadly, it aroused little else, and the book was not a success. Although heand HPB had done some damage control on Robert Dale Owen’s unfortunate episodewith Katie King, interest in Spiritualism was clearly on the decline. Althoughfrom the perspective of her mission this should have been a good thing, theimmediate result was increased skepticism about any nonmaterial reality. TheKatie King affair could not have been the sole cause, and the central reason whySpiritualism was losing its steam was that it seemed to lead nowhere.Tambourines floated, ectoplasm appeared, and voices were heard, but what theysaid was not particularly enlightening. The vast majority of the messages fromthe dead were numbingly trivial, and although proof of survival brought solaceto many, it led most intelligent minds to believe that life after death must beinsufferably dull. Like much “channeled” material today, the “teachings” of thespirits were usually little more than vacuous meditations along broadly mysticallines. Whether HPB’s next step was motivated by a good nose for the Next BigThing or by her mission is debatable, and perhaps the two were identical. Eitherway if she was to survive Spiritualism’s decline, she had to act fast. Olcott,impressed with HPB’s powers and talk of her Masters, had already pointed in thegeneral direction and provided the first hint of the “hidden hand” theorydiscussed above. In a footnote to his account of HPB, he raised the suspicionthat “this very American outbreak of spiritualistic phenomena is under thecontrol of an Order, which while depending for its results upon unseen agents,has its existence upon Earth among men.”• • •ONE RESULT OF Olcott’s book was a letter from the Russian spiritualist AlexanderN. Aksakov, who had had his own encounter with Katie King and found her realenough.25 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText162] Aksakov asked if Blavatskywould consider translating the book into Russian, and she seems to have taken onother translation work too, even tackling Darwin’s Origin of Species—an ironicchoice, given later developments. More pressing matters occupied her, though.She had received word from M that it was time to speak openly about occultismand to abandon her spiritualist disguise. Exactly how to do this was thequestion. The Banner of Light, which she had written for, would not beinterested in the new idea, as it would be critical of Spiritualism, and theyalready had enough problems in that area. Then she remembered The SpiritualScientist, a small journal published in Boston. Its editor, Elbridge GerryBrown, had read her attack on Dr. Beard and had invited her and Olcott to callon him if they were ever in Boston. Perhaps her campaign could start there?Olcott agreed, and wrote a circular letter to Brown, spelling out the newdirection he and HPB were taking. When he rearranged the paragraphs so it wouldread better, his chum pointed something out. The first letter of the first wordof each of the six paragraphs spelled a name: TUITIT. It was that of one of theMasters, Tuitit Bey, to be exact (who may or may not have been Max Théon).Olcott had asked HPB if he or she should sign the circular. Blavatsky said itseemed it was signed already, by Tuitit Bey himself. Olcott agreed and sent itoff, under the auspices of the “Brotherhood of Luxor.” Brown printed it, and acollaboration with him, Olcott, and HPB began.Not long after this Colonel Olcott received another letter, whose point oforigin seemed more exotic than Russia. He had already noticed some funnybusiness with his post. He had received letters in Philadelphia that had notbeen redirected from his New York office, where he had left instructions aboutforwarding his mail. Yet who could have known he was there? That is, the sendershad addressed them to his office, yet they had reached him directly, withoutbeing redirected. How could that have happened? Now another letter appeared. Itcame in a black, glazed envelope. The address was written in French in gold ink;strangely, it was addressed to his office on Beekman Street, but sent in care ofMadame Blavatsky, who rarely visited the office, if at all. It was from TuititBey, the Master whose name Olcott had unconsciously spelled when rearranging hiscircular. Could that have been sheer coincidence? In a note from HPBaccompanying this strange epistle, she explained that the letter had been“ordered at Luxor” and “written out in Ellora”—in India—and entrusted to her togive to him. She warned him about accepting the obligation it entailed, for itwas nothing less than an invitation from her Masters to join them. If he agreed,he was, she said, “cooked.”Looking at the strange message, written in gold ink on green paper, anddecorated with various Masonic and occult signs, Olcott saw that it was from theBrotherhood of Luxor—the Seventh Section, to be exact—and addressing him as“Brother Neophyte,” it read: “He who seeks us finds us. Try. Rest thymind—banish all foul doubt. We keep watch over our faithful soldiers. SisterHelen is a valiant, trustworthy servant. Open thy Spirit to conviction, havefaith and she will lead thee to the Golden Gate of truth.” After some criticalwords about “John King”—who would no longer be making appearances—the letterinformed Olcott that three Masters, no less, were keeping an eye on him: SerapisBey, of the Ellora Section; Polydorus Isurenus, of the Solomon Section; andRobert More, of the Zoroaster Section. Entreating Olcott to “Activity andSilence,” it was signed “Tuitit Bey, Observatory of Luxor.”Olcott, indeed, was cooked. One part of the message that both Tuitit Bey and hismessenger, HPB, especially impressed on him was to “Try.” As Joscelyn Godwin haspointed out, “TRY” was the magical motto of Paschal Beverly Randolph, a kind ofesoteric “Just do it,” familiar today for less noble purposes, and it wouldappear more than once in the mystical messages that followed. Randolph’s work,we know, was part of the H. B. of L.’s curriculum, and with the letter comingfrom the Brotherhood of Luxor, we can’t help but wonder if there is aconnection—even as little as HPB hearing of the H. B. of L., and throwing theirname into what was fast becoming a very rich mix. Soon Olcott received otherletters, mostly from another Master, Serapis Bey, entreating him to have courageand to be hopeful and, more than once, to be patient with his chum, and to doeverything he could to help her. For letters coming from a mystic Master, theyhad a curiously practical tone. One was about the need to complete the divorcefrom Betanelly. HPB’s mad marriage was a calamity, and threatened legalproblems, as word was Betanelly was planning to skip the country, leaving hiswife responsible for his many debts. The tie had to be severed immediately. ( Itwas and Betanelly returned to Georgia.) Other letters suggested that Olcottborrow money from his ex-in-laws, in order to finance their mission; one evensuggested a partnership between them and Betanelly. The Masters quickly changedtheir minds about this idea, though.Another concern of Serapis Bey was the collaboration with E. Gerry Brown.Although Brown would publish what Blavatsky later called her “first Occultshot,” in which she first publicly declared the existence of the Masters, heturned out to be not quite the staunch supporter that Serapis Bey believed himto be, and was apparently interested in promoting HPB’s mission as long as shecould pay to have her articles about it printed in his magazine. Hiscollaboration with the chums was short-lived and Brown soon exited the story,but in “A Few Questions to Hiraf,” published by Brown in July 1875, Blavatskymakes a kind of dry run for what would soon become her first major occultstatement, Isis Unveiled.“Hiraf” was an acrostic made up of the first letters of the names of fiveamateur scholars who had collaborated on an article published in the SpiritualScientist entitled “Rosicrucianism.”26 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText163]HPB read the article and was impressed enough by it to pen a lengthy reply.Although their use of “Rosicrucianism” to cover all aspects of occultism wasincorrect, she felt the article was intelligent and insightful enough to warrantclarification. In her response she argues that “Occultism . . . stands inrelation to Spiritualism as the Infinite to the Finite,” and she affirms theexistence of “colleges” of the “Secret Science” in the East. She would reveal,she said, “a little of the little I picked up in my long travels throughout thelength and breadth of the East—that cradle of Occultism” in order to help“sincere enquirers” who might want to drink at “the source of knowledge.” Thosewho do wish to learn the “Great Truth” can do so, provided they “try” to meetthe right person—again, using Randolph’s magical motto. The location of theBrotherhoods, however, will never be revealed, “until . . . Humanity shall awakein a mass from its spiritual lethargy, and open its blind eye to the dazzlinglight of truth.”One point she emphasized, and which would become a central theme of her laterwork, is the difference between what she called the Oriental and the JewishCabala (Cabala or Kabbalah means “tradition”). The Oriental Cabala, which is“the most secret of all,” is “carefully preserved at the headquarters of aBrotherhood in the East,” possibly a Sufi sect to which al-Afghani belonged.This mysterious lodge safeguards the “secret powers of the ancient Chaldeans,”and, as mentioned, Blavatsky will later make repeated reference to a mysterious“Chaldean Book of Numbers.” This Cabala, the original and first, was lateraltered by Moses, an “ambitious prophet-medium,” who passed off his “familiarspirit, the wrathful ‘Jehovah’” for the spirit of God himself. The keydifference between the Oriental Cabala and the altered Mosaic one is theintroduction of a principle of evil. This is absent from the original Cabala,and its introduction by Moses and his descendants has, according to Blavatsky,caused more than a few problems.27 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText164]As Joscelyn Godwin and K. Paul Johnson have pointed out, a common aim shared byHPB’s early occult confederates is a criticism of the Judeo-Christian tradition,not only in occult matters, but in social, personal, and political ones as well.We recall Agardi Metrovitch’s passionate anti-Jesuit beliefs, Albert Rawson’sresearches into the Druzes, Sufis, and other forms of Islamic religion, andHPB’s own time in Mentana, fighting with Mazzini’s Italians against the papaltroops, and we remember the extraordinary hold Judeo-Christian ideas had on themoral and philosophical consciousness of Victorian times. Although she is mostlythought of in occult or spiritual terms, we need to recognize that Blavatsky wasalso linked to many modern progressive movements, and that she was an earlycombatant in the struggle against what many felt was an oppressive religious,moral, and social tradition. Whether she was involved in “nothing more nor lessthan the abolition of Christianity in favour of a freethinking humanism,” asGodwin argues, is debatable.28 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText165] Her animustoward the Judeo-Christian ethos, however, is clear, and would soon bring hermore than one enemy. Two quotations should give us an idea of her attitudetoward it. In an essay entitled “The Esoteric Character of the Gospels,” HPBwrote that “the Bible is not the ‘word of God’ but contains at best the words offallible and imperfect teachers.” And for her, Christianity is “the religion ofarrogance par excellence, a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth,sham, and power, and a convenient screen for hypocrisy.”29[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText166]• • •ALONG WITH SEEING what would come of working with Brown, the Masters alsoprodded Blavatsky to try once more to form a society, “a secret Society like theRosicrucian Lodge,” the kind, indeed, to which her great-grandfather PrinceDolgorukov belonged. She had already struck out twice in Cairo, but she andOlcott decided to try again. The result was, as mentioned, something they calledthe Miracle Club, and its activities were kept to some degree secret. Sadly,nothing too miraculous happened in it, even behind a veil of secrecy. It was forthe most part occupied with the familiar spiritualist routine, and those whocame to it didn’t see anything that they couldn’t see elsewhere. But it didprovide the setting for what would become an unqualified success.One of the miracles shared by members of the club was a lecture given onSeptember 7, 1875, by the engineer, architect, and inventor George H. Felt on“The Lost Canon of Proportion of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.” The talk,which was held at Blavatsky’s rooms at 46 Irving Place—she had moved onceagain—went over well, and during it a thought came to Olcott (although he lateragain questioned if it was his thought at all). Wouldn’t it be a good idea tostart a society that studied this sort of thing, he wondered? Olcott jotted thisidea down on a slip of paper and handed it to a new comrade, William Quan Judge,a twenty-four-year-old Irish immigrant with an interest in Spiritualism who hadonly recently passed the New York bar examination. Judge agreed and passed thenote on to HPB, who nodded approvingly. The lecture continued and Felt, who itis believed was a member of the H. B. of L., went on to claim that the men whodesigned the pyramids were adepts. Their great structures, which have survivedmillennia, were not made of only bricks and mortar—or the ancient Egyptianequivalent—but were the product of an occult wisdom, carefully guarded by thehigh priests. This wisdom consisted of an exact mystical science, which could behoused in specific geometric designs. Indeed, these geometric drawings, whichinvolved the use of the Egyptian zodiac, could, Felt maintained, be used tomanifest spiritual “presences,” which Felt associated with elementals. Sadly,although Felt promised that he would give a display of these mysterious beings,he never did—because he was unwilling or unable is unclear, but he neverthelesscollected a hundred dollars for his efforts, and subsequently faded from view.30[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText167]But Felt had manifested something perhaps even more remarkable. During theconversation about the Egyptians and their wisdom following the lecture, Olcottstood up and informed the audience—there were sixteen or seventeen people inall—of the idea that had passed between himself, Judge, and HPB. Everyonethought it was splendid, and an immediate vote was taken, constituting thosepresent into a society dedicated to studying precisely the sort of thing theywere just discussing. Judge moved that Olcott be made chairman; Olcottreciprocated by nominating Judge for secretary. Blavatsky herself at this pointheld no office in the new society, which was yet to be named. Official electionswere held the next evening, and Blavatsky eventually was made correspondingsecretary. But it wasn’t until a week later that the society was properlychristened. Various names were considered: Hermetic, Rosicrucian, Egyptological,but none seemed right, or to convey the sense those present had that this wouldbe something different. We can be sure that HPB wanted to hit the esoteric nailon the head, having already struck out three times, and with the Master lookingover her shoulder. Frustrated, one of those present, Charles Sotheran, ajournalist, bibliographer, and antiquarian with an interest in fringe Masonryand radical politics—and who may have known Blavatsky from earlier days—grabbedthe dictionary from the shelf and started flipping the pages (today, of course,he’d have gone to Google). Was it chance, fate, or the Master? We’ll never know,but Sotheran’s eye landed on what seemed a good candidate. “What about‘theosophy’?” he asked. That was it. Everyone agreed. On September 13, 1875, theTheosophical Society was born. Not long after that, at a meeting on November 17,held at the Mott Memorial Hall on Madison Avenue, it was made official, and asthe saying goes, the world would never be the same."},{"pageContent":"SIXUNVEILING ISISAlthough unusual, the term “theosophy” was not without precedent. Formed of twoGreek terms, theos (“god”) and sophia (“wisdom”)—as our word “philosophy,” thelove of wisdom is—it could be roughly translated as “god-wisdom,” or “divinewisdom,” or “the wisdom of the gods.” This could mean wisdom about God or thegods, or the wisdom possessed by God or the gods, the one leaning towardtheology, the other toward mysticism. In effect, “theosophy” as used by HPBwould include both meanings, and a whole lot more—so much, that exactly whattheosophy meant would lead to more than one unsatisfactory attempt byTheosophists to define it. William Quan Judge may have highlighted andcircumvented the problem by saying that “the strength of theosophy lies in thefact that it is not to be defined.” But many people wanting some idea of whatthe Theosophical Society is about may not be convinced by Judge’s belief that inits “evolution,” “new truths” and “new aspects of old truths” will expel theneed for “dogmas or ‘unequivocal definitions,’” which, frankly, sounds likeevasion.1 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText168] One wants to ask exactly whatis evolving, and without agreeing on that, this sounds too much like “anythinggoes.”Blavatsky herself said that the term came from the Alexandrian philosophers ofthe second and third century A.D., and she referred to a group known as thePhilaletheians, or “lovers of truth,” from philo (“love”) and aletheia(“truth”). Neo-Platonic thinkers from the same period, such as Iamblichus andPorphyry, whose understanding of philosophy leaned much more toward mysticismand the occult than any philosopher today would allow, used it, and in morerecent times it was associated with the work of the seventeenth century Silesiancobbler-mystic Jacob Boehme. In 1600, Boehme had a powerful mystical experience.While gazing at the sunlight reflected on a pewter dish, he believed he wasshown “the signature of all things,” the true relation between man and God, thenature of good and evil, and the spiritual structure of the world. In a seriesof weighty and obscure books, couched in an often difficult alchemical language,Boehme tried to convey his insights. One of these books, his last, was called177 Theosophic Questions.Blavatsky’s use of “theosophy,” though, would be something more and somethingless than that of earlier exponents, and the term’s vagueness—at least as seenby some—led not a few critics to wonder if it meant anything at all. PeterWashington points out that the understanding of “truth” and “science” that HPBand her Theosophists respected in ancient sages such as Pythagoras and Plotinuswas hardly reconcilable with contemporary notions of these pursuits.2[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText169] Part of the new society’s aim was toapply “scientific” study to the kind of phenomena familiar to spiritualists,which meant maintaining standards of objectivity, detachment, precision, andneutrality—not qualities usually associated with the “wisdom of the gods.” Butif you begin by accepting that such phenomena are real—as HPB, Olcott, and theother early members did—then, Washington asks, aren’t you already prejudicingyour investigations? This muddle, however, is only apparent, as you would havenothing to investigate if you didn’t believe it existed, and the other side ofthe coin is the “hard-nosed” scientist’s belief that such phenomena areimpossible. If you don’t believe they exist, HPB could ask, how can you studythem? A greater index of an inherent vagueness in Theosophy—which is notnecessarily a weakness—is its inclusiveness. Sometime after the society’sfounding, it produced a “mission statement,” which guides its many branchestoday: 1. To form the nucleus of a universal brotherhood of humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or color. 2. The study of ancient and modern religions, philosophies, and sciences, and the demonstration of the importance of such study. 3. The investigation of the unexplained laws of nature and the psychical powers latent in man.Of the three, the last two could, I think, find a place under the more narrowunderstanding of “theosophy.” Yet, in actual practice, at least during HPB’slifetime, it was the first aim to which she devoted the most time and energy.Blavatsky repeatedly reprimanded her followers for wanting to pursue theothers—mostly number 3—without securing what, for her, was the most importantgoal. This seems more attuned to the kind of “freethinking humanism” thatJoscelyn Godwin believed she pursued, than any kind of mystical doctrine,although the notion of a “universal brotherhood of humanity” certainly has aMasonic ring.While it is untrue to say that Theosophy was all things to all men, it didprovide a very wide umbrella, under which quite a few things could find a place.This inclusiveness extended to Theosophists themselves. In a late article, “Howto Become a Theosophist,” published in her journal Lucifer (whose titleexpressed her anti-Christian sentiments and reflected her own, by that time,“fallen” status within society), HPB explained thatany person of average intellectual capacities, and a leaning toward themetaphysical; of pure unselfish life, who finds more joy in helping hisneighbour than in receiving help himself; one who is ever ready to sacrifice hisown pleasures for the sake of other people; and who loves Truth, Goodness, andWisdom for their own sake, not for the benefit they may confer—is aTheosophist.3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText170]This, as she often pointed out, meant that there were many Theosophists whoweren’t members of the society, just as there were many members of the societywho were not necessarily Theosophists, a distinction she would repeatedlyemphasize in her struggles ahead. If we bracket the word “theosophist,” thisdefinition seems to broadly denote what in the West used to be called thephilosophical life. In the East, especially in Tibet, it could point to thebeginning of a bodhisattva.In the early days, though, Theosophy meant pretty much HPB herself, and herposition as corresponding secretary was a tacit agreement that she would be thenew society’s theoretician and ideas-person. If the newly christenedTheosophists looked to anyone to give them some sense of direction, it was she.• • •THE GROUP ITSELF, however, was not made up of mere followers. As a report of thefirst meeting published in a New York newspaper pointed out, those gathered inBlavatsky’s rooms on that fateful evening included “several persons of greatlearning and . . . wide personal influence.” Besides HPB, Olcott, and CharlesSotheran, who suggested the society’s name, there was William Quan Judge,considered one of the Theosophical founding fathers. Judge had been in contactwith occultists and spiritualists in Dublin, Ireland—from where he hailed—andwas a correspondent of George Russell, the mystical poet and intimate of W. B.Yeats, who wrote under the pseudonym “A. E.” Judge’s father had been a Mason,and Judge himself was led to meeting HPB through reading Olcott’s People fromthe Other World. We’ve seen Emma Hardinge Britten’s association with mysteriousoccult secret societies; she was accompanied by her husband. The Italian SignorBruzzesi, known as Il Conte, was a sculptor and ex-secretary of Mazzini; he wasalso, by most accounts, like Agardi Metrovitch, a Carbonaro, who knew HPB fromher European travels. C. C. Massey was an English barrister and Freemason. Alsopresent was the Cabalist Dr. Seth Pancost, who had failed to cure HPB’s leg inPhiladelphia and precipitously advised amputation; William Livingston Alden,editorial writer for the New York Times; John Storer Cobb, the editor of ajournal called The New Era; and a “learned Portuguese Jew,” D. E. da Lara. Therewere also the editors of two religious newspapers; the co-editors of twoliterary magazines; an Oxford professor; the president of the New York Societyof Spiritualists; and a New York judge and his wife. Although not all wouldstay—many indeed soon left or were asked to leave—the initial gathering showedthat HPB’s mission was not attracting “flakes” and “lone nutters,” as we mightsay today, but accomplished men and women, drawn together by a common interest.And as we’ve seen, in its heyday the Theosophical Society would indeed attractand influence some of the most creative and influential people of the time.Although Blavatsky would repeatedly argue that Theosophy was not areligion—there were too many of them already, she thought—the next step in hermission seemed obvious: Her new movement needed its Bible. She had alreadystarted to put her mind to this task, and the result would be a remarkable work,Isis Unveiled, her mammoth compendium of Hermetic, occult, and esoteric ideas.Yet perhaps even as remarkable as the work itself was its manner of production.For some months before the founding of the new society, the Colonel had noticedan odd change in his chum. He felt he was not free to speak of it openly, yet inletters to her family, Blavatsky herself gave an account of a strangetransformation that seemed to be taking place within her. It was anothermanifestation of the “double life” she had experienced earlier. Writing to Vera,HPB spoke of feeling a “very strange duality,” as if there was anotherconsciousness present in her body, which she called “No. 2.” She retained herown sense of self, but along with this there was someone else. She spoke of “thelodger who is in me,” and of the strange experience of sharing his knowledge andmemories, which were quite different from her own. This “lodger” was herfamiliar Hindu, but now it seemed that he had begun to infuse his ownconsciousness into hers, a practice that in Tibetan Buddhism is associated withthe phenomenon known as a tulku. This is when a yogi or holy man transfers hisown consciousness into the mind of another, an experience described by LamaAnagarika Govinda in Chapter 3. Blavatsky spoke of having memories of places shehad never visited and knowledge of things that to her “real” self were unknown.Yet, the new consciousness inspiring her was not completely “other,” and HPBalso told Vera that what she felt was at work was a “higher and luminous Self,”thinking and writing for her.4 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText171] Thissuggests the possibility that the Master HPB had encountered since childhood mayhave been at least in part a personification of some larger aspect of herself.5[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText172]Blavatsky’s “strange duality” was perceived by others as well. A reporter forthe Hartford Daily Times, interviewing her a few years later, spoke of her“rare, strange countenance,” in which a “combination of moods” seemed to beconstantly at play. A “keen, alert, subtle undercurrent of feeling andperception perceivable in . . . her eyes” impressed the journalist with “theidea of a double personality . . . as if she were here and not here; talking,and yet thinking, or acting far away.”6 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText173]Many years after Blavatsky’s death, the writer Beatrice Hastings—a remarkablecharacter, who, sadly, is for the most part unknown today—argued that parts ofIsis Unveiled clearly showed that more than one mind was at work in itsproduction. Comparing Blavatsky’s style in her letters and more polemicalwritings to certain passages in Isis Unveiled, Hastings observed that while her“private letters frequently halt in expression,” and her polemical writings arealways expounded with “a thump on the desk,” HPB “had nothing of the temperamentnecessary for the serene expositional expression of which we find so much inIsis Unveiled.”7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText174] Hastings would alsoargue that this marked difference in style was—at least as far as she wasconcerned—proof that HPB could not have written the notorious Mahatma Letters,whose sonorous sentences seem of a piece with the more stately passages in Isis.Adam Crabtree, an authority on multiple personality, remarks that “human beingspossess a mysterious inner malleability or plasticity,” and that at “someobscure depth of the psyche, a moulding of discrete mental units can takeplace.”8 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText175] These “discrete units,” Crabtreeargues, manifest as separate personalities, and one of the most baffling aspectsof this remarkable phenomenon, is that the original personality—“No. 1,” so tospeak—is often completely unaware of his strange partners. In his absorbinghistory of the discovery and treatment of this often bizarre phenomenon,Multiple Man, Crabtree relates how the famed French psychologist Pierre Janetdeveloped a method of communicating with the “other” personalities directly.Janet observed that if the “No. 1” personality was occupied with some activity,he could ask the “other” questions, speaking in a calm, quiet voice, to which itwould reply. When the “No. 1” personality was asked what Janet had just spokento him about, he would not know, and seemed puzzled by the question. It seemedthat by catching the “No. 1” personality off guard, when he was distracted bysome absorbing activity, “No. 2” could quietly make an appearance. Lateracquaintances remarked on HPB’s apparent obsession with playing solitaire; intheir accounts, it is as ubiquitous as her cigarettes. Archibald Keightley, whoknew HPB during her last years in London, remarked that “while solitaireoccupied the brain, HPB was engaged in very different work.” She could “takepart in a conversation going on around her . . . attend to what we used to call‘upstairs,’ and also see what was going on in her own room and other places inthe house and out of it, at one and the same time.”9[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText176] Yet this “splitting” of her consciousnesswas with her from early on. When HPB returned to her family in 1858 after herfirst years of wandering, and entertained them with her raps and strangeknockings, she often produced these mysterious sounds while sitting engaged inembroidery. It was as if in order to manifest them, she had to keep her “No. 1”consciousness occupied, much as Janet’s patients had to be distracted in orderfor him to talk to their other selves. The idea seems to be that by engaging insome purposeful but unimportant work—embroidery or playing cards, perhaps evenrolling and smoking cigarettes—our everyday consciousness “frees up” some innerspace that the “other” self uses in order to appear. This possibility suggeststhat some activities related to spiritual practice, such as chanting a mantra,repeating a prayer, the rituals involved in ceremonial magic, and even the teaceremonies associated with Zen Buddhism, are methods of distracting the everydayself, in order for the “other” to manifest.10[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText177]Blavatsky’s “other,” to be sure, manifested in ways much more monumental thananything Janet’s or Adam Crabtree’s patients produced. In looking at theenormous effort that went into Isis Unveiled, we are tempted to fall back onearlier notions of “inspiration,” although the “divine afflatus” associated withthis idea can itself be seen as a form of “multiple personality” or even“possession,” whether by a “higher Self” or some more external entity.11[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText178] Although written under “orders,” when HPBbegan the work, she wasn’t exactly sure where it was heading, which was ratherthe case with the fledgling Theosophical Society itself. Olcott says that atsome point in the summer of 1875—exactly where they were living at the time isunclear—HPB handed him some pages of a manuscript. “I wrote this last night,”she told him, “‘by order,’ but what the deuce it is to be I don’t know.” Shethought it could be for an article, or maybe a book, or possibly for nothing atall. With this less than encouraging remark, she pushed the pages into a drawerand forgot about them for some time. What triggered her return to the work isunclear, although the publication of a book by Emma Hardinge Britten, Art Magic,might have had something to do with it.Britten claimed that the book was not written by her, but was dictated by anadept, none other than the mysterious Chevalier Louis B, supposed author ofGhost Land. Although it spoke of adepts, white and black magic, and theimportance of the Astral Light—all themes that Blavatsky herself wouldtackle—neither Olcott nor HPB was impressed with it. In fact, in many ways theyfound it scandalous, not the least because of its assertion that developingcommunication with the dead, and accepting them as spirit guides and “controls,”would aid its readers on their way to becoming adepts, a belief that Blavatskywas determined to undermine. Britten was a successful medium and an accomplishedspeaker, and although she limited the print run of the book to five hundredcopies, word of it soon spread throughout the milieu that Blavatsky herselfwanted to conquer. HPB’s star was rising, but Britten was at that point the moreestablished figure. Soon, however, it would be clear that no séance would be bigenough for both of them.That Blavatsky had some major work in mind for some time is suggested by aletter she wrote in early 1875 to Hiram Corson, a professor of Englishliterature at Cornell University in upstate New York. Corson had written to HPBafter reading her defense of the Eddy brothers in the Graphic; he had turned toSpiritualism after the death of his teenaged daughter, and hoped he couldestablish contact with her through Blavatsky. In one exchange, HPB remarked thatshe believed “we . . . are at the threshold of an epoch when a thousandmysteries shall be revealed,” and lamented that it was up to “such feeble mortalagencies” as Corson’s pen and her own, to determine “how soon the world shall beenlightened.” I have not actually counted how many mysteries are revealed inIsis Unveiled, but I would say a thousand is a rough estimate.Corson’s and Blavatsky’s correspondence led to an invitation by the professorfor HPB to come and stay with him and his wife at their home in Ithaca. Here thework on what would become Isis Unveiled began in earnest, although the professorhad little idea what he was letting himself in for. Blavatsky’s letters may haveprepared Corson for a “woman of frantic intensity,” but having her in his home,and not merely as a correspondent, was another story. HPB’s appearance, in avoluminous robe that, according to one account, made her look as if the curtainshad fallen on her, was bad enough, but predictably, her tobacco intake was thereal shock.12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText179] HPB had warned him that shewould be stealing away every fifteen minutes to have a smoke in his basement;she had come to recognize that even among enlightened folk, in America womensmoking in public was still taboo. But her nicotine habit wasn’t limited tobasements. Corson soon discovered that his flowerpots were full of her stubs,and at one point, while on a carriage tour of the area, she demanded he stop soshe could light up somewhere out of view. He estimated she smoked two hundredcigarettes a day, which seems to confirm Hannah Wolff’s remark that she couldeasily get through a pound of tobacco. Corson was also put out by HPB’s refusalto try to contact his daughter, and by her adamant dismissal of any suchpractice, opposed as it was to the teachings of her Masters. She was, he said,“a smart woman, but ignorant of all the graces and amenities of life,” andsummed up his assessment of her personality by calling her a “great Russianbear.”Yet the crudity of her personal habits was more than made up for by herremarkable ability to work. Holed up in her room, HPB produced some twenty-five“closely written foolscap pages a day.” Yet if the sheer volume of words wasimpressive, even more so was Blavatsky’s apparent ability to quote long passagesfrom works neither she nor the professor possessed, and which Corson suspectedwere not even available in America at the time. Blavatsky explained that she sawthe passages “on another plane of objective existence” and simply wrote themdown—if need be, translating them from whatever language they were in intoEnglish. She employed, it seems, a form of “clairvoyant reading”; either that orshe possessed a phenomenal memory, which, as Corson remarked, would be evidenceof an even more startling feat than that of getting her references “from theether.”13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText180]Corson was not the only one privy to Blavatsky’s curious writing habits. By thistime, Colonel Olcott and his chum had shared more than one lodging, and in whatwould become their best-known home, he observed HPB’s remarkable “clairvoyantreading” at first hand. Toward the end of 1875, they shared rooms at 433 West34th Street, where the impecunious Baron de Palm died, his request to becremated sparking something of an uproar. A cremation society existed in NewYork, but it had yet to burn any bodies, and in any case, it didn’t want to beassociated with what it saw as a dubious occult organization. In fact, thebaron’s funeral and his actual cremation were separated by six months, duringwhich time his body was packed in clay, giving rise to the story that Olcott hadbuilt his own clay oven in which to burn it. At the ceremony, which Olcott haddevised and which was held at the Masonic Temple in New York on May 29, 1876,the Colonel described God in Theosophical terms as the “uncaused cause.”14[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText181] A Methodist preacher took offense at thisand shouted, “That’s a lie,” and started a disturbance. The crowd that gatheredlaughed at the whole proceeding and the affair garnered some bad press,something that was repeated that December after the baron’s body was finallyconsigned to the flames in the private crematorium of Dr. Francis Le Moyne,which he had built for his own use in Washington, Pennsylvania. News of the“heathen” goings-on was reported around the country and in Europe, and thesociety was criticized for supporting what was to many a “pagan” custom. YetOlcott had by now absorbed his chum’s sanguine attitude toward publicity.Although lambasted, the debacle did make the Theosophical Society more widelyknown, and helped to establish cremation as an accepted practice.In early 1876, the chums found a new roost in Hell’s Kitchen, perhaps the mostunlikely location for the home of a spiritual movement. At 302 West 47th Street,off Eighth Avenue, HPB and the Colonel came to rest in what would be their lastAmerican abode. The apartment’s unusual décor led one reporter to dub it “theLamasery,” an apt quip, given the chums’ taste for the exotic. Olcott decked theplace out with assorted outré bric-a-brac gathered from what used to be called“curiosity shops.” Japanese cabinets, a Swiss cuckoo clock, and a stuffedlioness’s head greeted visitors as they entered an apartment wreathed in incenseand tobacco smoke. An upright piano supported images of the Buddha and otherspiritual teachers, and a stuffed gray owl leered eerily from a bookcase. Long,narrow mirrors stood in the corners of the rooms, stuffed monkeys hung from thewalls, as did several toy lizards, and potted palm fronds reached to theceiling. A stuffed bat hung over a doorway, a stuffed crocodile hung overanother, and the dining room wall featured a jungle tapestry, complete with asnake, a tiger, and an elephant, surrounded by thick foliage. Another snakecurled around the mantelpiece mirror. The most famous objet d’art, however, wasthe celebrated stuffed baboon. This Olcott dressed in a collar, white cravat,and a pair of glasses, and under one of its arms he shoved the manuscript of alecture on Darwin’s Origin of Species. They christened the caricature ProfessorFiske, after an academic who propounded an extraordinarily narrow materialisticview of the universe. Not all the animals in the chums’ menagerie were stuffed,though. Blavatsky liked pets—during one of her stays in the Near East sheacquired a collection of monkeys which she was later forced to abandon—and inthe Lamasery she kept a pair of canaries, which she often let fly about therooms. They even made a nest in the chandelier, using scraps from HPB’s growingmanuscript.For the next few years, the Lamasery was New York’s most famous salon, whereChristians, Jews, and “heathens” met with artists, intellectuals, and bohemians,as well as doctors, lawyers, and aristocrats, to discuss “every imaginablesubject on earth, in the heavens above the earth, and in the profoundest depthsbelow,” with a “curious mix of wit and philosophy.”15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText182] Here HPB also put on occasional displaysof her powers, although she was increasingly loath to devote her energies tosuch trivia, and it was because of her reluctance in this matter that many ofthe early members of the society left. The demonstrations she did provide seemto leave little doubt that HPB was indeed a mage. Years later, William QuanJudge wrote that in his presence Blavatsky caused objects to move unaided,including a silver spoon that penetrated two walls to reach her hand. Shematerialized bottles of paint, drew a letter from an unopened envelope and thenduplicated it, and created the hallucination of one of her rings, and gave it toa woman who coveted it.16 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText183] From the sameperiod, Olcott described demonstrations of telepathy, materialization (whenOlcott balked at lending her his pencil—she invariably kept them—she“materialized” a dozen of them to spite him), the command of elementals,“mesmeric hallucinations,” “precipitations”—when an image or writing appeared onblank paper—clairvoyance, and her reading of what she called “the Astral Light”or “Akashic Record,” “akasha” being the Sanskrit term for “ether.” Many of thesedisplays were accompanied by the tinkling of “astral bells,” delicate pings fromthe spirit world that preceded some phenomenon.The last power that Olcott describes was most in evidence while HPB labored atwhat would become her first major work. During the day, Olcott would head to hisoffice, where he maintained the legal practice that provided upkeep for himselfand his chum, as well as his ex-wife and sons; when we consider the weird worldhe was moving in, that he managed to support both Blavatsky and himself as wellas his estranged family seems a testament to his industry and sense ofobligation. HPB worked on her own during the day, but in the evening, afterdinner—which a maid usually prepared, although Olcott occasionally cooked; HPBherself was useless in a kitchen—they sat across from each other at a long desk,the central furnishing of the Lamasery, and worked together into the night.Blavatsky would show him what she had written earlier, and he would comment onit and more than occasionally correct it. Although she had developed a vigorous,idiomatic style, HPB was usually helpless with punctuation, and her syntax wouldhave given Proust a run for his money. She was also less than tidy, and her manypages were often covered with new paragraphs pasted over earlier, rejectedpassages. Olcott would go over the mess, correcting mistakes, suggestingchanges, and occasionally rewriting whole sections. These he would read back toher, and she would either accept them or not. Not infrequently she would throwout what both she and Olcott had written, and start from scratch.As if materializing pencils were not enough, Olcott was also baffled by thenumber of quotations Blavatsky stuffed into the work. As they had only a fewbooks in the place, he couldn’t understand where they came from. To be sure, shemade great use of the books they had, and references to the work of the Frenchoccultist Eliphas Lévi; the French writer on India, Louis Jacolliot; theinevitable Bulwer-Lytton; Hargrave Jennings’s book on the Rosicrucians; MaxMüller’s works; those of Samuel Fales Dunlap; Joseph Ennemoser; C. W. King onthe Gnostics; and other writers little read or practically unknown today, whichcame from their meager bookshelves, made their way into Blavatsky’s growingmagnum opus. But as Professor Corson had observed, many quotations came fromsources not readily at hand, not even at the public library, which, in any case,Olcott was certain she did not visit. She rarely, if ever, left their rooms, noteven for an evening’s constitutional. By some accounts she was housebound forsix months straight, and worked seventeen hours a day.Her manner of writing was anything but methodical and seemed to preclude theconscientious fact-checking of more fastidious authors. She seemed to work to nofixed plan, with ideas rushing through her mind in a ceaseless torrent, herpencil racing across the page in a desperate effort to keep pace. When she didstop, it was not to leave her seat and flip through some tome. Olcott recountsthat her pencil would suddenly halt in midsentence, and she would look up intothe space in front of her. She would then narrow her eyes, “as though to look atsomething held invisibly in the air before her,” and then resume writing,apparently copying onto the paper what she had just read. When she showed theColonel the recent addition, it invariably contained a quotation from some workof which neither of them had a copy. If Blavatsky was quoting from memory, thenshe seems to have been capable of producing “eidetic imagery,” one definition ofwhich is “a subjective image of minute photographic detail, which is perceivedas a concrete, three-dimensional reality.” One famous eidetic person was theinventor Nikola Tesla, who could visualize an entire blueprint in his head anduse this to construct some device. Elsewhere I have related eidetic imagery tothe phenomena of hypnagogia, the often bizarre, sharply detailed images many ofus perceive at the point of sleep.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText184]Hypnagogia is linked to the twilight state in between sleeping and waking, and,as mentioned, can be seen as another form of the “duo-consciousness” Blavatskyrepeatedly experienced.One curious characteristic of HPB’s apparent astral literacy was a kind ofnumerical dyslexia. On occasion she would ask Olcott to check some reference shehad gathered from the ether at the library, and he often found that the pagenumber she gave him turned out to be wrong. However, if he turned the numbersaround, they were correct. So, for example, page 291, which she had given him,would turn out to be really page 192. When asked about this, she explained that“in the astral,” it is as if things are seen in a mirror, that is, reversed.Although difficult, she had trained herself to read backward—no mean feat initself—but for some reason she frequently forgot to turn the numbers around.Later followers who helped organize her other monumentally intractable work, TheSecret Doctrine, also came across the same problem.Another curious feature of HPB’s writing habits that Olcott observed was adistinct change in her handwriting, depending on the subject matter she wasworking on. She also seemed on occasion to become another person; thistransformation usually took place when she briefly left the room. When shereturned, she was “someone else,” a strange metamorphosis that was alsowitnessed on occasion in Gurdjieff.18 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText185] Shewas not “entranced,” nor had she become possessed by “spirit guides,” but, shetold Olcott, “others” were writing the book through her, and one wonders if thepassages of “serene expositional expression” that Beatrice Hastings believed HPBwas incapable of matched those supposedly written by Blavatsky’s “others.” These“others,” of course, were the Masters—she spoke of an Indian, Narayan, and of anHungarian named Rákóczy (a pseudonym of the legendary Comte deSaint-Germain)—but it is worth noting that in his studies of multiplepersonality, Adam Crabtree more than once came upon cases in which the “No. 1”personality became so different that his patient’s actual appearance changed.Crabtree, however, does not recount any cases in which a patient’s hair changedas well, but apparently HPB’s did. From its normal state of being fair andcrinkly, Olcott and others saw it change to being black and straight. On twooccasions, Olcott clipped some of these transformed locks; Blavatsky told himthat one came from the head of an Egyptian, the other from a Hindu. She alsoseemed to sport an invisible mustache and sideburns, which he would watch herstroke, and on one occasion she materialized the head of the Indian to whom theybelonged. Olcott himself believed that HPB was not really a woman, but a man, a“Hindu man,” and in moments of deep absorption, “his own hair . . .materialized.”19 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText186]By now the reader is no doubt wondering if Olcott was lying, or was a dupe, thevictim of a remarkable fraud perpetrated against him by his chum. The fact thatthese are only some of the incredible events recounted in his Old Diary Leaveswill not, I am sure, instill greater confidence in the Colonel’s account, ourrecognition that he made a living investigating insurance fraud notwithstanding.Here I will only say that Olcott was not the only one to maintain that, in hispresence, Blavatsky did things that, quite frankly, most of us would considerimpossible.• • •ONE SEEMINGLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT that HPB did manage to accomplish, and to whichthere were quite a few witnesses, was to gather the chaotic mess of writing sheproduced each day and fuse it into a coherent whole. In this alchemical task shewas not alone. We’ve already seen that she had help from Colonel Olcott. Anotherhelpmeet was Alexander Wilder, a professor of philosophy who was also aphysician and archaeologist, among other accomplishments. J. W. Bouton, whomOlcott had approached about publishing the work, had suggested he let Wilder,who had edited some books for him, read the manuscript. Wilder found it a “trulyponderous document,” which “displayed research in a very extended field,” and asit related to current thinking, had “a revolution in it.” It was, however, toolong, and if Bouton wanted to publish it, it needed cutting. Olcott insistedthat Wilder meet the author, and one afternoon Wilder made his way to theLamasery. Wilder found a woman “who had seen much, thought much, travelled much,and experienced much.” She was an excellent conversationalist, spoke Englishfluently, and “uttered her thoughts clearly, concisely, and often forcibly.”Evidence for this last trait appeared in HPB’s use of the term “flapdoodle” whenreferring to anything she disagreed with. One suspects Wilder heard the term alot. Wilder was charmed by the author, and his editing of the enormous workbecame for him “a labour of love.”Up until shortly before its publication in September 1877, Blavatsky called thework The Veil of Isis, referring to the inscription on an ancient statue of thegoddess in the Egyptian city of Sais: “I am all that has been, all that is, allthat shall ever be, and no mortal has ever lifted my veil.” Readers of the bookmay notice that the whole of the first volume still retains that heading. Thisis because just before the second volume was prepared for printing, CharlesSotheran told Bouton that a book with the same title had just appeared inEngland. Bouton agreed that it would be a good idea to change the name, and heand Sotheran apparently hit on the new one simultaneously. HPB herself was neverhappy with the title Isis Unveiled, nor with its subtitle: “A Master Key to theMysteries of Ancient and Modern Science and Theology,” which seems to have beenBouton’s idea. Both, she thought, were too immodest. As today, publishers thenreserved the right to decide on a book’s title—after all, they have to sell thething—and as Bouton had already published books on ancient religion, symbolism,and mythology—all of which Blavatsky had written about—he knew there was a readymarket for this sort of work, and he wanted potential customers to know exactlywhat they’d be getting.Evidently Bouton knew what he was doing. Against all expectation, Isis Unveiledwas an overnight success, its initial edition of one thousand copies selling outin little more than a week, leaving its predecessor Art Magic somewhat in thedust. (As we’ve seen, Emma Hardinge Britten was so peeved at the book’s successthat she started the rumor that HPB had plagiarized the work from material foundin Baron de Palm’s trunk.) More printings followed, many of them, and the workhas been in print ever since. Not everyone, though, was happy with it. HPBherself had to be forcibly stopped from adding new material to it, which she didpractically up to the minute of publication, making the proofreading somethingof a hell. The spiritualist papers, expecting another Art Magic, were stunned,but many of the mainstream journals were less enthused. One called it a “largedish of hash” (Springfield Republican), while The Sun thought it a heap of“discarded rubbish.” Others agreed, but quite a few didn’t. HPB’s friends at theGraphic called it “a marvellous book,” remarking that its index alone, runningto some 50 pages, made it unique. (Beatrice Hastings later agreed, saying the“index would be an education to most people.”20[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText187] It was apparently Wilder’s work.21[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText188]) For the Boston Evening Transcript, thebook demanded “the earnest attention of thinkers and merits an analyticreading.” The New York World found it “an extremely readable and exhaustiveessay upon the paramount importance of re-establishing the Hermetic Philosophy,”and the New York Herald called it “one of the remarkable productions of thecentury.” HPB herself, who assumed the book would bring her little more thangrief, was so moved by this remark that she pointed it out in a letter to hercountryman Alexander Aksakov, emphasizing that it came from one of the mostconservative Catholic papers.One very vocal critic of the book was William Emmette Coleman, who, along withother spiritualists, tried very hard to show that the only veil involved in IsisUnveiled was the one being pulled over the public’s eyes. Coleman was a scholarand member of several learned societies. He argued that Blavatsky’s apparenterudition—astral or otherwise—which amazed everyone, including her family, was afraud. He diligently scrutinized the work, showing how, while she had indeedquoted from some fourteen hundred works, she neglected to note her source forthe quotation. This created the impression, Coleman argued, that she had gone tothe original works, when in fact she had found the quotations in what scholarscall “secondary material,” that is, other books that had quoted the originals.In fact, Coleman argued, Blavatsky had really only used about a hundred works ofcontemporary literature and scholarship, and had not read the many old texts shehad claimed to, either in the akasha or in a library.Yet, as Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke points out, Coleman’s charge of plagiarism isbeside the point, and may be little more than an example of what BeatriceHastings called a “snippet mind.”22 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText189] Thepoint of Isis Unveiled is not the erudition that went into it—impressive or not,as the case may be—but what Blavatsky did with the material; and we have toremember that, as a spiritualist, Coleman was not a neutral party. Only adry-as-dust pedant would disregard the original synthesis HPB achieves with hermaterial, basing his argument on the fact that she does not provide correctattribution for her sources. Blavatsky may not have been a particularly logicalthinker—her insights are erratic and often jumbled—but she was an enormouslyvital one, as well as a voracious reader, and she had an enviable ability tomake connections between ideas and facts that others may not have recognized. Idon’t believe she was interested in impressing others with her erudition. Ifthat was the case, then she certainly would have accepted Bouton’s offer of asubstantial advance, if she would consider unveiling Isis a bit more. Thesuccess of the book was so great that any publisher would have jumped at asequel, yet HPB turned him down, even when he increased his offer to fivethousand dollars, a huge sum at the time. She had a mission to accomplish withthe book, she said, and she believed she had fulfilled it, and with that done itwas time to turn to something else. The torrent of references, quotations, andfacts that frequently swamps a reader of Isis Unveiled—as Beatrice Hastingsremarked, “one is hurled from authority to authority”—is not aimed at impressingus, but at buttressing her argument with so much support that we cannot easilyignore it or dismiss it out of hand. Only someone whose mind was completely numbcould come away from this without feeling in some way challenged.• • •AND WHAT WAS her mission in writing it? What is Isis Unveiled about? It is acliché to say of some works that they “defy description,” yet this work of morethan fourteen hundred pages and some half a million words is not easilyprécised. In many ways, its closest relatives are the unclassifiable works ofCharles Fort, or Louis Pauwels’s and Jacques Bergier’s Morning of the Magicians,which started the “occult revival” of the 1960s, or even Erich von Däniken’sChariots of the Gods, although Blavatsky’s is a more serious effort, unlikeDäniken’s slipshod, frankly commercial work. Yet all three convey with IsisUnveiled the hoary truth that “there are more things in heaven and earth thanare dreamed of” in our philosophy, and in many ways it is a shame thatBlavatsky’s first major effort is often overshadowed by her later, morewell-known masterpiece. Although The Secret Doctrine is seen as the foundationof Theosophy, for my taste Isis Unveiled is more accessible, morethought-provoking, and more readable than HPB’s later, equally gargantuan opus.It is also filled with more argument—conveyed in Blavatsky’s best“desk-thumping” style—that the reader can consider and come to his ownconclusions about, unlike that more revelatory, “set in stone” pronouncement.The central theme of Isis Unveiled, as the reviewer for the New York Worldremarked, is the revival of the ancient Hermetic philosophy, and as NicholasGoodrick-Clarke points out, the value of William Coleman’s research is that itshows just how steeped in the Western esoteric and occult tradition Blavatskywas. Nearly all of the works that Coleman argues she cribbed from deal with someaspect of this.23 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText190] Although she would soonturn her sights toward the mystic East, HPB’s first major work is firmly rootedin the West. Against a modern, materialist science that considers “magic” andthe “occult” mere nonsense, and a Judeo-Christian tradition that sees them asdemonic, Blavatsky wants to re-establish the ancient Hermetic, Neo-Platonictradition, the outlines of which she had discovered in her great-grandfather’slibrary. The third prong of her attack, against Spiritualism, comes from thesame source. The kind of phenomena that the spiritualists associate with thedead, she argues, were known to the ancient sages. But they also knew—as didshe—that the dead did not produce them, but that they were the work of the“elementals,” or were the products of the ancient magicians themselves. The“invasion of the spirit people,” then, was not something new; in fact, it wasn’tan invasion at all, as the phenomena spiritualists saw as evidence of this hadbeen reported throughout history. They were mistaken that it was the dead whowere behind them, and they aggravated their mistake by allowing themselves to betaken over by forces that the magician disciplines himself to master. In fact,Blavatsky even argued that only weak, sick minds could become mediums, as anyhealthy mind would naturally prevent these lower entities from dominating it—aremark that Emma Hardinge Britten, D. D. Home, and other spiritualists could nothave cared for. (It has to be said, though, that as many histories ofSpiritualism show, many mediums were less than robust—Home is a good example—anda weak grasp on this world was seen as a sine qua non of access to the other. )Although it made her many enemies, this in-house fighting was not the majorbattle HPB had entered with Isis Unveiled. And for today’s readers, her equallystrong criticisms of Christianity and lavish praise for Hinduism and Buddhismseem nowhere near as scandalous as they did at the time. Precisely because ofbooks like Isis Unveiled, our contemporary “multifaith” sensibilities are moreopen to seeing Christianity in relative terms, as one among many forms ofspiritual practice and belief. Although our time has seen a resurgence ofintolerant, fundamental forms of religion, we live in an age in which Christian,Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist—even atheists and agnostics—can generally peaceablycoexist. This, as we’ve seen, was one of the aims of the Theosophical Society,and there is a good argument that the TS was itself a major agent in bringingthis about. The World’s Parliament of Religions, which took place in 1893 duringthe World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, in which Buddhists, Jains, Bahá’ís,Muslims, Hindus, and Theosophists shared a platform with Catholics, Protestants,and Jews, and in which Theosophists like William Quan Judge and Annie Besantwere major participants, was precisely the kind of coming together of differentfaiths that Blavatsky saw as the essence of Theosophy.A central argument informing Isis Unveiled is that all of the world’s religionsspring from a common source, the ancient wisdom religion that Blavatskyidentified with the Hermetic philosophy. This idea, of a common, ancient,“primordial” origin for Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and the rest, is foundtoday in the work of the Traditionalist school, whose main theoretician, RenéGuénon, was, oddly, a strident critic of Blavatsky. The idea has a prestigiouspedigree and can be found in the writings of the Corpus Hermeticum, a collectionof philosophical and spiritual texts attributed to the ancient mythological sageHermes Trismegistus, but which were most likely written circa 100 to 200 A.D. inAlexandria by contemporaries of the Philalethians and Neo-Platonists. The ideawas later revived when the Corpus Hermeticum, lost for centuries, was translatedinto Latin by the Florentine Platonist Marsilio Ficino in 1463. Ficino and hiscontemporaries believed the Hermetic texts were the source of a priscatheologia, a “perennial philosophy,” that dated back to the dawn of time, andthis idea informed much of the art and culture that we associate with theRenaissance.24 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText191] In reviving this notiononce again, Blavatsky was in some good company.Such an idea seemed peculiarly apt for the time, and if any occult congresswanted to stem the tide of materialism, it would have had better luck with this,I think, than with any murky machinations involving mediums and séances. WhenIsis Unveiled appeared, Western consciousness had entered a kind of metaphysicalblack hole. Although Christianity was still a powerful presence—henceBlavatsky’s criticisms—it was fighting a losing battle against a reductive,exclusively materialist science, the conclusion of which was that the universe,and the life within it, were ultimately meaningless, an assessment it stillstands by today. By this time, Darwin’s “dangerous idea” had shown that we werereally only “trousered apes,” and all our pretentions to being something morewere mere egotistical delusions. And if this wasn’t bad enough, in 1865, theGerman physicist Rudolf Clausius had introduced the notion of entropy. Clausiushad observed that over time, in a closed system, organized energy—for example,heat—tends to move toward a less organized, uniform state. (This is why a cup ofcoffee cools to room temperature.) As the “second law of thermodynamics,” thissuggested that eventually the organized energy in the universe would dissipateuntil it formed a kind of uniform lukewarm “cosmic puddle,” unable to supportlife. This irreversible process was known as the “heat death” of the cosmos. Forall the “progress” associated with the Industrial Revolution and the nineteenthcentury, a sense of futility had entered things, a feeling for which can befound in Matthew Arnold’s famous poem “Dover Beach,” where “ignorant armiesclash by night” upon “a darkling plain.” The Society for Psychical Research,which we will meet shortly, was formed because its members were troubled by thisgrowing sense of cosmic inconsequence, and hoped that the study of Spiritualismand other “psychical” phenomena might help throw light on “the actual truth asto the destiny of man.”25 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText192]Yet while Spiritualism offered some support for the belief in a nonmaterialreality, its nebulous pieties repelled more vigorous minds, eager for somecoherent philosophy with which to challenge a science that seemed intent onundermining all human purpose. Faith was little help in this matter. What wasneeded was knowledge, and with Isis Unveiled, Blavatsky seemed to show that shehad it on tap.• • •ALTHOUGH DARWIN’S FIGURE looms over the book, her main targets are his“bulldog,” Thomas Henry Huxley, and the scientist John Tyndall, the two highpriests of scientific materialism. Although few historians have noted it, inIsis Unveiled Blavatsky presents the first major intellectual—notreligious—criticism of Darwinian evolution. Credit for this is usually given toSamuel Butler, best known as the author of the utopian fantasy Erewhon. In 1878,Butler published Life and Habit, the first of a series of brilliantly arguedbooks, criticizing this mechanical account of how species evolved. Butler arguedthat Darwin had “banished mind from the universe.” Blavatsky agreed, but she hadmade the point first, and this alone should warrant her a secure place in thehistory of ideas.Darwinian evolution, she argued, only told part of the story, the part thattakes place in our current, physical world. It leaves out what happens beforeand after this interlude. Basing her vision on the Hermetic belief that theuniverse and everything in it, including ourselves, is an emanation ofspirit—which means that creation necessarily emerges from the Godhead, ratherthan in the Judeo-Christian account, in which God is separate from a creationthat might just as well not exist—Blavatsky argued that the transition frommonkey to man is only part of the evolution of men and women into gods, atransformation, she added, that embraces the entire cosmos. Darwin, she said,“begins his evolution of species at the lowest point and traces upwards. Hisonly mistake may be that he applies his system at the wrong end.”26[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText193] After passing through a period ofnecessary separation, spirit returns to itself, enriched by its voyage. Thus, asthe late Theodore Roszak remarked, Blavatsky presents “the evolutionary image asthe redemptive journey of spirit through the realms of matter” offering “thefirst philosophy of psychic and spiritual evolution to appear in the modernwest.”27 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText194]The evolution of life, then, is not a “chance” occurrence, which “just happened”to take place because of some “accidental” combination of chemicals, and whichthen carried on, driven by the pressures of survival and the occasionaladvantageous mutation. As she says, “it is not spirit which dwells in matter,but matter which clings temporarily to spirit.”28[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText195] Spirit (or consciousness), then, isprimary, and matter a temporary means spirit employs in its work. Evolution isthe basic grain of the universe itself, and opposed to the materialist visionwhich presents a “hideous, ceaseless procession of sparks of cosmic mattercreated by no one, floating onward from nowhere,” and which “rushesnowhither,”29 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText196] Blavatsky offers theCabalistic aphorism: “A stone becomes a plant; a plant, a beast; a beast, a man;a man, a spirit; and the spirit, a God.” In this scheme, “each perfected speciesin the physical evolution only affords more scope to the directing intelligenceto act within the improved nervous system,” a remark that the philosopher HenriBergson, whose Creative Evolution (1907) similarly challenged Darwin, could havemade.30 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText197] For Blavatsky, then, mind is not“banished” by evolution, but uses it in order to develop itself. In this way,rather than oppose science to religion or vice versa, Blavatsky synthesizes thetwo and transcends both, in a way reminiscent of the philosopher Hegel’s equallyevolutionary account of spirit’s journey through matter, The Phenomenology ofMind.Isis Unveiled is such a huge work, both in size and conception, that it can beread on many levels. It is also, as most modern readers discover, not a workthat needs to be read cover to cover, and perhaps the best way to approach it isby dipping in and out. (It makes, I believe, excellent bedside reading.) From ahistorical perspective, we can learn about works that were considered importantat the time but which are pretty much forgotten today. One such is The UnseenUniverse by Peter Guthrie Tait and Balfour Stewart, published in 1875. This oncevery popular work argues that “the visible universe is not the whole universebut only, it may be, a very small part of it,” an idea that physicists today aregrappling with under the rubric of “dark matter.” Arguing against the universe’seventual “heat death,” the authors suggest that the energy of the visibleuniverse might transfer to an invisible one, from which it emerges again in newforms—an idea that Blavatsky, with her Hermetic belief in dimensions of realitybeyond the sensory, embraced and which was later revived by the poet Rilke.31[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText198]On a biographical note, we discover that HPB was impressed with a work by aCivil War hero, General A. J. Pleasonton, The Influence of the Blue Ray of theSunlight, and because of it she had blue glass windows and blue draperiesinstalled in the Lamasery.32 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText199] Pleasontonbelieved that blue light was particularly helpful in plant growth and that itwas able to eradicate many illnesses.33 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText200]His work is seen as the beginning of chromotherapy—the idea that certain colorsaffect health—and HPB was not alone in putting it into practice. Around the timeof Isis Unveiled, there was a “blue glass” craze in America, with many peoplefollowing Pleasonton’s example, using blue glass in their hothouses and forpersonal ailments.It should also come as no surprise that many of the themes and ideas that occupya great deal of contemporary “alternative” literature were first announced byBlavatsky. When she asks her readers, “Do not the relics we treasure in ourmuseums—last mementos of the long lost arts—speak loudly of in favour of ancientcivilizations?” we are unavoidably reminded of Graham Hancock’s many works onjust that theme.34 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText201] When she tells us that“ages before [Columbus] clove the western waters, the Phoenician vessels hadcircumnavigated the globe and spread civilization in regions now silent anddeserted,” and asks who “will dare assert that the same hand which planned thepyramids of Egypt . . . did not erect the monumental Nagkow-Wat of Cambodia,” wethink of Charles Hapgood’s ideas about a “prehistoric” maritime civilizationthat encircled the globe.35 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText202] Even vonDäniken, who wrote of “ancient astronauts” and the science of earliercivilizations, is upstaged: “At a period far anterior to the siege of Troy, thelearned priests of the sanctuaries were thoroughly acquainted with electricityand even lightning conductors.”36 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText203]An attentive reader familiar with other works of modern esotericism soon seeshow much in later systems is rooted HPB. While a student of Gurdjieff’s “work,”I repeatedly plowed through his own gargantuan masterpiece, Beelzebub’s Tales toHis Grandson, and one idea that baffled me was the notion that “the sun neitherlights nor heats.”37 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText204] Gurdjieff, we know,criticized HPB but he was not beyond borrowing from her, and the same notion canbe found in Isis Unveiled.38 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText205] (Itsoriginal source is the Pythagorean notion of the spiritual “central sun,” ofwhich our physical sun is only a reflection.)Gurdjieff also spoke about the law of “reciprocal maintenance” at work in thecosmos. HPB speaks of “the reciprocal relations between the planetary bodies.”39[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText206] And when Gurdjieff told Ouspensky thatwars were the result of “tensions” between two planets, Blavatsky told herreaders that “certain planetary aspects may imply disturbances in the ether ofour planet, and certain others rest and harmony.”40[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText207] Indeed, for HPB, the planets and otherstellar bodies so influence life on the earth, that at one time they promoteperiods of withdrawal—“monasticism and anchoritism”—and at others frenziedaction and “utopian schemes.”41 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText208] Thisseems a pre-echo of Gurdjieff’s gloomy assessment of mankind’s inability to“do,” our complete mechanicalness and “sleep.” Gurdjieff, of course, wasn’t theonly one to borrow from the Madame. Some time ago I wrote an article for thesadly defunct Gnosis magazine about Rudolf Steiner’s odd idea that the earth was“dying,” in preparation for its evolution to a higher planetary level, and howdeveloping our own inner worlds helps this process along.42[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText209] Although, like Gurdjieff, Steiner wasoften critical of HPB, he nevertheless seems to have picked up this idea fromher. Blavatsky asks, “who is able to controvert the theory . . . that the earthitself will, like the living creatures to which it has given birth . . . afterpassing through its own stage of death and dissolution, become an etherealizedastral planet?”43 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText210] Gurdjieff, too, talkedabout the earth “evolving” into a sun, and the moon “evolving” into an earth,along what he called the “Ray of Creation.” And, as already mentioned, Steiner’s“Anthroposophy”—the “wisdom of man,” as opposed to that of the gods—is in manyways a Western, intellectualized version of HPB’s basic teachings. In sayingthis I am not arguing that Steiner and Gurdjieff stole from Blavatsky. As weknow, she herself borrowed quite a bit from previous thinkers. But I think it’simportant to recognize the possible source for ideas that followers of these twoimportant esoteric teachers may believe originated with them.• • •BUT EVEN A READER coming to these ideas for the first time is sure to learnsomething from HPB’s vigorous, often torrential accounts of what modern scienceis unable to fit under its narrow rubric. Arguments for Mesmerism, hypnosis,precognition, psychometry (the ability to “read” an object’s past simply fromtouching it), the science of the ancients (which in many ways anticipates ourown), the cyclical theory of history (well in advance of Oswald Spengler’sDecline of the West), elementals, the evolution of the planets, the unity of allreligions, prehistoric civilizations, animal reincarnation (she believed manyanimals were more deserving of this than many humans), magic, and much, muchmore are all presented in a robust, exuberant manner that often leaves thereader dazzled. The central message is that the dull, dead, mechanical universe,which a triumphant modern science was applauding as the height of humanconsciousness, was, quite simply, false, and that the world was infinitely moremysterious, more fascinating, and more alive than what the Huxleys, Tyndalls,and others believed. The ancients knew this and built a deeper, more profoundscience on that belief, a science that Blavatsky was here to revive.The style is often breathless and urgent, yet, as Beatrice Hastings noted, thereare occasional passages of serene, detached observation, such as this one aboutwhat the ancients believed about the inhabitants of the ether: “The universalether was not, in their eyes, simply a something stretching tenantlessthroughout the expanse of heaven; it was a boundless ocean peopled like ourfamiliar seas with monsters and minor creatures, and having in its everymolecule the germ of life.”44 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText211] It was thisvision of a universal ether, or, as she also called it, the akasha or “AstralLight,” that is perhaps the most influential idea to emerge from Isis Unveiled.Blavatsky borrowed it from her predecessors, Franz Anton Mesmer, Bulwer-Lytton,Eliphas Lévi, and others, but in her hands it took on a wider scope and meaning.Mesmer had seen his “animal magnetism” as a kind of subtle “fluid,” permeatingthe universe; in the human body, its currents affected health; the mesmeristcould learn how to control these, and through this heal his patients. EliphasLévi took Mesmer’s animal magnetism and transformed it into what he called the“Universal Agent,” a medium of such subtle materiality that, through the powerof his will and imagination, the magician could impress on it his very thoughts.In his early science fiction novel The Coming Race, about a subterraneancivilization of supermen, Bulwer-Lytton took Lévi’s “Universal Agent” and turnedit into vril, a mysterious power these superbeings possessed, a kind of laserbeam of the mind, a mental force of enormous capabilities. And, of course,material science had its own “luminiferous ether,” the medium thought to carrylight waves.45 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText212]Blavatsky linked these notions to earlier ones: the “sidereal light” ofParacelsus; the anima mundi, or “soul of the earth” of the ancient philosophers;the sacred fire of Zoroaster; the akasha of the Hindu adepts; the spiritual fireof the Rosicrucians; and also to contemporary ideas, such as the Odic force ofBaron Reichenbach; the “nerve-aura” of Joseph Rodes Buchanan; even electricity,then a still-mysterious phenomenon. To these she added the idea of the AstralLight as a kind of eternal record of everything that has ever happened, whatRudolf Steiner would later call “cosmic memory.” For Blavatsky, the Astral Light“keeps an unmutilated record of all that was, that is, or ever will be. Theminutest acts of our lives are imprinted on it, and even our thoughts restphotographed on its eternal tablets. . . . It is, in short, the memory ofGod.”46 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText213] So, far from a universeirrevocably heading toward its “heat death,” Blavatsky presents one in whicheven the faintest thought has an eternal life.“It is on the indestructible tablets of the Astral Light that is stamped theimpression of every thought we think,”47 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText214]Blavatsky wrote, and it is the magician’s task to master this phantasmagoria,this constant stream of images, memories, thoughts, and fantasies. If he failsin this, he can be easily led astray by dreams and alluring visions. Hence theAstral Light or Universal Agent is often symbolized as a serpent or dragon,whose undulating body mirrors the ever-fluctuating surface of the magneticwaves, and the magician is depicted as standing with one foot upon its head.Again, as with Spiritualism and mediums, Blavatsky insists on the disciplineinvolved in becoming an adept; it has nothing to do with “giving way,” “lettinggo,” or other passive methods. The magician must control the Astral Light, notlet it overwhelm him, something that seekers of enlightenment who employpsychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs often disregard.• • •YET, THE ASTRAL LIGHT is something more than a kind of permanent “cosmic harddrive,” containing an infinite number of downloads. It also contains a kind ofblueprint for the future, Platonic models of things yet to come. As I haveargued elsewhere, in this sense it is similar to David Bohm’s “implicate order,”and Rupert Sheldrake’s “morphogenetic fields.”48[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText215] And if we think that only eccentriccharacters like HPB had access to this, we are wrong. “In the stillness of thenight-hours, when our body senses are fast locked in the fetters of sleep . . .the astral form becomes free” and “soars to its parents and holds converse withthe stars.”49 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText216] (“Astral” means “of thestars.”) “No man,” she assures us, “however gross and material he may be, canavoid leading a double existence; one in the visible universe, the other in theinvisible.”50 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText217]This last remark is the central insight of all Hermetic, esoteric, occult, andspiritual philosophy: that human beings are the inhabitants of two worlds, themundane world we unavoidably encounter every day, and another world, whichtranscends this one and in which we are not constrained by the usual limits oftime and space.Again, if we think this is simply woolly “New Age” rubbish, consider, as merelyone example, the experience of the historian Arnold Toynbee, author of thetwelve-volume classic, A Study of History. In volume 10, in a section called“The Inspirations of Historians,” Toynbee speaks of a series of strangeexperiences that led to his writing the work. All of them involved a kind of“time-slip,” in which Toynbee found himself apparently perceiving an event inthe past, as if he were actually there, reliving it. Perhaps most remarkable wasan occasion when, while walking near Victoria Station in London, he foundhimself “in communion, not just with this or that episode of History, but withall that had been, and was, and was to come.” “In that instant he was directlyaware of the passage of History flowing through him in a mighty current, and ofhis own life welling like a wave in the flow of this vast tide.” (Toynbee wrotehis account in the third person.)The similarity between Toynbee’s words and Blavatsky’s is striking, and is morethan reminiscent of the inscription on the statue of Isis in Sais. And we shouldalso note the similarity between Toynbee’s experience, Blavatsky’s Astral Light,and the phenomenon of psychometry, which, as mentioned above, is the strangeability to “read” the past “written” on some object. As one researcher remarks,psychometry “is probably the best authenticated of all ‘psychic faculties,’”with “hundreds of impressive examples in the history of psychical research.”51[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText218] (William Denton, whose book The Soul ofThings is the classic work on the subject, receives high marks in IsisUnveiled.) Again, we are also reminded of the experience of the neuroscientistWilder Penfield, who, in 1952, while operating on a patient, accidentallystimulated an area of his brain. As the brain has no pain receptors, the patientwas awake, and reported not only a vivid memory but an absolute “re-living” of apast experience in all its detail, and in three dimensions, as if it washappening again (and we are reminded of HPB’s “astral reading,” which I havelinked to “eidetic imagery”). This is practically identical to the famousaccount that begins Marcel Proust’s enormous novel, A Remembrance of ThingsPast, when the hero tastes a bit of cake dipped in tea and is immediatelytransported back to his childhood, in all its sensory delight.Colin Wilson has explored this strange ability we have to grasp “the reality ofother times and places” and has dubbed it “Faculty X,” and elsewhere I havelooked at this in the context of the Hermetic philosophy that Blavatsky aimed torevive in Isis Unveiled.52 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText219] Whatever wemay think of Blavatsky’s choice of terms—to some, “Astral Light” is too “occult”and off-putting—she nevertheless pinned down an ability we all have to“transcend time and space,” and which seems to be available to us, whether ornot we pursue any occult or esoteric studies. If an occultist, a historian, aneuroscientist, and a novelist, who have no connection with each other and areseparated by time and space, all seem to be talking about the same thing, reasonsuggests that it is something objective—that is, real. And that Blavatsky arguedthat it was something the ancients knew of as well, seems to clinch it, for meat least.Isis Unveiled is full of insights like this, and if all she had done was toproduce this unwieldy masterpiece, HPB would warrant credit as one of the mostfertile minds of the nineteenth century. But more was in store for her, andshortly after unveiling Isis, HPB and the Colonel were packing their bags for ajourney to the East."},{"pageContent":"SEVENA PASSAGE TO INDIAIsis Unveiled was an unqualified success, but the Theosophical Society hadn’tprofited by it. The book had caused a stir, but it didn’t lead to a flood of newmembers, and more than a few of the original group moved on. With her magnumopus done, the movement itself seemed to have hit a doldrums. Even a briefperiod as a “secret society” along Masonic lines didn’t spark terrific interest,although HPB’s Masonic pedigree was recognized by John Yarker, English GrandMaster of the Ancient Primitive Rite of Freemasons.1[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText220] “From the close of 1876 to that of 1878,”Olcott recorded, “the Theosophical Society as a body was comparativelyinactive.” Their meetings had practically stopped. They had even stoppedcollecting fees. What activity there was took place at the Lamasery, and thismanifested more as an informal gathering than an official organization,following bylaws and agendas.Not everything was becalmed. Their correspondence grew, articles appeared,branches in London and elsewhere took shape—C. C. Massey had left for Englandand started a lodge there—and relations with sympathetic minds developed. Oneimportant new recruit was Thomas Edison, who joined the society in April 1878.By this time, “the Wizard of Menlo Park” had made significant contributions totelegraphy. He had also invented the phonograph, developed the first industrialresearch lab, and was on his way to devising the carbon microphone and electriclightbulb. Edison told Olcott that he had already made experiments along occultlines, and was currently working with pendulums, investigating whether theycould be moved by willpower alone. Edison later spoke of making a device tocommunicate with spirits, although there is some controversy about this, and ina later article HPB quoted him as saying that atoms are “possessed by a certainamount of intelligence,” a remark that, some decades later, would seem to becorroborated to some degree by quantum physics.2[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText221] Another famous American who had come intothe fold was Abner Doubleday, a Civil War hero, and, as mentioned, the purportedinventor of baseball. Doubleday was second in command at Fort Sumter, and astatue was erected at Gettysburg in honor of his bravery there. But even theaddition of these stellar notables wasn’t enough to prompt wider appeal.Major events in Blavatsky’s personal life had occurred, too. In May 1878, herdivorce from Michael Betanelly finally came through, and on July 8, five yearsand a day since her arrival there, HPB became an American citizen. Yetstrangely, taking on U.S. citizenship, and officially renouncing her ties toRussia, were only the prelude to what was perhaps HPB’s most fateful decisionyet: to leave the United States for good and move to India.• • •EXACTLY WHY, KNOWING she had already planned to shift her operations to India,HPB decided to become a U.S. citizen, is a question more than one of herbiographers has asked. John Symonds suggests that she realized carrying a U.S.passport, rather than a Russian one, would make life easier for her there.India, we know, at that time was the playground of the Great Game between Russiaand the British. Understandably, the British were suspicious of Russians comingto India, given Tsar Alexander II’s ideas about a “Russian Asia,” and to travelas a U.S. citizen would, she must have thought, smooth her journey a bit. Debateremains over whether or not HPB ever worked as a Russian spy, but the fact thatthe British thought she did is uncontested, and her newly earned U.S.citizenship did not, it seems, dissuade them from keeping an eye on her.But what prompted her to uproot once again and head for the mystic East isitself a much debated point. Some see it as a purely practical move. TheTheosophical Society was going the way of the Miracle Club, and rebooting itelsewhere seemed a good idea. Some, like K. Paul Johnson, believe the move wasmotivated by earlier ties she had made on her journeys, connections withspiritual and political societies that would soon resurface. William Quan Judgerelates that HPB had planned all along to go to India once Isis Unveiled hadbeen published, and that further, her plan was then to go to England, which infact she did.3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText222] She apparently told Olcottsomething similar as early as the spring of 1876.4[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText223] But in the standard account of thedecision, Olcott is the main player.Olcott relates how one evening in 1877, he was visited at the Lamasery by anAmerican, possibly James Peebles, a spiritualist and occultist who knew of HPB’sactivities with the société spirite in Cairo in 1871.5[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText224] His visitor had just returned from India,and on a whim, Olcott asked if he had chanced to meet two Hindu gentlemen theColonel had met in 1870 on a return voyage from England to America. Olcott had aphotograph of the men and showed it to his visitor. As fate would have it, hisvisitor did know one of the men, Moolji Thackersey, a textile magnate whom hehad recently met in Bombay. Olcott got Thackersey’s address from his visitor andwrote to his old traveling acquaintance, telling him about the TS, hisremarkable chum, and her great love of India. He also offered him membership inthe society. Thackersey replied, thanking Olcott for his membership, and tellinghim about a great Hindu holy man, Swami Dayananda Saraswati, who was the leaderof a Hindu reform movement, the Arya Samaj (“Samaj” means “society”). Thackerseyalso told Olcott about Hurrychund Chintamon, who was president of the Bombaybranch of the Arya Samaj. Olcott wrote to Chintamon, telling him about the TS,and its belief in an “Eternal and Omnipresent Principle which, under manydifferent names, was the same in all religions.”6[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText225] Chintamon replied, explaining that itappeared both groups had identical aims, and as it was pointless to maintain twosuch societies, it made sense that they combine. Olcott agreed, and afterexplaining things to the members, they decided to change their name to “TheTheosophical Society of the Arya Samaj.”Amalgamating itself with a Hindu reform movement may not seem as logical a stepfor the TS as Olcott seemed to believe it was, but there was some precedent forit. HPB, we know, had early contact with Eastern beliefs through her experienceswith the Kalmuck tribesmen during her time with her maternal grandparents. Wealso know that she claimed to have traveled in India as well as Tibet, and thather Masters, at least two of them, were Hindus. Her formal conversion toBuddhism was a few years ahead, but as early as 1877, while still in New York,HPB referred to herself as a Buddhist. In a letter in which she explains thatshe is not a spiritualist—at least “not in the modern and American sense of theword”—she calls herself “a benighted Buddhist.” By this she means that she is aSvabhavika, “a Buddhist pantheist, if anything at all.” This amounts tobelieving in “one eternal, indestructible, substance,” the Svabhavat, an“invisible, all pervading matter,” which seems reminiscent of what she means bythe Astral Light.7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText226] In this instance, itseems that HPB’s Buddhism is important to her as an alternative to the orthodoxChristian view of a supreme, personal, creator God—Jehovah, lording it over theuniverse. That she did not consider herself a Buddhist in a traditional sense isclear from her remark that, if it was said that she “belonged to the religionthat had inspired the Buddha”—my italics—and not the one that would have her“turning the Wheel of the Law,” that would be correct. The religion thatinspired the Buddha, it will turn out, is the “secret doctrine” she will laterreveal to the world, and of which she makes mention at the beginning of IsisUnveiled.Olcott himself had more than an intimation that his chum was planning a tripback East, and he had asked spiritualist friends to try to dissuade her from theidea. Failing this, he sent out feelers, asking about the possibilities of the“Lodge”—the Masters—sending someone else to shepherd the Theosophical flock inthe event that Blavatsky left them.8 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText227] Yet,as early as 1875, in his letter from “the Brotherhood of Luxor,” the Indianconnection was clear. Although “ordered at Luxor,” it had been written out inEllora, India, the site of mysterious cave temples near Arungabad. The MasterSerapis mentioned Ellora more than once to Olcott, and, as Joscelyn Godwinpoints out, it is in Ellora that the Chevalier Louis B of Ghost Land receives animportant initiation.9 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText228]In the public mind, India was a land of magicians, swamis, fakirs, holy men,mystics, and the “Indian rope trick.” It was also a land of warmth and sunshine.After completing Isis Unveiled, Blavatsky’s health, never good, began to suffer.Already large, she began to gain weight—a process certainly helped by her eatinghabits—and her body started to retain water, with folds of flesh growing aroundher wrists and ankles, a symptom of a disease in those days known as “dropsy”but today called edema. Her kidneys, too, were not doing well. Combined withother physical problems—not to mention old wounds from her roustabout life—it’sno surprise that in her later years, HPB more than once regarded her path as oneof suffering. The thought of life under the Indian sun, without having to faceanother New York winter, more than likely appealed to her.• • •SHE ALSO HAD another reason for pulling up stakes. In 1878, D. D. Home hadpublished a book, Lights and Shadows of Spiritualism, in which he attacked bothher and her chum, calling them fakes and charlatans. Never one to take criticismlightly, she erupted with rage—the Colonel was the recipient of it—and in aletter to Aksakov, she explained that as Home had ruined her reputation, whereelse could she recover it, except India? And there is always the thought that,in some way, HPB or her Masters subtly arranged events to bring her to India.Josephine Ransom, an early Theosophical historian, remarked that on the voyageacross the Atlantic, during which Olcott met them, Moolji Thackersey and hiscompanion were traveling not on business or for pleasure, but “on a mission tothe west to see what could be done to introduce Eastern spiritual andphilosophical ideas.”10 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText229] As Olcott’svisitor knew Moolji, his visit may not have been purely by chance.But, although the lure of the East was strong, Olcott had ample reason tohesitate. He had always wanted to go to the East, but unlike his chum, he hadobligations that prevented him. He thought he should stay in New York until hissons were set up in their own careers; whatever his relations with his wife, thethought of no longer seeing them must have crossed his mind. His own livelihoodwas another factor: how was he to make a living in India? These second thoughtsmust have reached the Masters. One night at the Lamasery, while he and Blavatskywere still working on Isis Unveiled, Olcott had a strange visitor. Theirevening’s work done, the Colonel retired to his room, where he relaxed with abook and a cigar. Suddenly he found himself in the presence of “an Oriental cladin white garments,” towering above him. Long, black hair hung down to hismysterious visitor’s broad shoulders, and a yellow silk turban crowned his noblehead. He wore a long black beard in Rajput style, parted at the chin, with theends curled gracefully behind his ears. His burning eyes pinned Olcott, and theColonel was so impressed by his strange guest’s appearance—“so luminouslyspiritual, so evidently above average humanity”—that he bowed before him andbent his knee. The figure placed a gentle hand on Olcott’s head and asked him tosit. He had come, he said, because he knew Olcott had reached a crisis in hislife, and he told Olcott that his own actions had brought him to this moment. Itwas up to the Colonel whether or not in the future they would work together “forthe good of mankind.” Great work was to be done, and Olcott could share in it.His link with HPB ran deep, deeper than he could suspect. Olcott was impressedthat his visitor could tell him things about himself and his chum that no oneelse knew.How long the meeting lasted is unclear—Olcott said it could have been an hourbut that it seemed “but a minute.” When his guest was about to leave, Olcott,still dazzled, nevertheless had the presence of mind to think that this could besome trick of HPB’s. She had, after all, shown remarkable abilities and was notabove using her powers to further her Masters’ designs. His visitor must haveread his mind, for he smiled and, undoing his turban, handed it to the Colonel.As Olcott took it, his guest vanished, but there in his hand was the turban,proof, Olcott wrote, that he had been “face to face with one of the ElderBrothers of Humanity, one of the Masters of our dull pupil–race.”11[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText230] Olcott even included a photograph of itin his account of this strange experience in his Old Diary Leaves.This wasn’t Olcott’s first visit from a Master. Sometime earlier he had a visitfrom two individuals that, from the description of it in a letter to friends,makes it seem that in some ways the Masters were rather like the Marx Brothers,or at least the mysterious “men in black” that haunt many UFO accounts; they,too, are strange visitors from unknown parts who act in a dreamlike, surrealway. In a letter to the London spiritualist Stainton Moses, Olcott relates howhe was visited by a character named Ooton Liatto, a Cypriot, who was accompaniedby another individual, a dark-skinned, gray-bearded man he does not name.There’s reason to suspect that Liatto and Hilarion Smerdis, the MasterHilarion—who wrote to Olcott as a representative of the Brotherhood of Luxor—arethe same. Bidding Olcott remain silent, Liatto materialized a bouquet offlowers, and Olcott watched as it floated to the floor. He then made it rain inOlcott’s room, soaking the Colonel, his books, his cigar, and his carpet, yetleaving himself and his companion absolutely dry. The other visitor now showedOlcott a crystal in which he saw fantastic visions. During an earlier visit byLiatto recounted in his Old Diary Leaves, Olcott related how the Cypriot madethe walls of his room disappear, and how he then gazed on vast landscapespeopled by strange, “elemental” forms.12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText231]Olcott told his visitors that they must meet HPB, who lived in the apartmentbelow—this was before they had moved to the Lamasery. Running downstairs, he wasstunned to find them already with Blavatsky, chatting like old friends. He thenran upstairs, only to find his apartment empty. He rushed to the window and sawhis visitors on the street below, turning the corner. Was his chum playingtricks on him? Yet his wet clothes, the soaking carpet, and the flowers, stillthere on the floor, argued that his visit had been real. When he asked HPB whathad just happened, she said nothing, and only complained that what he hadwritten about her in People from the Other World had caused her no end oftrouble.13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText232]Olcott’s fears seemed to have been quieted by his visit from the Master, whichappears to have been Blavatsky’s old Hindu, Morya. Provisions were made for hissons—William Quan Judge pulled a few strings—and Olcott himself secured a kindof open-ended position as a U.S. trade representative. His reputation evenwarranted a letter of recommendation from President Rutherford Hayes, which mayhave done something to assure his ex-wife that he wasn’t running out on hisalimony payments. Until the last minute, Blavatsky feared that the ex–Mrs.Olcott—whom she referred to as “Kali,” the Hindu goddess of death—would preventhim from leaving.The ostensible impetus for the move was the union with Swami Dayananda’s AryaSamaj, and for a time Olcott and Blavatsky believed the swami was in league withthe Masters, or at least in communication with them. Letters HPB wrote toHurrychund Chintamon were full of occult references: Akasa, the fourthdimension, and other arcane subjects, such as a request for a photograph of afakir or sannyasin levitating. Chintamon wrote back about the plight of theHindus under the British Raj, and Blavatsky’s sarcastic reply that she wouldlike the Russians to kick the British out of India (only for them and theMuslims to be kicked out by the Hindus themselves) was later used as “evidence”that she supported Russian rule in India. She also asked Chintamon to writeletters to C. C. Massey and another London member, Emily Kislingbury, sayingthat an Indian postmark and Sanskrit signature would do much to impress them.This clearly shows that she wasn’t above using a bit of “glamour” to achieve herends. What Chintamon would say she could easily say herself, but, she explained,she was “but a white-faced idiot not a Hindu,” and a letter from the mystic Eastwould carry more weight.14 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText233]But when Olcott received a copy of the Arya Samaj rules, he and HPB discoveredthat they amounted to a very narrow interpretation of Hinduism—in fact, a kindof fundamentalism—that was about as far from Theosophical eclecticism as onecould get. HPB and Olcott had also communicated with Parsees in Bombay andBuddhists in Ceylon, and the swami had strongly objected to this. The formalunion was now scrapped and both chums must have realized that working with theswami wasn’t feasible, just as the high hopes about E. Gerry Brown had come tonaught. Yet the wheels were turning and whatever might await them, they wereIndia bound.“Orders” had come that they were to leave New York by December 17. Where themoney for tickets and other necessities would come from was unclear. Some of itcame from an auction at the Lamasery on December 9, in which the whole menagerieof stuffed animals and assorted other mystical tchotchkes went up for sale. (Thefate of Professor Fiske would, I think, make for a good story.) Everything wentunder the hammer and, as HPB put it, “for a song.” Reporters covered the story.As HPB’s arrival in the United States was news, so was her departure. For allher praise of America—becoming a “plain citizen of the U.S. of America,” she hadtold a reporter, was “a title I value far more than any that could be conferredon me by King or Emperor”—on leaving the country, she had some second thoughts.“I am glad to get away from your country,” she told one reporter. “You haveliberty, but that is all, and of that you have too much.”15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText234] And some practical business had to besettled. Olcott appointed Abner Doubleday president ad interim to serve in hisabsence. Judge, who would later become head of the society in the United States,was made temporary treasurer and corresponding secretary, taking over HPB’spost. Judge had intended to make the voyage himself, but concern for his wife,who had no interest in Theosophy, prevented him. Edison was sorry to see themgo, and as a parting gift, he gave Olcott a phonograph that weighed nearly onehundred pounds. At a farewell party in the empty Lamasery, many recorded theirgreetings to their unknown Indian counterparts on this monstrous device,including HPB and Olcott; even Charles, a Theosophical cat, purred a hello.16[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText235] (Sadly, the recording no longer exists.)HPB maintained a sense of crisis until the last second. On the day they wereordered to depart, the Colonel had some last-minute business in Philadelphia,and did not return to New York until seven P.M. In his hand were their ticketsfor the steamship Canada, leaving that night bound for London. From there theywould journey to Liverpool, and from there—destiny. Things, however, did not goso smoothly, and although they had fulfilled their orders by leaving Americansoil by the 17th, first bad weather and then a missed tide kept them anchoredoff Coney Island for a day and a half. Not until the afternoon of December 19were they on their way, accompanied by two Theosophists, Rosa Bates, aschoolteacher, and Edward Wimbridge, an architect, who would assist them ontheir journey. Following her Masters’ orders, HPB had left her adopted country,never to return.• • •THERE WERE NOT many passengers on the Canada. One of these, an Anglicanclergyman, helped HPB pass the time by arguing with her about Christianity. OnNew Year’s Day, 1879, they reached the English Channel and the next day were inLondon, where they stayed at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Billing, in the suburb ofNorwood Park. Theosophists came to see them, as did spiritualists like StaintonMoses. Mrs. Billing herself was a noted medium, with a reputation on both sidesof the Atlantic. Inevitably, Blavatsky was asked to produce phenomena, and C. C.Massey, president of the London Lodge, saw her “materialize” an ivory cardcase.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText236] HPB paid a visit to the BritishMuseum and Olcott lectured to the London Lodge at their headquarters nearby, onGreat Russell Street. Later, in Cannon Street, in the City, Olcott had anotherencounter with the Masters. Walking in a heavy fog with two other Theosophists,Olcott suddenly found himself looking into the eyes of a tall Hindu. Back inNorwood Park, he discovered that the same Hindu had paid a visit to his chum.Although the front door was locked and bolted, that afternoon Mrs. Billing wassurprised to find an Indian gentleman in the hallway, asking to see MadameBlavatsky. When Mrs. Billing opened the door to her room, he saluted HPB byplacing his palms together, and the two conversed in a strange language.On January 17, they got a late train out of Euston Station, and that night werein Liverpool. The next day they boarded their steamer, the Speke Hall. It wasn’ta pleasant voyage. The seas were rough and at one point HPB injured her knee,smashing it into a table leg. Everyone, HPB included, got seasick. Just short ofa month later, on February 15, they entered Bombay harbor. Moolji Thackersey wasat the dock to greet them, as were some of his friends. In a show of gratitudefor finally reaching India’s sacred ground—or perhaps simply relief for beingoff the ship—Olcott kissed the stone quay.This seems a touch theatrical, but for the Indians it was a powerful symbolicact. The British had been ruling India for more than a century, first under theBritish East India Company, and then, more recently, under the Crown (the“British Raj”). For most of this time, the Hindus had seen the British as moreor less gods, invincible rulers (for the most part benevolent) who had broughtthem much good: unification, education, higher living standards, peace, andreforms such as the end of slavery, the end of suttee—the practice of burning awidow alive on her husband’s funeral pyre—the outlawing of human sacrifice, andof the Thuggee cult, which performed ritual murder in honor of the goddess Kali.But by 1857 and the Sepoy Mutiny—which Blavatsky just missed during her secondIndian adventure—attitudes toward the British had changed. The very educationIndians received from their rulers led them to a new, nationalist consciousness.They no longer wanted to be treated as children, and one product of this wasSwami Dayananda and the Arya Samaj, who worked to introduce his countrymen totheir own culture and religion. And now, here were two influential Westerners,who celebrated the Vedas and Holy India and had abandoned the West for thesacred land. How much Theosophy the many Indians who joined the society actuallyabsorbed is debatable. What is undeniable is the effect that Olcott’s and HPB’sembrace of their culture had on their self-esteem. For both Theosophy and theIndians, they couldn’t have come at a better time.After the greetings subsided, it was unclear what would happen next. ThenHurrychund Chintamon, who had missed their arrival, turned up. Olcott had askedfor a simple house for them, with only a minimum of servants. The houseHurrychund provided was actually one of his own and, as the Colonel had asked,it was very simple, lacking practically all Western amenities. On their secondday, at a reception held in their honor, three hundred people crammed into asmall hall. Garlands were tossed around their necks—even an Irishman they hadmet on ship and whom HPB persuaded to join the society was feted. The next daythey attended “Shiva’s Night,” a great feast, and were later brought to see hugestatues of the gods, and explored vast caves whose entrances were guarded bygiant lingams, large phallic sculptures, that worshipers covered in bright paint(what the asexual HPB thought of them is unclear). Visitors crowded their house,eager to see the Westerners who had joined the Arya Samaj, and holy men engagedthem in long philosophical discussions known as durbars. One evening they satthrough a performance of an interminable sacred drama. By 2:45 A.M., even thechums’ love of all things Indian had been exhausted. They got up to leave, butHurrychund stopped the performance, only to read a lengthy welcoming address.The next day, out of the blue, their ostensible host presented Olcott with aneye-watering bill for the house, their food, and everything else they hadenjoyed on their arrival, even a telegram he had sent them in New York insistingthey come. Olcott was staggered, and HPB let loose a barrage of invective. Itsoon turned out that money the TS had collected for the Arya Samaj and had sentto Hurrychund to be forwarded to Swami Dayananda had never reached its goal. HPBlater forced Hurrychund to admit to this and to refund the money, but it was notthe best start to their new alliance.In early March, the chums found a new home at 118 Girgaum Road, in the nativesection of Bombay, an area few Europeans entered. Here HPB acquired a Gujaratiservant boy, the fifteen-year-old Babula, who would stay with her during hertime in India. HPB and Olcott had separate bungalows, a symbol, perhaps of thefact that on reaching India, their “chumship,” always bumpy, would begin toloosen. As at Hurrychund’s house, visitors streamed into the place; they wererarely alone, and Parsees, Hindus, Jains, and others came to see the holyWesterners. Very few British made their acquaintance. HPB’s reputation, hardlyinviting to the average member of the Raj, may have preceded her, but theirreception could not have been helped by the fact that neither she nor Olcottbothered to stop at Government House, more or less standard procedure for anywhite visitors. Predictably, HPB ignored the “done” thing, and didn’t make theexpected calls at the “right” houses. This, plus the fact that from the minutethey arrived they were under British surveillance, no doubt played havoc withher social standing.Someone they might have expected to meet was one of the Masters, and soon enoughthey did. On March 29, HPB had Moolji get them a buggy, a small two-seatercarriage. She didn’t say where they were going but at each crossing simply gavethe driver directions. They entered a suburb, then passed into a wood, and aftermany turns finally reached the seashore, where they rode to a large estate. Atthe gate she told the driver to stop. She told Moolji to wait and that under nocircumstances was he to try to follow her. HPB then walked down the path to abungalow. The door opened, and a tall Indian in white welcomed her.Moolji was surprised that he didn’t know of this estate; when he asked about it,gardeners he saw working nearby refused to tell him anything about the owner,not even his name. Finally, HPB and the tall Indian appeared again. One of thegardeners gave the Indian some white roses. He handed them to HPB, who thenreturned to the buggy and told the driver to take them home. Back at GirgaumRoad, HPB gave the roses to Olcott, explaining that they were from Master Morya.She explained that the mysterious bungalow was used by the Masters whenever theyneeded to come to Bombay from Tibet. It was hidden by what she called a maya, anillusion, that prevented unwanted visitors from seeing it. Moolji did try tofind it again, with Olcott, but couldn’t. Later the Master paid a visit to thechums. Babula told Olcott that someone wanted to see him in HPB’s bungalow.There he saw the tall Indian he had seen in New York. Then it was his astralform, but now he was in the flesh. After a few minutes he pointed his finger inthe direction of Blavatsky’s voice—she was in another room. She came inimmediately, and fell at the Master’s feet.More mysterious events happened. In April, on Master’s orders, HPB, Olcott,Moolji, and Babula set out for the Karli Caves, ancient Buddhist temples cutinto solid rock, a day’s journey from Bombay. On the way, Moolji had his ownencounter with Morya. At the train station in Khandalla, he suddenly heard hisname and in a carriage saw the tall Hindu he had seen at the secret bungalow. Hehanded Moolji some flowers—they were again for Colonel Olcott—and then his trainleft the station. Olcott wished he could thank the Master for his gift, andBlavatsky offered to deliver a note. Olcott wrote one, to which he added aquestion, and handed it to Moolji. HPB then told him to walk along the roadahead of them. Moolji had no idea how the note would be delivered, but HPBsimply told him to go on. When he returned a few minutes later he explained thatthe tall Indian who had just left the station had appeared before him, taken thenote from his hand, and then disappeared.At the Karli Caves, HPB had to be carried up the steep hill; the heat and effortwere too much for her. Inside the elaborately decorated temples, the group had apicnic, and Blavatsky told them of secret passageways that led to a hidden innersanctum, where the Masters still resided. Shortly after, Moolji and Babula wentto purchase more provisions, and HPB and Olcott were left alone. HPB then toldOlcott to turn his back. He heard a loud thud, like a slamming door, and hischum’s piercing laugh. HPB had vanished. Sometime later she reappeared andexplained that she had passed through one of the secret doors and had been inconference with the Masters within.The next day, after a night spent sleeping on the temple porch, she announcedthat the Masters had told her telepathically that they wanted them to go northto Rajputana in the Punjab. Back in Khandalla, HPB was worried that Rosa Batesand Mr. Wimbridge, who were keeping house for them, would think they wereheading off on a holiday, using the Masters as an excuse, and wished that theMasters’ request had come in a more concrete form—a telegram, to be exact. Onthe train she wrote a note to that effect, asking the Masters to telegraph theirfriends in Bombay, to make things “official.” As she was about to toss the noteout the window, Olcott grabbed it, to make sure it wasn’t simply a blank pieceof paper. She then let it go. When they reached Bombay, they discovered that attwo that afternoon, Miss Bates had signed for a telegram, sent to Olcott by“Gulab Singh,” a character in Blavatsky’s From the Caves and Jungles ofHindustan, who is supposed to be based on Morya. The message was “Rajputana.Start immediately.” At a rest house on the way, a Hindu approached Olcott andgave him a letter. It was the answer to the question he had included with hisnote of thanks to Morya. Olcott had asked if it was possible for him to livefull time with the Masters. They answered no: His path was his service to theTheosophical Society. Later, when Olcott had second thoughts about the move, theMaster wrote to him again, soothing his worries.Exactly why they had to go to Rajputana is unclear; it seems the chums weresimply waiting for something to happen. At the River Jumma, they met BabuSurdass, a sannyasin who had sat in a lotus position on the riverbank forfifty-two years, rain or shine. At Cawnpore and at other places, they met othersannyasins, men who impressed Olcott with their powers of physical endurance.Yet when Olcott asked each of them to demonstrate the siddhis, or supernaturalpowers they had achieved, each declined, although one did explain that thesecret of materializing physical objects was to discover a “nucleus” aroundwhich the adept can gather the “matter of space.” (Later, Swami Dayananda wouldtell Olcott the same thing; again, current ideas about the mysterious “darkmatter” apparently missing from the universe as well as the equally mysterious“power of nothing” seem suggestive.18 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText237]) InAgra, they were appropriately stunned by the Taj Mahal, but the main event ofthe trip was a meeting with Swami Dayananda. At Saharanpore, they were met bythe Arya Samaj, who greeted them with a formal reception which everyoneattended, even the police agent who had been following them since they arrived.(At the end of the trip, Blavatsky approached him and sarcastically thanked himfor his escort. Less humorously, at the U.S. Consul, Olcott brandished hisendorsement from President Hayes and made an official complaint against theBritish, who were intercepting and reading their mail and telegrams; thesurveillance eventually stopped.) Olcott, Moolji, and even HPB were impressedwith the swami, who conversed with them about Nirvana, God, moksha(“liberation”), and also announced that Hurrychund had been expelled from thesociety. The next day they attended a meeting at which the swami addressed hisfollowers. Olcott addressed them as well, emphasizing the great benefit to behad from a union of East and West. When they left the next day, crowds escortedthem to the station and threw flowers after them as their train took them backto Bombay.At Girgaum Road, Olcott soon “went native,” and took to wearing a long cottoncloth and sandals. His chum, however, wasn’t happy with all the local customs.When a high-ranking middle-aged gentleman introduced a ten-year-old girl as his“wife,” HPB spluttered “Your WIFE? You old beast! You should be ashamed ofyourself!” and stormed away. But in general, Olcott and HPB met with tremendoussuccess. In July, they started work on The Theosophist, a monthly magazinedevoted to the cause. Olcott managed it and Blavatsky was the editor. Its firstissue appeared in October and it soon developed a large readership, whichbrought in many new members. One of these was Damodar K. Mavalankar, a youngBrahmin who gave up his privileged life to follow the path. He had read IsisUnveiled and when he learned that its author was in Bombay, he went to meet her.When his parents learned of his interest in Theosophy, they demanded he give itup or lose his inheritance. Damodar sacrificed his comfortable life, moved inwith the chums, and soon took over managing The Theosophist, to which he alsocontributed. He was the first to start calling the Masters “mahatmas” or “greatsouls.” In his youth he had a vision of a wise sage who helped him pass througha terrible illness; he later identified this figure as Koot Hoomi.• • •IT WAS AROUND this time that HPB received a letter from her old friend, EmmaCutting, who was now Emma Coulomb. Emma, we remember, knew Blavatsky in Cairo,and was one of the mediums involved in her failed société spirite. Emma had seenreports of HPB’s arrival in the Ceylon Times and thought it a good idea toreconnect. Emma explained that she had married the son of the owner of the Hoteld’Orient, where HPB had stayed. They had tried to run the hotel, but it failed,and another venture in Ceylon, from where she was writing, was alsounsuccessful. If she and her husband, Alexis, could get to Bombay, could her oldfriend help her find work? Blavatsky remembered the kindness Emma showed heryears ago, and Olcott agreed that they should help her. In what would soon provea major mistake, Blavatsky invited her to join them.• • •ONE BRIT WHO did go out of his way to make contact with Olcott and HPB wasAlfred Percy Sinnett, editor of The Pioneer, probably the most influentialnewspaper in India at the time; among its contributors was Rudyard Kipling.Almost as soon as they had arrived, Sinnett wrote to Olcott, inviting him andHPB to visit him in Allahabad, should they ever come north. Sinnett was aspiritualist with a keen interest in phenomena, and he had been told that IsisUnveiled was a major work. In retrospect it isn’t difficult to see that, fromHPB’s perspective, he would make a good alternative lieutenant, should she andthe Colonel have a difference of opinion.In December, HPB and Olcott, accompanied by Damodar and Babula, took upSinnett’s invitation. It was her first real contact with the British rulingclass. Olcott records that while Sinnett himself seemed stiff, his wife,Patience, was more at ease, and that a real friendship was struck up betweenthem. Sinnett met them at the Allahabad station with his barouche and pair andtwo liveried footmen. When they got to his home—they stayed for twoweeks—Blavatsky warned Sinnett that she was a “rough old hippopotamus.” Itdidn’t take long for him to agree. Not one for small talk, HPB launched into adiscussion of phenomena, and when Sinnett admitted that their experiments hadn’tproduced a rap, she replied “Oh, raps are the easiest thing to get,” put herhand on the table and immediately produced a score. Another guest was A. O.Hume, a pro-Hindu secretary for the government and noted ornithologist who laterbecame known as “the father of the Indian National Congress,” which eventuallyled to Indian Home Rule.19 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText238] One of HPB’scomplaints about the visit was that the smell of alcohol permeated the place.Blavatsky was as teetotal as Carrie Nation, with whom she shared somecharacteristics, and Olcott warned Sinnett, whom she had watched drink a wholebottle of wine, that she was “under great self-restraint.”20[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText239] Although usually loath to do so, HPBagreed to produce more phenomena, and more raps sounded about the house, on adoor, a clock, even on her hosts’ heads. They felt, they said, like faintelectric shocks. They grew suspicious, however, when she was asked to“materialize” a cigarette holder. She made some occult gestures, rubbed theColonel’s pipe between her hands, and then simply pulled one out of her pocket.It may have been a joke, or a subtle hint to Sinnett not to invest so muchimportance in these tricks, a “teaching strategy,” that, like her “abuse” ofColonel Olcott and others, is reminiscent of Gurdjieff. If so, subsequentdevelopments suggest it was lost on him.The party made a trip to Benares, where they stayed at the palace of theMaharaja of Vizianagram. Swami Dayananda was there, and they also paid a visitto a holy woman, known as the Maji, who lived in a cave near the Ganges. HPB wasindisposed and couldn’t make the visit, and everyone was impressed when theMaji, who never left her cave, did so to meet the Madame. At a gathering ofSanskrit scholars, who lauded Olcott for his promotion of Hindu sacred texts, aGerman professor and protégé of the great Orientalist Max Müller opined thatwhile in the past many yogis possessed siddhis and could, for example, make ashower of roses appear, no one could do that now. HPB disagreed, and after aperemptory wave of her hand, a dozen roses fell on the learned heads. Aftercomplementing her on her knowledge of Indian philosophy, the scholar thought tocatch her in her ruse by asking if she could possibly produce just one morerose, as a souvenir of the evening—she may have prepared for one such trick, hethought, but surely not two. She said, “Certainly, as many as you like,” and letloose another bouquet. And to make her point that such siddhis were possibletoday, she also caused the flame of a reading lamp to rise and fall, simply bycommanding it. When Olcott expressed his amazement, she said that one of theMasters had simply turned the wick up and down. He disagreed, and believed thatshe had achieved mastery over the salamanders, or fire elementals.On their return from Benares on December 26, the Sinnetts became members of thesociety. Some second thoughts may have assailed them, though. After a lectureOlcott had given on “Theosophy and Its Relation to India,” to a packed audiencewhich Hume had arranged, Blavatsky orally pummeled the Colonel because he hadleft her shawl behind. She had warned them that she was a hippopotamus, and evenOlcott admitted that he only put up with her abuse because he knew what laybehind her.• • •IN MARCH of the new year, the Coulombs arrived unannounced, their passage fromCeylon paid by the French consul. HPB may have forgotten her offer of help, buton seeing her old friend, she instantly asked her and her husband to stay withher—at least according to Emma Coulomb’s account. As the Coulombs werepenniless, they agreed. Alexis Coulomb was an all-round Mr. Fix-It, with general“hands-on” skills, and Olcott tried to secure him steady work. But he was pickyand tended to argue with his employers. Emma could keep house, and so the twoeventually became part of the society’s household, receiving room and board fortheir work. As Jean Overton Fuller suggests, this led to problems. If they hadbeen given a wage, then their positions as employees would have been clear. Asunpaid members working at the headquarters, their status was altogether moreambiguous. Miss Rosa Bates and Mr. Wimbridge, who had accompanied HPB and Olcottfrom New York, were beginning to have doubts about the move, and when Olcott putEmma in charge of the house, making Rosa a sub-editor of The Theosophist,warning signs should have gone off.Soon after the Coulombs were installed, HPB and the Colonel sailed for Ceylon(Sri Lanka). The Buddhists there had asked them to come, and already one oftheir high priests was a member of the society. Mohattiwatti Gunananda, a greatSinhalese religious leader, had praised Isis Unveiled and even translatedextracts from it. There on May 25, 1880, HPB and Olcott officially becameBuddhists, by taking pansil (the Five Precepts) at a temple of the RamayanaNikaya, although as mentioned, HPB’s “Buddhism” was always of a peculiar sort.As in Bombay, the chums were met by cheering crowds, who appeared at every stopon their tour of the island. They were the first Westerners to come andcelebrate Buddhism at the expense of the Christian missionaries who, both hereand in India, were beginning to feel the effect the chums were having on theirflock. Shouts of “Sadhoo, Sadhoo” (“Peace be unto you”) followed themeverywhere. Olcott writes of giving speeches in packed halls, of newspapersfilled with accounts of their visit, of dances, rituals, and other performancesput on in their honor. Not too long before, they were sitting in Hell’s Kitchen,unsure what lay ahead. Now they had a country looking to them as saviors. As inIndia, the religious revival also fueled a nationalist consciousness, andTheosophy produced a major boost for Sinhalese self-esteem.As might be expected, the Colonel took it all in with great earnestness, but HPBmaintained her sense of humor. On a visit to Kandy at the end of their tour,they were taken to see an ancient relic known as the Buddha’s Tooth. When Olcottexpressed mild skepticism about the object actually being the Buddha’s tooth, orany tooth at all, for that matter—it was quite large—his hosts explained that“they were giants in those days.” HPB however had no doubts. “Of course it’s histooth,” she said with, one suspects, a smile. “It’s one he had when he was bornas a tiger.”• • •WHEN THEY RETURNED to Girgaum Road in July, they received some sad news: Mooljihad died only a few days before. If this wasn’t bad enough, a feud had brokenout between Emma Coulomb and Miss Bates. Miss Bates accused Emma of trying topoison her. The charge was absurd but it made clear the tensions in thehousehold. Miss Bates resented being relieved of her duties and wanted to begiven more responsibility on The Theosophist. She and Mr. Wimbridge had hoped tomake a fresh start in India but things weren’t working out, and the introductionof the Coulombs did not help. After days of bickering, Wimbridge and Batesdemanded the Coulombs be expelled. Olcott and HPB refused, and their two escortsturned on the chums. During an argument, when Miss Bates displayed an invectiveequal to HPB’s, a letter mysteriously fell onto Olcott’s lap, apparently fromnowhere. It was from Serapis and in essence it advised getting rid of MissBates. Whether Miss Bates and Mr. Wimbridge also received counsel from theMasters is unknown, but soon after Olcott received the letter, they decided toreturn to America.On the same day that Rosa Bates and Edward Wimbridge announced they wereleaving, HPB and Olcott received another invitation from Sinnett, this timeasking them to join him in Simla, the summer capital of the Raj. This trip hasgone down in history because of what are known as “the Simla phenomena.” Muchhas been written about these strange events, and with the Mahatma Letters, theyform the most discussed examples of HPB’s powers of “materialization.” They tookplace during a picnic outing with HPB, Olcott, the Sinnetts, a Major Henderson,and a Mrs. Reed (ironically, Major Henderson had been responsible for having HPBand the Colonel shadowed). Just as they were setting out, at the last minute thegroup was joined by Syed Mahmood, the district judge of Rai Bareilly. When thegroup decided to stop for tea, the Sinnetts’ servants were embarrassed. They hadpacked the picnic baskets before Mahmood had joined them and, in consequence,were a cup and saucer short. Someone joked that they would have to take turns;someone else suggested that two people share one cup. Someone then asked ifMadame Blavatsky could not make a cup and saucer appear? After muchencouragement she agreed, and after some time inspecting the ground, she calledto Major Henderson and, pointing to a spot, told him to dig. The ground was hardand full of roots from a nearby cedar tree. After some work he had cut throughabout six inches and there, embedded in roots and the soil was a cup, matchingthe ones packed by the servants. HPB told the major to dig deeper. He did, andsoon discovered the matching saucer, also embedded in the soil and wrapped inroots.The major was stunned and when he asked Blavatsky to explain how she had managedit, she told him she couldn’t speak of it, unless he was a Theosophist. Heagreed to join the next day. Mrs. Sinnett asked why he didn’t join then andthere, and the major asked HPB to produce a diploma on the spot. She asked if hewould really join them if she did. The major assured her he would. “Then youshall have it,” she said. After looking about for a few moments, she told themajor that he would have to find it himself, and that it would be wrapped inblue twine. Everyone joined in the search, until the major came upon the diplomain a bush, wrapped in blue twine and already made out in his name in Olcott’shandwriting.Later, at the house, it was confirmed that the “materialized” cup and saucer didnot come from the Sinnetts’ pantry. The original set had formed a dozen; threecups had been broken beyond repair and had been discarded, and three remainedwith broken handles and were set apart on a high shelf. Six cups and saucerswere packed by the servants; the ones HPB provided were not from the remainingbroken three, yet were a perfect match. Later, Major Henderson had secondthoughts about the materialization, and suggested that it was just possible forsomeone to dig a tunnel behind where the cup and saucer had been found and plantthem there. When he mentioned this to HPB, and asked for another phenomenon,just to be sure, she burst into predictable rage.Yet, as Sinnett himself explains in The Occult World, a book he wrote about theexperience, subsequent examination of the area showed no signs of digginganywhere near the spot where the items were discovered. The whole area wasundisturbed. To plant the cup and saucer ahead of time, HPB or an accomplicewould have had to have spent a considerable time digging—more than a fewhours—then expertly covering their tracks; and for Blavatsky to have planted theitems, the tunnel would have had to have been fairly large. But more to thepoint, she would have had to have somehow known in advance that Mahmood Syedwould join them: that is, that an extra cup and saucer would be needed, and thatthe party would take that exact route. Although the destination had been decidedon, there was more than one route to it and exactly how to get there was leftopen until the last minute. And she would also have to have known that thedecision to stop for tea would have been made at that exact spot, and which cupsand saucers the servants would pack. There was more than one set to choose from,and HPB wouldn’t have seen them until they were unpacked for tea. Likewise withMajor Henderson’s diploma: HPB would have had to have known that he would agreeto join the society then and there, and would have had to have been in cahootswith Olcott about it—the diploma and a letter accompanying it were in hishandwriting. The picnic excursion was decided on the night before, after HPBtold her hosts that one of the Masters was passing through the area and thatthey might catch a glimpse of him. They had tried the previous day but had noluck, and thought to be in the general area just in case.There were other phenomena. On the evening of the picnic, the Sinnetts and theirguests were invited to dinner at the home of A. O. Hume. His Rothney Castle,decorated with specimens from his ornithological collection, commanded amagnificent view of the Himalayas, and was considered one of the finestdwellings in the area. At the dinner, HPB asked Hume’s wife if there wasanything she wished for. Mrs. Hume thought for a moment, then said she wouldlike to have a brooch that her mother gave her, but which someone had borrowedand subsequently lost. HPB took her hand and asked her to form a clear pictureof the brooch in her mind. Mrs. Hume described the brooch, and even drew apicture of it. HPB then took two cigarette papers and wrapped them around a cointhat was attached to her watch chain. She then put this inside her dress. Later,at the end of dinner, HPB said that her cigarette papers were gone, and sheannounced that the brooch would be found in a star-shaped flower bed in thegarden. There was such a flower bed at a distance from the house and, carryinglanterns, the party went to it. There among the nasturtiums they discoveredHPB’s cigarette papers, wrapped around some object. HPB wasn’t there when it wasfound, and when she got to the flower bed, the discovery was handed to Hume. Heunwrapped it; within was a brooch as described by Mrs. Hume.It later became known that the person who lost the brooch was Mrs. Hume’sdaughter, and that she had met Madame Blavatsky in Bombay, en route to Europe.Skeptics insist that for some reason, Mrs. Hume’s daughter gave the brooch toHPB, who somehow planted it in the Humes’ garden. Why Mrs. Hume’s daughter wouldgive a family heirloom to a stranger is never explained, but in any case shedenied giving the brooch to Blavatsky, and insisted that she really did lose it.But even if she did give it to HPB, this would mean either that Blavatsky againknew in advance that Mrs. Hume would wish for it, or that Mrs. Hume for somereason was in league with Blavatsky, and that the two planned the whole episodetogether, with Mrs. Hume pretending to want the lost brooch, and someone—Mr.Hume, perhaps—planting it in the flower bed. While conceivable, it raises thequestion why the Humes would go along with it. If the phenomena were engineeredto impress people—and that is the general reason given for them—who else wouldHPB conceivably want to impress, except people like Hume, who could be useful toher in some way. But you cannot use a fraud to impress your fellow conspirators,and it’s difficult to see what Hume, an important government official, wouldhave gained from being involved in such business, while it is clear that he hadmuch to lose by being caught out in it.There were other Simla phenomena, and they all breach the believabilitythreshold, yet they are all also subject to the same logical problems. Oneconcerns another brooch, this time Mrs. Sinnett’s. One night Sinnett saw what hebelieved to be Koot Hoomi in his astral form, and the next day he received amessage from the Master, saying that proof of his visit would be given to him.On an outing to Prospect Hill, HPB announced that Koot Hoomi had asked her toask Sinnett where he would like to receive his proof. The “proof” was somethingKoot Hoomi had taken the night before, during his astral visit to Sinnett.Sinnett looked around, and finally pointed to a cushion one of his guests wasusing, and said, “Inside that cushion.” HPB agreed and was about to begin, whensuddenly Mrs. Sinnett said, “No. Let it be inside mine!” HPB nodded. Mrs.Sinnett used her cushion all the time—it was her favorite—and, following HPB’sinstructions, she took it from behind her back and put it beneath a cover thrownover her legs. Then HPB asked her to take it out. Sinnett took a knife andslowly cut the threads, stitch by stitch. After he removed the outer cover, hefound an inner one, and after Sinnett carefully cut through this, Mrs. Sinnettfound a brooch like hers inside, which she had last seen on her dressing table,where she had put it the night before. The initials “K.H.” were scratched ontoit, and with it was a note, folded into a triangle. It read, “My Dear Brother,This brooch No. 2, is placed in this very strange place, simply to show you howvery easily a real phenomenon is produced.” It also suggested carrying oncommunication in a form that didn’t require pillows, showing that, if nothingelse, the Masters had a sense of humor.To have a brooch that was pilfered on an astral visit turn up inside yourfavorite cushion is remarkable enough. But what is truly significant about thisphenomenon is that the Masters were beginning to communicate with someone otherthan HPB and the Colonel. It was the beginning of a whole new era in HPB’s life,and it was one that would end in crisis."},{"pageContent":"EIGHTA CRISIS IN ADYARBy the time Mrs. Sinnett’s brooch inexplicably appeared inside her favoritecushion, her husband had already started what has to be one of the strangestcorrespondences in history. Impressed with HPB’s tales about the Masters andtheir mission, Sinnett asked Blavatsky if he could communicate with themhimself. Naturally he would use her as a go-between, an arrangement that hewould nevertheless quickly try to get around. (A. O. Hume, equally impressed,would try the same thing.) Blavatsky said she would ask, but there were noguarantees. The Masters were busy men, and, as she told Sinnett, at first noneof them were open to the idea. But eventually one agreed, and between 1880 and1885, Sinnett received over thirteen hundred pages of eloquent, often elaboratecommunication, collectively known as “the Mahatma Letters,” mostly from KootHoomi (who wrote in blue ink) but also from Morya (who wrote in red). These madeup, for the most part, an extensive instruction in esoteric philosophy.The essence of this Sinnett compressed into a book, Esoteric Buddhism, whichcaused quite a stir when it was published in 1883. Among its many readers were ayoung Rudolf Steiner and W. B. Yeats, both of whom, in different ways, madesignificant contributions to Theosophy, and to modern thought in general. Yet,although the book had popular appeal and remains a staple of Theosophicalliterature, it was not appreciated by all. Max Müller, the famed Orientalist,pointed out that however esoteric its teaching, it had nothing to do withBuddhism, and that the idea of an “esoteric Buddhism” itself could not be foundin any Buddhist literature and was therefore an invention of the book’s author,or of his guru, Madame Blavatsky.1 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText240] YetBlavatsky herself wasn’t happy with the title—or with the book—and took Sinnettto task about it in The Secret Doctrine. We’ve seen that her own form ofBuddhism was highly eccentric and had little to do with the Buddhism of scholarslike Müller or that of your average Buddhist. As Buddha itself means “awakened”or “enlightened one,” Sinnett’s use of the term can be translated as “EsotericAwakening” or “Esoteric Enlightenment.” Sinnett himself admitted to theconfusion his title triggered, commenting on how people inspired to join the TSafter reading his book spoke of themselves as “esoteric Buddhists.” He alsopointed out that he could easily have called the teaching he transmitted“Esoteric Brahmanism” or “Esoteric Christianity,” as a central claim of the workis that it communicated the ancient, original wisdom behind these subsequentdevelopments. Brahmanism, Christianity, and other world religions could, throughthis teaching, be seen to have emerged at various periods “from the same commonroot of spiritual knowledge.” But “since Buddhism had apparently separateditself less widely than other religions from the parent stem,” and as in its“exterior form” it was already attracting a great deal of attention in the West,he thought it appropriate to use it as a way of leading his readers into theprofound teaching which had been revealed to him.2[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText241]This may be a way of saying that, as Buddhism was attracting interest in theWest, calling his book Esoteric Buddhism was a way of attracting attention toit, a successful marketing ploy. In any case, in the long run it led to a greatdeal of confusion about Theosophy’s relation to Buddhism, and in recent yearshas informed the claim that works like The Tibetan Book of the Dead areessentially Western inventions, concocted by Theosophically inclined scholars.As one contemporary Buddhist scholar points out, W. Y. Evans-Wentz, the manresponsible for bringing the texts constituting The Tibetan Book of the Dead (atitle he gave them, borrowing from The Egyptian Book of the Dead) to a wideWestern readership, was a Theosophist, and the stamp of HPB’s ideas lies heavilyon his work.3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText242]The content of the Mahatma Letters is not, however, the most controversial thingabout them. Who actually wrote them is the subject of much debate and,naturally, HPB herself has been seen as their author. Books have been written“proving” this to be the case, most notably Who Wrote the Mahatma Letters? byWilliam and Harold Hare, published in 1936. Their conclusion, not surprisingly,is that Blavatsky did, and their argument was vigorously rebutted by Blavatsky’slate champion, Beatrice Hastings.4 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText243] Otherbooks, such as Did Madame Blavatsky Forge the Mahatma Letters? By C.Jinarajadasa (1934) argue otherwise, and support the case that HPB did not writethe letters. (Although the letters in question are generally those Sinnettreceived, we remember that the earliest date for a Mahatma letter is 1870, whenHPB’s aunt got word from Koot Hoomi that her niece was well, and that others,such as Colonel Olcott, received them too; Jinarajadasa also points out thatalong with KH and M, at least four other Masters wrote letters.) Handwritinganalysts, literary critics, and forgery experts have been employed by eitherside and, frustratingly, have come to opposite conclusions. Although commonsense suggests that HPB is responsible, when the circumstances are examined indetail, this doesn’t seem as obvious as we might think. And the argumentsuggesting that whatever her involvement, HPB neither physically wrote theletters nor composed them is more substantial than we might like. But even thequestion of their authenticity is not the most fascinating or exasperatingaspect of the Mahatma Letters. What leads the unbiased inquirer to an oftennumbing sense of uncertainty about them is their manner of delivery.Like Mrs. Sinnett’s brooch and the miraculous teacup—not to mention the saucerand, aptly enough, quite a few cigarettes—the Mahatma Letters were mysteriously“precipitated.”5 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText244] Although some did arrivein the post, most materialized in unusual circumstances via a kind of “astralspecial delivery,” often falling out of thin air.6[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText245] We’ve seen one appear in Mrs. Sinnett’scushion. Earlier during HPB’s visit, another note from one of the Brothers wasdiscovered in a tree. Mrs. Sinnett had asked to receive a letter from theMasters and HPB obliged, passing on Mrs. Sinnett’s request by her odd method ofjotting it down “invisibly” on a slip of paper, folding this into a triangle,and tossing it into the air, as she did when asking the Masters to send atelegram to Miss Bates and Mr. Wimbridge.Sinnett’s first Mahatma letter appeared on his writing table, in admittedly notparticularly mysterious circumstances: It could have been left there by normalmeans. Yet ironically, its message was the danger involved in trying to usephenomena to convince people of the existence of the Masters, which, one wouldthink, was precisely what the teacup, brooch, and now these mysterious letterswere about. Sinnett had asked that the Masters arrange for a copy of hisnewspaper, The Pioneer, to appear in London on the same day as its publicationin Allahabad. Normally it would take weeks for copies to arrive in Britain, andone turning up on the same day as publication would, Sinnett thought, be aconvincing proof of the Masters’ powers. Koot Hoomi disagreed. As HPB herselfrepeatedly pointed out, he argued that people are never convinced through suchthings, but would only ask for more and more miracles, and that in any case, thephenomena themselves were irrelevant to their mission. Better, he believed, thatSinnett make known the precipitation of the cup and the other items, and soencourage people to think about them themselves—it was preferable to get peopletaking an active stance toward these things, rather than encouraging theirpassivity by simply stunning them with miracles. As Sinnett would soon find out,the moral, ethical, and social aspects of their teaching were of infinitely moreimportance to the Masters, and they were not in the least interested in creating“a college for the special study of occultism,” as Sinnett seemed to have inmind. The Brothers worked for the “welfare of humanity” through the foundationof “a universal Brotherhood”—point number 3 in the Theosophical Society’s“mission statement”—and from the beginning Sinnett, and even more A. O. Hume,were at odds with this aim.7 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText246] As KootHoomi made clear, if Sinnett was to be of use to them, he had to choose between“the highest philosophy” or “simple exhibitions of occult power.”8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText247]Yet for all Koot Hoomi’s argument against the importance of phenomena, one hadto admit that the letters in which he communicated this were pretty phenomenal.Although in some, perhaps most cases, some kind of trickery may have been atwork, there are some, it strikes me, where that explanation seems inadequate.The phenomena themselves were more complicated than simply having a letterappear out of thin air, as did the roses HPB allegedly produced for herskeptical Sanskrit scholar, incredible enough as that would be. They involvedHPB receiving a question from Sinnett (or someone else), and then mentally“transmitting” this to Koot Hoomi. She did this via her “throw-away notemethod,” or by the more immediate means of a kind of telepathy. Then KH wouldeither communicate mentally his answer to one of his chelas, or students, whowould then “precipitate” this onto a page, or he would “precipitate” it himself.This meant that not only the actual paper the letter was written on, but thewriting itself, was somehow paranormally produced. Although KH does remark thathe occasionally writes the letters by hand, most of them were “impressed,” thatis, the writing reached the paper through imagination and will—in other words,magic.Common sense tells us that, if she didn’t write the replies herself, HPB passedon Sinnett’s messages through some normal means to whoever did. Yet this verysatisfying explanation doesn’t seem to fit all the facts. We’ve already seen howa note HPB threw out of a moving train reached “Gulab Singh,” who complied withher request and sent Miss Bates a telegram. If the whole thing was not anelaborate hoax (and the idea that it was raises its own problems), how do weaccount for “Gulab Singh” receiving HPB’s request and, immediately after,sending the telegram? The way the story is told, Miss Bates received thetelegram almost immediately after HPB sent her request, that is, while she andOlcott were still on the train. This wasn’t the only Mahatma letter associatedwith rail travel. Olcott himself received one on a moving train, and a train wasinvolved in the exchange that convinced Sinnett that HPB couldn’t have writtenKoot Hoomi’s letters.9 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText248] On this occasionit was actually a “Mahatma telegram,” and it arrived by normal delivery, but itconvinced Sinnett that HPB must have been in some kind of telepathic contactwith her Master.On October 27, 1880, HPB and Olcott were in Amritsar, where they visited theGolden Temple of the Sikhs, a place of worship for Sikh pilgrims, which housesthe Amrit Saras, “the fount of immortality,” and the Adi Granth, the sacred Sikhscripture.10 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText249] The hot weather had ended,and before leaving Simla for Allahabad, Sinnett wrote a letter to Koot Hoomi andposted it in a registered letter to HPB at Amritsar, asking her to forward it tohim. When he reached Allahabad, he found a letter from Blavatsky enclosing theregistered envelope he had sent her, and a telegram from KH, acknowledgingreceipt of his letter. HPB received Sinnett’s letter at 2 P.M. on thetwenty-seventh; the telegram was sent to Sinnett from Jhelum on the same day. Ina letter from KH that Sinnett received two days later, KH told him that he hadreceived his letter via HPB while on a train near Rawalpindi (in what is nowPakistan) and had gotten off at the next stop, Jhelum, in order to send him anacknowledgment of receipt. This was at four that afternoon. The distance betweenAmritsar and Jhelum is roughly 112 miles, and that between Amritsar andRawalpindi is roughly 175 miles. KH said he received HPB’s “transmission” ofSinnett’s letter at 2:05 P.M., five minutes after HPB received Sinnett’sregistered letter (the envelope she returned to Sinnett was stamped with thetime of delivery). By train, the fastest transportation available then, it tookKH two hours to travel the distance between where he received the “transmission”and where he sent a telegram to Sinnett acknowledging it, roughly sixty-threemiles. Were HPB to have sent the telegram acknowledging receipt of Sinnett’sletter, she would have had to travel nearly twice that distance in the sameamount of time. Sinnett asked the post office for the original message of thetelegram. It was in the handwriting he had come to know as Koot Hoomi’s. Thisconvinced Sinnett that HPB could not have sent the telegram and could not, then,have written the letters from KH.11 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText250]This does not, of course, prove that KH or Morya was a Master. But it does show,I think, how difficult it is to account for how HPB “transmitted” Sinnett’sletter to KH by any normal means, at least on this occasion. There was notelephone (Alexander Graham Bell had only patented his idea in 1876 and it wasstill not in general use, and certainly not in northern India), and of course noe-mail. But even if HPB had gotten the message to KH by some normal means, thefact that the original telegram message was written in KH’s handwriting and sentfrom a place that HPB could not have gotten to in time to send it (if she gotthe letter at two she couldn’t have been in Jhelum at four to send theacknowledgment) suggests that she wasn’t writing the letters to Sinnett.To be able to communicate telepathically with KH or her other Masters is, to besure, a remarkable claim. Yet by now, the reality of telepathy has, I think,been fairly well established. Around the same time as Sinnett was receiving hisletters, members of what would become the Society for Psychical Research werecollecting data supporting just that conclusion, and since then, numerousstudies, as well as a mountain of anecdotal material, confirms, to my mind atleast, that telepathy is real.12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText251] This,again, doesn’t prove that HPB did communicate with her Masters telepathically,only that we cannot dismiss the possibility that she did on the grounds thattelepathy is impossible.“Precipitating” letters, teacups, and other items is another thing, but evenhere there is some evidence in support of such phenomena. In an article for TheTheosophist HPB spelled out just how precipitation worked. She speaks of a “sortof psychological telegraphy,” in which the Master sends his message via “astralcurrents” to one of his chelas. This is picked up by the chela’s brain, whichcommunicates the message through his “nerve-currents” to his fingers, which reston a piece of “magnetically prepared paper.” The Master’s thoughts are thendirected to the paper, which then draws on the “ocean of akasa,” (the “matter ofspace” Swami Dayananda and the sannyasin that Olcott met had spoken of) and“permanent marks are left.”13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText252] Koot Hoomihimself commented on how he “writes” his letters: “I have to think it over, tophotograph every word and sentence carefully in my brain before it can berepeated by ‘precipitation’ . . . we have first to arrange our sentences andimpress every letter to appear on paper in our minds before it becomes fit to beread.” And he compares the process to the “mystery of the lithophyl . . . andhow the impress of leaves comes to take place on stones.”14[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText253]Are there examples of this remarkable ability elsewhere? The medium StaintonMoses, a friend of Olcott’s and HPB’s, was said to be able to “translocate”objects: photographs, picture frames, books, and other items were said to haveappeared in locked rooms during his séances, apparently arriving there throughthe walls. This “passage of matter through matter”—common during Spiritualism’sheyday—came about by some “process of de-materialization,” according to Moses’colleague Charles Speer, and we know that such things were speculated on inGhost Land.15 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText254] Other individualsassociated with “materializations,” “apports,” or “translocations” include thelate Hindu holy man Sathya Sai Baba and the psychic Uri Geller, and of coursemuch controversy surrounds their claims.But perhaps the paranormal phenomenon most relevant to the Mahatma Letters arethe “thoughtographs” of Ted Serios. In the 1960s, Serios, a Chicago bellhop,claimed he could make pictures appear on Polaroid film through his mind alone, aclaim substantiated by the investigations of the parapsychologist Jule Eisenbudin his book The World of Ted Serios (1967). Serios’s method was to hold acylinder to the camera and then point this at his forehead. He would thenconcentrate and force the image in his mind onto the film—a process soundingvery much like Koot Hoomi’s method of “impressing.” Serios also claimed to beable to do this at a distance, and, interestingly enough, he seemed to have moresuccess when under the influence of alcohol.16[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText255]I should also mention that some of the other phenomena associated with theMasters have a history, too. “Bilocation,” which we’ve already seen in thecontext of Tibetan Buddhism, is fairly common in the Western world. In 1886,Edmund Gurney, Frank Podmore, and F. W. H. Myers of the Society for PsychicalResearch published Phantasms of the Living, an Isis Unveiled–sized tomecollecting a monumental amount of anecdotal evidence for the phenomena ofsomeone’s “ghost” appearing to others while the person was still alive. InGerman-speaking countries, this is known as a doppelganger, and such esteemedcharacters as the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe were known to have experiencedit.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText256] In Psychic Self-Defence, theoccultist Dion Fortune recounts her own experience with creating a tulpa, or“thought form,” as discussed in Chapter 3. In Fortune’s case, it was an“elemental” in the form of a wolf, and as in the case of Alexandra David-Neel,it took some effort on her part to “reabsorb” it. Ouspensky recounts thatGurdjieff was able to project his thoughts inside his—Ouspensky’s—chest.Gurdjieff was also able to read his mind and, at one point, while travelingalone on a train to Moscow, Ouspensky “saw” Gurdjieff in the carriage with himand carried on a conversation.18 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText257] Again,in mentioning these examples, I am not trying to prove that HPB or her Masterscould do such things, merely show that they are not entirely unheard of.• • •HOWEVER THE MAHATMA LETTERS ARRIVED, soon after their correspondence began, bothSinnett and A. O. Hume ran into some problems. Both Sinnett and Hume asked KH ifit wasn’t possible to communicate directly, that is, without HPB. Predictably,when “the old lady,” as Sinnett called her, caught wind of this, there was hellto pay. Sinnett and Hume had also asked to start a branch of the TheosophicalSociety independently of Olcott. Both considered him something of a fool andwere uncomfortable with his “American ways,” as they were with HPB’s lack ofsocial tact, and wanted to initiate a more respectable “English” group. KH’sreply was a gentle but firm rebuke and a strong defense of the chums; he alsoasked why, if he was repelled by Olcott’s Yankee bumptiousness, Sinnett wasready to take instruction from a “greasy Tibetan.” Communication with Hume wassoon broken off, and he left Theosophy to focus on what would become the IndianNational Congress. Sinnett himself had to be continuously reminded of theimportance of furthering a “Universal Brotherhood.” He wanted to start an“elite” esoteric school, and KH dropped hints that he had been involved in onethat failed some years ago in London, among whose members were Bulwer-Lytton andEliphas Lévi. From his description, it sounds remarkably like the Orphic Circlespoken of by Emma Hardinge Britten. Other oddly familiar items in KH’s lettersare the emphasis on the admonition to “try”—which, as we’ve seen, was associatedwith Paschal Beverly Randolph and the H. B. of L., and which featured inOlcott’s letter from Tuitit Bey—and the American spelling of “skeptic,” whichsuggests that KH spent time in the United States. That the letters fill somethirteen hundred pages also reminds us of HPB’s own prolix style.19[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText258]For students of Theosophical history, Koot Hoomi’s discussions about practicalconcerns and the aims of the Masters are enlightening, but what stunned thereaders of Esoteric Buddhism was the new vision of man and the cosmos Sinnettwas receiving. I can only give the briefest outline here, and interested readersare advised to go to Sinnett’s book or the Mahatma Letters themselves, both ofwhich are available online.20 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText259] Contrary tothe Christian view, which sees man consisting of body and soul, the Masters toldSinnett that the human being was actually made up of seven “bodies.” Theseconsisted of Rupa, or the physical body; Prana, or the “vital” body, theprinciple of life; Linga Sharira, or the astral body; Kama Manas, or the animalsoul; Manas, or the human soul; Buddhi, or the spiritual soul; and Atma, or thespirit.21 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText260] The first four bodiesdisintegrate at death—the astral taking a bit longer than the others—and ourspiritual development depends on uniting Manas with Buddhi, or our human soulwith that of the spirit, while alive. If we are successful, this will result ina “true individuality” or “monad,” which will share in the immortality of Atma,the eternal spiritual principle.This sevenfold system was reflected in the cosmos, with the earth passingthrough what are called “Rounds,” a kind of spiritual evolution of its own. AsJean Overton Fuller remarks, “the Rounds are desperately difficult tounderstand,” and as Jocelyn Godwin comments, their study, as well as that of the“Root Races” and “Sub Races” associated with them, “is a recreation reserved forthe few.”22 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText261] The basic idea is that ourpresent physical earth is but one in a series or “chain” of seven incarnationsthat, in KH’s homely analogy, form a kind of “necklace.” Our earth as the“heaviest” or most material, is a kind of pendant hung between two groups ofthree. If, following his image, we take our earth as D, then A, B, and C areearlier, less material planetary incarnations, and E, F, and G are future, morespiritualized ones.23 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText262] Each shift from oneRound to the next involves huge stretches of time and is occasioned bytremendous transformations and cataclysms, and each Round or “bead” on thecosmic necklace has different “Root” and “Sub” races linked to it, an idea HPBspelled out in considerable detail in The Secret Doctrine. The overall pictureis of an evolution, but one, as already pointed out in Isis Unveiled, that goesfar beyond Darwin. It involves the entire universe passing from a pregnantnothingness into its physical existence, then into an increasing spiritual one,until it disappears into a kind of cosmic Nirvana, with a new universe appearingfurther on, which will go through its own cycle. For a generation alreadyexposed to Darwin and to the vast age of the earth—as presented in the work ofthe geologist Charles Lyell—that the cosmos itself went through an evolution didnot seem too fantastic, and that, united with Atma, we could see it through, wasa more thrilling version of an afterlife than the Victorian notion of acloud-filled heaven, populated by chubby, harp-playing angels.• • •AFTER THEIR VISIT TO SIMLA, the chums traveled through northern India gatheringnew recruits. Although the English papers in India were critical of them—asidefrom The Pioneer, whose owners were beginning to worry about Sinnett’spro-Theosophy stance—HPB and Olcott received tremendous popular support, and newbranches of the society sprang up practically everywhere they went. After avisit to the Sinnetts at Christmas, HPB and the Colonel returned to Bombay atthe beginning of 1881. By this time Madame Coulomb, who had ingratiated herselfmore firmly into the running of the household, had found them a new home. It wasa bungalow they nicknamed the Crow’s Nest, in the less crowded suburb of BreachCandy. Sinnett was happy at the move. Girgaum Road was much too “native” forhim, and as the society was attracting more European recruits, a morerespectable location was welcome. The Sinnetts passed through briefly in thespring, en route to England for a holiday, where Sinnett completed his bookabout “the Simla phenomena” and the Mahatmas. Published that June, The OccultWorld was a popular success, although it received bad reviews; according to theSaturday Review, HPB and the Colonel were “unscrupulous adventurers,” and Olcotthad received his title most likely “in a saloon.”Olcott, however, shrugged off such remarks. Back in Bombay, he had put his mindto more important matters. His thoughts turned to Ceylon and to the influenceChristian missionaries were having on the Buddhists there, and he determinedthat he would help the Buddhist effort. He started a Buddhist Education Fundthat would, in essence, bring Buddhism to Buddhists. His chum was not happy withthe idea. The Masters, she said, were not in favor of it, and would cut him off,but most likely she was worried about her lieutenant making plans of his own. Hewould travel without her, and no doubt the signs of independence were a threat.Predictably, she flew into a rage and refused to see him for a week; this may bewhy she continued to work with Sinnett who, according to a later devotee, wasincompetent “to pronounce even the most superficial judgement on one whom he wasinherently incapable of understanding,” that is, HPB herself.24[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText263]Whatever doubts the Masters had about Olcott’s mission, it was an unqualifiedsuccess. He gathered support from different Buddhist sects, gave lectures aroundthe island, wrote tracts, raised money, debated with missionaries, and wastreated as a savior wherever he went. He was shocked to find how little Buddhismthe Sinhalese knew, and to redress the lack, he composed a Buddhist Catechism.It was translated into Sinhalese and other languages and became a best-seller.Olcott in fact became a national hero and something of a legend. In the summerof 1882, he returned to Ceylon to continue his campaign, and while therediscovered he had some remarkable powers of his own. When a man, Cornelius Appu,with a paralyzed arm and leg made a contribution, Olcott suddenly felt animpulse to “try some healing passes” over him; in his early years Olcott had, weremember, cured some relatives of their ailments through magnetism. Now thepower seemed to have returned. Later that evening, Appu returned to thankOlcott, saying his arm and leg were better. Olcott made more passes, and after afew more treatments, Appu could move freely. He came back with a paralyzedfriend, and Olcott “cured” him too. Word got around and suddenly Olcott wasbesieged with the sick and crippled, treating people “from dawn until late atnight.” By his account, he cured eight thousand people in the course of a year,and only stopped when one of the Masters ordered him to, because his own healthwas threatened.25 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText264] In recognition ofOlcott’s efforts on behalf of the nation, in 1967 Sri Lanka issued acommemorative stamp in his honor. Streets in Colombo and Galle are named afterhim, and a statue of him stands outside Colombo Fort Railway Station. Olcott’swork inspired the Buddhist nationalist efforts of Anagarika Dharmapala, thegreat Sinhalese religious reformer and one of the speakers at the first World’sParliament of Religions held in 1893 in Chicago, at which both W. Q. Judge andAnnie Besant also spoke. In many ways Olcott’s career resembles that of anotherWesterner who “went Asian,” the Greek-Irish-American writer Lafcadio Hearn,whose celebration of Japanese life and culture led to him being venerated inJapan, much as Olcott is in Sri Lanka.26 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText265]When Olcott returned to the Crow’s Nest from his first Ceylon venture—inDecember 1881—he was surprised that the Masters had changed their mind about histrip. His chum welcomed him back warmly and gave him a message ofcongratulations from the Brothers. Olcott was pleased but wondered about thechange of attitude. If he had stifled doubts about his chum before, now theystarted to bubble up. HPB herself had been busy while he was away, traveling,spreading the word, and, in Lahore, meeting her Master. The summer found heragain at Simla, and it was during this stay that she exploded over Sinnett andHume’s request to deal with the Mahatmas directly.The Crow’s Nest, though preferable, served as the chums’ base for only a shortwhile. During most of it, the two traveled, sometimes together, but alsoseparately. In March 1882, they met in Calcutta, where Olcott lectured and theywere the guests of the maharaja. In April, they went to Madras, where they metT. Subba Row, an advocate or Vakil in the Indian justice system, who wouldbecome one of their most important Hindu supporters. It is said that beforemeeting HPB, Subba Row was ignorant of Sanskrit literature and anything to dowith philosophy or metaphysics, but that after meeting her, he could quote fromthe Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and other mystical texts by heart. The members ofthe new Madras lodge urged them to move their headquarters from Bombay to theircity. The idea appealed to the chums. HPB was beginning to feel the effects ofBright’s disease, but the “bags à la kangaroo” that were forming on her bodywere, she thought, the effect of Bombay’s heat and humidity. Her condition, shetold her relatives, was so bad that she convinced her doctor that she could “dieat any moment as a result of any excitement,” and one wonders if the Colonelever tried his healing powers on her or, indeed, if she would have let him.27[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText266] In November, the Theosophical Societypurchased a large estate in the suburb of Adyar. Although HPB herself wouldspend only a few years there, it would become the permanent home of the society.Before moving to Adyar, HPB took a “rest cure” in Sikkim, on orders from M. Shewas refused a pass by the British but went “just the same,” and spent time in amonastery just across the Tibetan border, and also a few days at her teachers’ashram, where she felt it was “like the old times.” In Darjeeling, she metMohini Chatterjee, a lawyer in the Calcutta Theosophical lodge, who was adescendant of the Hindu reformer Raja Rammohun. It was through Mohini Chatterjeethat W. B. Yeats would become involved in Theosophy, when he attended Mohini’slectures in Dublin in 1885. Yeats later wrote a poem about him.28[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText267]• • •ON DECEMBER 19, 1882, the TS established its new headquarters in Adyar. HPB,Olcott, Babula, Damodar, as well as the Coulombs and various visitors, occupiedthe new premises, which, with their spacious gardens, mango trees, and view ofthe estuary and sea, were a welcome change from the noise and bustle of Bombay.HPB’s rooms were on the second floor, above a large room on the ground floorwhich was used for lectures and meetings. A curtain divided her space into abedroom and living room, but she now thought to have a special space arrangedjust for the Masters, which became known as “the occult room.” Olcott had AlexisCoulomb build an extension for his chum on the bedroom side, and Blavatskydedicated a recess there as a space solely for the Masters’ use. Here sheerected what became known as “the shrine.” This was a cabinet, about five feethigh by four wide, that she hung on the wall. Behind its lacquered folding doorswas intricate metalwork, and here HPB put “precipitated” portraits of KH and M,a statue of the Buddha, and other sacred objets d’art, all of which was closedoff by a curtain. Here followers would deposit letters to the Masters, whichwould be “delivered” to them, and here they would receive their “precipitated”replies. Although the most famous Mahatma Letters are the ones Sinnett received,except for one, none of these came through the shrine.• • •THE YEAR 1883 was relatively peaceful for the chums, but it was only the calmbefore the storm. Blavatsky wrote and published an enormous amount in TheTheosophist. This was just as well, as the owners of The Pioneer had finally hadenough of Sinnett’s pro-HPB policy. It was alienating its English readers whosaw Theosophy as a native gimmick, and he was asked to leave. The Christianmissionaries, who were increasingly resentful of Theosophy’s success, were happyabout the decision. A plan by KH to start a new paper, The Phoenix, funded byHindu rajas, fell through, and Sinnett returned to England, where he wroteEsoteric Buddhism and would soon make a bid to become president of the LondonLodge. Anna Kingsford, an upper-class Englishwoman who combined interests inChristian Esotericism with vegetarianism and the anti-vivisection movement (shehad even taken a medical degree to fight the practice), had succeeded C. C.Massey as president, but Sinnett had his sights on that position and the twowould soon clash. Sinnett’s argument against Kingsford was that she doubted theexistence of the Mahatmas, a point the Mahatmas themselves thought negligible,as a letter from Koot Hoomi supported her presidency.29[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText268] The Colonel was enjoying his work, whichwas increasingly independent of his chum. At one point in June, returning from atour of Bengal, he was unsure whether to accept invitations to Colombo again, orto Allahabad. He put one of the invitations into the shrine and immediately gota reply from Master Hilarion suggesting he go to Colombo. Olcott receivedseveral letters that summer, one directing him to write a letter which Sinnettcould use to bring the scientist and spiritualist William Crookes over to theTheosophical cause.One embarrassing moment occurred in September. The spiritualist paper Lightpublished a letter by Henry Kiddle, who claimed that whoever the Mahatmas were,they had plagiarized him. In one of the Mahatma Letters Sinnett had published inThe Occult World, Kiddle was surprised to find phrases that seemed to have beentaken from a lecture he had given in 1880 and which had been printed that yearin The Banner of Light. Everyone rose to KH’s defense, but he himself admittedthat while making a “clairvoyant survey” of current Spiritualism, he had pickedup some of Kiddle’s phrases and while “dictating mentally” the letter inquestion to his chela, he had inadvertently fastened on these. He was tired atthe time and when Sinnett’s book was published had forgotten about it.A more assuring contact with the Master was made with Olcott in November. On atour of northern India with a recent convert, W. T. Brown of the University ofGlasgow, Olcott received a visit from KH while sleeping in his tent. Touchinghim lightly, KH placed his right hand over Olcott’s, closing his fingers intohis palm. When the Colonel opened them, he held a letter wrapped in silk. KHthen visited Brown as well. Damodar, who was accompanying them, had his ownvisit the next night. What made this unusual was that it wasn’t an astral visit.Olcott, Brown, and Damodar were convinced they had seen the Master in theflesh.30 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText269]By December, HPB’s health had so deteriorated that she attended the society’sconvention on crutches. Her doctors advised a change of climate. Olcott wasplanning to go to England, both to help settle the turmoil in the London Lodgeand also to plead the cause of the Ceylon Buddhist community, which was beingrepeatedly harassed by Christians; Olcott intended to bring the matter beforethe British authorities. He invited HPB to accompany him. As the chums would beaway for some time, Olcott appointed a Board of Control to run things while theywere gone. One of its members was the German-American occultist Franz Hartmann,who had recently arrived from Colorado and whose magnetism HPB once remarked was“sickening.”31 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText270] Others included T. SubbaRow; another new recruit, St. George Lane-Fox; and Damodar. HPB and Olcott leftAdyar in February, and were accompanied by Hartmann and Madame Coulomb as far asBombay. While staying with Prince Harisinghi Rupsinghi, Madame Coulomb againtried to borrow two thousand rupees from him; she had made an earlier attempt atthe December convention. When HPB heard of this, she counseled the princeagainst the loan, and chided her old friend Emma for the indiscretion. It was areprimand her friend would not forget.• • •THEY REACHED MARSEILLES IN MARCH. By now the group included Mohini Chatterjee,who went on to Paris, while Olcott and Blavatsky went to Nice to stay with theCountess of Caithness. The countess was a fervent Theosophist—among otherinterests—and had founded the French branch of the society, and it is possiblethat she provided the money that HPB was supposed to deliver to someone inBuffalo on her arrival in New York. The countess invited many notables,including the great astronomer Flammarion, to meet the Madame. The chums thenheaded to Paris too, where the countess had arranged for them to stay in a suitein the Latin Quarter near Notre Dame. Here she threw a grand fete for them ather home in the Faubourg St.-Germain, which received notices in most of theParis papers. W. Q. Judge, on his way to India, met them there. By this time HPBwas writing Sinnett, commiserating with him about the Masters’ support ofKingsford, whom she didn’t like (she wore too much jewelry and was a Christian).But she was also unhappy about his attempt to get Laura Holloway, an Americanmedium who had been sent to London by KH to work with Mohini, to work for him.She told him that if he took her away from Mohini, the Masters wouldn’t like it.Sinnett no doubt was interested in Holloway as a means of talking with theMasters himself.On the way to London, Olcott shared an empty carriage with Mohini. Out of theblue—or the ceiling—a letter dropped onto the book he was reading. It was fromKH, and it warned him of some trouble afoot back in Adyar. It informed him thatthey had “harboured a traitor and an enemy” who would help the missionariesagainst them.32 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText271] What Olcott thought ofthis is unclear. In any case he had a lot to do already. A meeting was arrangedfor April 7, to elect new officers of the London Lodge. HPB had been invited toattend, but she refused. At a meeting before the elections, Anna Kingsford hadaccepted Olcott’s offer to head her own branch, the Hermetic TheosophicalSociety, whose title affirmed Kingsford’s preference for a Western rather thanEastern esoteric tradition—one, of course, that HPB herself was well acquaintedwith. This was later truncated to the Hermetic Society, which eventually brokewith the TS. In Paris, HPB told Judge that M had just given her an extraordinary“order.” She was to go to London anyway. Why he had ordered this, she couldn’tfathom, as the members there would only think she was doing it for effect. Buthe had also taken note of the train timetables, and if Judge would help, shecould just make the 7:45 express.Whatever the Masters’ designs, an effect is exactly what HPB’s appearance at therooms in Lincoln’s Inn, where the elections were being held, produced. Accountsdiffer as to details. Kingsford either decided not to run for re-election, orwas defeated by a Mr. Finch, who became president, with Sinnett a magnanimousvice president. Among those who watched the proceedings—which were curiouslylike a later event, when Gurdjieff made a dramatic appearance among Ouspensky’sLondon students—were C. W. Leadbeater and F. W. H. Myers, an important member ofthe new Society for Psychical Research, or SPR.33[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText272] According to Leadbeater, “a stout lady inblack” burst into the room and took a seat. After a few minutes fidgeting, shejumped up and shouted “Mohini,” at which Mohini Chatterjee appeared andprostrated himself at her feet. Sinnett, who dreaded her ever coming to England,was stunned, and after a few minutes fumbling announced to the startled crowdthat Madame Blavatsky was in the room. HPB asked to see Anna Kingsford and hercolleague, Edward Maitland. The two apostates presented themselves, andBlavatsky turned her liquid eyes on them and ordered them to make up withSinnett. But Kingsford was no pushover; she claimed to have killed avivisectionist by thought alone, a feat difficult to square with her Christianbeliefs.34 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText273] A showdown was imminent andOlcott, ever the diplomat, did not want more fractures. He approached his chumand said that he could not have her mesmerizing Dr. Kingsford. HPB laughed andthe tension diffused. But not for long.One result of the meeting was an invitation by F. W. H. Myers for Olcott tolunch with him and other members of the SPR. Olcott accepted, and investigatingMadame Blavatsky and the “precipitated” letters was soon on the society’sagenda. HPB wasn’t impressed and referred to them as the “Spookical ResearchSociety.” But Olcott felt Myers was friendly and posed no threat. He had no ideathat the SPR would bang a very big nail into the Masters’ coffin, an activitythat someone closer to home was engaged in back in Adyar.• • •MADAME COULOMB WASN’T happy that she wasn’t on the Board of Control, nor thather dear friend HPB had spoiled the two thousand rupee loan. On the other hand,the Board of Control wasn’t very happy with her. She appears to have fiddledwith the house expenses and, perhaps even more egregiously, had made broad hintsabout revealing “everything” that had been going on at Adyar to anyone who wouldlisten. Emma Coulomb appears to have been a resentful, grasping person, easy totake offense, and she had a habit of poking her nose into other people’sbusiness, as well as their mail. As Hartmann, one of her accusers, remarked,“she seemed to consider it her especial purpose in life, to pry into everybody’sprivate affairs, pick up stray letters here and there that were not addressed toher,” and if she found a sympathetic ear, she would “insinuate that the wholesociety was a humbug, the phenomena produced by fraud, and that ‘she could tellmany things, if only she wanted to do so.’”35[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText274] Although she and Alexis had madethemselves indispensable, the board, tired of their insinuations and actualmisconduct, thought to dispense with them anyway, and they were asked to leave.The Coulombs refused. The Masters seemed unsure of this decision. KH firstthought it best to try to soothe things, but M warned outright that Emma wascollaborating with the enemy—Christian missionaries—and he also warned that hertalk of “trap doors and tricks” would soon be made good: “trap doors,” he wrote,“will be found.”36 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText275]Eager to get rid of them, Hartmann offered the Coulombs a share in a silver minein Colorado if they would go there. At first they agreed, then demanded threethousand rupees as well, explaining that if they weren’t paid, incriminatingletters between HPB and her dear friend would reach certain parties eager toread them. These letters, Emma explained, would show how Madame Blavatsky drewher into her scheme to “fake” the Masters, their letters, the precipitations,and their appearances, just as she had been involved in her phony séances inCairo. Subba Row wrote to Blavatsky of this blackmail attempt. HPB assured himno such letters existed, and the demand was refused. The Coulombs then seemed tohave tried to insinuate that Hartmann, Lane-Fox, and others were trying to oustHPB, and that they, her good friends, were being framed.In May, the board officially charged the Coulombs with several counts, includingmisuse of funds, accusations of fraud, and blackmail, and they were expelled.They were also asked to return the key to HPB’s rooms. They refused. After HPBherself cabled her regrets at developments and bid them both good luck, theyrelented, but only after displaying to the board the mysterious hole in HPB’sroom that gave access to the “occult room,” and the sliding panels in the wallthat opened into the shrine. In her absence, HPB had given the Coulombs the runof her rooms; Alexis was supposedly making some improvements on them. Now theBoard of Control discovered exactly what those were. Hartmann remarked that thehole was clearly made very recently and that the sliding panels were stiff andnoisy, an assessment with which others, who also examined them, agreed. Neither,they believed, could have been used to fake the precipitated letters, althoughit was clearly the Coulombs’ intent that this “evidence” would prove that theywere. About a week later, the Coulombs demanded ten thousand rupees in exchangefor keeping quiet about these “discoveries.” Again, the board refused, and theCoulombs retreated—for the time being.37 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText276](The Coulombs, of course, denied any accusations of blackmail or of creating thehole or sliding panels in Blavatsky’s room.)While this crisis was going on, Olcott and HPB were making a favorableimpression on the SPR. In May, a committee was appointed to take evidence fromTS members regarding the phenomena, and in June, at the SPR’s general meetingheld in Queen Anne’s Mansions in London, Olcott spoke of his astral visit by M,even producing the Master’s turban as proof. Strangely, this triggered anonslaught of fury from his chum; she abused him so terribly that at one point heasked if she would like him to commit suicide.38[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText277] Our first reaction is that she wasworried that if the SPR investigated the Masters, they would discover they werefake. But HPB’s own remarks suggest the opposite: that she was worried that theywould be shown to be real, and their identities revealed. She was already angryat Sinnett’s The Occult World and Esoteric Buddhism because it had made thereality of the Masters common knowledge, with the result that “Nowadays peoplecall their dogs and cats by the name of Koot Hoomi.”39[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText278] Of course, we may decide that HPB wassimply afraid of being found out, but her commitment to the Masters—whoever theywere—was, I believe, real, and years later she lamented that their name hadbecome “common property” and that the “sacred names of occultism . . . have beendragged in filthy mire.”40 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText279] WhateverOlcott’s mistake, at Francesca Arundale’s home on Elgin Crescent, anothermeeting between HPB, Mohini, and Professor Henry Sidgwick, president of the SPR,went well. In his journal, Sidgwick wrote that his “favourable impression ofMadame Blavatsky was maintained,” calling her a “genuine being” with a “realdesire for the good of mankind,” and also commenting on her “flounces full ofcigarette ashes.”41 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText280] At two earliermeetings at Arundale’s home, members of the SPR, including Myers, had heardastral bells.42 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText281] It seemed that, Olcott’sunwitting blunder aside, the Spookical Research Society meant well by HPB.Then disaster struck. In September, the Madras Christian College Magazinepublished an article entitled “The Collapse of Koot Hoomi,” in which its author,Rev. George Patterson, revealed that the Masters and the “phenomena” associatedwith them were fake. Koot Hoomi himself was a cloth dummy, or, on occasion,someone dressed like him. That someone was Alexis Coulomb. Emma Coulomb had madethe dummy herself. Unfortunately, in a fit of pique, after being unceremoniouslybanished from Adyar, she destroyed it. But the letters she had from MadameBlavatsky told the story. And now the Christian College Magazine was telling theworld. A Times correspondent picked up the account and cabled it to his officein London. When she got the news, HPB was staying in Elberfeld, Germany, withfriends, the Gebhards, working on what would become The Secret Doctrine. Sheimmediately wrote the Times denying the accusation, saying that aside from a fewlines here and there, the letters in question were not written by her. She leftGermany for England, and in London told reporters that she was on her way toIndia to sue the Christian College Magazine and clear her name. Olcott wasalready en route. On November 1, 1884, HPB, accompanied by the Cooper-Oakleys, aTheosophist couple, left for Liverpool, where they boarded the S.S. ClanDrummond, heading for Port Said. There they were met by C. W. Leadbeater. Thegroup spent a few days in Cairo, gathering information about the Coulombs. Theyhad, it appears, a history of extortion and general underhandedness, or so atleast HPB had discovered. She had cabled Olcott: “Success complete. Outlaws.Legal proofs.” HPB was confident she could trump her old friend. But when shefinally arrived in Adyar in December, she found another worry. Richard Hodgson,whom she had met while in London, had been sent by the SPR to investigate thephenomena associated with the Masters. He couldn’t have come at a worse time.He had arrived two days earlier and was refused entry to the “occult room” byDamodar; it was, after all, part of HPB’s private chambers, so his reluctance isunderstandable. Then when HPB arrived, Hodgson asked to see the shrine. Damodarexplained that it had first been removed to his room, and then inexplicablyburned by Hartmann. The hole in the wall from her room to the occult room wasalso plastered over. If the Coulombs had fixed things so that HPB would appear afake, the board’s actions after discovering this had only thrown fuel on thefire. Subsequent conversations between HPB and Hodgson led Blavatsky to believethat his attitude was hostile. She was correct. In essence, Hodgson bought theCoulombs’ story lock, stock, and barrel, and when his report was finallypublished the following year, he concluded that Madame Blavatsky was, amongother things, “one of the most accomplished, ingenious, and interestingimpostors in history.” She was also most likely a Russian spy.43[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText282]• • •BUT BEFORE HODGSON’S REPORT was made known, HPB had other problems to deal with.Even though she believed she had sufficient evidence to clear her name and thatof the Masters, at the TS convention that year it was decided that taking thematter to court was not a good idea. Several reasons were given for theirdecision, but the central one, aside from the timidity of the committee incharge, was that the case would give their enemies an opportunity to “injure thecause of Theosophy,” and that, if asked questions about the Mahatmas that theMahatmas had forbidden her to answer, HPB could be charged with contempt ofcourt. No doubt HPB felt plenty of contempt, and not only for the legal system.She fumed, but Olcott and the others held firm. Then the Colonel left for a tourof Burma, leaving his chum on her own. She fell ill and, as in Philadelphia,felt she was near death and made out a will. But once again, a visit from MasterMorya revived her. He gave her a choice: She could die now and enjoy awell-deserved rest, or live a few more years and complete The Secret Doctrine,which she had begun during her stay in Paris. Yet the stress and scandal wereproving too much, and the fact that she wasn’t allowed to defend herself incourt must have drained her already depleted reserves.General H. R. Morgan, whom HPB had met in Ootacamund and who had witnessed the“precipitated” mending of a broken saucer at Adyar, had declared publicly thatthe “Coulomb letters” were forgeries.44 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText283]Madame Coulomb’s solicitor threatened a libel suit, but he stood firm, and sherelented. But why would she, if the letters were genuine? Perhaps one reason isthat, had she sued him, the letters would have been produced in court, whichwould have given the defendants an opportunity to examine them. They never were,nor were any of the so-called “incriminating” passages ever made available topublic scrutiny.45 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText284] Hodgson himselfrefused to show HPB the ones he had in his possession, and she never had anopportunity to examine the “evidence” against her. The “incriminating” lettersthemselves have vanished—much like the supposed “dummy” of Koot Hoomi—and tothis day it has never been proved that Blavatsky wrote them.46[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText285]Ill, weary, and abandoned, Blavatsky nevertheless remained fearless and wouldhave taken on an army to clear her Masters’ names, and her own. By this time, inaddition to the “incriminating” letters, Emma Coulomb had also produced apamphlet outlining in detail HPB’s nefarious acts, which included, among otherthings, the claim that she had had illegitimate children in Cairo.47[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText286] And Hodgson seemed to have taken it ashis mission not merely to examine HPB’s claims about the Masters and phenomena,but to turn her Hindu allies against her. (In fact, he never investigated anyphenomena, merely gathered reports about them from others.) Through his efforts,HPB became a liability to Adyar, and many felt the society, at least in India,would be better off without her.No doubt Blavatsky’s fiery temper would have worked against her had she gone tothe courts on her own, and she only relented when Olcott threatened to resignfrom the society if she did. Her own departure would be a blow, but withoutOlcott, everything she had spent a decade working toward would collapse. Herdoctor had in any case ordered her to avoid any excitement and to find “perfectquiet and a suitable climate” in order to recover. That meant Europe. So for asecond time, Madame Blavatsky said farewell to an adopted home. After resigningfrom her office as corresponding secretary, on March 31, 1885, accompanied byHartmann, a Hindu recruit called Babaji, and a visitor to Adyar named MaryFlynn, HPB left India for good. By this time, her health was so poor that shecould not use the gangway and had to be hoisted on board in a wheelchair."},{"pageContent":"NINESECRET DOCTRINES ON THE ROADHPB and her party landed at Naples on April 12, 1885 (some sources have April23), but Italy was only the starting point of a new life of wandering. Shestayed briefly at the Hotel del Vesuvio in Torre del Greco, an apt perch for sovolcanic a character, with a view of the Bay of Naples and Mount Vesuvius, butfound the place cold and uncomfortable and was eager to move on. The essentialthing was to find somewhere congenial to work. All she had left now was tofinish The Secret Doctrine. Working on that kept her alive. She had turned downan offer from her Russian publisher, Mikhail Katkov, to write exclusively forhim, a deal that would have “put yearly 40,000 francs at least” in her pocket.1[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText287] She certainly could have used the money,as she was now dependent on a small pension from the TS for her needs. But, aswith the offer to do a follow-up to Isis Unveiled, Master had said no; she hadto concentrate on her real work. Where best to do that was the question. Shewanted to avoid any of the European capitals; all she needed, she told Sinnett,was a warm, dry room. She decided to move to Würzburg in northern Bavaria, as itwas near to Nuremberg and Heidelberg, where KH had once lived. She wanted to“remain in the shadows,” but being solitary was always difficult, and she foundherself flooded with guests. Her only helper now was Babaji—the others in herparty had left—and he was little use with visitors and correspondence. AnotherOlcott would have helped, but the chums had taken separate paths. HPB wrote toher friend Mary Gebhard in Elberfeld about her plight, and Mary suggested to afriend, the Swedish Countess Constance Wachtmeister, that she delay her proposedtrip to Italy and visit HPB in Würzburg.2 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText288]The countess had already met HPB in London the year before, at Sinnett’s house,where she had also met Mary Gebhard. She had joined the TS in 1880 after readingIsis Unveiled. She had been interested in Spiritualism but found Theosophy arevelation. During a later meeting with HPB in Enghien, Belgium, Blavatsky hadtold Wachtmeister that within two years she would devote her life completely toTheosophy, a prediction Wachtmeister strongly doubted. Now it seemed to havecome true.When the countess wrote HPB proposing a monthlong visit, Blavatsky refused,saying she was too busy working to receive guests. Yet when Wachtmeister wasabout to leave for Italy, a telegram arrived. It was from HPB. She had changedher mind and the countess was to come immediately. The tactic, if it was one,again reminds us of Gurdjieff, who regularly changed his plans at the lastmoment. Wachtmeister went, and until Blavatsky’s death, she remained herconstant companion.According to the countess, Blavatsky was a hard worker. HPB rose at six, and wasat her desk by seven, where she worked until one, when she had a brief lunch,and was back at work until seven P.M. To relax she played Patience (solitaire)or read magazines and newspapers, mostly Russian, or the occasional Frenchnovel, and was in bed by nine. And like Olcott and Hiram Corson, Wachtmeisterbecame privy to HPB’s peculiar method of composition. Again Blavatsky seemed tocarry an enormous library in her head. Wachtmeister speaks of the “poverty ofher travelling library,” and of “manuscripts . . . overflowing with references,quotations, allusions” that couldn’t be accounted for by the books on hand.3[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText289] On one occasion, HPB asked her to verifya passage that she had taken “astrally” from the Vatican Library. Wachtmeisterhad a friend with a relative in the Vatican; he verified the passage, evenmentioning that the two words HPB had got wrong were nearly indecipherable inthe original text.4 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText290]Wachtmeister was also witness to another aspect of HPB’s character that againreminds us of Gurdjieff. Already, at her first meeting, Wachtmeister hadexperienced difficulties and delays in getting to HPB that she later realizedwere part of a “probation,” something other followers of Blavatsky alsoencountered.5 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText291] Now, in Würzburg, she sawthat she had been “a petted child of fortune,” and that her late husband’spolitical position—he was minister of foreign affairs—had given her “a prominentplace in society.” “It took me a long time to realize the hollowness of what Ihad hitherto looked upon as being the most desirable objects in life,” shewrote, “and it required much training and many a hard battle with myself beforeI could conquer the satisfaction in self which a life of idleness, ease and highposition is sure to engender.”6 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText292] As HPBtold her, a great deal had to be “knocked out” of her, and no doubt living withBlavatsky did precisely that. “The knowledge of Self,” the countess wrote, “wasgradually acquired by those who lived in daily contact with her.” Accounts byfollowers of Gurdjieff, who made things uncomfortable for everyone around him,say practically the same thing.It was a difficult time for the countess’s teacher. While at Würzburg, HPBreceived Hodgson’s report, and when she did, the effect was crushing. The karmaof the TS had fallen on her, she told the countess in despair, and now she hadto pay for the “cursed phenomena,” which she only produced to “please privatefriends and instruct those around me.” She told her friend to leave “before youare defiled by my shame. . . . You cannot stop here with a ruined woman.”7[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText293] “Letters,” Wachtmeister wrote, “came incontaining nothing but recrimination and abuse, resignation of fellows, andapathy and fear.” And those who didn’t resign were “paralyzed . . . all theywanted . . . was to keep quiet and out of sight, so that no mud should be thrownat them.” Babaji and Mohini both turned against her, but one of the hardestblows came from T. Subba Row. He broke with his teacher, saying she had broughtshame upon India and had betrayed its deepest secrets to the unworthy. She was,he said, “guilty of the most terrible of crimes. You have given out secrets ofOccultism—the most sacred and the most hidden. Rather that you should besacrificed than that which was never meant for European minds.” By this time,Subba Row had moved to a more fundamentalist position, arguing that the Mastersand their knowledge belonged to Hindus alone.It was a painful recrimination, but Blavatsky agreed with him. She said her pathwas one of suffering, and in one sense she was glad that Hodgson’s “exposé” hadmade her a “trickster and imposter” in the eyes of many. It that way, she told acorrespondent, “the whole burden falls upon me, as the Masters are made out tobe myths. So much the better. Their names have been desecrated too long and toomuch.” If necessary, she told Sinnett, she would “proclaim publicly that I alonewas a liar, a forger, all that Hodgson wants me to appear” in order to “screenthe real KH and M from opprobrium.” She was on the “way of blame” and sheaccepted it.Yet Subba Row’s complaint was not that HPB was a fraud, as the Hodgson-Coulombaccusations argued, and as Babaji, Mohini, and others now believed, but that shedivulged “things most sacred and holy that had never been known to the profanebefore.” It was a criticism she herself made of Sinnett, whose books “thrustoccultism and its mysteries into the teeth of a prejudiced unprepared public.”8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText294] Yet this was exactly the concern of the“right wing” occult groups we met in Chapter 5, who argued against disseminatingoccult knowledge freely, and of Koot Hoomi, who refused Sinnett’s request tohave a copy of The Pioneer “precipitated” to London on the day of itspublication. It is also, since time immemorial, the charge brought againstinitiates who divulge holy secrets to the uninitiated. Blavatsky’s fiercelydemocratic temperament compelled her to share what she knew with anyone whoshowed a serious interest in it. She may have been wrong in this, and she mayhave been in many ways a poor judge of character. Many she let close to herproved, as Alice Leighton Cleather said of Sinnett, “inherently incapable” ofunderstanding her.9 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText295] We can chalk this upto HPB’s essentially trusting nature, which is not the temperament associatedwith fraudsters and confidence men, who are fundamentally suspicious of others.But it did cause her a lot of trouble.• • •A DETAILED DISCUSSION of the Hodgson Report warrants more space than I can grantit here. Since its publication in December 1885, it’s been subject to numerouscriticisms, pointing out its flaws, omissions, prejudice, and bias, and arguingthat Hodgson’s claim that HPB’s “real object” in her Masters and phenomena was“the furtherance of Russian interests” in India, was itself motivated by his ownloyalty to the Crown.10 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText296] Through herRussian publisher Katkov, Blavatsky did have connections to influential Russianswho were interested in the idea of a “Russian Asia,” as K. Paul Johnson’sresearch has made known. And she did make remarks that could be read assupportive of Russia’s designs on the subcontinent—but could also be read inother ways. Yet the trigger for Hodgson’s conviction that she was, after all, aRussian agent, was her concern over the movement of Russian troops inAfghanistan, which seemed to presage a possible invasion of India. Such adevelopment would, she told Hodgson, “be the death blow of the society.” Hodgsonread—or misread—this remark as a “blind,” to obscure her “real” feelings forsuch an action. As Sylvia Cranston remarks, Hodgson “could not imagine that herreaction was one of genuine concern for the welfare of the TheosophicalMovement.”11 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText297] This suggests Hodgson hadalready made up his mind that HPB was a spy, and was on the lookout for“evidence.” But Blavatsky was no more interested in a “Russian Asia,” than shewas in a “British” or “Hindu” one, and she remarked on more than one occasionthat, although the British Raj was bad for India, the Russians “would be athousand times worse.”12 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText298] Like her Masonicantecedents, her vision was international—global, we would say—and concerned abrotherhood of humanity, not of Russians, Englishmen, or Hindus.It’s to be expected that friends and followers of HPB would naturally defend heragainst accusations of fraud, but perhaps the most damning blow againstHodgson’s report came not from a Theosophist, but from the SPR itself. In 1986,a century after Hodgson’s report appeared, the SPR issued a press releaseannouncing that “Madame Blavatsky, Co-Founder of the Theosophical Society, WasUnjustly Condemned,” and declaring that the validity of Hodgson’s work was “inserious doubt.”13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText299] Vernon Harrison, aforgery expert and past president of the Royal Photographic Society, examinedHodgson’s work and concluded that Hodgson was “prepared to use any evidence,however trivial or questionable, to implicate HPB,” and “ignored all evidencethat could be used in her favour.” “His report,” Harrison argued, “is riddledwith slanted statements, conjecture advanced as fact or probable fact,uncorroborated testimony of unnamed witnesses, selection of evidence anddownright falsity.” And he concludes that “The Hodgson Report is not, as hasbeen widely believed for more than a century, a model of what impartial andpainstaking research should be: it is the work of a man who has reached hisconclusions early on in his investigation and thereafter, selecting anddistorting evidence, did not hesitate to adopt flawed arguments to support histhesis.” One result of Harrison’s efforts is that the SPR itself has disclaimedresponsibility for Hodgson’s work, in effect saying that the Society did notinvestigate HPB, only Hodgson, and that he is solely responsible for hisconclusions, a somewhat Jesuitical way of sidestepping blame for any possiblemistakes. (It is also a means of smoothing over differences between theTheosophical Society and the SPR, both of which share more than a few members.)This maneuver does, however, seem to affirm the remark by Leslie Price, a memberof the SPR’s Library Committee, that “any writer or speaker who says the SPRexposed Madame Blavatsky is only exposing his own ignorance.”14[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText300]Unfortunately, this disclaimer has not filtered down to many researchers outsidethe Theosophical fold. In her otherwise brilliant account of the SPR, GhostHunters, Deborah Blum makes no mention of its retraction of Hodgson’s report,and applauds it as his “demolishing a medium’s reputation.”15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText301] The idea is not that Vernon Harrison’sinvestigations vindicate HPB completely, a claim some HPB supporters themselvesreject, and which we shall return to further on. But it does, I think, show theflaws and prejudices in it. In terms of the British justice system, Harrison’s“evidence” would be enough to warrant HPB at least a retrial, and would verylikely support a verdict of “unproven” against the charges of fraud, rescindingthe earlier one as “unsound.” Blum’s book, however, does make clear one of themotivations at work in Hodgson’s “exposé”: the fear members of the SPR had ofbeing seen as “gullible dupes.”16 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText302] InNatural and Supernatural, Brian Inglis makes the same point: that for much ofits history, the SPR adopted a highly defensive attitude and was determined toshow that it wouldn’t be fooled by any fraudulent activities, resulting in anoverly critical and suspicious approach to its material. Given the reductive,dismissive, materialist science of the time—which is still our own—this isperhaps understandable, but it argues that on many, perhaps most occasions, theSPR and its agents began their investigations with the determination that theywould not be “fooled.” This suggests that they also began them with thesuspicion that the mediums under investigation were, more than likely, out tofool them, which is hardly an unbiased attitude. Inglis points out thatHodgson’s investigation of the medium Eusapia Palladino was also highlyflawed.17 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText303] Ironically, in the end, Hodgsonhimself came to believe in the reality of spirit communication.18[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText304]• • •IN 1886, HPB decided to escape Würzburg’s summer heat and move to Ostend, on theBelgian coast. The countess was in Sweden on business, and HPB was accompaniedby Emily Kislingbury, an English Theosophist she knew from the early days in NewYork. Kislingbury had read Hodgson’s report and was so outraged that she came tohelp. In Cologne, Rudolf Gebhard met the party and they decided to spend a fewdays in Elberfeld, but practically on arrival HPB slipped and sprained her ankleand was bedridden for two months. Her sister, Vera, arrived, and by July theyhad moved on to Ostend, where Vera left to return to Russia. Here HPB was aloneuntil the countess arrived at the end of August, and she spent her time workingon The Secret Doctrine. By this time it was extremely painful for her to walk,and she only felt well when she was sitting and writing.19[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText305]When Countess Wachtmeister arrived, the two decided not to return to Würzburgbut to stay in Ostend, where they took a spacious suite, which included a piano,on the rue de l’Ouest. For exercise, the countess wheeled HPB along the seafront in a “bath chair,” a kind of early wheelchair. Here they were visited byTheosophists from England, among them Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland.Kingsford’s own health was always poor, and she would die two years later frompneumonia after getting caught in the rain on the way to the Pasteur Institutein Paris. Another visitor, Friedrich Eckstein, a Viennese Theosophist, was afriend of Rudolf Steiner, at that time a Goethe scholar. It was through Ecksteinthat Steiner read Sinnett’s Esoteric Buddhism.20[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText306] Work on The Secret Doctrine continued,although HPB’s fussiness over materials caused some problems. The ink in Ostenddidn’t meet her standards and, as she had years before in Russia, she developedher own. She was apparently so successful that she built up a small business.When a poor woman came to their door asking for money, finding her pocketsempty, Blavatsky is said to have given her the deed to the business. An item ina Russian paper also gave HPB some amusement. In the fall of 1886, the St.Petersburg newspaper Listok ran an article entitled “The Mysterious Hand,” inwhich Madame Blavatsky’s “astral hand” was said to have saved a critic of herwork from being crushed by a roof that had collapsed after being struck bylightning. Blavatsky herself had no recollection of the event, and her auntwondered if one of the Masters was involved. Even without her participation, itseemed stories of her miraculous powers were still making news.A more significant development was a conversation HPB had with her Master aroundthe New Year, in which she was informed that the TS was going through its own“probation,” a “final and supreme trial” that would determine its future. Herown destiny was a choice between returning to India to die, or forming a newschool of “true Theosophists,” which she would run alone, and in which she wouldgather “as many mystics as I can get.” She could do it there, in Ostend, orelsewhere, even in London. Oddly, some of her visitors from England werecontemplating just that. Bertram and Archibald Keightley, two Cambridgegraduates, told her of their dissatisfaction with the London Lodge. A “deadness”had come over it, which they felt her presence would dissipate. They were alsounhappy with Sinnett’s approach; he was determined to make Theosophy anupper-class pursuit, an idea he had tried in India, and they, like Blavatsky,believed it should be available to everyone. Not surprisingly, Sinnett himselfwas opposed to her coming to London. By this time, his Incidents in the Life ofMadame Blavatsky had appeared, a work that more or less begins the“disinformation industry” around her. Too some extent it helped rehabilitate herreputation—it got some good reviews—although John Symonds thought it “one of theworst biographies ever written,” a judgment some readers may share.21[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText307] (Certainly some of Sinnett’scontemporaries did: Alice Leighton Cleather believed it aimed “at destroyingentirely the bona fides of HPB,” and portrayed her as an “ordinary medium, and afraudulent one at that.”22 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText308]) But it alsosparked renewed interest in the Coulomb-Hodgson scandal. Blavatsky herself washalfhearted about the project, on which she collaborated with Sinnett, and wasagain unhappy with its accounts of her contact with the Masters and hisobsession with phenomena. Sinnett was by this time determined to be an esotericsource on his own, and having the “old lady” around again would only causetrouble.Yet trouble was exactly what HPB wanted. She accused Sinnett of leading theLondon Lodge into a state of “lethargy,” and predicted that within another yearit would be “covered over with moss and slime.”23[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText309] She, however, was a rolling stone, andwhether he liked it or not, she was heading across the Channel. Other members ofthe London Lodge practically begged her to come; she was touched by their needand consented. Her plan was to leave Ostend for London at the end of March, andstay through the summer. Countess Wachtmeister had decided to sell her propertyin Sweden, and would join her after that. But then another crisis appeared.Blavatsky had lamented her fate to the countess repeatedly. She was “traduced,slandered, not by strangers, but by those . . . most attached to me, and whom Ireally love.” She was “tired of life and the struggles of that stone ofSisyphus” and was “wretched because . . . there is not a corner on this earthwhere I could be left to die quietly.”24 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText310]Perhaps some angel heard her. Just before she was to leave for England, HPB wasfound unconscious in her chair. She had been feeling “drowsy and heavy” duringthe day, and a doctor diagnosed kidney malfunction. Wachtmeister brought in a“sister of charity,” but she brandished her crucifix and told HPB it was not toolate to repent, and was little help. Mary Gebhard fared better, but HPB wasunable to stay conscious, and a Belgian doctor remarked that he “had never knowna case of a person with kidneys attacked as HPB’s were, living as long as shehad.” The countess said that her friend had been “compelled to remain in a formwhich should have disintegrated two years previously in Adyar,” a remark thatagain reminds us of Gurdjieff.25 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText311] AshtonEllis, a London doctor and Theosophist, was called in. He massaged her organs,which seemed to help. But everyone thought the end was nigh, and agreed that sheshould once again make out her will. She did, and left “everything” to thecountess. When a lawyer contested this, Mary Gebhard pointed out that“everything” wouldn’t have covered her funeral expenses.That night, the countess could smell “the peculiar faint odour of death,” andHPB herself told her friend that she was glad to die, and that “Master would lether be free at last.” It seems he had other plans. When Wachtmeister woke thenext morning—having fallen asleep during her vigil—HPB was sitting up in bed,asking for breakfast, apparently completely recovered. The Master had come toher in the night, she said, and had given her yet another choice: Die here inOstend or live a few more years and finish The Secret Doctrine. According toWachtmeister, the doctor could only repeat, “But she should be dead.” Blavatskyherself asked for coffee and cigarettes.• • •THE LONDON BLAVATSKY sailed to in May 1887 was the London of gaslight, QueenVictoria, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and, shortly after shearrived, Jack the Ripper.26 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText312] Her healthwas not good, and at Dover, after the crossing from Ostend, she had to becarried out of her cabin and onto the train. HPB wasn’t the only thing that hadto be carried. Blavatsky rarely traveled light—Wachtmeister speaks of thenumerous packages that accompanied her in railway carriages—and to this burdenwas added the growing manuscript of The Secret Doctrine, which, at this point,was a three-foot-high stack of densely written pages. Bertram Keightley recallsthat HPB worked until the very end, and that no sooner was some item packedaway, than she demanded it be unpacked so she could check a reference.This nonstop writing carried on almost immediately after they arrived atMaycott, the cottage of the Theosophist Mabel Collins in the London suburb ofNorwood, where HPB spent her first months in England. Collins, a traveler,novelist, and journalist, is known today as the “scribe” of the Theosophicalclassic Light on the Path, published in 1885. The place was small—HPB comparedthose living there to “herring in a barrel”—and Blavatsky’s few visitors had tosit on her bed. Relations with Mabel Collins, too, were not the best. UnlikeHPB, Collins led an active sex life, which included lesbianism, and at one pointHPB berated her for carrying on affairs with two Theosophical recruitssimultaneously. Yeats tells the story of how Blavatsky, displeased by Collins’spromiscuity, berated her, insisting at length that, in order to achieveinitiation, one must crush the animal nature and live in chastity, to which sheadded with perfect timing, “but I cannot permit you more than one”—lover, thatis. A more serious fracture occurred when Collins, caught up in a leadershipfeud within the society, retracted her statement that Light on the Path was“dictated” by one of HPB’s Masters—Hilarion Smerdis, to be precise—and that sheherself was only their channel.27 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText313] She nowtook full credit for the work, casting doubt on the Masters and HPB. Blavatskyretaliated by calling her a “mystical vampire,” and making statementsinjudicious enough to prompt a libel suit.28[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText314] When HPB’s lawyer showed Collins’scounsel a certain letter—whose contents remain unknown—the suit was dropped;until the end, HPB had a curious habit of getting into these legal disputes,which only wasted her time and drained her energies. Collins was eventuallyexpelled from the society.29 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText315]In September 1887, HPB moved on to the Keightleys’ home at 17 Landsdowne Road,in London’s Holland Park. By this time, the Blavatsky Lodge of the TheosophicalSociety had started, and many from Sinnett’s group left to join it. One of itsfirst acts was to start a magazine, Lucifer, which HPB edited, and whose title,as mentioned earlier, suggests her self-image as a kind of “fallen angel.”(Predictably, the Anglican Church had it banned from newsstands.) An early issueannounced HPB’s new “zero tolerance” policy toward phenomena. As in the past,phenomena were only accepted as “miracles, works of the Devil, vulgar tricks, orperformances of ‘spooks’”; now she would have no part in them. Instead, she wasonly interested in teaching ideas. “An occultist,” she wrote, “can producephenomena, but he cannot supply the world with brains, nor with theintelligence . . . to understand and appreciate them.” It was now time, shesaid, to “let the ideas of Theosophy stand on their own intrinsic merits.”30[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText316] Blavatsky had a nondogmatic approach toediting; she even serialized Franz Hartmann’s satiric novel The Talking Image ofURUR, which poked fun at Theosophists and referred to HPB herself as“mediumistic poll-parrot.”One thing she intended to stand on its own intrinsic merit was The SecretDoctrine, the towering pile of which she now handed over to the Keightleys toclean up. They were told to “do what you like with it.” Given the size andchaotic state of the manuscript—it was, Bertram Keightley remarked, “withoutplan, structure, or arrangement”—this was a dangerous suggestion. It was, theKeightleys believed, a great philosophical work, but careful revision would beneeded because as it stood now—literally—it was, as Countess Wachtmeistercommented, “another Isis Unveiled, only far worse.”31[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText317] As Wachtmeister politely understated, HPBwas “constitutionally . . . unfitted for the task of orderly and patientexposition of her teachings.”32 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText318] TheKeightleys took it in hand and arranged for a typist—brave soul—to make a cleancopy. When they finally managed to get a coherent text to the printers, HPB’schanges were relentless. She racked up a three-hundred-pound bill for correctingproofs—a huge sum those days—and had the compositor “tearing his hair out inblank dismay.”33 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText319]At Landsdowne Road, HPB received many visitors, and on Thursday nights theBlavatsky Lodge held its meetings there, basically an informal Q&A session withthe Madame. Alice Leighton Cleather remembered a “double drawing room” in which“a stout, middle-aged woman” (Blavatsky was fifty-six) sat at a card table,playing solitaire. Her rooms were filled with Indian souvenirs and other exoticbric-a-brac, a kind of encore of the Lamasery. She told Cleather that she workedtwenty-four hours a day: “in this body all day, in another one, all night.”34[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText320] She told Yeats, another visitor, the samething. “I write, write, write,” she said, “as the Wandering Jew walks, walks,walks.”35 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText321] Yeats thought she had an “airof humour and audacious power,” and some of her remarks suggest it was probablyfun being around her. Yeats recalled that her cuckoo clock “hooted” at him,although it seemed clearly broken. After explaining that she had mistaken himfor a visitor who thought the earth was flat, she told him not to break herclock. (Wachtmeister speaks of a similar clock with “streams of electric light”radiating from it.36 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText322]) When Yeats remarkedon her card playing, she replied “a person of genius has to do something; SarahBernhardt sleeps in her coffin.”37 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText323] Hedescribes her sitting at a table covered with green baize—the material coveringa pool table—on which she would scribble occult symbols in chalk. She was“impatient with abstract piety” and had little time for fools. She told onegullible devotee that the earth was shaped like a dumbbell, and that anotherglobe was stuck to it at the North Pole. Another was informed that “Yes, youhave the divine spark within you, and if you are not very careful you will hearit snore.”38 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText324] But there was wisdom, too.“Nothing mattered but what happened in the mind,” she told the poet. “If wecannot master the mind, our actions are of little importance.”39[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText325] Another visitor was her old chum, theColonel, who believed that “the fact of her being alive at all was in itself amiracle,” a sign, perhaps, that the kind of mastery she spoke to Yeats about wasin her grasp.• • •THE FALL OF 1888 saw some momentous developments in Blavatsky’s work. One wasthe founding of what she called the Esoteric Section of the TS. An announcementfor this appeared in Lucifer. The Esoteric Section, it said, would focus on “thedeeper study of esoteric philosophy,” and its direction and leadership would besolely in the hands of HPB.40 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText326] Itsactivities and material were to be kept secret. Blavatsky wrote a series ofconfidential instructions that were copied—not printed—by members anddistributed to others. There was a screening process and only serious applicantswere considered. According to one member, “tests” included visits by a Master onthe “inner planes.”41 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText327] Blavatsky said thatthe reason she started the Esoteric Section (or ES)—encouraged in the idea by W.Q. Judge—was that there was a great deal that she could not communicate, eitherin Lucifer or The Secret Doctrine. Out of those who joined, if she could “placeon the right and true path half a dozen or so,” she could die happy.42[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText328] Here was her attempt to fulfill theMaster’s wish that she form a new school of “true Theosophists” with as “manymystics as she could get.”The general aim of the ES was to “prepare and fit the student for the study ofpractical occultism, or Raj Yoga.” This did not mean, however, learning how toproduce phenomena or developing magical powers. Except under specialcircumstances, these were forbidden. What was aimed at was “knowledge of SELF,of the psycho-physiological processes (taking place on the occult plane) in thehuman body generally,” which demanded control and discipline of the “lowerpassions” and the “PERSONAL SELF.” HPB herself, she said, was only themouthpiece for the real head of the section, which was one of the adepts,although applicants were advised not to worry about which one that was, as itreally didn’t matter. What was important was that all work was done under theoccult law which guaranteed that one receives enlightenment insofar as onedeserves it. This depended on the applicant’s ability to assimilate theteachings and make them part of his life, his work for humanity, and theUniversal Brotherhood, not for personal gain.43[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText329]Not many made the grade, at least in the beginning. In the first group of“Instructions,” Blavatsky reminded members of the “strange law in Occultism,”which ensures that, as soon as one pledges oneself to the path, “everythinglatent” in oneself rises up and confronts one. All vices, vanities, sensuality,and ambitions that we normally keep under wraps appear more powerfully thanbefore, and one is compelled to kill them before taking another step. It was anidea she borrowed from Bulwer-Lytton, who speaks of the “Dweller of theThreshold” in Zanoni, and which Rudolf Steiner would also use, and in morerecent times appears under the Jungian notion of “the shadow.”44[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText330] HPB felt compelled to remind herprobationers about this, as, she lamented, “in the last three months . . .several of the most promising candidates have failed ignominiously.”45[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText331]HPB’s “Esoteric Instructions” begin with a detailed discussion of the axioms“know thyself” and “as above, so below,” in their relation to cosmic and humananatomy.46 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText332] But for many, the othermomentous, more exoteric development of this time was really quite esotericenough. In October 1888 volume 1 of The Secret Doctrine appeared; volume 2followed that January. As a commercial publisher couldn’t be found, with moneyfrom the Keightleys and with the countess at its head, the TheosophicalPublishing Company was formed. A first run of five hundred copies sold out onsubscription—what we today call “pre-order”—and another printing did the same.But if readers of Isis Unveiled found HPB’s first major work tough going, thissecond magnum opus was even more daunting. It was more mammoth than itspredecessor; even so, it was “only quite a small fragment of the EsotericDoctrine known to the higher members of the Occult Brotherhoods.” But itscontent was baffling. Even HPB herself said that reading it “page by page . . .will only end in confusion,” a remark that could apply to other esoterictomes.47 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText333] Some, however, may think thatreading it in any way will do that, and perhaps we cannot blame them.The Secret Doctrine purports to be a commentary on stanzas from the mysteriousBook of Dzyan, an unknown text written in an unknown language, Senzar, which, weknow, HPB learned, along with English, while studying with Koot Hoomi. It is the“old book” she refers to at the beginning of Isis Unveiled and it is the sourceof the Eastern and Western “wisdom traditions” that have come down to us. Whatthe two volumes of The Secret Doctrine, “Cosmogenesis” and “Anthropogenesis,”amount to is a cosmic history of man and the universe. The “Rounds,” “Root” and“Sub” races of the Mahatma Letters and Sinnett’s Esoteric Buddhism appear again,but now in complex detail, and it’s unfortunate that some of HPB’s remarks aboutthe merits of different races, both contemporary and ancient, are what mostpeople know about The Secret Doctrine, if they know anything about it at all. Inour hypersensitive age, this isn’t surprising; we are quick to judge others byour own contemporary views, however anachronistic that may be. Yet the fact thatsome of Blavatsky’s ideas were picked up by outright racist thinkers, and thatTheosophists used the swastika, an ancient sun symbol, decades before the Nazisdid, clearly doesn’t help.HPB was undoubtedly a “child of her time,” and race was an idea central to muchnineteenth-century thought, hers included. It’s not surprising that some of herremarks about “Sub Races” elicit a cringe. But she can’t be held responsible forhow some outright racially oriented occultists misused some of her ideas. Theseideas themselves, in fact, form only a small part of her total worldview, andappeared in their more extreme form only after her death. I have no doubt thathad Blavatsky been alive at the time, she would have fought fiercely todisassociate Theosophy from this abuse, just as she did from any other.Perhaps the most well-known example of this racist appropriation is the“Ariosophy” associated with Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, whicharose in Austria in the early twentieth century, in the years leading up toWorld War I. Guido von List was a Viennese poet, journalist, mountaineer, andoccultist devoted to reviving German paganism through the mystic power of theancient runes. In 1902, following a cataract operation, List was near-blind foreleven months. During this time he had a vision of the “Armanen Futharkh.” Thiswas an “alphabet” of eighteen runes—ancient German letters—which, he said,opened his “inner eye.” In The Secret of the Runes (1906) and other books, Listpromoted “Armanism,” a völkisch, “Aryan,” pan-Germanic philosophy, based on theancient worship of the “sun-kings,” the priestly caste of the Ario-Germanicnation. List drew many admirers, one of whom was Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, anex-Cistercian monk, who was also, with Franz Hartmann and many others, a memberof the Guido von List Society. Liebenfels, also Viennese, started a magazine,Ostara, named after the German pagan goddess of spring. Inspired by the KnightsTemplar and German paganism, and borrowing elements from Theosophy, Liebenfelspromoted a racial, anti-Semitic occultism, which he called “Ariosophy,” the“wisdom of the Aryans.” This was centered on the belief that “blue blond” Aryanswere Gottmenschen, “God-men,” natural masters of the earth, with the “lowerraces” and “dark skinned beast men,” their natural subjects. In 1904, Liebenfelspublished a book, Theozoologie, arguing this point in detail and suggesting thesterilization and elimination of the sick “sub-men.” (Oddly, in his “inspired”text The Book of the Law, “dictated” to him in the same year by theextradimensional being “Aiwass,” the magician Aleister Crowley was receivingvery similar advice.48 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText334])One regular reader of Ostara was an unemployed artist named Adolf Hitler, whosubsequently left Vienna for Munich. There, in 1918, a German-Turkish occultistnamed Rudolf Sebottendorf started the Thulegesellschaft, or “Thule Society.”“Thule” is a mythical city beyond the North Pole, in a land of mild climate theGreeks called “Hyperborea,” “beyond the north wind,” a name Blavatsky herselfwould borrow. The Thule Society was a German-Aryan heritage “study group” withradical right-wing anti-Semitic leanings, and its outlook was influenced by Listand Liebenfels. It was very successful and attracted some important figures,such as the evolutionary philosopher Ernst Haeckel, whose ideas influenced bothC. G. Jung and Rudolf Steiner. Another member was Rudolf Hess, who would becomea high-ranking Nazi. One thing the Thulegesellschaft, the Nazis, and theTheosophical Society undeniably had in common was the swastika. It appears onthe Thule emblem, emblazoned with a dagger, and also in the “Theosophical seal,”along with, it should be said, an Egyptian ankh, a Star of Solomon, theOuroboros Serpent, and the Sanskrit symbol for the mystic sound Om.Another member of the Thule Society was Anton Drexler, who in 1919 started theGerman Workers Party (DAP). Although Hitler himself did not join the ThuleSociety, he did join Drexler’s organization, and in due time this became theNational Socialist German Workers Party, or Nazis, for short. Another reader ofOstara was Dietrich Eckart, Drexler’s colleague, who took Hitler under his wingand, perhaps more than anyone else, was responsible for initiating his rise topower. Later, when the National Socialists were in control, both Liebenfels andSebottendorf tried to claim credit for the Führer. Hitler took Ostara off thenewsstands and banned Liebenfels from publishing, and he had Sebottendorfarrested. The links between Hitler, the Thule Society, Liebenfels, List, andmuch more form the essence of “occult Nazism,” by now a staple genre of modernesotericism.49 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText335]But whatever we may think of Blavatsky’s ideas, she cannot be held to accountfor the way in which List and Liebenfels may have used some of them, nor forwhatever “trickle-down effect” their work may have had on subsequent events inGerman history, if any. In many ways, Blavatsky is in the same position that thephilosopher Nietzsche occupied, before serious scholars cleared him of his ownappropriation by the Nazis, a false association it took some time to dissolve.Someone needs to do the same for HPB; the taint of “racist” clings to her whileher more positive influence—on, for example, someone like Gandhi, which we willlook at shortly—is usually ignored. As I’ve tried to make clear in this book,paramount on Blavatsky’s agenda was the formation of a Universal Brotherhood, anidea that appealed to Gandhi, and which is not, I think, on most racist agendas.And it should also be clear that two white Westerners living among, learningfrom, and celebrating Hindus, Sikhs, and Sinhalese, while avoiding their Anglobrothers, is not particularly racist either.50[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText336]• • •LIKE ISIS UNVEILED, The Secret Doctrine does not admit of easy summary, and thereader daunted by its length should try Michael Gomes’s excellent abridgement.51[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText337] It establishes, Blavatsky tells us, threefundamental propositions, any one of which provides much food for thought. Theyare: 1. The existence of one absolute Reality, which precedes all manifestation and transcends our ability to say anything meaningful about it. This is the sunyatta, or “void” of Mahayana Buddhism, the “Neti-Neti,” “not this, not that” of the Upanishads, the “negative theology” of Meister Eckhart, and the Ungrund of Jacob Boehme. It is, in essence, the “rootless root” of everything. 2. The eternity of the universe as a “boundless plane,” in which an irrevocable “law of periodicity,” the “ebb and flow” of creation/destruction is ceaselessly at work, bringing worlds into manifestation and passing them out of it. 3. The identity of every soul with the Oversoul, a universal aspect of the unknown root of being, which compels all souls—or “monads”—to take the evolutionary journey through all conditions and states of existence, an encore of HPB’s earlier reference to the Cabalistic aphorism “a stone becomes a plant; a plant, a beast; a beast, a man; a man, a spirit; and the spirit, a God.” This means that each of us—not our “personality” but our “individuality”—passes through all forms of existence, until we achieve complete union with spirit.Existence itself, HPB tells us, oscillates between the days and nights ofBrahma, manvantaras being the cosmic days, and pralayas the cosmic nights, eachof an incalculable length of time. In the beginning there was absolutenothingness, rather like the state of nonexistence cosmologists postulate beforethe “big bang.” Then the vibrations of eternity waken to new life and theprimordial essence separates itself into seven Rays that shape the universe.These Rays are really intelligent beings, the Dhyan Chohans. Through the energyof Fohat, they fashion a new cosmos, eternity being “the playground ofnumberless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappearing.” Our world is theresult of a kind of cosmic condensation, stellar matter passing through a kindof whirlwind, collecting into nebulae that will become our solar system.The earth, as mentioned, goes through seven Rounds, and during these, differentbeings are created. The first Root Race lived on a continent called the“Imperishable Sacred Land,” and were formed of pure spirit, as were the secondRoot Race, the Hyperboreans, who inhabited a land near the North Pole, which atthat time had a mild climate. The third Root Race lived in Lemuria, fragments ofwhich remain today as Australia and Easter Island. During the fourth Round,higher beings descended to earth, and the beginnings of our physical bodiesappeared, as did the separation of the sexes. The fourth Root Race appeared onAtlantis; they had bodies and senses like ours, and were masters of technologyand had psychic powers. The Atlanteans, however, had a taste for “black magic”and some unusual sexual appetites: A union between Atlanteans and certain “sheanimals” resulted in gorillas and chimpanzees. Some Atlanteans were giants andwere responsible for ancient sites such as Stonehenge, but they abused theirpower and knowledge and sank into decadence as Atlantis itself sank into thesea. Fleeing their lost world, some Atlanteans traveled to what we know asEgypt, others to America, and started civilizations there.52[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText338] But they were soon outstripped by thefifth Root Race, the Aryans. The sixth Sub-Race of the fifth Root Race—each RootRace is subdivided into seven Sub-Races—were, according to HPB, being born inher time on the western shore of the United States, with another Sub-Race toappear sometime before the Aryans themselves meet the fate of theirpredecessors. The aim of these vast cycles of civilizations and races ismankind’s ultimate flowering in a Seventh, and final, Root Race.This, clearly, is the most general of outlines, and there is, of course, muchmore. I applaud in advance the intrepid reader who goes to the source. My onebit of advice is that, if we read The Secret Doctrine as literal “truth”—as someFundamentalist Christians read the Bible—we may be doing it a disservice. Iprofited from it most by seeing it as Blavatsky’s attempt to create a new mythfor the modern age, or as a huge, fantastic science fiction story, somethingalong the lines of Olaf Stapledon’s Star Maker.• • •NOT SURPRISINGLY, most critics of the book point out that both Senzar and TheBook of Dzyan are unknown to scholars—or anyone else—and most likely have theirorigin in Blavatsky’s own fertile mind. Max Müller thought The Secret Doctrine arehash of badly digested Hinduism and Buddhism. The Cabalist scholar GershomScholem thought The Book of Dzyan was based on the Sifra Di-Tseniutha, a“pompous” Zoharic text.53 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText339] A contemporaryBuddhist scholar has called HPB’s work “a melee of horrendous hogwash . . . thatany Buddhist or Tibetan scholar is justified to avoid . . . ,” more or less thestandard take.54 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText340] Yet not all scholarsagree. The sinologist Giovanni Hoffmann believed that the “Stanzas of Dzyan”originate in the Book of the Secret Correspondences (Yu-Fu-King) of thefourth-century Taoist Ly-Tzyn.55 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText341] AndBuddhist scholars David and Nancy Reigle argue that Blavatsky’s The Book ofDzyan is based on the Tantric Books of Kiu-Te.56[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText342]As with so much else about HPB, the debaterages.One reader of The Secret Doctrine who recognized its importance was thejournalist, editor, and spiritualist W. T. Stead, friend of Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells, and later one of the fatalities of the Titanic. Stead met Blavatsky atLandsdowne Road and was impressed. When The Secret Doctrine appeared, he askedAnnie Besant, then a notorious freethinker and atheist, to review it; none ofhis other writers would touch it. Besant was a political firebrand; havingalready been arrested for supporting birth control, she was also a key activistin the “Bloody Sunday” and “Match Girl” demonstrations of 1887 and ’88. When shereceived Blavatsky’s book she was doubtful, but as she read, “the disjointedfacts were seen as part of a mighty whole, and all my puzzles, riddles,problems, seemed to disappear”; her review, which appeared in The Pall MallGazette on April 25, 1889, was positive.57[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText343] One writer suggests Besant fell intoTheosophy on the rebound of a failed romance with Shaw.58[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText344] Whatever it was, with a fellow socialistwho had also turned to Theosophy, Besant visited HPB. Besant noted HPB rollingcigarettes, and that the talk was “worldly,” nothing mystical. As she was aboutto leave, HPB turned to her and said, “Oh my dear Mrs. Besant, if you would onlycome among us.” Her timing was perfect. Besant melted and did come among them,so much that she later became the head of the TS, and in that capacity wasinstrumental in India winning its independence from the Raj, a tale I tellelsewhere.59 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText345] Besant’s conversion frommilitant progressive to Theosophical aspirant was so complete that she evenprovided HPB with her last place of residence, at least on this earth.But perhaps HPB’s most celebrated visitor from this time was Mohandas Gandhi,who described Theosophy as “Hinduism at its best.”60[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText346] Gandhi first came into contact withTheosophy in London, in 1889, when he was studying law and generally trying toadapt himself to Western, specifically British ways.61[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText347] He believed, as many educated youngIndians did at the time, that his people should give up their old ways, andstrive to be like the English. He met the Keightleys—whom he refers to as two“theosophist brothers”; they were really uncle and nephew—and they introducedhim to the Bhagavad Gita.62 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText348] They werereading the popular Edwin Arnold English translation, and suggested to the youngstudent that they might read it in the original together. Gandhi was ashamed toadmit that he had never read it in the original, or any other language. But hewas determined to, and the Gita became the most important book in his life; helater said that his doctrine of Ahimsa [images/Ahimsa.jpg], “nonviolence,” wasrooted in it. In November 1889, the Keightleys took Gandhi to meet HPB; on thesame visit he also met Annie Besant, whose recent conversion to Theosophy wassomething of a scandal. Gandhi didn’t join the society then, but a year and ahalf later, on March 26, 1891, he became an associate member of the BlavatskyLodge.63 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText349] Gandhi later said that in 1893,during his time in Johannesburg, South Africa, although he did not join aTheosophical lodge, he had many discussions with Theosophists, attended readingsof Theosophical books, and even spoke at some of their meetings.64[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText350] Gandhi’s interest in Theosophy was in itsgoal of a universal brotherhood. He had little interest in its occult side, andin fact was rather critical of it, and his appreciation of the society changedover time. Yet reading Blavatsky inspired Gandhi to study Hinduism and to rejectthe notion, taught by Christian missionaries, that his nation’s religion wasmere superstition. It was this belief in the value of his own tradition thatsustained him throughout his career. Strangely, some of Gandhi’s last words wereof Theosophy. On January 30, 1948, the day he was assassinated, Gandhi’s journalHarijan published some of his reflections on Theosophy and on what he saw as itsoveremphasis on the occult. He had come to the conclusion, however, that“Theosophy is Hinduism in theory, and Hinduism is Theosophy in practice.”65[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText351] It was through Theosophy, too, thatGandhi was introduced to the work of Leo Tolstoy, which influenced him almost asgreatly as the Gita.66 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText352]Before HPB moved to Besant’s house at 19 Avenue Road in London’s affluent St.John’s Wood in August 1890—the lease on the Landsdowne Road house havingexpired—two more works emerged from her irrepressible pen. In The Key toTheosophy—a book Gandhi read—Blavatsky tried to answer the many questions shewas asked about the nature of man, karma, rebirth, Spiritualism, occultism,politics, and dozens of other things, in the sackloads of letters she received.It’s written in the form of questions and answers and should be, as HPB intendedit to be, the first stop for anyone wanting to grasp the essence of herteaching. Here the focus and clarity are sharp and the aim is to clear upmuddles and get the reader thinking for himself. After the often bafflingprofundities of The Secret Doctrine, Blavatsky’s Key has an air of soundthinking and healthy common sense. The emphasis is on individual effort. Afterdeclaring again that Theosophy is not a religion, she argues against prayer. It“kills self-reliance and encourages a still more ferocious selfishness andegotism,” because such petitions are directed to an “anthropomorphic God, who isbut the gigantic shadow of man, and not even of man at his best.” “This idea ofpassing one’s whole life in moral idleness, and having one’s hardest work andduty done by another—is most revolting to us,” she wrote, and in any case,“being well-occupied people, we can hardly afford to lose time in addressingverbal prayers to a pure abstraction,” “the inner man” being “the only God ofwhom we can have cognizance.” Speaking of our “constant failure to find anypermanent satisfaction in life which would meet the wants of our highernature”—a reflection that warrants repeated consideration—she tells her readersthat Theosophy is “essentially the philosophy of those who suffer, and have lostall hope of being helped out of the mire of life by any other means.” Theosophyitself is “the storehouse of all the truths uttered by the great seers,initiates, and prophets” and the “channel through which more or less oftruth . . . is poured out into the world.” Duty is key. It is “that which is dueto humanity at large, to our fellow men,” and the Theosophist himself “must be acenter of spiritual action . . . from his daily individual life must radiatethose spiritual actions [and] forces which can alone regenerate his fellow men.”“Selfishness, indifference, and brutality can never be the normal state of therace. . . . Progress can be . . . only attained by the development of noblerqualities,” and Theosophy is one means of accomplishing this.67[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText353]Such development was the theme of her last major work. Like The Secret Doctrine,The Voice of the Silence—a short, devotional text, unusual for Blavatsky—is atranscription of extracts from a work originally written in Senzar. It waswritten in France, in Fontainebleau, during a brief holiday from London. TheBook of the Golden Precepts, from which The Voice of the Silence is taken,forms, Blavatsky tells us, “part of the same series as that from which thestanzas of The Book of Dzyan were taken.”68[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText354] Its maxims can be found, she says, indifferent forms in Sanskrit works, such as the Upanishads, and the originalprecepts are engraved on those “thin oblong squares” which are “preserved on thealtars of the temples” attached to centers of Mahayana Buddhism, which shelearned about during her time in Tibet. Today, Mahayana is the largest and mostpopular school of Buddhism—Tibetan Buddhism being one offshoot of it—but inBlavatsky’s day it was still fairly mysterious, and the Voice of the Silence isone of the earliest works celebrating the “Bodhisattva path.” The film stars andother celebrities who practice Tibetan Buddhism today and who recognize theDalai Lama as a spiritual leader owe Blavatsky a debt of thanks. If ColonelOlcott brought Buddhism to Buddhists, his chum passed it on to practicallyeveryone else.Needless to say, as they do with The Secret Doctrine, most academic Buddhistscholars deny that The Voice of the Silence originates in anything other thanBlavatsky’s imagination. Yet some influential names disagree. D. T. Suzuki, whobrought Zen, a form of Mahayana Buddhism, to the West, said of The Voice of theSilence that “Here is the real Mahayana Buddhism,” and remarked that HPB had “insome way been initiated into the deeper side of Mahayana teachings, and thengave out what she deemed wise to the Western world.”69[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText355] Edward Conze, the noted Buddhist scholarand translator who brought some of the central texts of Mahayana Buddhism toEnglish readers, told the historian of religion Mircea Eliade that HPB was areincarnation of Tsong Kha Pa, the fourteenth-century Buddhist reformer andfounder of the Gelugpa school, to which the Dalai Lama belongs.70[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText356] In 1960, Christmas Humphreys, founder ofthe London Buddhist Society, published his influential anthology The Wisdom ofBuddhism, which included selections from The Voice of the Silence. And Lama KaziDawa-Samdup, whose translation of the Bardo Thödol W. Y. Evans-Wentz publishedas The Tibetan Book of the Dead, remarked that “there is adequate internalevidence” of Blavatsky’s “intimate acquaintance with the higher lamaistic[images/lamaistic.jpg]teachings, into which she claimed to have beeninitiated.”71 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText357]That Conze, Humphreys, and Evans-Wentz were all Theosophists suggests toacademic scholars that their testimony is biased. To nonacademics, it maysuggest that HPB deserves more credit than she’s received, a sentiment expressedby the current Dalai Lama when he wrote in a preface to a centenary edition ofthe work, “I believe that this book has strongly influenced many sincere seekersand aspirants to the wisdom and compassion of the Bodhisattva Path.”72[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText358]Yet even some HPB supporters argue that she wouldn’t have needed to have been inMahayana monasteries to have written it. K. Paul Johnson suggests that ColonelOlcott’s friend, the Bengal explorer and British spy Sarat Chandra Das, whotraveled in Tibet in the 1880s, brought back hundreds of manuscripts, and thismaterial could have been used by Blavatsky for her “Tibetan” writings.73[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText359] But for most readers, I think, thequestion of whether HPB gleaned her material firsthand or in other ways issecondary. What strikes them is the quality of the ideas and the sincerity withwhich she expresses them.• • •THE MAIN THEME of The Voice of the Silence is the contrast between two paths:that of compassion for others, and that of one’s own salvation. The followers ofMahayana Buddhism differ from those of Theravada—the form of Buddhism more wellknown in Blavatsky’s time—in their determination to forgo their ownliberation—their entering into Nirvana—until all sentient beings are liberatedas well. (For Theravada—or, as HPB calls them, Pratyeka—Buddhists, one can onlysave oneself, no others.) As mentioned, those who are on the threshold ofNirvana and choose to remain in the world (samsara) in order to help othersreach the same goal are bodhisattvas. The Voice of the Silence encourages itsreaders to do this. It isn’t an easy path. Like HPB’s own, it is a “way ofsuffering,” of “renunciation” and “woe.” As she said in The Key to Theosophy,“Our joys and pleasures teach us nothing,” “the final goal cannot be reached inany way but through life experiences, and the bulk of these consist of pain andsuffering,” something Blavatsky herself knew at first hand.74[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText360] Our earth, she tells us, is a “Hall ofSorrow . . . the dismal entrance leading to the twilight that precedes thevalley of true light.” Yet by walking this path—indeed, by becoming the pathitself—one becomes “a soldier in the army of those who work for the liberationor salvation of mankind.” One begins the path by seeking stillness anddetachment from the senses, by becoming “as deaf to roarings as to whispers, tocries of bellowing elephants as to the silver buzzing of the golden fire-fly.”One must, in essence, turn a blind eye to maya, the world’s illusion, and seekthe true vision that comes from within. It is then that we can choose betweenthe “doctrine of the eye,” whose followers ignore the sufferings of others asthey go about saving themselves, and the “doctrine of the heart,” whosefollowers embrace the suffering of others as their own. As her life suggests,HPB chose the “doctrine of the heart,” and whether she learned of it under thetutelage of KH, or from somewhere else, it was a path she had walked for atleast a decade and a half, and she knew its contours well.• • •HER TRAVELS ON IT, though, at least in her earthly form, were coming to an end.On Blavatsky’s last day at Landsdowne Road, the countess took her for a drive inHyde Park, where, according to one version of events, she had first met theMaster nearly forty years earlier. When she returned, she lamented that of themany people she saw promenading, there was “not a soul among them.” A trip toBrighton to take the sea air was her last out of London—the year before she hadhopped across the Channel for the last time, to see M. Eiffel’s tower inParis—and now she seemed to be withdrawing deeper within herself. Her spirits,though, were somewhat brightened by her new home, although not everyone washappy with it. Alice Cleather felt a foreboding at the move, feeling that AnnieBesant’s “masterful and somewhat intolerant personality” cast a pall over HPB’snew address, and did not bode well for the future.75[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText361] If Blavatsky herself felt any hesitation,she didn’t communicate it. As she wrote to Vera, the property on Avenue Road waslarge; she had a spacious room on the ground floor, and she was adding a lecturehall to it. It would fit three hundred people, and its polished wooden ceilingwas to be covered with allegorical paintings, symbolizing the world’s greatreligions and the zodiac. It was here that the new European Headquarters of theTS was inaugurated on July 3, 1890. HPB sat in a huge armchair before the nearlyfive hundred people who attended—many more than the room could hold, and amongthem the wife of the Archbishop of Canterbury—and listened to lectures bySinnett and Besant. Besant was quickly outpacing Sinnett in what would soonbecome an open contest for dominance in the society. She had been made presidentof the Blavatsky Lodge, while he remained head of the London Lodge alone. HPBherself was a “regular theosophical pope,” having been elected president of allthe European branches. As always, titles meant little to her, unusual amongoccultists, who generally like dazzling others with esoteric regalia.It was also here that HPB founded an esoteric group within her Esoteric Section.The Inner Group consisted of twelve members, six men and six women. Besant,Countess Wachtmeister, Mrs. Cooper-Oakley, Laura Cooper (her sister), AliceCleather, and Emily Kislingbury formed the feminine half; Archibald Keightley(his nephew Bertram was in the United States), Walter Old (also known as theastrologer “Sepharial”), Herbert Coryn, E. T. Sturdy, Claude Wright, and G. R.S. Mead formed the masculine. Some members changed over time. E. T. Sturdybecame skeptical and left. At some point, the London coroner, Mason, andoccultist Wynn Westcott, one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn, joined. (One of the Golden Dawn’s members would be Yeats, whose interestin ceremonial magic, which HPB loathed, drew him to it.) The Inner Group met ina special seven-sided room with a glass roof, connected to HPB’s bedroom. Eachwall was covered in a particular metal, and several “magical mirrors,” of thekind used by the Orphic Circle, decorated them. Only Blavatsky and the membersof the group were allowed to enter it. Here the group sat in front of HPB in asemicircle, always in the same seats, with the men to her right and the women toher left, and she directed them in meditation.76[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText362]Mead, who became HPB’s secretary and was a brilliant spiritual and esotericscholar in his own right, spoke of her at this time as a “lovable bundle ofinexplicable contradictions,” a “puzzling mixture of wisdom and folly,” a“sphinx clad in motley.”77 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText363] Although herenergies were flagging and her health in visible decline, HPB could still dishout lessons when necessary. When angry she would “blurt out anything that mightcome into her head.”78 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText364] On one occasion,she berated Mead before Charles Johnston—her niece Vera’s husband—over somepeccadillo and left Mead crushed. “That was her way, to rate her disciples inthe presence of perfect strangers,” Mead reflected. “It speaks volumes for her,that they loved her still.”79 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText365] As usual,there were plenty of “flapdoodles” around, and HPB let them know what shethought of them. On one occasion, when a visitor droned on about some pet idea,Blavatsky whispered audibly to Besant, “Oh Annie, can you please make him stop!”That was inimitably the Madame.While taking her Inner Group into esoteric depths, in her last days Blavatskydidn’t forget the outer world. In August, on her last trip outside of her newheadquarters, HPB traveled to London’s slum-ridden East End, scene of the Rippermurders and one of the poorest areas in the country. Crime, poverty,unemployment were rife—a decade later Jack London would write about it in Peopleof the Abyss—and Blavatsky was there to open a working-girl’s home. Here herbodhisattvic efforts were literally concrete, and the place would be managed byBesant and Laura Cooper. Nearly twenty years earlier, HPB had found herself intough circumstances in New York’s own East Side, and no doubt memories of thosedays came to her as she sat through the inevitable speeches. But after this, heronly excursions were brief forays across Prince Albert Road and into theRegent’s Park, wheeled in her bath chair by the countess. On one promenade, HPBnearly fell out of her chair when she bent down to help a child whom they almostran over.She kept working until the end. There was her Theosophical Glossary, a handyguide when plumbing the depths of Isis Unveiled or The Secret Doctrine, and shealso edited some of her occult stories, which an enterprising publisher shouldreissue; HPB is a find for fans of ripping occult yarns. But as Mead and othersfelt, it seemed she was arranging things and preparing her flock for herdeparture. Her followers saw less and less of her. Gone were the open evenings,with visitors coming and going, when mystical pearls were dropped amid theconfusion. She may have wished for quiet, now that she was getting ready to moveon, but even her last days were filled with controversy.One last legal squabble flared up. Elliot Coues, who had founded a branch of theTS in Washington, D.C., had kicked up a storm when, in league with MabelCollins, he started the story that HPB had somehow forced Collins to say thather Light on the Path had been dictated by the Masters. He then tried to getcontrol of the TS in the United States, and asked HPB’s help in taking itsleadership from W. Q. Judge. Blavatsky would have no part in this, and Coues waseventually expelled. Coues retaliated by publishing articles denouncingTheosophy as “humbug” and HPB as a “fraud,” and on July 20, 1890, The Sunpublished a long “interview” with Coues, in which he brought together everycalumny ever made against Blavatsky, including the charge that she had had anillegitimate child, this time with Prince Emile de Wittgenstein, a long-timefriend of her family. HPB replied in a letter in The Path, denying the chargesand denouncing Coues; in September, libel suits were brought against Coues andThe Sun. In the end, it turned out that Coues’s “interview” was written entirelyby himself, and on September 26, 1892, The Sun printed a retraction, statingthat there was no evidence supporting Coues’s statements. Coues gathered much ofhis “evidence” against HPB from her nemesis William Emmette Coleman (Chapter 6),who supplied Coues with the disinformation about her affair with PrinceWittgenstein, drawing on the dubious letter from D. D. Home to Dr. Bloede(Chapter 4). Coleman also gave Coues the originals of the infamous HPB-Coulombletters, which he had bought from George Patterson, the Scottish missionary whohad published them. The letters were never seen again, and are said to have beeneither lost or destroyed while in Coues’s possession. Although they are stillreferred to as having proved that Blavatsky was a fraud, their loss makes anydefinitive judgement about their authenticity impossible.80[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText366] Some HPB supporters suggest that Coues,realizing the letters were faked, destroyed them in order to conceal theforgery.Sadly, HPB never saw The Sun’s retraction, and so didn’t have the chance toappreciate her victory. By the time it was printed, she had been dead for morethan a year. The winter of 1891 was harsh, and in April, an influenza epidemichit London. Everyone at Avenue Road was struck, HPB especially. Besant was inAmerica, bringing HPB’s last message to the TS convention there. Blavatsky’stemperature ran high and she had trouble swallowing. Laura Cooper tended her.Mostly she kept to her bed, but on May 6 and 7, she got up and walked a bitaround her room. She rolled her last cigarette on May 7, for her doctor, whotold her she showed courage when he found her sitting in bed playing solitaire.The night before she died she was restless, but that morning, May 8, 1891, sheseemed to quiet a bit. But by 11:30, she had taken a turn for the worse. As shesat in her big armchair, Walter Old and Claude Wright knelt before her, holdingher delicate hands, something she would have erupted at had she been well—Meadtells the story of how she “cried out in genuine alarm” when a zealous devoteeonce tried to kneel before her.81 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText367] IsabelCooper-Oakley had relieved her sister and was supporting HPB’s head with herarm. By two that afternoon, the end was close. Her last words were, “Isabel,Isabel, keep the link unbroken; do not let my last incarnation be a failure,” atough admonition to take on. That enormous vitality and will, which kept hergoing when others would surely have been crushed, was finally coming to a halt.Her breath slowed, and she died so quietly that no one knew quite when ithappened.Or almost no one.The Colonel was in Australia at the time, and he had last seen his chum onDecember 26, 1889. He had just been in Japan then, where he had been asked tohead all the Buddhist sects in the country; only he, they believed, could bringthe different schools together. It was an honor he had to decline, as MasterMorya wouldn’t let him resign from the presidency of the TS. Now, on the otherside of the planet, he felt his old chum was sending him a message, telling himher path, at least in this world, was coming to an end. The next day, on May 9,Olcott wrote in his diary that he felt a foreboding of Blavatsky’s death, aremark he repeated in his entry on the following day too. On May 11, he got thetelegram letting him know. They both were a long way from Chittenden. The Masterhad finally set her free.May 8, the day of Madame Blavatsky’s death, is celebrated by Theosophists allover the world as White Lotus Day. Although practically nothing about her lifeis certain, one thing is for sure: The world is a far less interesting placewithout her."},{"pageContent":"TENTHE MASTERS REVEALED?HPB’s body was cremated at Woking Crematorium on May 11, 1891. As fire hadmarked her entry into the world—we remember her young Aunt Nadya setting thepriest alight at her niece’s baptism—it seems fitting that it should mark herpassage from it. Cremation was still a controversial practice at that time. Thefirst cremation in England had taken place at Woking only a few years earlier,in 1885—a decade after Baron de Palm’s in Pennsylvania—and the practice was onlydeclared legal the year before. So once again, the “old lady” was causingtrouble.Yet the real trouble HPB’s death had started had little to do with the disposalof her rupa, or physical body. As happens with practically all occult groups andsocieties once their leader dies, Blavatsky’s passing triggered a contest amongthe Theosophical higher-ups to assume her place in the hierarchy. What thismeant more than anything else was assuring one’s own contact with the Masters.Although those close to her knew that HPB’s authority was anchored in her ownpersonality, for rank-and-file Theosophists, having a direct line to Morya, KootHoomi, and the rest was what guaranteed one’s esoteric credibility. Now that HPBwas no longer around to pass on messages, who was going to fill the gap? TheColonel was still president of the TS and would remain so until his death in1907, when Annie Besant would succeed him. But his position had always been moreadministrative than spiritually authoritative, his own deep commitment toBuddhism and evident healing powers notwithstanding. Although attempts todislodge him from power were made, he remained relatively secure. Others,however, jockeyed furiously to get even the slightest advantage in the race toreach the Masters. The result was an exercise in what Alice Leighton Cleathercalled “the extraordinary pettiness and narrow-mindedness” of many of HPB’searly followers.1 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText368] For a society built onthe idea of a universal brotherhood, it’s most important members certainly had avery difficult time getting along.Sinnett, we know, had already tried to make direct contact with the “old lady’s”adepts, but had been rebuffed. With HPB’s arrival in London and the start of theBlavatsky Lodge, he had already felt that he was losing ground in his ownbackyard. And now it was clear that Annie Besant was in line for the throne. Shehad already been appointed co-editor of Lucifer and president of the BlavatskyLodge; with Blavatsky’s death, she became head of the Esoteric Section, too.Alice Cleather’s sense of an “impending disaster” accompanying Blavatsky’s moveto Avenue Road may have been a product of hindsight—her reminiscences of thetime weren’t published until more than thirty years after the event—but onewouldn’t have needed precognition to see that Besant would quickly rise to aposition of power. Whatever her Theosophical credentials, Besant was a woman ofaction and an inspiring speaker. And she was only in her early forties, so stillrelatively young. Theosophy has always seemed much more of a woman’s game than aman’s. Aside from Rudolf Steiner, who eventually broke away to start his ownmovement, the dominant personalities in Theosophy have been for the most partwomen. There’s HPB herself, Besant, Anna Kingsford, and later, Katherine Tingleyand Alice Bailey. Certainly there was Sinnett, Judge, C. W. Leadbeater, and ofcourse Olcott. But none of them had the personal power that HPB or Besant andthe others had.Yet although Besant clearly was a dominant character, that in itself wasn’tenough to fill HPB’s shoes. Alice Cleather could lament that “when HPB left us,there was no longer any possibility of direct communication with the Great Lodgeof Masters,” but not everyone agreed.2 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText369]One in fact who had other ideas was William Quan Judge, who had remained vicepresident of the society.When his fellow founders had relocated to India, Judge stayed in America,building up a powerful Theosophical section there, and publishing an importantjournal, The Path. Judge had got closer to HPB in her last years, and now, withher gone, he decided it was time to challenge Olcott for the society’sleadership. While acknowledging the Colonel’s valuable powers of organization,Judge put it out that he, on the other hand, was the “spiritual” heir of HPB,and that the decisions for the society’s future directions should lie with him.Initially he had support from Besant in this. During her trip to the UnitedStates—she was there when Blavatsky died—she and Judge had become good friends.Now, as head of the Esoteric Section—a development that Olcott had agreed to buthad never really liked—she was open to Judge’s criticisms of the Colonel, who,he said, was losing the spiritual plot with all his focus on administration.Judge should be the one to put the society back on its proper course, and toprove his point, Judge produced letters from the Masters more or less saying so.Besant even found one communication among her personal papers, informing herthat “Judge’s plan is right.” Besant was so impressed by this that, in August1891, at her farewell speech to the National Secular Society, given at the Hallof Science—she could hardly belong to a secular society and remain aTheosophist—she declared that HPB herself was sending her messages from thespirit world.3 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText370]Olcott had come to London to secure Besant’s support against Judge, and wasthere when she made this announcement. Besant may have been impressed by Judge’s“letters,” but not the Colonel. Every other time Judge had had communicationwith the Masters, it had gone through Olcott. How was it that Judge wascommunicating directly with them now? What made things even more suspicious wasthat the letters were stamped with Master Morya’s “seal.” But this seal had beendevised by Olcott himself, and had been given to HPB in 1883, but subsequently“misplaced.” Olcott threatened to expose Judge’s apparent fraud. Judge respondedby threatening to tell the truth about the Master’s seal, which most membersassumed was genuine, or at least made in Tibet.4[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText371]The two had reached a standoff, and this quickly descended into farce whenJudge, through the Masters, tried to convince Besant that if she went to India,Olcott would poison her. Perhaps convinced by Judge’s warnings, in 1892, Judgeand Besant plotted to force Olcott to resign, gaining support from KH, who wroteto Judge approving of their plan. Master Morya, however, disagreed, and toldOlcott to stay put.5 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText372] (We remember thatthe Masters disagreed at first about the Coulombs, so perhaps this difference ofopinions shouldn’t be surprising.) Olcott did resign briefly, but quicklyreinstated himself. The European Section seemed in favor of Judge, but they alsowanted Olcott to stay in power. The balance shifted in Olcott’s favor whenBesant visited him in Adyar in 1893, ignoring Judge’s warnings of certain death.Olcott won her over, and she initiated proceedings against Judge, charging himwith fraud. This accusation was eventually dropped because the committeeconvened to try Judge admitted that, as belief in the reality of the Masters wasnot incumbent on members of the society, there were no grounds for the charge offraud. Which is to say, one can only be accused of forgery if the existence ofthe genuine article is accepted, and the reality or not of the Masters issomething each Theosophist must decide for himself; it is not part of the rulesof the society. So Judge avoided charges of fraud through a loophole that putthe existence of the Masters—the raison d’être of the TS—in question. Thisabsurd situation wasn’t lost on the press, and in a series of articles entitled“Isis Very Much Unveiled,” the Westminster Gazette was not slow to point outthat the very letters Besant accused Judge of forging were those that shesolemnly told her audience at the Hall of Science had been sent to her by HPBfrom beyond the veil.Along with the questionable letters from Master M, Judge later claimed he hadmade contact with HPB via the psychic powers of the American Katherine Tingley.Judge met Tingley in a New York soup kitchen in 1894. Like Besant, Tingley hadthrown herself into a number of philanthropic efforts and was running thekitchen in support of striking workers. She was converted to Theosophy almostimmediately.Judge seceded from the main TS body in 1895, bringing his several thousandfollowers into the new Theosophical Society in America. He died in 1896, andTingley succeeded him as head of the American section. Like Judge, Tingley hadbig ideas, and on a visit to India, she arranged to visit one of the Mastersherself, a meeting she described in her book The Gods Await. She met HPB’s“Teacher,” as she calls him, in Darjeeling. He was dressed in a plain Tibetanstyle and was whittling a small wooden peg to be used by his chela in the yokefor his oxen. The Teacher told Tingley that “the atoms of the human body becomeweighed down . . . by the burdens of the mind,” but that his chela had achievedmental balance, simply by conscientiously plowing his field.6[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText373]Much as had happened between HPB and Anna Kingsford, but on a larger scale, fora decade, Tingley and Besant locked etheric horns in a relentless battle forTheosophical dominance. Tingley had renamed the American Section “the UniversalBrotherhood and Theosophical Society,” and set out on a worldwide tour to drawsupport for the new movement. Her crusade was not particularly successful, andBesant retaliated by embarking on a tour of her own, winning over severalthousand new recruits in the United States alone. Through the weird twists ofkarma, at one point Tingley actually purchased Besant’s old home on AvenueRoad—Besant had by now relocated to India. But Tingley’s real success was inestablishing what must be one of the earliest “alternative communities” inAmerica, her Theosophical “white city,” Lomaland, at Point Loma, San Diego,whose foundation stone was laid in 1897.Here the “Purple Mother,” as Tingley liked to be called, presided over aspiritual enclave that included education, the arts, architecture, agriculture,and other necessities for a self-sustaining, what we would call “off-the-grid”establishment, as well as her own version of Theosophical spirituality.Tingley’s eclectic taste in architecture—which included Muslim domes, Hindutemples, Egyptian gates, and Greek theaters—seems to have presaged the kind ofarchitectural extravagance that would be associated with Southern California inlater years, and her early communal farms made an equally lasting contributionby introducing the avocado to the Californian diet.7[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText374] One of Tingley’s closest allies was theSwiss-American Gottfried de Purucker, who went on to write several Theosophicalworks. Another was the pulp mystical adventure writer Talbot Mundy, whose works,such as Om: The Secret of Ahbor Valley, are full of Indiana Jones dash andTheosophical mysticism. (His novel The Nine Unknown is based on an ancientIndian legend of a secret society dedicated to preserving esoteric knowledgethat HPB herself would draw on.) Although initially successful, Lomaland slowlyground to a halt, mostly because of the lavish eccentricities of the “PurpleMother,” and it eventually came to an end following her death in 1929.8[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText375]Although Besant was the clear front-runner for the Theosophical throne, a directlink to the Masters was needed to make this a fait accompli. Following inTheosophical tradition, in order to secure this, Besant needed a man. In fact,one could say that behind every successful Theosophical woman was a competent,but less dominant man. HPB had Olcott. Anna Kingsford had Edward Maitland.Katherine Tingley had W. Q. Judge. In Besant’s case, it was Charles W.Leadbeater.Leadbeater is one of the most colorful and dubious characters in Theosophicalhistory and is perhaps best known as the man who discovered Jiddu Krishnamurti,himself a Theosophist saint until his rejection of the society in 1929. Pickedby Leadbeater as the incarnation of Maitreya, the avatar of the New Age,following his rejection of Theosophy, Krishnamurti went on to become aninfluential spiritual teacher, inspiring figures as different as the composerIgor Stravinsky and the physicist David Bohm. Leadbeater’s “discovery,” however,which involved his ability to “read” auras as well as his predilection for youngboys, led to charges of pederasty, as well as acclaim as the mentor of a new“world teacher.” At least twice before, Leadbeater’s enthusiastic tutoring ofTheosophical adolescents got him into hot water, and it was only Theosophy’shigh standing in India that saved him from a lawsuit, brought against him byKrishnamurti’s father, involving pedophilia and deification, unique in theannals of the Raj.Leadbeater, who was ordained in the Church of England in 1878, read Sinnett’sbooks and joined the TS in 1883. His enthusiasm led to his own attempts to reachthe Masters through a medium named William Eglinton, and when these failed heapproached HPB about it herself. She passed on his request and got a reply thatLeadbeater should accompany HPB on her return to Adyar. Leadbeater was among theaudience shocked by HPB’s appearance at the London Lodge meeting when she andAnna Kingsford faced off. During his voyage, Leadbeater claims that he had avision of Djwal Khool on board ship. It was the first of many such sightings, atleast according to Leadbeater. Leadbeater remained at Adyar, undergoing a crashcourse in Theosophy, Blavatsky style. Like Countess Wachtmeister, he endured hisprobation, and soon was learning the basics of clairvoyance from KH himself.After that, as Peter Washington puts it, “the Masters couldn’t keep away fromLeadbeater,” visiting him almost every day. HPB wasn’t pleased with her newchela’s progress. The Masters themselves had repeatedly insisted that she wasthe sole source of contact with them. Now this renegade clergyman was chattingwith them regularly. As we will see, more than anyone else, Leadbeater isresponsible for leaving the astral door wide open and for encouraging the kindof purely “spiritual” contact with alleged adepts that resulted in the plethoraof “ascended Masters” stuffing many New Age books today.Like Olcott, Leadbeater embraced Buddhism, and in Ceylon, he became the firstChristian minister to become a Buddhist. It was in Ceylon that he met a youngboy, Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa, and became so attracted to him that he more orless tried to kidnap him. He was only stopped by the boy’s father and hisrevolver, but when he explained that his intentions were purely pedagogical,Jinarajadasa’s parents allowed him to take the boy to England, where Leadbeaterpromised he would be educated. For all his adoration of the East, Leadbeater wasmiserable in Ceylon, and he had written to Sinnett asking him to find somecongenial work for him in London. Sinnett suggested he come and tutor his son,but another reason for the invitation was that he wanted to use Leadbeater’spsychic powers to contact the Masters. They had by this time stopped theircorrespondence and Sinnett was eager to start it up again. Sinnett hadapparently already tried other psychics and mediums but with little luck. For atime, Leadbeater taught Sinnett’s son, as well as Jinarajadasa and GeorgeArundale (the nephew of Francesca Arundale, whose guest HPB had been), but thensomething happened, and he was asked to go. That “something” remains unclear,but it seems likely that Leadbeater’s instruction included some doubtfulextracurricular activities. Both George Arundale and Jinarajadasa would laterbecome presidents of the Theosophical Society Adyar, the name adopted by Olcottand then Besant to differentiate their organization from Judge’s Americansociety.Leadbeater met Besant in 1890, and soon the two became close colleagues; bothwere much too formal to be “chums.” In some ways their relationship was thereverse of HPB’s and Olcott’s. In this version, it was Leadbeater who found sexbeastly—ironic, given his track record with boys. At least he had a paranoidaversion to women, and the only one he could stand any close contact with wasBesant. By 1895, Leadbeater and Jinarajadasa were living in Avenue Road, andwith HPB out of the way, the clergyman could let his psychic vision rip. He did,and through tutoring Besant herself—whose psychic abilities were less powerfulthan her oratory ones—she could join him on clairvoyant visits to the Masters.What followed was a series of books which more or less set the tone for post-HPBTheosophy. Through the Masters, Leadbeater and Besant journeyed to the earth’sremote past, visiting Atlantis and Lemuria. They traced the true life of Christ,discovering that he had actually been an Egyptian adept. Modern science was alsoopen to them, and in their book Occult Chemistry, the two explored the new worldof the atom, clairvoyantly entering into its complex structure. One book,Thought Forms, can be seen as the inspiration for abstract art. One of its mostimportant readers was the Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky, who was also a deepreader of Rudolf Steiner. Leadbeater and Besant’s descriptions of thoughts andtheir auras as “radiating vibrations” and “floating forms” inspired Kandinsky,who is commonly accepted as the first abstract artist, and led to his owninfluential work Concerning the Spiritual in Art.9[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText376]Besant and Leadbeater also journeyed into their and others’ past lives, tracingthe karmic connections of their fellow Theosophists through countless eons. Andthey also took more than a few peeks into the future. In one of them, Leadbeatersaw that a new “world teacher,” the Lord Maitreya—a coming bodhisattva—wouldsoon appear in human form, and he realized he should be on the lookout for him.Hence his delight when, on a riverbank near the Theosophical compound in Adyar,he saw Krishnamurti’s aura. Leadbeater had already pegged another boy, Hubertvan Hook, son of a staunch American Theosophist, as the avatar of the New Age,and had duly taken him under his wing, but apparently he was mistaken. WhatHubert thought about this is unclear, and one wonders how far he had gotten inhis instruction. This time, however, Leadbeater was certain, and Besant soonagreed. This was in 1909. In 1906, Leadbeater had been expelled from the TSbecause of a scandal involving some young Theosophical boys he had instructed inmasturbation. But all that had been forgotten now, at least by Besant.10[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText377]Sinnett and G. R. S. Mead, however, hadn’t forgotten it, and with some sevenhundred other members of the British Section, they resigned from the societyover Leadbeater. Sinnett continued to write; his posthumously published EarlyDays of Theosophy in Europe was one of the first books of Theosophical history.He died in 1921. Mead went on to become a respected scholar of Westernesotericism, his work inspiring figures as important as the psychologist C. G.Jung and the poet Ezra Pound. Following his departure from the TS, he formed theQuest Society, which promoted an eclectic approach to the study of religion,philosophy, and science, much as the early TS had. Although Leadbeater’s returnwas the trigger for Mead’s resignation, Mead had long been unhappy with what hefelt was Besant’s dictatorial style. He died in 1933.Besant and Leadbeater would call the Theosophical tune for the next two decades.Besant would also die in 1933, Leadbeater in 1934, but Theosophy itself wouldbottom out in 1929, when Krishnamurti famously dismissed his avatarship.Krishnamurti himself survived, however, and, as mentioned, went on to become aspiritual teacher in his own right. But there were many who felt that whateverit was Besant and Leadbeater were doing, it wasn’t Theosophy. With theirheadlong plunge into the akashic and easy access to the Masters—accompanied bywhat seemed an inexhaustible appetite for ritual and showy initiation—Besant andLeadbeater’s approach was very different from HPB’s, and those who rememberedthe “old lady” weren’t happy with it. A “Back to Blavatsky” campaign started up,arguing against what it saw as an unhealthy revisionism. Granted, HPB’s own linkwith the Masters wasn’t exactly transparent. But at least she had alwaysinsisted that they were real people, made of flesh and blood, existing here andnow in space and time, somewhere on the planet. With Besant and Leadbeater, theMasters had become something much more like gods, or certainly almost entirely“spiritual,” and their astral open-door policy suggested that practically anyonecould say they had chatted with the Masters on Venus or Atlantis the nightbefore, and there was little one could say against them. The result, asmentioned, was a string of increasingly godlike “ascended Masters” having littleor nothing to do with HPB’s original brotherhood.• • •THE IDEA OF “hidden masters” did not, of course, begin with Blavatsky. Althoughmany “occult histories” root it in dim ages past, for the modern period atleast, the notion begins in Germany in 1614. As we saw in Chapter 1, that year,strange documents known as the Rosicrucian manifestos appeared, announcing theexistence of a mysterious Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross. As we saw, when themany who tried to find and join the Rosicrucians could not locate them, theywere sarcastically nicknamed “the Invisibles,” and some Rosicrucian defendersclaimed they had decamped to Tibet. This idea of “invisible” adepts was laterreprised in the Freemasonry of Baron von Hund, with its Rite of StrictObservance to “unknown superiors.” Blavatsky had found tales of these mysteriousfigures in her great-grandfather Prince Pavel Dolgorukov’s library, and to themshe later added other accounts of enigmatic, powerful adepts. In Bulwer-Lytton’sZanoni, she met the figure of Mejnour, a Rosicrucian mage who had lived forcountless ages, and in Occult Science in India, by the Frenchman LouisJacolliot, she came across mention of the “nine unknown men,” who, Jacolliotclaimed, really existed in India and secretly influenced world events. Asmentioned above, these “nine unknown men” would reappear in pulp adventurefiction, but also in the best-selling The Morning of the Magicians by LouisPauwels and Jacques Bergier—the book that kick-started the occult revival of the1960s—and also as the source of some paranormal communications received by thepsychic Uri Geller.11 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText378]Post-Blavatsky, the idea of “hidden masters” took a dark turn in the work of theFrench occultist Saint-Yves d’Alveydre, who spoke of a mysterious, all-powerful“Sovereign Pontiff” who secretly rules the world from his subterranean kingdomof Agartha, mentioned in Chapter 3. As we saw, this notion of a subterraneankingdom of supermen, preparing to invade the surface, had already been exploredin Bulwer-Lytton’s early science fiction novel The Coming Race. It was fromAgartha and its Sovereign Pontiff that d’Alveydre developed his ideas about“synarchy,” a form of occult totalitarianism that d’Alveydre had some success inpromoting in the early years of the last century. The Traditionalist thinkerRené Guénon also spoke of Agartha and a “King of the World” who resides there.His ideas about both were inspired by the account of Agartha given in the Polishtraveler Ferdinand Ossendowski’s book Beasts, Men, and Gods, in which he speaksof legends of an underground kingdom in Mongolia, told to him by a Mongol guide.Tibetan Buddhism itself speaks of a hidden city, Shambhala, which the Russianartist, traveler, and Theosophist Nicholas Roerich tried to locate during twoexpeditions to the Himalayas in the 1920s and ’30s. Roerich claimed that atleast one of these journeys was overseen by Master Morya, and the TheosophistAlice Bailey also spoke of an “invisible brotherhood” living in Shambhala.12[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText379] Agartha and Shambhala also makeappearances in Pauwels’s and Bergier’s Morning of the Magicians.Other forms of “hidden masters” populate much of Western esotericism. TheHermetic Order of the Golden Dawn spoke of “Secret Chiefs,” and there is somespeculation that the origin of this term goes back to Baron Hund’s “unknownsuperiors” and the mysterious career of the enigmatic Rabbi Samuel Falk, aCabalist from eastern Europe who was at the center of an occult community inLondon in the 1740s.13 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText380] Aleister Crowley,an early member of the Golden Dawn who broke with it to start his own occultsociety, took a Besant-Leadbeater turn and declared that he had contacted aSecret Chief psychically in a hotel room in Cairo. He spoke of anextraterrestrial intelligence he called Aiwass, who, Crowley claimed, dictatedto him his notorious Book of the Law. How different Crowley’s “Aiwass” was fromrun-of-the-mill spirit communication is unclear, but many of Crowley’sfollowers, such as the late Kenneth Grant, also tried to establish contact withthis disembodied “Master.” Gurdjieff talked about the mysterious “SarmoungBrotherhood,” and the “inner circle of humanity.” Some, like his follower J. G.Bennett, traveled in Central Asia in search of these “Masters of Wisdom,”believing they had some link to present-day Sufi brotherhoods. Ouspensky,Gurdjieff’s most brilliant student, began his “search for the miraculous” bytrying to make contact with what he called “schools.” At first he considered“the possibility of a non-physical contact . . . a contact, ‘on anotherplane.’”14 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText381] Later, this idea of “schools”became “more real and tangible,” and with his meeting with Gurdjieff in a Moscowcafé, he believed he had finally found one, or at least someone who had. Afterbreaking with Gurdjieff, Ouspensky spent the rest of his life trying to reachthe esoteric source of his ex-master’s teachings. Sadly, he never did.15[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText382]One thing that differentiates HPB’s approach to her Masters from some of theseaccounts is that, regardless of whether they “really” existed or not, one soongrasps that, whoever Blavatsky is talking about, they are actual people.Although Blavatsky claimed to communicate with her Masters mentally, we neverhave the sense that the Masters themselves are “spirits” or “entities” or“higher beings.” They are men. Remarkable men, possessed of remarkable powers,with high aims and a noble mission, but men nonetheless. And if we accept thepossibility that they really did exist—putting aside the question of whetherthey really were Masters—one can’t help but ask: Who were they?Oddly, it seems that until relatively recently, no one, whether Theosophist orskeptic, tried to answer this question. Over the years, Theosophists more orless seem to have accepted Blavatsky’s account, and with the rise of Besant andLeadbeater’s neo-Theosophy, regarded the Masters as entirely spiritual beings,existing on the “higher planes.” Skeptics took the Hodgson route and regardedthem as sheer fabrications. One attempt to pin the Masters down—or at least oneof them—was made by Jean Overton Fuller. In Blavatsky and Her Teachers, Fullerprovides a list of dignitaries who accompanied the Premier of Nepal during hisvisit to Queen Victoria in 1850, and suggests that “Master Morya” was amongthese. Although HPB says her first physical encounter with Morya occurred inLondon in 1851 during the Great Exhibition, and not 1850, Overton speculatesthat either Morya returned to London the following year, or had simply stayed onto see the exhibition. It was one of the most important attractions of the timeand drew people from around the world, so it would not be unusual for ahigh-ranking Nepalese either to extend his stay in London in order to see it, orto return.16 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText383]Yet the most extensive and convincing investigation into the “real” identitiesof the Masters was undertaken by the Theosophical historian K. Paul Johnson. Hiswork remains controversial, but it is highly stimulating and, perhaps more thananything else, is responsible for a kind of “Blavatsky revival” taking place onthe Internet, with scholars, Theosophists, and simply interested readers,engaging in a lively and passionate debate. (Others involved in the “Blavatskyrevival” are Michael Gomes and Daniel Caldwell.) Whether or not Johnson isright, he has done HPB and Theosophy a great service by reinvigoratingdiscussion about her and re-evaluating her importance to modern thought andculture. If the “Back to Blavatsky” movement of the early twentieth centuryfailed to attract much attention, Johnson’s work may achieve what those stalwartdevotees of HPB set out to do.Johnson argues, in essence, that Blavatsky’s Masters were a combination of threethings: her youthful romantic fantasies of Rosicrucian adepts and Masonic“unknown superiors,” stimulated by her discovery of her great-grandfather’soccult library; her own fertile self-mythologizing; and her actual encountersduring her travels with a variety of men and women who, like herself, wereengaged in the pursuit and study of esoteric knowledge. Johnson does not commenton HPB’s powers, nor on how the Mahatma Letters could have been precipitated,and unless we decide that she had no powers and the precipitations were faked, Ithink we must keep an open mind about these. But, as HPB herself repeatedlypointed out, this is the least important aspect of her work, and, as we know,she herself regretted the attention her phenomena drew. I have no idea how shecould have made a teacup materialize in solid earth—if she did—not to mention abrooch in a pillow, or how she could perform some of her other phenomena, andmore than likely I never will. But I have, by now, stopped losing sleep over it.When you write books about the kind of people I do—Swedenborg, Rudolf Steiner,C. G. Jung—you start to accept strange phenomena as part of the territory.Johnson points out that HPB’s ideas about her Masters changed throughout hercareer. Who might qualify as a Master seemed rather fluid, ranging from thespirit guide “John King,” to the Egyptians Tuitit and Serapis Bey, to their lastincarnation in her Indian Mahatmas. We must remember that it was DamodarMavalankar, and not Blavatsky, who started calling the Masters Mahatmas.Blavatsky herself pointed out more than once that, although she herself receivedher training in Tibet, it was not the home of the Brotherhood, and that they hadbases across the globe. Blavatsky’s habit of providing prequels to her life atvarious times, that linked up her past activities with those of her present,gave the impression that Master M was one individual who was involved in herlife at different times over many years. Yet the possible candidates for MasterM include different people, involved with her at different times. “M” could havebeen the Italian radical Giuseppe Mazzini in London, Paulos Metamon in Cairo,and even the novelist Bulwer-Lytton: Each have been suggested as his “true”identity. We have even seen that she could be wrong about a Master. Beforearriving in India, Blavatsky believed that Swami Dayananda Saraswati was aMaster, or at least was working with them. But once she and the Colonel met him,she realized he wasn’t. And we’ve seen, too, that the Masters themselves couldbe wrong. Elbridge Gerry Brown, the editor of Spiritual Scientist, the journalthat published HPB’s “first occult shot,” turned out to be a dead end.“Master” seems a title of honor and respect that HPB bestowed on differentpeople throughout her life. I don’t doubt that she had an “inner” Master,something along the lines of a guardian angel, or Socrates’ “daimon,” who guidedher at difficult times and who first came to her in her childhood. Later, this“inner” Master, which I think we can associate with her accounts of a “doublelife” and a kind of “controlled multiple personality,” came to be linked to the“real-life” Masters she read about in her great-grandfather’s library. Then, asshe began her travels, she met people who so impressed her, that she regardedthem as Masters. We have met some of them in this book: A. L. Rawson, Max Théon,Agardi Metrovitch, Paulos Metamon. Whether they considered themselves Masters ornot—or whether anyone else did—isn’t the point. HPB did, and her contact withthem fueled both her romantic, adventurous spirit, and her omnivorous appetitefor knowledge.As Johnson says, HPB’s Masters were “real persons systematically fictionalizedin Blavatsky’s accounts.” This is not to say she “lied” about them, but thatthey became “Masters” in her eyes, and in this way, part of her ongoingself-mythologizing. Again, self-mythologizing does not simply mean lying; onlyan irredeemably literal-minded person would think so. But from an early age,Blavatsky was on a search, a quest, which she believed was guided by an innerdestiny, and at different points, different people came to her as guides,instructors, and role models. The philosopher Nietzsche remarked that “the greatman is the play-actor of his own ideal.” This means that in order to become whoyou want to be—which is who you “really” are—you have to pretend to be thatperson already. By believing in her quest, her mission, Blavatsky made it true.Part of this belief meant telling stories, “true lies,” an idea we will returnto shortly. In this sense it is pointless trying to discover which of theseveral accounts of Blavatsky’s first meeting with Master M is the “real”one—and it may be the case that Blavatsky purposefully changed her story inorder to get this point across, and not, as literal-minded skeptics might say,in order to “cover her tracks.” What is “real” is that she met Master M, he gaveher a mission, and she accepted it. The rest is “histery,” an awful coinage thatconveys the fact that HPB’s life was made up of more or less equal parts ofhistory and mystery, some of which I’ve tried to outline in this book. Whethershe met M in London or Ramsgate, in Hyde Park or on Waterloo Bridge is, in avery real sense, unimportant, although biographers and historians may wracktheir brains over it and rummage through more than a century and a half ofwreckage searching for clues. Writing this book, I’ve sometimes wondered if I amin the position of that visitor to Holland Park who was told by HPB in allearnestness that the earth is shaped like a dumbbell. I ask myself: Are all the“blinds,” tall tales, wild adventures, and improbable claims pointing tosomething else, and have I been too thick to see this?Johnson’s most controversial claim is that he is fairly certain of the identityof the two main Masters, at least for the period in HPB’s life when they weremost in public notice. These are, of course, Morya and Koot Hoomi. His suspectsare Maharaja Ranbir Singh of Kashmir, in the role of M; and Thakar SinghSandhawalia, founding president of the Amritsar Singh Sabha, a Sikh reformmovement, in that of KH. Johnson points out that in its early years, the TSfocused on the revival of Western occultism as a viable alternative to bothmaterialist science and dogmatic Christianity. Although HPB claimed that shealways had her eyes on India, it wasn’t until her arrival on the subcontinent’sshores that the TS’s focus shifted to the revival of Indian culture and thereform of Indian society; hence its early but mistaken union with the AryaSamaj. These concerns, Johnson argues, were motivated by HPB’s alliance withRanbir Singh, who supported her work openly, but, he argues, was also in asecret confederacy with her. Johnson’s argument is detailed, but according tohim, both Ranbir Singh and Thakar Singh Sandhawalia were committed to advocatingreligious brotherhood. In the maharaja’s case, his subjects included Muslims,Buddhists, Christians, and Sikhs, so the kind of religious tolerance promoted bythe TS was a political necessity for him. HPB, we know, was associated withdifferent progressive, if not radical, political movements, and the idea thatshe got involved with them in India too shouldn’t be too surprising. HPB lenther support to the Singh Sabha and to what Johnson calls “a network of Sikh andHindu maharajahs in a secret coalition opposing Christian missionaries.”17[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText384]Although HPB wasn’t a Russian spy, the British were right to be wary of her, asher “silent partners” in India did include powerful leaders who could maketrouble for the Raj. This comes through in the Mahatma Letters; at one point, KHinforms Sinnett that, at a signal from him, forces could be unleashed againstthe British and the “white race which subjugates and daily humiliates mine.” Italso makes clear why Sinnett was important to them. As an influential part ofthat “white race,” who had thrown his support behind their “agent”—HPB—he was anexcellent means, at first, of getting their message across. Johnson points outthat with Sinnett’s departure from The Pioneer and the failure of “the Phoenixventure,” the attempt to start a Maharaja-funded newspaper (mentioned in Chapter8), KH lost interest in the plan. KH/Thakar Singh Sandhawalia was also deeplyinvolved in a conspiracy to return his cousin, the disposed Dalip Singh, thelast Maharaja of the Sikh empire, from England to northern India as ruler of anindependent Punjab; and it is in his company that most accounts suggest thatBlavatsky has another meeting with Morya “in the house of a stranger” (Chapter2). The plan was thwarted by the British, but by this time, Johnson argues, theKH identity was of no further use to Thakar Singh Sandhawalia, and he drops outof view. Yet by then, A. O. Hume was on his way to founding the Indian NationalCongress, a movement he claimed was inspired by “advanced initiates.”18[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText385] Gandhi wrote of the early days of theCongress that all “the top congressmen were theosophists,” so it is not anexaggeration to say that Theosophy was a threat to the British in India afterall.19 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText386]Johnson is also controversial among Theosophists for his belief that Blavatsky,and to some extent Olcott, were involved in some deception with the MahatmaLetters. Not in the way that Richard Hodgson believed—although here, too,Johnson’s opinions have drawn much criticism. Johnson accepts that Hodgson’sinvestigation was flawed and that he was wrong to accept the Coulombs’ accountat face value. But he doesn’t believe, as some Theosophists do, perhaps rightly,that Vernon Harrison’s examination of Hodgson’s report exonerates HPBcompletely. In fact, Johnson argues that the whole “Tibetan adventure” was oneof Blavatsky’s “blinds,” and that during the time that she claimed she was inTibet, she was really in northern India. The “Tibet blind” was devised to drawattention away from her “real” Indian Masters in order to protect theiridentities, and it was a device she used even with her followers. But when firstthe Coulombs and then Hodgson drew unfriendly attention to them, Blavatskyrealized her Masters were in danger.Even earlier, Blavatsky had second thoughts about using the Masters as a meansof drawing recruits into her mission. In a letter to Franz Hartmann, she wrotethat when Olcott met a Master in Bombay, he “went crazy,” and that this startedan uncontrollable process of turning her Masters from real, if incognito, peopleinto “Gods on earth.” With each new meeting with a Master by new members, theirstatus grew, and Blavatsky must have realized that soon the whole game wouldexplode. But it was the Masters and the belief in them that were drawing peopleto Theosophy and, perhaps even more important, were giving many Hindus a renewedsense of self-esteem and cultural awakening. Hodgson’s conclusion that theMasters were a fabrication was difficult to bear, but it was better than theirreal identities becoming known, as the political repercussions could have beendisastrous, and Blavatsky was fiercely loyal. So she shouldered the blame, tookthe path of suffering, and protected the secret. Such, in a nutshell, isJohnson’s argument.My own feeling is that HPB’s Masters were in many ways what theseventeenth-century Rosicrucian author Johann Valentin Andreae called aludibrium, a Latin word meaning “serious joke.” Andreae was the author of TheChemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz, a strange alchemical documentpublished in 1616 following the first Rosicrucian manifestos. When word of theRosicrucians got out, a “Rosicrucian furor,” as the historian Frances Yatescalled it, broke out across half of Europe. If the tabloid press had been aroundthen, stories about the mysterious Rosicrucians would be turning up there, andthey would be “trending” heavily on the Internet and filling tweets onTwitter—as would Blavatsky’s Masters. As Olcott did when he met a Master, Europewent crazy for the strange, secret Brotherhood. Yet, soon this furor turnedsour, and “the Invisibles” became the target of ridicule and calumny.In order to protect the ideals that the Rosicrucians stood for, Andreae admittedthat, yes, the Chemical Wedding—and, by inference, the earlier manifestos—were akind of fiction. There were no literal Rosicrucians, but this wasn’t important.The fiction of a literal Brotherhood was a useful device to convey the ideas ofa “general reformation” at the heart of the manifestos. It also provided a modelfor how individuals, eager to help that “reformation” along, would act. Theywere the “true lies,” which enabled Nietzsche’s “great men” to be “play actorsof their own ideal.” The Rosicrucians of the manifestos may have never existed,but the people who were moved by the manifestos and inspired by their values,became Rosicrucians themselves. Two very important self-made Rosicrucians werethe English Hermeticist and physician Robert Fludd, and the Bohemian philosopherand educator Jan Comenius, “father of general education” whose pedagogicalideals are recognized by UNESCO in the Comenius Medal it awards for outstandingachievements in education.20 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText387] I write ofboth elsewhere.21 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText388]Andreae and his colleagues didn’t imagine their manifestos would generate thetumult they did, nor that they would lead to the rancor against the Rosicruciansthat quickly followed. Alarmed at this, he thought it better to say theRosicrucians were a kind of joke that got out of hand, and so diffuse thesituation. In this way, the ideas and beliefs informing the Rosicrucianexperiment could be salvaged, and put to use elsewhere, which is exactly whatAndreae did.22 [9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText389]I think HPB’s Masters were a ludibrium that got out of hand, a serious joke thatwent wrong, or at least caused as much trouble as good. After the Hodgsonaffair, HPB realized this and, as Johnson notes, began to soft-pedal both theMasters and phenomena. They had, in any case, served their purpose, andintroduced many people to a much needed alternative to a reductive, materialistscience, and a sclerotic, dogmatic religion. Sadly, in many ways, the Mastersthemselves soon became the source of a new dogmatism—or at least the ideas aboutthem that HPB had no control over did. Olcott wasn’t the only one to “go crazy”over the Masters, nor was he the only one besides HPB to have seen them “in theflesh.” Daniel Caldwell’s excellent collection, The Esoteric World of MadameBlavatsky, includes many eyewitness accounts of meetings with the Masters by awide range of people. I can only leave it to the reader to judge theirauthenticity.In one case it is possible that a too strong belief in the Masters may even haveled to tragedy. In February 1885, Damodar Mavalankar, having received permissionto join the Masters at their ashram—or so he believed—left Adyar en route forTibet. HPB later spoke of Mavalankar as someone who had “fully benefited” byTheosophy, and that he alone proved that the move from New York to India wasn’tin vain. Mavalankar held a unique position in the Coulomb-Hodgson scandal, beingsingled out by Emma Coulomb as one of HPB’s dupes and accused by Hodgson ofbeing one of her accomplices. Like many around HPB, his earnestness oftenoutshone his good sense, and some Theosophists, like Franz Hartmann, thoughtlittle of him. But he was undeniably dedicated, and he stood by HPB when otherHindus, like T. Subba Row, abandoned her. By April 1 he had reached Darjeeling,and on April 19, he met with a Tibetan lama who was to guide him to KH and M’smonastery. On April 23, he made his last note in his diary, saying that he washeading on alone from Kabi—a district in Sikkim—and that he had sent his thingsback with the coolies.That was the last official word from Damodar, and some months later there wereunconfirmed reports that his frozen body had been found in the snow. ColonelOlcott suggested that the “body” was really a maya, an illusion, created toleave a false trail, that is, a “blind,” an idea HPB agreed with. As withpractically everything else in this story, there is much debate about the fateof Damodar. In a letter of 1886, KH himself said Damodar had arrived but hadundergone severe trials, a necessary preparation for the work ahead, and wasrecovering. In a letter published in Lucifer in 1889, a sannyasin, Sriman Swamy,said that he had seen Damodar in Lhasa, where he was convalescing. Although HPBwas pleased to hear word of her chela, she denied he ever was in Lhasa, sayingthat this was another “blind,” thrown out to obscure his true location. She alsosaid that she had already received letters from him previously, acknowledginghis arrival, but these have not survived. By the 1930s, Gottfried de Purucker,Katherine Tingley’s second-in-command, was stating that Damodar was in Shambhalaworking with the other Masters in their secret sacred sanctuary. If this was thecase, it would be a terrific endorsement for “play acting one’s own ideal.”Here, Damodar not only reached the Masters, he became one himself, something infact that HPB believed was, fate willing, in the cards.23[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText390]The rest of us no doubt will have to settle for something less fantastic, andwith the amount of spiritual tourism in the Himalayas these days, the Mastersand their troupe have more than likely headed for less popular locations. InChapter 5, I spoke of C. G. Harrison’s strange idea—later repeated by RudolfSteiner—that for a time Blavatsky was held captive in “occult imprisonment,” andthat she was only set free by some Hindu mystics, to whom she was then indebted.Johnson makes the point that with the Coulomb-Hodgson scandal, HPB was in a wayset free from a different kind of “occult imprisonment,” and was then able tofollow her own path, no longer in thrall to her particular Masters at the time.Inarguably, her most creative periods were the times prior to and after heryears in India, when she produced Isis Unveiled, The Secret Doctrine, The Voiceof the Silence, and The Key to Theosophy, works by which, with the absence ofMasters today, her reputation must either stand or fall. With all due respect tothose who argue for its authenticity, how important it is that The SecretDoctrine is really based on the mysterious Book of Dzyan, and that this reallyexists, is debatable, a situation followers of Gurdjieff also find themselves inwhen they anchor the importance of his work in the “real” existence of theSarmoung Brotherhood. As someone who devoted some years to the Gurdjieff “work,”it never made a difference to me whether the ideas and disciplines I wasstruggling with came from a secret fraternity in Central Asia, or Gurdjieff’sown fertile and inventive mind. They were exciting and compelling, and that wasenough. In the end, I opted for Gurdjieff’s fertile mind rather than theSarmoung Brotherhood as their source. Others, I know, disagree.While questions about whether or not HPB was ever in Tibet, ever met “real”Masters, ever learned Senzar, and dozens of others will no doubt trouble all whotake her seriously, in the end what is important now are the writings she leftbehind, and what we can understand about her life. My own belief is that HPB wasone of the most creative synthesizers in modern thought, and that she pulledtogether an enormous wealth of ideas, observations, and speculations aboutourselves and the cosmos from a dizzying range of sources, and out of thisproduced at least two undeniable classics. If she did only this, it would beenough for us to owe her a debt of gratitude. Being one of the most adventurous,fearless, and indomitable women of the nineteenth century in the bargain makeswhat we owe her almost an embarrassment. Those around her had the benefit ofbeing exposed to her electric character, and many profited by the shocks—it waswith some accuracy that Rudolf Steiner described her as an “electrically chargedLeyden jar,” from whom “electric sparks—occult truths—could be produced.”24[9781101601389_EPUB-18.html#FNText391] I seriously doubt if CountessWachtmeister, G. R. S. Mead, or even Colonel Olcott thought getting the “secretdoctrine” down correctly was as important as being open to her teaching byexample. And, as most accounts show, at this she was surely a Master. If we goin search of her own Masters, more than likely we will not find them. But we maydiscover someone even more remarkable along the way: that “old lady,” “chum,”and tireless scourge of flapdoodle, the incomparable HPB."},{"pageContent":"Notes [images/Madame%20B%20Notes%20BMH_fmt.jpeg]INTRODUCTION: WHO WAS MADAME BLAVATSKY?1.

She first became interested in Tibet afterattending lectures on Eastern religions at the Paris Theosophical Society, andshe herself became a leading Theosophist. Like HPB, she worked and traveled asboth a musician and journalist, was a strong-willed young girl who came frombadly matched parents, escaped from a precipitous marriage only days after thewedding ceremony, and remained single for the rest of her long life. She died in1969, just short of her 101st birthday. Again like HPB, although separated andleading totally independent lives, her husband supported her throughout his lifeand financed her travels. Like HPB, she was deeply devoted to Tibetan Buddhism,wrote much about it, and embraced its belief in magic and mysticism, aphilosophy in evidence in her classic Magic and Mystery in Tibet (1931). Andlike HPB, she had detractors who claimed that she was never in Lhasa or Tibet,and that her accounts of her travels were pure fiction. Also like HPB, hertravels were motivated by a quest for “the unknown.” See Alexandra David-Neel,My Journey to Lhasa (London: Virago Press, 1988), the introduction by PeterHopkirk, pp. ix–xvi, and David-Neel’s own introduction, p. xvii.3.

[9781101601389_EPUB-11.html#FNNumber137] My own contribution to this murkybusiness came about after reading two books by the skeptical parapsychologistPeter Lamont. In The Rise of the Indian Rope Trick (London: Abacus, 2004),Lamont remarks that “Madame Blavatsky’s introduction to the spirit world was asa result of meeting the famous medium D. D. Home” (p. 61). He then refers to theletter from Home in which he laments HPB’s power over his poor friend the baron.Yet in a later book, The First Psychic (London: Abacus, 2006), a biography ofHome, Lamont makes no mention of this. In fact he makes no mention of HPB atall. One would think that, HPB being good copy, Lamont would include at least abrief mention of her in his book on Home who, according to his earlier book, wasso concerned about the illicit relation between HPB and his friend. But hedoesn’t. Why not?Lamont’s source for his remarks about Home and HPB is a pamphlet, “The Fraud ofModern Theosophy Exposed: A Brief History of the Greatest Imposture everperpetrated under the Cloak of Religion,” published in 1913. The title aloneshould tell us that its author, the stage magician and virulentanti-spiritualist J. N. Maskelyne, was not one of Blavatsky’s friends, andLamont himself—also a stage magician—refers to the work as “vicious.” In 1894,three years after HPB’s death, Maskelyne filled his Egyptian Hall in London withaudiences happy to pay to see a burlesque of Blavatsky and the famous MahatmaLetters. Maskelyne himself got Home’s remarks about HPB from the arsenal ofWilliam Emmette Coleman, an equally vehement anti-HPB polemicist. A closereading of Home’s letter suggests that a meeting between Home and Blavatsky isdoubtful—at no point does Home unequivocally say that he either met or sawher—and argues that Home was, at best, criticizing her at second hand. But if hedid not actually see HPB in Paris with his friend the baron, then the “evidence”for their supposed liaison is suspect, and Home may unknowingly be referring tothe affair between the baron and Nathalie Blavatsky, or perhaps purposefullyconfusing the two.When I wrote to Peter Lamont and asked why he left this very good story—or anymention of HPB at all—out of his book on Home, he replied very briefly that hedidn’t “recall any good evidence of them [HPB and Home] meeting,” and that he“probably took the Maskelyne source at face value.” Yet one might think thatafter repeating remarks about HPB in one book that he later discovered wereincorrect, he might make a note of this in the later book, which is specificallyabout the source of some of the earlier incorrect remarks. A footnote relatingthat he found no evidence that HPB and Home ever met, and that the story ofHome’s concern over Blavatsky’s lascivious designs on his friend was at bestdoubtful, would have done much to help unravel this knotted tale.CHAPTER FIVE: ANCIENT WISDOM FOR A MODERN WORLD1.

Like Blavatsky, Strindberg believed in higher intelligences that wereguiding him, what he called “the Powers.”11. [9781101601389_EPUB-13.html#FNNumber178] Crabtree, pp. 120–34.12.

Maria Carlsonargues that a letter supposedly written by Blavatsky in 1872 shows that sheoffered her services as a spy to the Russian government (Carlson, p. 316), yetmore than one researcher has questioned the authenticity of the letter.Blavatsky herself is said to have been more furious over Hodgson’s claims thatshe was a spy than about his supposed “exposure” of her fraud; this could betaken as an admission of guilt or simple anger at a falsehood. As did Gurdjieff,Blavatsky seems to have played fast and loose with her political allegiances,crossing sides, as it were, when it suited her “higher” purposes.

Although sheclaimed that the Master took one look at him and would have nothing to do withhim, she allowed him to visit her repeatedly—in Paris and in Würzburg—andimportune her with requests to teach him how to do phenomena, and suggestionsthat she become a Russian spy. It should have been clear early on that Solovyov,a writer of historical fiction, was a sensation seeker out to make a name forhimself, unlike his more well-known brother, Vladimir Solovyov, who was aserious spiritual philosopher; see The Meaning of Love (West Stockbridge:Lindisfarne, 1985), War, Progress, and the End of History (West Stockbridge:Lindisfarne, 1990), and The Crisis of Western Philosophy (West Stockbridge:Lindisfarne, 1996). But HPB was either too busy or too focused on her own workto take much notice of him, until she finally realized he was unsuitablematerial. By this time the damage was done, and her rejection of him as a chelaled to his scandalous “exposé,” published, significantly, only after her death.It may be of some import that Solovyov’s companion during his Würzburg visit wasYuliana Glinka, a Russian agent and the person most likely responsible forbringing the forged anti-Semitic tract The Protocols of the Elders of Zion fromFrance to Russia. See James Webb, The Occult Establishment (La Salle, Ill.: OpenCourt, 1976), pp. 241–49.10.

As early as 1903, Samuel Studd of the MelbourneTheospohical Society investigated Hodgson’s work and found it “unconvincing,” anassessment reached by Beatrice Hastings, K. F. Vania, Walter Carrithers, JohnCutter, Leslie Price, Vernon Harrison, and others. Although K. Paul Johnsonargues that Harrison’s work does not exonerate HPB completely, it certainlypoints out flaws and inconsistencies in an investigation that has been acceptedas accurate by practically every HPB biographer who was not a Theosophist.15.

[9781101601389_EPUB-16.html#FNNumber312] I’ve already mentioned AleisterCrowley’s tongue-in-cheek remark that Blavatsky herself was the Ripper.

Anotherodd link between HPB and the Ripper is the relationship between the TheosophistMabel Collins and Robert D’Onstan Stephenson, who has been pegged as a candidatefor the Ripper’s true identity.

For confusion’s sake, I’ll add that Gurdjieff was also accused ofinspiring the Nazi use of the swastika. See Louis Pauwels’s highlydisinformative Gurdjieff (New York: Weiser, 1972). Hyperborea became a centraltheme in the racially oriented esotericism of the Italian Traditionalist JuliusEvola; see his Revolt Against the Modern World (Rochester: Inner Traditions,1995).

Atlantis receives much lessattention in Isis Unveiled than it does in The Secret Doctrine, and one can’thelp but think that, having read Donnelly’s book, HPB thought his ideas too goodto leave out of her new work.53.
