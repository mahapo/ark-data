Ourconfidence as a species is higher than ever before and the knowledge of theuniverse we live in is expanding faster than most people can keep up with. Wecan compute and calculate the landing of a small probe on a planet 100 millionmiles away; we know what the atmosphere on Jupiter consists of; we canregenerate new organs in our bodies and genetic engineers can create new life inany shape or size they want to. There are however three fundamental questionsthat we have not been able to answer. Who are we? How did we get here? And, whyare we here?As we steadfastly march on the road to an unknown destiny, our ignorance hasbecome our weakness and our arrogance has become a congenital diseasethreatening us with our own annihilation. In this book we will deal with thelatest breakthroughs in science and technology, to reach back into the distantpast in an attempt to unravel the extremely vague origins of Humankind. Itsimply makes no sense at all that, as advanced as we have become, we have noabsolute answers dealing with our origins and ancestry. Why has Humankind beenso obsessed with gold? And why are slavery and gold the two common denominatorsthat can be traced all the way back to the very dawn of Humankind?The global population is torn between hundreds of religions and cults, allclaiming to have the answers. Any semi-sober person will realise in an instantthat they cannot all be right. Right? And yet it is religious dogma that hasheld billions of people captive through preaching death and destruction,threatening punishment by the ‘all mighty’ to disobedient pilgrims and promisingreward and salvation to those who submit to blind faith.The past 50 years have seen an explosion of new archaeological discoveries whichhave stunned scholars all over the world with its body of information. Over500,000 clay tablets have been excavated and many of them have been deciphered.It is only in the past 30 years or so, that the true meaning and relevance ofthe tablets has been identified by a handful of broad thinkers. What wasoriginally believed to be myth or fantasy, mainly due to ignorance by so-calledscholars, has turned out to be documented historic evidence so fantastic, thatit shakes the very essence of our existence.I would like to take you on a journey of discovery, using the latesttranslations and revelations of the many tablets that speak about ancient eventslong before a single word of the Bible was written. It is shocking to find thatnone of the stories of the book of Genesis are original but rather are watereddown versions of much older stories conveyed in great detail in ancient claytablets. Our journey will weave through precious detailed information which wasleft behind by our ancient ancestors, probably never realising that it would betreated with such suspicion.The uncanny coincidences which link the many ancient civilisations by the samepantheon of ‘mythical gods’ are too fantastic to be accidental. We now haveirrefutable evidence that there were strange powers on Earth who ruled the earlyhumans with an iron fist. They dispensed punishment and demanded absoluteobedience from the primitive new species. We will uncover the slow and painfulpath the newly created human race had to travel and the crucial role played bymore advanced deities who had ulterior motives for our existence. We willuncover the terrible truth that the human race was indeed created in the imageof our maker, but the maker was not who we’ve been led to believe. We willunmask the god of the Bible and other major religions, showing the differencebetween God with a big ‘G’ as opposed to god with a small ‘g’. The god whoconstantly displays humanlike behaviour, the god of vengeance we know from theBible, turns out to be a god with a small ‘g’. Some characters will be instantlyrecognizable, while others have been so distorted by latter translators that wewill need a little polishing to identify them. Many more questions will beraised as we postulate new theories surrounding our origins, demystifying Godand allowing the reader to experience the much bigger picture of possibility.With the help of science and the corroborative evidence from thousands ofancient clay tablets, we are now able to weave together the full story which Ilike to refer to as the ‘Great Human Puzzle’. The thousands of years it took forthe ‘slave species’ to progress from their labour camps in southern Africa, tothe point about 9,000 years ago, when a wave of sudden civilization spreadaround the world. From India, the Near East, Europe and the Americas. Thisjourney will also resolve the many archaeological dilemmas regarding the missinglink, which is clearly outlined by our advanced ancestors. We dispel the mythand the dogma that has kept Humankind ignorant and fearful for far too long. Theadvances we have made in genetic engineering will help us understand that justbecause we can create life, it does not make us God.We dispel archaic myths that belong in the dark ages and provide clear thinkingindividuals with the information to reach new conclusions. I would like to sharewith every reader the same incredible sense of discovery that I personallyexperienced as I unravelled the utter rubbish which I was conditioned to believethrough my formative years. As terrible as this ‘new truth’ may sound, it willbe the most liberating experience you will have."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1 [../Text/toc.html#chapter1]ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR [../Text/toc.html#chapter1a]Ever since I first became interested in genetics, it has always intrigued methat such an important part of our anatomy, the genome, a molecular structure sorefined should have been created incomplete. Actually, the truth is that thegenome was created in abundance with large parts of the structure that are notbeing used at all. It is as if the inactive parts of the genome are waiting forsome extrinsic factor to switch them on. The question begs, which unimaginablecharacteristics or super abilities are the dormant parts of the genome notcontrolling? What human abilities are they hiding? And how has this affected ourevolution as a species?The genome is just another name for the full complement of genes and DNAcontained by an individual. In humans, the genome consists of 23 pairs ofchromosomes, which contain the entire genetic programme for that specificindividual and is located in the nucleus of every cell in our bodies. Thisgenetic programme controls all the information that allows us to grow andfunction. Our genome is unique for every individual and every species. When weare born, we are blissfully unaware of what awaits us. There might be seven agesof man, but it all ends up woven together into a long reality performancedirected by some invisible force. We are all given some 70 years to do ourperformance here on Earth, on average; the rest is up to each one of us. Enterstage left… exit stage right. The only certainty we have at present is that wewill exit. What are you going to do with your 70 years? What is the purpose ofthis journey, this play of life that we all participate in? Will you use thistime creatively, make a contribution to the global community of beings or willyou be a mere spectator; a usurper of facilities before you exit stage right?Despite the 6.5 billion people who populate the Earth, the human race is arather fragile and primitive species. No matter how intelligent and smart wethink we are, we constantly display signs of basic animal behaviour that canlead to the destruction of our kind in the blink of an eye. We have waged war onour fellow man throughout history and continue to do so into the 21st century.There always seems to be a moral high ground or justification for our action.From Cain and Abel to George W. Bush, it has always been the strong and powerfulwho oppress and wipe out the weak. The old testament of the Bible is not apretty tale of compassion and forgiveness. In fact, quite the opposite. It talksabout an eye for an eye; wiping out man, woman, child and beast in the name ofGod and often mentions the enemy by name, personifying them as the 'bad' guys ordisciples of the devil. It seems that God has been taking sides from the verybeginning. He had his favourites and then there were ‘the others’. I always feltthat the God I have been told about should be more impartial and loving.The Bible is filled with prophets and other individuals who for thousands ofyears had a direct link to God and who on a regular basis received instructionsfrom God to do certain things. When reading the Bible it is not only deemednormal but it is expected of us to take for granted that we believe that anumber of ‘chosen’ people received such regular instructions from God. Not onlydid they receive clear instructions and warnings, they received physicalinstructions in the form of the Ten Commandments and rewards of a material kind,such as land or cattle. But the most impressive interactions between God and manwere the many visitations God made in person to various individuals. If he couldnot make it in person, he would send ‘angels’ to deal with whatever situationneeded to be dealt with. The divine beings would share ideas, share wine andbread and inevitably God would instruct the person to perform certain tasks. Allof these individuals seem to have been men. And all of the people whocontributed to the scriptures of the Bible were also all men. If ‘He’ created usall equal, did God have a problem with the credibility of women? Or was God justthe personification of a male dominated society? The simple historic factremains that God actually physically interacted with man. Today, such claims ofa physical interaction with God would draw strong criticism and ridicule. Why isthat? Is it perhaps that such events in prehistory cannot affect us here today?We seem to accept it when it happened in ancient history, almost reduced to somefantastic fairy tale of our struggle for freedom. Or is it simply because we aretoo scared to analyse the facts for fear of victimisation if we place sucharguments in the public domain? These questions have troubled me for most of mylife.And who decided that the Bible had reached its conclusion and when; that it wasnow enough, it is now the end and the final chapter must be written? Obviouslythis was another man, inspired by God and dictated to by the Holy Spirit! Surelythe quest for truth and salvation continues? Surely the atrocities on Earth havenot abated; surely the people of the Earth need ongoing guidance andinstructions from God on how to deal with modern day mayhem and crime; how torespond to dictators; how to survive colonisation, racism, invasions and otherinventions of ‘evil’ minds. Our capacity for cruelty as a species has reachedunbearable proportions. We make rules as civilised beings, only for them to beabused and used against us by less civilised individuals with a good knowledgeof the legal system. Those who preach peace and love and turning the other cheekhave become the weakened victims of their own philosophy.Now, more than ever, people need salvation. They need something real to believein and to hold onto in times when all hope seems to have vanished. So why arethe scriptures not ongoing? Why is God not dictating more wisdom through one ofhis prophets? Or many of his prophets? Some say He is. Many claim they are incontact with God on a regular basis. Many convey God’s messages in packedchurches and other places of worship. How does the global community respond toindividuals who make fantastic claims of miracles and hearing God’s voice andhaving the answer? Well, in many cases these modern prophets rise to a cultstatus with a blind following of disciples who will respond to every commandwhile in other cases they are reduced to cranks with a loose screw.So, how should a judge in the 21st century respond to a guy who tied up histen-year-old daughter to a table in the back yard and who was caught by policein the process of stabbing her to death or slitting her throat? If he claimsthat God had instructed him to sacrifice her to prove his obedience to theAlmighty Lord, should such a character be seen as an example of a modernfaithful or a psychopath? Yet we look at Abraham as a faithful man of God withstrong principles and a leader of men because he obeyed God’s instructions tokill his own son. The Bible however calls it ‘sacrifice’. Would we see it assuch if it happened today in a wealthy suburb of Johannesburg or Paris?It is truly a confusing state of religious activity out there. Thousands ofreligions, all of them man-made, all claiming that they have the answer. Only‘their’ followers will be saved by the maker and bask in the pleasures ofparadise. It seems that the more money they have, the more power they wield andthe closer to God’s ear they can get.And so the religious argument begins and we clearly display the primitive sideof our low evolutionary state. Are these the primitive characteristics thatcould be controlled by the inactive genes? We look at the past greatcivilisations and somehow feel superior. The fact that we cannot explain manythings from prehistory is quickly discarded as ‘who cares about the Egyptians…they’re all dead’. In the light of all our achievements and scientificdiscoveries, the more we evolve, the stronger the religious dogma becomes. Itseems that the religious dogma, which could also be called fanaticism in thiscase, is directly linked to money. The wealthier a nation, the more they canenforce their particular religious views on others. The USA may claim that theyare a ‘free’ society in all respects but that is mainly because they feel asense of comfort among their 96% Christian community. It is safe for them toallow the minority ‘rogue’ religions to waste their time on their ownmeaningless salvation.But then we start to look at who we really are and the road we have travelled asa species on this planet, only to realise that our presence here does not evenequate to the ‘tip of the iceberg’. We marvel at dinosaur fossils and talk aboutwhat it must have been like here on Earth when dinosaurs roamed. We throw aroundnumbers like ‘60 million years’, when they were extinct; ‘200 million years’when T-Rex caused havoc and ‘400 million years’ ago really makes us gasp at thefossils of insects in the museums. Then we start comparing the timescale tofamous events in our own frame of reference. The First World War 100 years ago;Leonardo da Vinci 500 years ago; the Vikings some 1,200 years ago; Mohammed some1,400 years ago; Jesus 2,000 years ago; the pyramids 4,000 years ago; the lastice age some 13,000 years ago; by then most of us run out of reference points.And then one day something miraculous happens. We lift our eyes up at the nightsky filled with billions of stars and we try to imagine infinity. Someone pointsout Mars and Jupiter. And then you look through a telescope and for the firsttime you see Saturn with its rings and even several of its moons, and suddenlythe reality of it all changes somewhat. It all becomes a little bit bigger. Youlook at Alpha Centauri and realise that the light from the closest star to ustakes five years to reach us, travelling at 300,000 km per second. You go to alecture by an astronomer and see pictures of galaxies so far away it isimpossible to imagine the distance. Galaxies a billion light years away.Super-cluster galaxies five billion light years away; ultra hot quasars some 12billion light years away right at the edge of the known universe and then… some13.8 billion light years away… just blackness. Nothing. You sit in silentcontemplation as you try to digest the reality of what you have just witnessed.You have just looked beyond the edge of the known universe, where nothingexists.But when you wake up in the morning and you try to explain your epiphany to agroup of close friends, they share your excitement for exactly 15 seconds beforeone of them pronounces, “Hey, did you guys check that lekker (nice) movie on TVlast night?”With all the valiant attempts and sometimes remarkable discoveries byarchaeologists, we still cannot pinpoint the origin of Humankind. Oh, scores ofscientists will argue and give you all kinds of evidence and proof, only to berewritten by some new scientist five years from now. It is all calculatedspeculation presented to us either as scientific hypotheses or religious dogma.But in reality, all it ends up being is more manipulation of the pieces of theGreat Human Puzzle. We cannot tell when civilised man first walked the Earth andwe cannot tell when man was created or how man evolved with a definite level ofcertainty.Lets face it, the past two centuries have led to amazing discoveries of ancientcivilisations, lost cities and a closer understanding of the people whodeveloped these ancient cultures that displayed remarkable knowledge andunderstanding of science and the cosmos. It has taken us decades to decipher thevarious texts or styles of writing by the many extinct cultures. With all ourknowledge and sophistication, we have not deciphered the Balkan-Danube scriptand the Indus Script to date. The diversity of these ancient civilisations, fromthe ancient Chinese, various cultures of the Americas and the hieroglyphs of theEgyptians to the cuneiform scriptures of the Sumerians and the lost cities ofAsia, have baffled historians and archaeologists alike. It has taken us bycomplete surprise to discover ancient libraries, such as the library of KingAshurbanipal at Nineveh, with around 30,000 cuneiform clay tablets of scripturesthat point to great knowledge by lost civilisations.It is curious to discover the extensive knowledge of astronomers as early as sixthousand years ago with detailed information of our own solar system, describingit in great detail. We read about ancient gods who roamed and ruled the Earth inchariots that flew in from the stars and about conflicts and betrayal betweenthese ancient gods. We read about brave men who achieved great things in thedistant past and wisdom, which was imparted to man by the many gods who camefrom the stars. The ability to extract precious metals from ore in the groundand the the production of gold, copper, tin and bronze as early as nine thousandyears ago points to clear understanding of metallurgical procedure. The ancientruins of the Americas with visible extraction and mining activity explain whythere was an unimaginable wealth of gold in this part of the world long beforeColumbus, Cortes or the other savages who set foot there only a few hundredyears ago. The further inexplicable evidence of ore mining in southern Africa asfar back as 100,000 years ago is simply too much for even the bravest ofarchaeologists to accept.The knowledge of medical procedure and genetic manipulation, the creation of the‘Adamu’ and a new species is clearly documented in ancient tablets, which haveonly recently been understood by so-called intelligent man. The power ofwireless communication and geophysical knowledge to anticipate natural disaster;all this wealth of information stares us bluntly in the face. And yet we cannotcome to terms with the fact that we may not be the pinnacle of intelligence thathas inhabited the planet. Since the rapid evolution of the computer, our abilityto document and match this ancient wisdom has enabled us to understand it moreclearly. But what do we do with all this information when standing face-to-facewith incredible tales from prehistory? We have two choices. Either we believethat it has been left for future civilisations to use and build upon or wediscard it as hallucinogenic garbage by some primitive idiots from a stone age,not worthy of our attention.But the fact that only 500 years ago men were burnt at the stake for suggestingthat Earth was not the centre of the universe; the human body was a mysteriousvessel that was studied and dissected by daring scientists risking their livesin the early hours of the morning; that we only discovered the last threeplanets in our solar system in the past 200 years are clear indications that weare not the super race.We are the sub-species. Our arrogance is our weakness and our ignorance, acongenital disease that will eventually destroy us. The dogma has consumed usand the fear controls us. But why are we so blind to the facts and evidence thatsurround us? Why are we so obsessed with popular religions that mostly bow to agod who uses retribution and punishment as a form of control? If we all comefrom the same maker, we should all have the same set of rules on how to obeythat maker, but this is clearly not the case. Religious conflict has torn ourhistory apart for millennia and still hangs over our heads into the 21st centurylike a cancer waiting to devour us.In this book we will discover that our disorder is the direct result of ourbastard race status, with unpredictable animal behaviour lurking in ourmanipulated double helix DNA. Our intelligence has been suppressed, ourknowledge has been erased, our lifespan has been genetically shortened and ourmemory has been removed. We are an inferior, genetically cloned mutation of thegreat civilisations of the past, left behind to pick up the pieces or to puttogether the pieces of the Great Human Puzzle.We have made remarkable progress in the field of genetic engineering but justbecause we have been able to ‘map’ the genome does not mean we know everythingabout it. On the contrary. The more we learn about the genome, the more wemarvel at its complexity. We seem to understand the basic principle of thedouble helix, but we are far from understanding all its functions. What we areespecially perplexed by are the large sections that seem to be ‘switched off’.Yes, it is curious to learn that there are large parts of the genome that arenot active. Ever since I first became interested in the study of the genome, Ihave been fascinated by the strange phenomenon, that such a masterful part ofour anatomy, a molecular structure so refined, should have been createdincomplete. That kind of discovery flies directly in the face of allevolutionary processes. But the real truth is that the genome was created inabundance, with far more DNA in our cells than we need for our primitive form.It is as if the inactive parts of the genome are waiting for some extrinsicfactor to switch them on.This begs the question, if the genome controls all our characteristics andbodily functions, then what is it that is not controlled by the inactive partsof the genome? I firmly believe that this is the ultimate question of humanity.What inert secret powers are being locked up behind the inactive parts of ourgenetic structure?Let’s take a quick look at the history of genetic discovery. While there isclear evidence of prehistoric genetic activity and manipulation dating back tosome 250,000 years ago, modern man has only rediscovered the genome in the1950s.In 1866 Gregor Mendel published the results of his investigations of theinheritance of ‘factors’ in pea plants but it was only in the 1950s that thechemical structure of the DNA was rediscovered by modern scientists. Theyfinally had a name for it: Deoxyribonucleic acid. The people involved in thisbreakthrough were Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin, Francis H. C. Crick andJames D. Watson. With this discovery they started a whole new branch of science,namely molecular biology. In the same decade, Watson and Crick made history whenthey made the first model of the DNA molecule, showing its twisted double helixstructure, and proved that genes determine heredity. In 1957, Arthur Kornbergproduced DNA in a test tube. 1963 saw F. Sanger develop the sequencing procedurefor proteins. By 1966, a real breakthrough was made when the genetic code wasdiscovered. Scientists were now able to predict characteristics by studying DNA.This very quickly evolved into genetic engineering and genetic counselling.In 1972, Paul Berg produced the first recombinant DNA molecule and in 1983Barbara McClintock was awarded the Nobel Prize for her discovery that genes areable to change position on chromosomes. In the late 1980s, an international teamof scientists began the tedious and demanding task of mapping the human genomeand the first crime conviction based on DNA fingerprinting, in Portland Oregontook place. By 1990 gene therapy was used on patients for the first time. In1993 Dr. Kary Mullis discovered the PCR procedure, for which he was awarded theNobel prize. In 1994, the FDA approved the first genetically engineered food.These were FlavrSavr tomatoes engineered for better flavour and shelf-life.By 1995, criminal DNA forensics made headlines in the O.J. Simpson trial. In1997, Dolly the Sheep was cloned as the first adult animal clone. 1998 saw thesenate inquiry into the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal based largely on DNA evidenceand in the year 2000, J. Craig Venter, along with Francis Collins, jointlyannounced the completion of the mapping and sequencing of the entire humangenome. This was a major achievement that took almost 10 years less thanoriginally expected. In 2003, Craig Venter launched a global expedition toobtain and study microbes from environments ranging from the world’s oceans tourban centres. This mission will yield a definitive insight into genes that makeup the vast realm of microbial life. And now the true genetic era is upon us.The first pet cloning company opened their doors for business in the USA in2004. In essence, we have become the creators of species. And so we have become‘God’ to those species we create.The more we discover in the Cradle of Humankind in South Africa, the more we cangenetically link the various peoples of the world to half a dozen originalindividuals in southern Africa; the more evidence we get from femalemitochondrial DNA that the first human was born around 250,000 years ago, themore the pieces of the puzzle seem to fit. In this book we will explore writtenevidence that places such a group of primordial humans in southern Africa some200,000 years ago, at about the time when 'Adam' was supposed to have beencreated. When I first started placing these pieces together, I was doubtful thatsomething so fantastic could be a possibility. But if you allow yourself thefreedom of thought and possibility, you will discover an incredible story with aclear vision of the past and you will begin to unravel the great steps ofhumanity that brought us here.This brings us to the age old question: 'Who are we… and why are we here?' No,it is not really a ‘hey-shoo-wow’ kind of question, it is possibly one of themost complex riddles of our species, which deserves a fresh new look andpossibly a slightly less conventional approach if we want to reach new andrefreshing answers. But then we must be prepared to face answers we may not haveexpected. This is what I intend to share with you in this book. What may atfirst seem like a horror story will turn out to be the most liberatingexperience, one that brought me much closer to God than I ever imaginedpossible. Once again I have to draw your attention to the difference betweenGod, the creator of the universe and all things in it and ‘god’ one of manydeities who walked the Earth over millennia, wielding power, knowledge andtechnology with which they ruled over humanity.There is good news for those who believe in the ‘creation’ theory that man wascreated by God and given certain rules to live by. Those who believe in theevolutionary theory have a few surprises to face. Evidence that has beenuncovered and contained in the many Sumerian tablets suggests that the ‘Adamu’was created here on Earth in the image of his ‘maker’. But who created Adam, andwhen, will reveal that he was created by an advanced species of deities for aspecific purpose here on Earth some 200,000 to 250,000 years ago. We furtherlearn from the tablets that Adam was created from the genetic pool of theadvanced species of humans on Earth and a lesser evolved hominid that roamed insouthern Africa. But who were these ‘advanced humans’ and where did they appearfrom? And why is there no fossil evidence of their existence?I must once again remind you of the dilemma we face when we contemplate suchoutlandish theories as most, if not all, of our facts come from prehistoric claytablets that have been deciphered over the last 50 years of the 20th century. Wehave to make a personal choice, whether we believe that what was written inthese tablets is close enough to the truth, or whether it is merely somehallucinogenic garbage from a time when people’s minds did not functionproperly. I, for one, have made my decision to take at face value what has beenwritten. I cannot imagine for one minute that thousands of people spent millionsof man-hours painstakingly creating these tablets if their contents were lessthan relevant. I am convinced that they had better things to do than trying toconfuse future generations about our origins. After all, we have not reallychanged that much; we also want to leave evidence of our intellect andachievements, not only for future generations but also for other advancedspecies in the vastness of the universe. Why else would we send space probesfilled with human paraphernalia, videos, compact discs, books, photographs, TVshows and other symbols of our existence into space? At the back of our mindsand against the belief of millions, there is the faint hope that there may beadvanced life somewhere in the universe. If there is, we hope to dazzle it withour brilliance or disappoint them with our ignorance, all depending on howevolved they may be by the time they accidentally recover our earthly ‘spaceark’.It has always amazed me how many people show a complete disregard for history.To many, what happened in the past simply does not matter. But if we don’t knowwho we are and where we come from, how can we possibly begin to understand wherewe might be going on our path of progress and evolution?So we toil away and dream of better days. We close ourselves in cocoons ofcomfort, position our blinkers squarely on our heads and try not to step too farout of the lane of conformity. We believe that if we work hard or if we worksmart we will achieve some sort of reward at the end of all of this. We take outinsurance policies to reward our offspring and retirement annuities to cruisethrough the last few years of our own time on this planet. We keep procreatingas if we were programmed to do so. It seems to be a natural step in our maturingprocess. And unbeknown to us, it is most likely driven by our genome in anattempt to continue surviving while our DNA evolves towards its own completion.On this path of evolution it unlocks the secret parts that have been switchedoff by some alchemist in our distant past.We pray for health, wealth and happiness. Some dream of eternal life and manypray for salvation but deep inside there seems to bubble the burning desire tofind answers to the great human question… ‘Who am I and why am I here?’.History gives us many clues about who we might be and by stringing together theevents and behavioural patterns of humans in the past, history does give us someclues as to where we are heading. Whether we will survive to get there isanother question altogether. History does not however always clearly answer thequestion of who we are and where we come from. Historians, archaeologists andanthropologists have painted a very predictable past for us. Aside from thearguments between creationists and evolutionists, the story of humanity andHumankind has become an almost pretty fairytale and most humans do not wanttheir fairytale disrupted. Humanity rose from the ashes against all odds; wesurvived and grew in numbers while spreading over the Earth. We discovered fire,iron, bronze, silver and gold. We learnt new skills, adopted farming instead ofroaming, buried our dead, learnt to live in structured communities, learnt towrite and built cities to protect us from the bad guys. Then we learnt to trade,found democracy, discovered mechanisation, discovered technology and reached forthe stars and all the time we have been killing each other in the name of ourGod, our king, or for some other perfectly justifiable reason. It is truly amiracle that we have survived all this. It is clear that somewhere in our DNAthere is a violent gene that plays a prominent role in human behaviour.This is a great story, but it only really deals with the past 6,000 years or so.Prior to this it gets very murky and somehow the timing does not seem to fit.The question of the missing link is now more relevant than ever before. Ourgenome has certainly evolved to the point where we can at least ponder thesequestions and challenge some of the obvious conventions. But this evolutionseems to be more spiritual or mental. Physical evolution is debatable. If wehave not really evolved physically in the past 6,000 years since the Egyptiansand Sumerians, why should we believe that we underwent some dramatic evolutionin the previous 6,000 years… or the 10,000 years before that? It appears thatour genome has been evolving around the mental parts only. As if we had somecatching up to do mentally. This kind of genetic imbalance seems to point tosome sort of tampering in the ancient past.Survival of the fittest has been embraced as one of the pivotal evolutionaryarguments. Terms like ‘natural selection’ have been introduced and presentedwith dramatic evidence. It may have been the case in the protozoa, the dinosaursor the horse but there seem to be serious gaps in the prehistoric evolutionarypatterns of humans. Dramatic jumps in evolution, which will form part of myargument, point to the horrible truth that we are a slave species, purposefullycreated to perform a mundane function here on this Earth. It is for us tocollect the clues and string them together to formulate a sensible answer. Somewill not find any sense in my logic, but some will hopefully become moretolerant of the unknown and the forbidden questions of the past. One of thehighest hurdles to cross, will be the real possibility that we might have tocome to terms with two gods. One with a capital ‘G’ and the other with a small‘g’. The difference between the two should be obvious and our prehistory seemsto be filled with events that tend to favour the needs and whims of the latter.Have we been conned since the beginning to believe that some form of advanceddeity was actually God? If so, did he give us the rules, the scriptures and thepunishment? Was it in his image that we were created? There is an overwhelmingamount of written evidence pointing to this conclusion. Do we start to take thisancient knowledge more seriously, giving it the respect it deserves, or do werespond to our overwhelming enslavement by dogma and discard all this ancientknowledge? I will leave it up to you to draw your own conclusions."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2 [../Text/toc.html#chapter2]THE CELL [../Text/toc.html#chapter2a]Our human body is truly a miracle of creation. It clearly points to anextraordinary event that led to our existence. Our bodies consist of billionsupon billions of cells which make up all the different parts of the body: likeheart cells, liver cells, muscle cells and so on. Inside the nucleus of eachcell is the genetic material that determines pretty much everything about usfrom the moment we are conceived to the day we die.Before we journey back in time to retrace the evolutionary steps of humanity,let us take a quick look at those tiny things in our cells that shape us, ourgenes and the genome. I think of them as the fingerprints of God. This is whereall the codes for our existence are kept and this is where God with a capital‘G’ played the omnipotent role when life in the universe was created. I use thisexpression poetically and more for effect, so don’t take it too literally, butrather inject your own theory of how the universe was created. One of thepivotal questions I have been grappling with for 30 years is ‘why do we age andwhy do we die?’. A question like that may sound silly to most of us, as we haveall been conditioned to accept death as the inevitable. We always hear that theonly thing we can be sure of in life is that one day in the future we will die.What happens after death is the question that man has been debating for eternityfrom a multitude of angles and which we will attempt to answer by the end ofthis book. I have however purposely steered clear of an extended spiritualdebate, rather focusing on the physical aspects of our being and how those haveevolved to shape our present state. Some will argue that it is impossible toseparate the spiritual from the physical but I hope to demonstrate that it isthe physical boundaries, predetermined by our DNA at the point of conception,which ultimately dictate the pace or capacity of our spiritual evolution. Buteven in this relatively primitive and disease-prone state, our bodies aremiracles of creation.For those with biology or anatomy as a major, please humour me as I bring therest of the readers into the loop. To put things into perspective on thiscellular level, let us first take a quick look at the cell and its contents asthis will introduce a number of terms that will help you understand some furtherexplanations.The CELL and its content:The cell surface is covered with a plasma membrane and the contents consist ofthe cytoplasm, which contains the various organelles including the nucleus.The plasma membrane controls flow of materials in and out of the cell, eitherpassively, which is called diffusion, or actively by active transport. Thesurface is covered with vesicles or vacuoles, which are flask-like invaginationsof the membrane. It is thought that these provide a crucial means for largemolecules to be taken into and out of the cell.The nucleus controls the cell and also contains the DNA (chromosomes or genome),which in turn determines all of our characteristics. Elements of thesecharacteristics will be passed onto the next generation of offspring because ofthe action of the DNA. This is called hereditary transfer of DNA and it is whychildren take after their parents. One half of the child’s DNA comes from itsmother; the other half from its father.The cytoplasm is the whole area between the cell wall and the nucleus, where themetabolism and all the chemical reactions occur. The rate is controlled byenzymes. But the secretion of enzymes is in turn controlled by DNA.The cytoplasm contains a number of organelles:• The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is an organised matrix of interconnectedflattened parallel cavities. It is the intracellular transport system. •Ribosomes are attached to the sides of the ER in some places, in which case itis called the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins are made here. Some of theseproteins include enzymes and digestive hormones, which are used by the cell,while some are secreted. The ER isolates and transports the proteins, which havebeen made by the ribosomes. • The Golgi body is made up of smooth ER with noribosomes. It is thought to be involved in the making and transporting of lipidsand steroids. There are a number of vesicles nearby containing secretorygranules. It is thought that the Golgi apparatus is an assembly point throughwhich raw materials for secretion are funnelled before leaving the cell. • Themitochondria is where respiration in the cell happens. The mitochondria alsogenerate all the energy for the cell. There is an average of 1,000 of these percell but there are many more in the motile tail of the sperm cell. • Lysosomescontain enzymes for splitting complex chemical compounds into simpler sub units.They also destroy worn out organelles or even the whole cell if needed. •Chromatin is the genetic material within the nucleus.But cells don’t just float around on their own throughout the body. Largenumbers of them are massed together to form organs and tissue. The latestestimation is that there are around 50 - 100 billion cells in an average humanbody, but this number changes all the time, every hour of the day. It gets morecomplex, as bigger people have more cells than smaller people and in the endno-one has a definite answer for the number of cells in the human body. Todemonstrate the complexity of this estimate just imagine that your turnover ofblood cells alone is about eight million per second. When quantities like theseare in question, it is really hard to pin down an accurate number.The cells that make up the many different parts of our anatomy all originatefrom stem cells, which are formed shortly after fertilisation and make up theearly embryo. They divide and divide and slowly transform into all the organsand cells that make up our entire anatomy. It's like a factory that keeps onproducing a large variety of end products. Every single part of your bodystarted out as a stem cell. Several months later, the baby is born and unless ithas a severe genetic defect it is perfectly complete and ready to grow into anadult human. Its body appears to be complete and ready for life but its genomeis far from complete. Just like its parents, the child bears a genome that willcontrol all of its life functions, but this genome is as incomplete as that ofits parents who collectively contributed to their offspring.[../Images/17-1.jpg]THE HUMAN CELLI remember the day very vividly. It was 1975 and I was sitting in the biologyclass at my high school in Randfontein, South Africa. Biology was one of thosesubjects that seemed to always come naturally to me, one of the lucky ones. Thesecret was to pay attention in class. It dramatically reduced the amount of workI would have to do on my own at home. The other trick was to ask as manyquestions as you could, to anticipate what might come up in the exam. Theteacher took forever to draw the animal cell on the board and then stepped backto admire her masterpiece. “Right…who knows what this is?” she asked with adetermined pride in her voice. She proceeded to explain all the different partsof the cell, then moved on to the very curious fact that the cells divide everyfew hours in some kinds of tissue and every few days in others. The new cellsare born and almost immediately proceed to prepare for mitosis (cell division).This was almost too good to be true, I thought to myself. This was a perfectformula for eternal life. When you add the Krebs Cycle to the equation, theprocess through which energy is derived from food in the cells to keep the bodynourished, it seemed pretty clear to me that the cells are the perfectstructures to keep the body at peak maturity and the achievement of eternal lifeshould be a mere formality. I raised my hand and asked the question that mostprobably changed the way I think about life and death today: “So why do we die,if new cells are born all the time and nourished by the food we eat?” I asked.“We die because that is what happens,” she said. She went on to explain thatthis process of mitosis seems to carry on for some time, for a number of cyclesor years and then suddenly the process starts to slow down. Fewer cells areborn, the cells grow older and fragile with weakened cell walls, prone topathogenic attack, until they stop dividing completely. This process spreadsthroughout all the parts of the body until we eventually die.Somehow this explanation was not good enough for me and I felt that the teacherwas missing out on a very important part of the equation. There had to be somesort of control mechanism, which should be and could be manipulated to overcomethis slowing down process in cell division that ultimately leads to death. Butin 1975 I knew absolutely nothing about genetics and the teacher was not allthat well informed either. Ever since that day I have always believed that theremust be a simple procedure possible to reverse this ageing process. Whengenetics became the cool new science by the late '80s, it all started to make alot of sense. Strangely enough, until the year 2004, scientists had still beenat odds about the causes of ageing. Some have still not reached the seeminglyobvious conclusion that just like all other anatomical and physiologicalfunctions, ageing must also be controlled by the genome. It is not only the cellas a whole that keeps multiplying, but all the parts of a cell are constantlybeing built up and broken down throughout its lifespan. The cell is constantlyactive and every bit is often renewed. When certain parts or organelles are notneeded, such as extra mitochondria, they are simply disassembled and broken downto a molecular level. The truth is that once cells are born, they are trulyperfect organisms that should continue to live by constantly dividing themselvesfor as long as they are fed. This is a great question for philosophers, sincethe original cell is now two cells and exists twice. Like a magician at akiddies' party with those long thin balloons, a twist here and a twist there andsoon the balloon has become two balloons. A few more effortless manipulationsand the cells have become a little doggie or a rabbit or even a beating heart.That is the magic of the cells in our bodies.[../Images/19-1.jpg]THE HUMAN CELL SHOWING THE DNA IN THE NUCLEUSThe last decade has seen some new theories on cell death and ageing but to dateno-one is sure why cells get fragile and ‘cranky’ as they get older. One of thepopular theories in the attempt to understand ageing is a substance called‘telomeres’. These protect the DNA from damage during copying. It is thoughtthat the telomeres on the ends of the genes get worn away or damaged and whenthis happens it seems that the DNA can get damaged too. This can lead tomutations and changes that lead to ageing and cell death. This is however stillone hypothesis with many others doing the rounds and no-one can speak withabsolute authority. So I will use this hole in the fabric of science topostulate my own hypothesis in later chapters. The damaged DNA then starts tosend the wrong messages or codes to the cell and its components, which leads tothe secretion of the wrong enzymes or chemicals, which leads to the cell notperforming at its peak and then it slowly shuts down and dies.This is an important link to my argument in later chapters. All because ofmessed up programming and incorrect triggering of genetic responses, it ispossible that the cells in our bodies die and we end up dying as a logicalconsequence. So if messed up cellular genetic information leads to diseases suchas tumours and cancers and many other serious life threatening conditions, couldwe assume that the correct genetic information will do the opposite? Keep thecells alive forever? This is where genetic engineers are focusing much of theirattention. We have made many breakthroughs in identifying various genes thatcontrol a vast number of physiological activities and our success rate in genetherapy and gene replacement is growing constantly. In a nutshell, byidentifying damaged genes we can take steps to replace them with healthy genes.But what if we cannot do this in certain situations. What alternatives do wehave? Stem cells! The success rate we have witnessed by introducing stem cellsinto damaged tissue has taken everyone by surprise. While everyone was focusedso fiercely on genetics, stem cell research has exploded with astonishingresults. By injecting stem cells into damaged tissue, doctors have reconstitutedhearts, livers and even eyes. The recovery of the organs is almost likeperforming a miracle, with the damaged tissue being regenerated within days orweeks. A man who had only 10% active heart muscle left had recovered to 90%within two weeks after receiving a stem cell injection into the damaged part ofthe heart. This is why the debate over human cloning has become so heated.Scientists have now realised that the stem cells in human embryos can be used tocure all kinds of incurable diseases, produce new organs and rejuvenate almostany part of our body. Embryonic stem cells first appear about a week afterfertilisation. They are the ‘parents’ of all other cells in our body.In theory, stem cells could be harvested from an early embryo, which was acloned version of you, after which the embryo would be discarded. Suchdeliberate wastage of embryos is one reason why therapeutic cloning is so highlycontroversial. But the technique offers such important life-saving treatmentsthat its use is considered justified by many people. Research into therapeuticcloning is allowed in the UK but it is illegal to place any cloned human embryointo a womb. This was intended to prevent anyone from trying to create a livingclone.But stem cells can also be found in adult bodies, where they provide ongoingmaintenance and repair. Adult stem cells appear to be partially differentiated,which means they have already started moving towards becoming a specific celltype. They do however show great flexibility.Another possible source for stem cells is in the blood collected from a baby’sumbilical cord just after birth. Some parents are choosing to freeze and storethis blood so their baby will be able to call on a supply of its very own stemcells if it ever needs it later in life. I trust that scientists all over theworld are already busy trying to recreate stem cells in a tube but the miracleof these cells lies embedded in the deep secrets of their genome. Not until westart to unravel some of the ‘junk’ parts of the genome and the secret encodingthey possess will we start to fathom the true mechanism of stem cells. So, nowthat we have uncovered a possible miracle of life, let’s get back to theshortcomings of the incomplete genetic structure lurking in our cells.The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 and its goal was to decipher andmap the entire DNA of a representative human, who was selected from a group ofanonymous donors. The cost? A phenomenal US $3 billion! It has been called thebiological equivalent of putting a man on the moon. The results have takenhumanity completely by surprise every step of the way as the group of scientistscontinually made new discoveries during the course of this process. The originalestimate was that the project would take about 20 years but thanks to the rapiddevelopment of computer technology it only took them 10 years. In June 2000, itwas announced that the entire human genome had been sequenced. The sequence is aprint-out of the structured order of four chemicals found along the length ofthe DNA molecule. These chemicals are referred to as letters A, T, C and G andthere are an astonishing three billion variations of them along our 23chromosomes, forming a unique sequence that holds the encoded programme for thegrowth of a specific person. The hidden message in this code controls everythingabout us; it points to our ancestry and predetermines our future. These aremainly the instructions for building proteins and millions of other secretactivities that have not yet been discovered.The big surprise to the scientists was that active genes make up only tinyfractions of the entire genome. Incredibly, they only make up 3% of the totalDNA in our chromosomes. The genes are either alone or clustered together inlarger groups, but in between each gene sequence, there are long stretches ofDNA which do not appear to contain any type of code for anything. Thesestretches have now been referred to by scientists as ‘Junk’ DNA, mainly becausethey have not figured out what secret message it conceals. This has sparked aninteresting new debate that will last until the true relevance of these dormantDNA sections is explained. Fortunately the scientists had learnt from thearrogance of their predecessors, and in their wisdom they decided to map theentire Human Genome, including the ‘Junk’ just in case it might have as yetundiscovered significance. It only took a few years to learn that those ‘Junk’genes indeed played an important role in the structure of the genome. It is nowclear that the positioning of these sections of dormant DNA are an integral partof the entire structure. More specific information will emerge as time goes by.It makes no sense at all that the single most important molecular structure inour body, which is also the master control mechanism, would be createdincomplete or with defects. I suggest that at the point of creation, the genomewas originally created to be complete and fully functional. But because it isneither complete nor fully functional, we start to theorise about its truepotential and our own full potential when dictated to by the perfect genome.Every week scientists are discovering new genes with specific control mechanismsover certain parts of our body. Genes that control the colour of your eyes, yourhair, your height, the secretion of enzymes, your skin, your sex and even a genethat supposedly dictates whether you will be ‘straight’ or ‘gay’. For everycharacteristic or function, there is a specific group of genes that controlsthat specific part of our body. Before we are even born, while we are growing inthe womb, the genome starts to dictate how the master cells should divide andhow they should shape our unique being.It seems that as our genome evolves, it allows us to evolve on two levels. Aphysical level and a spiritual or mental level. It is very curious that ourevolution or development as a species seems to be linked to technologicaldiscovery, scientific achievements and spiritual maturity. The more we evolve,the more impressive our discoveries. And the more complex the questions we seemto pose, the more challenging the goals we set ourselves. Except for periodslike the Dark Ages, when all knowledge was seemingly lost and replaced byoppression, dictatorship and savagery. It seems incredible that the knowledge ofthe universe, our ability to build breathtaking structures like the pyramids,and broad-minded philosophy all vanished, only to be replaced by an oppressedsociety during those times. But once again we emerged as a striving species andcontinued to ask more poignant questions about our origins, discoveringelectricity, the atom and reaching for the stars. We have theorised abouttravelling beyond the speed of light, time travel and even meta-universes. We nolonger seem so sure of our wisdom, we wonder more curiously where we areheading, but… we still don’t know where we come from. Is our insatiable need toreach the stars a clue to where we might have come from? It is quite possibly soand we will examine ancient evidence which seems to support this theory verypersuasively. We cannot place a limit on our mental and spiritual evolution. Soif the mental and physical are somehow linked, there should be no boundary toour physical evolution too. Such physical evolution will not necessarily bevisible on the outside, but its effects will most certainly be felt on amolecular and cellular level where the genome is most active.Without most of us realising it or having the background knowledge to comprehendthe reasons, our bodies are continually striving for a complete or ‘perfectgenome’. One that has reactivated the seemingly endless stretches of ‘Junk’which line the DNA. This is the fundamental principle of evolution. Our owngenome is in a constant state of evolution, a never-ending process of completingitself. Re-computing and re-scanning its own structure and constantly filling inthe missing bits. The evolutionary process starts with the genome itself. Justlike new computer technology allows us to scan photographs and turn a dull imageinto a perfectly sharp image, the genome is constantly fixing the dull, inactivebits, unlocking them and reactivating them to perform the specific function forwhich they were created. Just because the geneticists have not yet figured outwhat all the dormant stretches of DNA are for, does not mean that evolution isgoing to stand still and wait for us to figure it out. Slowly but surely we areevolving physically and mentally, as the genome reactivates itself. It is like arebirth from a long sleep which Humankind is waking up from. A sleep into whichwe must have been induced by someone or something a long time ago. A sleep ofignorance and forgetfulness. It is often said that less intelligent people seemto be happy with their lot. They don’t question why, they just accept their lotand get on with life without asking too many questions. They place their livesin the hands of their god, whichever god it may be and believe that one daytheir souls will be saved from the devil. It is truly a great escape for manyand a good enough reason to go on regardless. We have however seen smallincrements of evolutionary evidence in our physical and spiritual forms. Thefact that our tonsils cause more trouble than good; our appendixes are removedwell before they can possibly kill us by bursting and the fact that the averagesurvival age in the global population has increased dramatically since the Darkand Middle ages. This may have something to do with socioeconomic circumstances,diet and climate, but on the other hand it may not. For every bit of geneticresurrection that occurs in our cells, our bodies and minds evolve in harmony.More and more people around the world now refer to themselves as ‘spiritual’rather than religious. The past 2,000 years has seen the emergence of countlessnew religions and more splinter cults, as people are searching for new answersand opening themselves up to new realities.I predict that in time to come, as we unravel more of this DNA structure, wewill discover power and wisdom emanating from the genome, the complexity ofwhich we cannot comprehend today. But we have the capacity to digest sciencefiction in large doses, so if this is a little too much for you at this moment,just pretend that this is a little science fiction trip and enjoy the ride.Why would such a perfect part of creation like the DNA, consist of as much as97% of unintelligible junk? Surely God does not make mistakes! Or is it possiblethat the inactive genes were purposely switched off, somehow, by someone whenmodern humans were created, right at the dawn of humanity? Could there have beensome group of beings armed with sufficient skill and knowledge, who consciouslyplanned and executed this procedure? They must have had a reason or motive tocreate a being or possibly even a new species with a drastically stunted genome.In the past two decades scientists have shown conclusively and established witha relatively wide margin for error that both mitochondrial Eve and chromosomalAdam were created between 180,000 to 250,000 years ago. Who would have had suchknowledge of genetics 250,000 years ago and what motive did they have to createa lesser evolved and more primitive creature like the human? The answer may behidden in thousands of ancient texts that have gone unnoticed for centuries. Inher book ‘Private Lives of the Pharaohs’ Joyce Tyldesley points out that 200years ago, the early archaeologists were no more than ‘officially sanctionedtreasure hunters’. They knew very little about the science they were involvedin, unable to read hieroglyphs or other ancient texts, sometimes not even beingable to distinguish between written text and decorative art. Excavators wereobsessed with finding giant monumental pieces to impress funders and attractcurious people to the museums. The knowledge that was captured on thousands ofclay tablets was lost to Humankind for centuries, piled up in the basements ofmuseums of the world. No one could possibly imagine that the primitive people ofthe ancient past could have had anything of consequence to say. Those whobelieved such misconceptions would have had those beliefs shattered.For now, let us return to the possibility of a perfect genome and let us imaginefor a moment what capabilities we may possess if our genetic structure wascomplete and fully functional, if large parts of our genome were not switchedoff. Let us examine some of the common problems in our physical anomalies whichwe would overcome with our DNA intact. The list is very long and touches everysingle aspect of our being. On this list would be all forms of disease; cancer;the simple process of healing; organ failure; mutation and the ability to adaptswiftly to severe external conditions; eyesight; hearing; deformities and otherphysical imperfections and obviously also ageing and death. These are just someof the complex physical benefits Humankind will reap with a complete genome. Bylogical deduction, there will be genes which control all these characteristicsin our bodies, and we will be able to manipulate these genes in any way wechoose to. Curiously enough, I have mentioned the topics which have alreadyreceived much attention from scientists. Have you ever tried to catch anordinary garden lizard and its tail comes off in your fingers? Or while you diga hole for the plant you received as a present from your mother, and youaccidentally chop an earthworm in half? Well, the lizard’s tail will grow backrather quickly and the worm will not die, it will grow to its full size again.The fact that such primitive creatures have the capacity to re-grow lost limbsor other vital parts of their anatomy, should unquestionably allow us, a farmore advanced species, to do the same, if we could only reactivate certain partsof our genome. The other, more complicated characteristics deal with thespiritual and mental parts of our psyche. The concept of being born with all thememories and knowledge of our parents has been debated for decades. The power tointeract with others through ESP or reading someone’s thoughts have been toutedas a function of higher evolved beings. Thought materialisation andteleportation linked to the materialisation of the physical around thespiritual, would allow us to travel though time and the universe. In a nutshell,we would become super-humans who live forever. But this kind of evolved state ofexistence will have certain prerequisites. The physical and the spiritual partsmust evolve in tandem and in perfect harmony with each other. The one cannotovertake the other. A kind of ‘yin yang’ coexistence between physical andspiritual needs to be accomplished. If the one should evolve faster or slowerthan the other, we will have an imbalance between the two characteristics, whichwill manifest in a variety of unpredictable effects, behavioural patterns ofinstability, violent and dramatic antisocial behaviour, and who knows what else.In fact, it is exactly the kind of behaviour we have grown accustomed to on thisplanet. This must be the reason why we as a species are so volatile. The reasonfor our instability can be ascribed to the turbulent clash of our currentdisparate pace of evolution between the physical and spiritual parts of ourbeing. The fact that some people may be evolving faster than others is apossible cause for conflict, aggression and misunderstanding.The fact that our genome is evolving towards a complete genome could also beevident from the way in which our bodies cope with certain diseases, which inthe past would have killed us and yet today are controlled by our boosted immunesystem. On the spiritual side it is heralded by the more complex questions weask about our origins, God and the universe. With the advances in astronomy wemarvel at the vastness of the universe and many people are coming to terms withthe fact that we may not be the only intelligent life out there. In 1990,astronomers were still of the opinion that planets were not commonly distributedin the universe. A few years later, after some more startling discoveries, theyestimated that a small fraction of the stars may have some planets that formedaround them during their own birth. And only a few years later they reached theconclusion that the formation of planets and the existence of solar systems isan integral part of what happens when Nebulae give birth to new stars andgalaxies. Suddenly, filled with this new wisdom, astronomers started discoveringmany new solar systems with planets and they continue to do so today.When Fred Hoyle and Chandra Wickramasinghe reintroduced the ancient Greekconcept of Panspermia in the early '70s, and suggested that life arrived here onEarth from space, as it probably did on countless other planets in the universe,most of us were unaware of other planets, and this theory was laughed off asludicrous by most scholars. Today, Panspermia is accepted by the majority ofscholars. These two celebrated scientists have proved beyond any doubt that lifehas in the past arrived on Earth from space and still does so every day, in theform of viruses, bacteria, spores and other microscopic organisms. While thesemay have played the leading role in the origin of life on Earth some 3,5 billionyears ago, they also played a pivotal part in the great leaps of evolution ofspecies. Furthermore, Fred Hoyle has presented evidence which supports thetheory of evolution happening in jumps, as opposed to the great Darwinianpropaganda that ‘evolution does not happen in jumps’. So what has this got to dowith our quest for our own identity? … Everything!It holds up the argument that Humankind is not the final link of an evolutionaryprocess which started with so-called ‘apes’, and grew into primitive hominids,who in turn grew into intelligent humans. It goes a long way in supporting theargument that the ‘Adam’ or first man was created by a conscious act of medicalscience some 200,000 years ago. This has been supported by tracking the Ychromosome in the male population and arriving at a similar date. Is it acoincidence that this scientifically determined prehistoric date is in turnsupported by the 1994 announcement by scientists, that tracing mitochondrial DNAin females, has placed the first ‘Eve’ around the same time? These scientificdiscoveries have gone a long way in supporting the evidence which suggests thatAdam was created and when he was lonely, a female partner was created for himfrom his ‘essence’. It sounds like a great fairytale which we read in the Bible,but it is also written exactly like this in Sumerian clay tablets, which predatethe Bible by as much as 3,000 years. So where did the authors of the Bible getall their inspiration from? As we unravel the ancient times of Humankind, wewill expose the origins of many of the stories from the Old Testament, clearlycaptured for eternity on thousands of cuneiform clay tablets, long before asingle word of the Bible was first jotted down. Furthermore, we are able to drawsuch conclusions and begin to make sense of it all, because of the incrediblediscoveries in biological science that have exposed the power of the DNA, allheld together in the human cell."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3 [../Text/toc.html#chapter3]THE BRAIN [../Text/toc.html#chapter3a]So what is this thing called a brain? A lump of gross-looking soft tissuetightly squeezed into our skulls, which allows us to formulate thoughts,contemplate our own being and question our consciousness. We use it to be witty,to bamboozle people, to reason with others and a million other functions thatare often too small for us to notice. We abuse it with drugs and alcohol,pushing the limits of our brains to what seems to be the edge at times. Thebrain is a very fragile organ and that is why it is so well protected by theskull. But the brain also punishes us for abusing our bodies. It gives usheadaches and causes us to feel pain of a wide variety. It can even cause usemotional pain when there is no sign of physical trauma. The brain can sendmixed messages and cause us to hear voices, imagine demons and drive us toinsanity.The brain is by far the most complex and mysterious organ in our bodies. It isthe ultimate marvel of our creation. It has intrigued doctors and scientists forcenturies and will possibly continue to do so for centuries more. Unlike thegenome, the brain’s activity is impossible to map. The truth is that we knowvery little about the brain and how it works. Oh, we know all about thechemicals and enzymes involved, what triggers what and where, and what the finaleffect is, but this is just the visible chain reaction that is easy to follow.What we cannot explain, are the invisible bits. What actually happens in thebrain in between the stimulus and response which allows us to formulate anargument or burst into tears, or feel pity and remorse, or such anger that werespond with violence.Neuroscientists have spent the past few decades studying the brain’s anatomy,function, physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology, but all that thisresearch has amounted to, is to highlight how little we know about thismysterious organ. Intelligence has always been ascribed to the size of the brainin species. That is why we are said to be the smartest or most evolved specieson Earth. And yet, whales have larger brains than humans, so where does thatleave them?Here is a short list of animals, comparing their brain size in grams. It mustsurely force us to reconsider the idea of ‘larger is smarter’ or is theresomething more to the bigger brains of several species on Earth?Average Brain Weight in GramsGrams Grams Adult human 1,300 - 1,400 Newborn human 350 - 400 Sperm whale 7,800Fin whale 6,930 Elephant 6,000 Humpback whale 4,675 Gray whale 4,317 Killerwhale 5,620 Bowhead whale 2,738 Pilot whale 2,670 Bottle-nosed dolphin 1,500 -1,600 Walrus 1,020 - 1,126 Pithecanthropus Man 850 - 1,000 Camel 762 Giraffe 680Hippopotamus 582 Leopard seal 542 Horse 532 Polar bear 498 Gorilla 465 - 540 Cow425 - 458 Chimpanzee 420 Orang-utan 370 California sea lion 363 Manatee 360Tiger 263.5 Lion 240 Grizzly bear 234 Sheep 140 Baboon 137Source: faculty.washington.eduBased on the above information, the Bottle-nosed dolphin should be slightly moreintelligent than humans, while elephants and whales should be infinitelysmarter. For all we know, maybe they are. But for now there are still somecountries in the world who allow the barbaric hunting and killing of thesehighly evolved species. The brain and its major extension, called the medullaoblongata, can be described as a mass of interconnected nerve cells that controlall the activities of the entire central nervous system. Between these twostructures they control all the voluntary and involuntary activities in ourbodies. Involuntary activity would be respiration, heart rate, blood pressure,muscle activity and all the goings-on in the digestive tract, just to name afew. Voluntary activity is basically every movement or action we engage in byfirst thinking about it and then doing it. Some of these may seem likeinvoluntary reactions, because our muscles are trained to perform the tasks,like walking, talking or even typing. But there are millions more activitiesthat fall into both the voluntary and involuntary categories. It is estimatedthat the communication network in your brain can perform several billionconnections and calculations per second. There are a number of major players inthis network. Neurons or brain cells, which carry the nerve impulses rapidlybetween the point of stimulation and the affected organ; the neurotransmitter,which allows the message between neurons and organs to be transmitted, andreceptors or receptor cells, which receive the message at the site of theaffected organ, like the eye.There are around 100 billion neurons in the brain but there are also anestimated 10 - 50 times as many glial cells in the brain. These perform somesort of supportive and possibly nutritive function to the neurons but their truefunction is yet unknown. The total estimated length of nerve fibres in the brainis around 160,000 kilometres. To get an idea of how incredibly complex the brainand its entire central nervous system really is, just look at the eye. It sitsvery closely located to the brain with a five centimetre long optic nerve. Inthis nerve there are 1.2 million fibres that send and receive messages betweenthe brain and the eye on a constant basis. Even when we sleep the brain controlsthe eyes through REM or rapid eye movement activity. If you ever have doubtsabout a supreme creator God, who masterminded all this stuff in the universe,the brain is a good place to start. It is truly the master organ of our anatomy.But the brain also controls activities that are often described as spiritual andare more mysterious by nature, like consciousness, thought, reason, emotion,love, purpose, passion and more. These are the properties of the brain whichwill challenge us until we are evolved enough to understand them. But for now,we just speculate.Someone, somewhere at some stage in the past made a careless statement, that weonly use 10% of our brains. The media immediately jumped on it and the lie hasbeen immortalised in pop-science, pulp-fiction articles ever since. But thereare a number of interesting examples to keep the theory alive. I must drawattention to the subtle difference in such claims, by scholars who approach itfrom the point that the brain’s potential is infinite. Their statements aretherefore merely expressions of support for the ‘infinite brain’concept.[../Images/29-1.jpg]NEURONThe possibility that the human is only 10% functional, at best, was outlined byAustralian neurology Nobel laureate sir John Eccles. But as I mentioned, hisstatements came from the assumption that 'the brain indicates its powers areendless'.Another scientist called John Lorber performed a number of autopsies in Englandon hydrocephalics. This condition basically causes large parts of brain tissueto be dissolved by acidic spinal fluid. He tested the IQs of patients before andduring the disease. His findings showed that IQ remained constant up to death,even though more than 90% of brain tissue was destroyed by the disease. It hadno impact on what is considered to be normal intelligence.In Russia, a neurosurgeon called Alexandre Luria, showed that the bulk offrontal lobes are mostly dormant, when he physically proceeded to cut out largeparts of frontal lobes from humans. He also gave them physiological andpsychological tests, before and after cutting out parts, and he even went as faras removing entire frontal lobes from patients. His conclusion was, that whileit had some effect on mood patterns, it caused no major change in brainfunction. I believe that experiments like these most likely had a lot to do withthe ‘10% brain activity’mania.In higher mammals there are large parts of the brain which seem to be associatedwith intelligence, personality and higher mental activity. Neuroscientists havedeveloped a number of imaging techniques to study the activity inside the brain,like positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) andcomputerised tomography (CT).CT uses X-rays to discern normal brain geography from tumours and otherabnormalities, while MRI reveals brain structure by detecting radio waves thatare deflected by tissues in a strong magnetic field; and PET detects gamma raysemitted by radioactively-labelled chemicals as they rush to active sites in thebrain. Another technique, which is known as magneto encephalography, involvesmeasuring the magnetic currents that are generated by the electrical impulses inthe brain. All of the different approaches to imaging in the brain give us someinsight into brain activity and functionality, but it leaves humans far short ofunderstanding the true complexity of this organ.Many tests have been done trying to determine how much of the brain we actuallyuse but scholars seem to differ on this estimation. Some say that we use about10% of our brain, some are as bold as saying that we use up to 20%, but the morecautious ones claim that 3-4% is much closer to the probable truth. There seemsto be no specific scientific finding or origin for any of these statements. Thissudden interest in the capacity of the brain may have originally been stimulatedwhen scientists performed basic experiments with rats, and found that rats couldperform most of their normal functions with as little as 2% of their cerebralcortex intact. Various extrapolations of these statements may have caused thisbrain usage debate, which was mainly fuelled by the media and others who wantedto capitalise on such disinformation. The truth is, we probably use all of ourbrain. This has been illustrated by many of the previously mentioned imagingtechniques over the years. Neuroscientists have now pretty much mapped theanatomy of the brain and identified the functions of each section. Uponexamining the map of the brain, you will realise that we know which part of thebrain is responsible for various functions and there is not much brain left,which could be called idle. But the fact is, although it seems that the wholebrain is active in countless stimuli and responses, there is no scientific wayin which we can measure the amount of brain we use. At the same time, there isalso no method to date, which can measure the full capacity of the brain. So weshould rather be asking what the capacity of the brain is, instead of how muchof the brain we actually use.The two approaches are philosophically opposed. The one approach assumes thatthe brain capacity is finite and aims to measure the current usage, while theother suggests that our brain capacity could be infinite.Many scientists claim that nutrition plays a key role in the performance andpossibly evolution of the brain. Much has been written about healthy diets withvery specific dietary instructions to help certain conditions. While diet andnutrients undoubtedly play a crucial role in the health and smooth performanceof the brain, it is impossible to claim any long term evolutionary benefits fromsuch treatment. It would be equivalent to saying that a daily moisturisingregime will make you immortal. The one thing that many scientists seem to agreeon, is that around 200,000 years ago, the human brain underwent a dramaticevolutionary change. Various theories for this sudden increase in brain size andintelligence have had scientists guessing and speculating for years. The populartheory doing the rounds is one of high seafood intake.[../Images/31-1.jpg]THE HUMAN BRAINThe different functions of the left brain and the right brain have been welldocumented. Here are some examples:Left Brain Functions Right Brain Functions Written language Insight Numberskills 3-D forms Reasoning Art awareness Spoken language Imagination Scientificskills Music awareness Right-hand control Left-hand controlLet’s take a quick look inside the brain and at some crucial statistics:The brain is involved in everything you do, either voluntarily or involuntarily.As was pointed out before, some of the involuntary activities that arecontrolled by the brain are your heartbeat, breathing and coughing, or betterdescribed as all the things that need to continue functioning while you sleep.The voluntary activities are all the things you do consciously, like walking,writing, talking, smiling.When your brain functions properly, you function properly as a well-synchronisedunit. But when your brain hits a few bumps it can manifest itself in a multitudeof unwanted side effects. The brain is active from the moment you are born tothe day you kick the bucket. If it had to shut down for even a second, all theinvoluntary functions in your body would shut down too. Something as simple asbreathing or your heart beat, would basically put an end to you if your brainhad to stop functioning. And because the brain is so active and never stops, itconsumes about 20-30% of the body’s energy. To achieve such a high consumptionof blood, it is serviced by about 400 miles of capillaries delivering a constantsupply of oxygen, glucose and other nutrients. So if you want to lose weight youhave to think harder. There are about 100 billion neurons or nerve cells in thebrain. Alcohol and drugs destroy these cells by the millions. They do grow backhowever. Each neuron or nerve cell is connected to other nerve cells in thebrain, by hundreds or even thousands of connections, called dendrites. It isestimated that there are over 1,000,000,000,000,000 (Ten to the power offourteen, 1014) connections in the brain, more connections than there are starsin the Milky Way. The brain is more complicated than any computer we canimagine. The reason we can make such a silly comparison, is because we now knowthat the brain’s capacity is infinite.A single neuron can produce almost a tenth of a volt electrical charge, and thetotal electrical activity in your brain can easily be measured with anelectroencephalogram (EEG). This allows us to actually measure brain activityand test the activity under various stimuli. Just like the other cells in yourbody, the brain cells also start to decline and die after a certain period. Thereceptors also decline with age. The neurotransmitter serotonin interacts withat least 15 different receptors in the body but after the age of about 20, oneof serotonin’s most common receptors starts to decline and vanishes from thehuman brain at about 15% per decade, which may be why depression commonlyappears in middle-age.Scientists believe that humans underwent a major brain change around 200,000years ago. What could have caused the sudden and dramatic change in humanbrains? The suggestion that a high seafood diet was the cause of this suddenchange is silly and makes no scientific sense at all. There had to be a moredramatic event that caused such a major change in the brains of our ancestors.There is emerging evidence supported by genetic and mitochondrial dating, whichseems to point to such a dramatic event. It seems that scientists in all fieldsof expertise are constantly providing us with more evidence of our humanancestry, but most of us are totally oblivious to the evidence that surroundsus. Keep in mind that the coincidental facts of mitochondrial Eve andchromosomal Adam were both dated back to around 200,000 years ago. Just acoincidence, or another piece of the human puzzle that fits perfectly? Thosescientists who ascribe this sudden brain change to dietary habits of the ancientHomo sapiens, are saying that those who ate more seafood evolved bigger brainsover millions of years. They compare the small brains of inland Australopithecussome 2 million years ago, to Homo sapiens some 200,000 years ago. Can you seethe problem here? These changes in brain size happened suddenly, as ifovernight. They are more easily explained by genetic manipulation than gradualevolution due to high fish consumption. Besides, the two species have noconnection in their evolutionary lines anyway. This kind of theory is a clearindication of how resistant some sectors of the scientific fraternity are to newdiscoveries that challenge the conventional way of thinking. Homo habilis (handyman) was the first of the genus Homo, who lived between 2.2 and 1.6 millionyears ago, with an average brain size of 500 - 750 ml. The next in line was Homoerectus, around 2 million - 400,000 years ago, with a brain capacity of 800 -900 ml. Then suddenly around 200,000 years ago, a new species appears out of theblue with a brain 55% bigger. This calls for some serious investigation, sinceDarwin believes that evolution does not happen in jumps. How is it possible thatsuch a species could miraculously appear; be able to think; able to reason andable to calculate? There must be more plausible theories for this phenomenon.Scientists go on trying to substantiate their big-brain theory by comparing thehigh fish intake of humans some 28,000 years ago in central Europe. Neanderthalshad a low seafood intake surviving mostly on meat from inland animals, and thisis why they were outlived by Homo sapiens, who had a high Omega-3 and Omega-6fatty acid intake. The crucial mistake they make here, is that fossilisedevidence has clearly shown that Homo neanderthalensis had a larger brain thanHomo sapiens, by between 5% to 10%. Scientists have also proved that a highseafood intake dramatically reduces the levels of depression among itspopulation. North American and European populations showed a rate of depression10 times greater than a Taiwanese population who consumed a lot of fish. TheJapanese, whose diet is also rich in fish, have a significantly lower incidenceof depression compared to North Americans and Europeans. Once again, these aresimply cosmetic reactions by the brain which will have no effect on how thegenome has been programmed. This theory will need more evidence which points toDNA restructuring or some form of evolution to make it stick. Putting make-up onyour face will not keep you immortal.So while it may be true that fats build your brain, and proteins unite it,carbohydrates fuel the brain, and micronutrients defend it, the real miraclelies in the fact that your DNA planted the programmed code at your point ofconception, which allowed your brain to grow into its fully functional form. Asincredible an organ as the brain may be, it is ultimately controlled by thegenome, just like every other minute aspect of our being.It does seem that the brain may have a limitless capacity for higher functionsnot yet understood by humans. A variety of unexplained psychic abilities havebeen demonstrated by large numbers of individuals. These are more often than notlooked upon as ‘freaks of nature’and not regarded as a possible higher state ofevolution which needs closer attention. We can look at the brain as the‘interface’ between the physical and the spiritual; our body and our soul.Somehow, some individuals have mastered these higher brain activities withoutknowing how and why. This adds another mysterious element to the Great HumanPuzzle. How and why have some people cultivated ESP skills? It makes completesense to me that while the genome is evolving towards its own completion, itkeeps unlocking parts of our brain, allowing us to perform higher mentalfunctions.So if the brain is indeed the physical ‘interface’between body and spirit, itwill take a lot more evolution on our behalf to understand it. Remember, thegenome and the spirit cannot evolve at individual speeds. So while the genomecontrols the rate of evolution of the brain, it is then by default also thegenome that ultimately dictates the pace at which the soul is allowed to evolvewhile trapped in our human body. Like the laws of osmosis, where the twoconcentrations on either side of the membrane will eventually reach a state ofequilibrium, but only if the membrane is permeable and allows these to cross.Our DNA will allow the spirit in our bodies to mix with the greater spirit inthe universe, in bite-size chunks, as we evolve and as we learn to deal with ournewfound knowledge.All this strange activity in the ancient past that caused our brains to suddenlyexpand, goes a long way to substantiate that there must have been some kind ofgenetic manipulation involved. The kind of manipulation which was revealed to usin ancient clay tablets written somewhere between 4,000 and 6,000 years ago.This new emerging information has found favour with only a handful of broadthinkers. Many archaeologists, historians and anthropologists are very nervousabout dealing with such sudden leaps in philosophy. But I hope to show you asteady, cohesive trail of evidence that points to the placement of an advancedrace of beings, right here on Earth at the time when our brains had somiraculously expanded. Not only did they leave behind written evidence of theirgenetic manipulation, but they actually explain in great detail the reasons whythey needed to create a ‘primitive worker’on this planet.Just think about how many times people say to you ‘I don’t know if I want tohear that… it sounds too horrendous’. That is really an honest admission thatthey are not ready to receive certain information. When it comes to new truthsregarding our origins and spirituality, people are not that polite about it. Themajority of the world’s population is not yet ready to face these new emergingfacts, even if they were asked to contemplate them only as a theory to beginwith. On the contrary, most people will reject any such utterances with highlevels of contempt. After all, they know exactly where they come from and whotheir god is, clearly displaying the power of our pre-programmed genome to keephumanity obedient and fearful of their maker.So what have we learnt in this chapter? That the brain is an infinitely complexorgan with a capacity for processing knowledge and information that goes waybeyond our imagination. All the mystique around the brain raises the possibilitythat it is an interface between the physical and the spiritual worlds.Regardless of its complexity, the programme for its development comes from thegenome. Around 200,000 years ago the brain underwent a dramatic increase insize, just about at the time when the Anunnaki created ‘Adamu’ according to theSumerian tablets. The sudden increase in the Homo sapiens brain could not haveoccurred due to millions of years seafood consumption. The human race uses onlya fraction of its brain, which is strictly controlled by our genome. All thisleads to some crucial questions to close this chapter with. What will our mentaland spiritual capacity be when our genome has fully evolved? Who were theAnunnaki? Why and how did they create Humankind?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [../Text/toc.html#chapter4]A JOURNEY BACK IN TIME [../Text/toc.html#chapter4a]If we don’t know where we come from, how can we possibly know where we aregoing? So in this chapter we will attempt to find pointers in both directions.We need to dig deep into our prehistory before we start gazing far into thefuture. Fortunately we have been handed loads of knowledge by our advancedancestors. Information that paints a very clear picture of exactly who we areand where we are heading as a species. All of this is possible because ofhereditary DNA transfer, combined with thousands of clay tablets filled withhistoric entries which have been treated either as mythology or the mutteringsof primitive folk with nothing better to do.So at the risk of becoming repetitive, let me remind you that to know where weare going, we need to know where we come from. To start our journey back intime, we need to retrace the steps of modern humans and use all the resourcesavailable, including knowledge and information from prehistoric scriptures,which may have previously been dismissed as garbage. The Sumerian tablets havebeen a fascinating revelation and a source of mysterious knowledge. So little isknown about prehistory, about the time before time, that when new dramaticevidence rises to the surface, it can sound so fantastical to us modern humansin the 21st century, that we refuse to accept it. We all talk about Greek andRoman mythology, we know their gods and we even know their designations; Venus,Pluto, Mercury, Isis, Thor, Apollo and the all-powerful Zeus, just to remind youof a few. But were these just fairy tale heroes from ancient times or were theyreally beings with superior powers? The Sumerian tablets tell us that these werereal gods and not imaginary names for forces of nature. The names might havechanged from civilisation to civilisation, but their influence has shaped all ofhumanity to date.Just when I sat down to start writing this chapter, I had visitors who popped inon a Saturday afternoon. We relaxed with a chilled glass of wine by the pool andthe subject of evolution and our ancestry came up. I asked my friends what theythought of evolution, and what they know about our ancient prehistory, and howand when we became human. Jana, immediately expressed her understanding that webecame human when we jumped out of the trees and started walking upright.Clearly not an opinion based on any levels of credible research, and yet,probably a very similar perception shared by many others who have had themisfortune of being brainwashed by the modern education system. Anton, on theother hand, was a bit more reserved and unsure of the answers, but he was surethat the evolutionist had got it right and that we evolved from some sort ofape-like species over millions of years.From these and numerous other discussions I’ve had over a period of 15 years, itseems that there are still two main theories which captivate the minds of modernhumans. The ‘evolution path’ and the ‘creation path’. I have personally grappledwith the conflict between the two for nearly two decades, only to discover thatthere is a third possibility! One which may possibly satisfy the fanaticalbeliefs of both sides, while opening their eyes to new realities that haveemerged out of our ancient past.While new discoveries and evidence are continually being presented, it keepsmoving the finish line. Every time some smart person postulates the latestunassailable argument supported by remarkable evidence, it just stimulates moredebate and controversy which inevitably leads to more discoveries and moredebate. It is truly a great journey of discovery which no person should layclaim to hastily. Scientists and anthropologists will continue to differ on thissubject for years to come, but I do feel a convergence of the two doctrines isunavoidable. Just recently I heard a priest talk about how he would welcome anyalien species as the miracle of God’s creation. He made a clear point ofdiffering with previous religious dogma, which places man at the centre ofcreation, god’s great masterpiece, and as the pinnacle of intelligence andmaster of the beasts.It is impossible to argue against evolution as it has been presented to us overthe past 150 years. We are surrounded by evidence everywhere which supportsevolution in the animal world and in the plant world. This is not the challengeI am raising in this book. My struggle lies with the last few hundred thousandyears on this planet which saw the emergence of humanity and the disappearanceof the hominid creature who preceded us.I need to quickly draw a link between the words ‘Humankind’ and ‘humanity’. Ipresent that you cannot have humanity without humankind and therefore the twoare inextricably linked, with subtle differences in our personal interpretation.So I purposely use the two randomly to illustrate this simple relationship.Evolution has played an important role in how the two have entwined as man hasevolved. There are however some fascinating shortcomings in the Darwinian theorywhich have already been attacked endlessly by much smarter people than me.It does seem that Darwin may not have had it all correct. Darwin actuallyborrowed much of his doctrine from many other scientists and brilliant peoplebefore him, sometimes seemingly distorting the theories to support his own. Itrust that if he had lived today, he would most likely change his minddramatically about his ‘natural selection’ theory based on the new evidenceavailable.It was not actually Charles Darwin who first coined the phrase ‘naturalselection’, when he published his controversial ‘bible’ on evolution in 1859,called On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or thePreservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. It was anotherbiologist by the name of Patrick Matthew in 1831, who referred to the “naturalprocess of selection”. He saw it as a more descriptive term than ‘the feedbackidea’ which was used leading up to that point. Natural selection was describedas 'the properties which best permit particular individuals possessing them tosurvive and reproduce their own genetic variants, will increase from generationto generation, more in proportion than other individuals with less beneficialgenetic structures'. In a nutshell, what this really means is ‘the survival ofthe fittest’. There was another concept which Darwin seems to have borrowed; theanalogy of the branching tree of life, which was described by Alfred RusselWallace in 1855.One of the very strong points which Darwin makes is that evolution does nothappen in ‘jumps’. It took about 120 years for Fred Hoyle and ChandraWickramasinghe to show that evolution does happen in jumps with the help ofviruses and bacteria that arrive on Earth from space in a process calledPanspermia. These new arrivals from space constantly mutate, infect the cells ofplants and creatures and quite quickly cause dramatic changes in the DNAstructure of the host.To demonstrate this outlandish proposition very basically, I would like you totake your mind back to your school classroom wall. Picture the poster with thechronological stages of human evolution. The ape-like creature on the left; theslightly taller ape-like creature to its right with less hair; and a slightlytaller and more upright ape-man to its right with even less hair; eventually weend up with a handsome man on the extreme right representing modern humans, asthe pinnacle of evolution. From ape to human, just like that. They show us thesesimplistic illustrations which leave children with preconceived ideas that thisevolution thing is pretty well documented and understood. They do not tell thechildren that this is just one hypothesis of how we became human. There is adeafening silence from the anthropologists about what exactly happened in thegaps between the different stages of evolution. We would be wiser to teach ourchildren the full truth instead of the sweetened half-truth. There are giantjumps of evolution between every creature on the evolution poster. How is thatpossible? What happened to the thousands of evolutionary steps between everystage? Or, did the creature on the left live for millions of years, whensuddenly it gave birth to a creature which looked nothing like it? What couldhave sparked such a dramatic change? Clearly it was a genetically driven change,but what would have caused such a dramatic genetic deviation so quickly, when itwas happy in its previous form for millennia?At the end of the 18th century, James Hutton felt unhappy with the concept ofgradual evolution when relating it to the geological activity on Earth and theprinciples of uniformity in geology. He stated that “The processes at work onand inside the Earth have been operating in the same general way throughoutgeological history. The overall environment has remained broadly the same for500 million years, while life has changed dramatically from simple neurologicalbeginnings, to highly complex present day forms. How could this measure ofchange come about in a broadly unchanging environment, if species were alwaysoptimised to their maximum extent?”.Since the unearthing of ‘Lucy’ and ‘Mrs. Ples’, the ‘Taung skull’ and the‘Turkana boy’, which were all landmarks in the field of archaeology, thousandsupon thousands of fossil skeletons of hominids and other human ancestors orrelatives have been found. Just when we think we have a clear picture of howhumans evolved, and a better understanding of the great apes that livedalongside them, we are faced with a new discovery which forces us to rethinksome of the fundamentals. Just recently, two major discoveries shook our viewsquite dramatically. In September 2003 ‘Ebu’ was unearthed in a cave on theIndonesian island of Flores. Standing at only about 1 metre tall, she is thesmallest adult hominid known. It is estimated that Ebu lived from around 95,000years ago until as recently as 13,000 years ago. This was the first time weactually realised that we were not alone on this planet until relativelyrecently, but shared it with people from another species! Because Ebu was not asimple Homo sapiens, she was apparently human.Another discovery was made about the great ape family, in Spain during 2005,near Barcelona. Salvador Maya-Sola and Miquel Crusafont unearthed a fossilisedskull and partial skeleton of a great ape, Pierolapithecus catalaunicus. Thisgreat ape is thought to have lived in the Middle Miocene period between 12 and13.5 million years ago, when the great apes which include gorillas, chimpanzeesand humans, split from the lesser apes like gibbons and siamangs. Although it ispossible that this was the ancestor of the great apes, the major difference isthat this great ape could not swing through the trees. I mention these examplesof very recent discoveries to prove the simple point, that the more we seem tothink we know, the more surprises we receive to remind us that we know verylittle. We should keep an open mind at all times and realise that while weevolve as humans, our evolving genome forces us to ask more complex questionsand discover even more staggering answers.Let us now take a journey into our human past to realise how young and fragileour species is and how little time we have spent on this Earth. This is animportant journey we need to take, to place the argument between creation andevolution squarely on the table. Armed with this knowledge, we will postulate anew combination of the two theories, which will offend neither those who believethat God made all life on Earth, nor the evolutionists who cling onto theDarwinian doctrine of natural selection. We will however need to stress theimportant differences between ‘God’ & ‘god’.

It is important to note that modern Homosapiens lived at the same time and probably side by side with Neanderthals. •35,000 years ago - Cave paintings in Europe. • 40,000 years ago - Traditionaldate for the origin of Material culture. • 50,000 years ago - Colonisation ofAustralia. • 75,000 years ago - Clothing invented. The oldest beads werediscovered in South Africa dating back 77,000 years, right to the middle of thestone age. • 90,000 years ago - Modern humans start migrating out of Africa intoEurasia. • 120,000 years ago - Widespread use of pigments like ochre in Africa.• 170,000 years ago - Mitochondrial Eve. The first female ancestor of all livinghumans. This date varies from 150,000 - 250,000 based on various interpretationsby scientists. • 170,000 years ago - Adam is born. From the Y chromosome passeddown only through males, it has been calculated that ‘Adam’, the first man onEarth, was created at this time. This date also varies by the same margins as‘Eve’. (It is curious to see that Adam and Eve seem to have been created at thesame time - this will form a very convincing part of our story in laterchapters.) • 200,000 years ago - First anatomically modern humans make theirappearance.It seems that there may be a clash in this time line - did other humans existbefore Adam and Eve? This is also part of the puzzle which seems to corroborateour theories in later chapters.Source: New Scientist 2004This was the easy part of the journey back in time, because we really onlycovered the journey of one species; Homo sapiens and Homo sapiens sapiens, themore civilised version of the earlier. There is a very fine line between thetwo, and scholars are still at odds about where the one suddenly became theother – a slightly more ‘streetwise’ version of its prior self. There waspossibly a period during which the two relatives may have crossed over and livedside by side, and the clay tablets certainly give us enough evidence to takesuch suggestions seriously. This part of our archaic history has however beenrewritten many times before and probably will be rewritten many times again,until we are presented with irrefutable evidence from some credible,unquestionable source. What we will take from this evidence is anyone’s guess,but it would have to be pretty convincing to draw mass appeal from a generallyuninformed global populace. The funny thing is that such evidence has existedfor thousands of years, without us taking any notice of it. It’s as if weemerged out of those prehistoric times as an ignorant species, and for someobscure reason forgot everything we had been through. Could this phenomenon havesomething to do with our shortened lifespan? A curious anomaly, which is way outof step with the many years our distant ancestors apparently lived? If that isthe case, then why is it that we only live for an average of 70 years, while thebiblical characters and others before them are shown to have lived for as longas 900 years and even more? The answers are all well documented in the enigmaticclay tablets which we will uncover in later chapters.But for now, the next part of our journey back in time gets very interestingbecause we have to really use our imagination and powers of visualisation. Thatis what most anthropologists will want from you, as the evolutionary jumpsbetween the fossilised hominids become very large. While evolutionists expect usto buy into the fantastic story of human evolution, in the same breath mostscholars will also tell you that there are anything from 20 to 50 evolutionarysteps between each identified genus or species. Unfortunately we have had noproof or evidence of any of these ‘in-between steps’ of evolution. What thisreally means is that we face a dilemma of many missing links, and not just the‘missing link’ that we often joke about. I know that we have all spotted apotential candidate for the missing link in our neighbourhood, or a potentialcandidate for Homo neanderthals, but you can rest assured that you are mistaken.But then on the other hand, maybe not!Let us go back to around 30,000 years ago. This is the time when Neanderthalsapparently disappeared from Earth. The debate around Neanderthals has beenraging since the first skeleton was discovered in 1857, just two years beforeDarwin published Origin of Species. But it seems that Darwin simply ignored thismomentous find as it did not really fit his model of evolution. Many theorieshave been postulated about this species, mostly depicted as wild savages whowere much more primitive than humans. This seems a little arrogant and probablypremature since we now know that the Neanderthal brain was on average 1,200 -1,750 ml, which would make it approximately 100 ml larger than modern humans. Ifyou consider that we only use 3% - 10% of our brains, just think of what theNeanderthals would have been capable of today.In 1999, the skeleton of a child was unearthed in Portugal. It was dated back to25,000 years ago. It had very strange features which looked like it could be ahybrid between modern human and Neanderthal. This prompted scientists to extractsmall fragments of DNA from three different Neanderthal specimens, which showedthat they were not closely related to any present-day human population.Neanderthal anatomy on the other hand is essentially human in scope, with thesame number of bones as humans, which function in the same manner. There arehowever minor differences in thickness and strength. Based on some rigorousdental studies, it seems that Neanderthals may have had a greater longevity thanmodern humans, which may have also affected their anatomy.The reason I am taking you on this little journey, which I trust will end beforeyou get too bored, is purely to illustrate the complexity and contradictionsthat have been troubling this field of science for centuries. From these highlevels of speculation and uncertainty, others like myself, can take some respitethat although I do not have a Ph.D behind my name, I do understand the fields ofgambling, speculation and deduction.A perfect example of anthropologic contradiction lies in that some evolutionistsclaim that Neanderthals were incapable of modern speech. They apparently lackedthe ability to produce the full range of vowels, because the flat, non-flexingbone at the base of their skull and larynx was positioned higher in the throatthan in modern humans, or even chimpanzees. A computerised reconstruction ofthis part of their anatomy showed that the resonating chamber at the back of themouth was all but eliminated. This obviously supported their argument and placedNeanderthals in a completely different league to humans. But a newreconstruction of the same anatomy showed it to be quite human. What broughtNeanderthals even closer to us modern humans, was a discovery of the mostcomplete Neanderthal skeleton in 1983, which contained the first Neanderthalfossil hyoid bone. This bone is located in the throat and is integral to theformation of sound in speech; it is indistinguishable from that of modernhumans.To add to the intrigue of who these Neanderthal people really were, let me addsome more startling discoveries. In 1996, a small flute made from the thigh boneof a cave bear was found in a cave in Slovenia. It had four precisely alignedholes punctured on one side of the four-inch-long bone, pointing irrefutably toevidence which strongly supports Neanderthal ‘humanness’. Furthermore, they madetools to make other complex tools, buried their dead, had controlled use offire, practised religious ceremonies, used complex syntax in their spokengrammar and played musical instruments.Some Neanderthal graves have stone tools, animal bones, and even flowers buriedin the ground next to their remains. The corpse was not simply dropped into ahole in the Earth without preparation; it was prepared and buried in an unusualposture. This implies an awareness of the ‘after-life’, demonstrates theexistence of formal ritual and is also an indication of strong social ties. Thisis also supported by evidence that Neanderthal individuals with severe cripplinginjuries were cared for. So? Were Neanderthals human and somehow related to us?Or were they just wild and primitive cave men who deserved extinction? Maybe anexplanation of our own humanity may shed some light on the possible answers alittle later in this book.Now that we have dealt with a possible human relative who lived on Earth andshared it with modern humans for around 200,000 years, let us travel furtherback and take a quick look at how the other hominid ancestors fit into thepicture. Once again, the most recent knowledge is constantly under scrutiny andwill most likely be modified as a result of new discoveries in years to come.But years after the first discovery of Australopithecus, scientists still do notrank them as ancestors to humans. In the areas of archaeology and anthropology,like in all the others of science, disagreement is widespread. So, theinformation below should be absorbed with a sense of speculation anduncertainty.Just recently in the year 2000, scientists discovered a possible hominid whichthey call Orrorin tugenensis. It lived around 6 million years ago in Kenya andpossessed clear features which indicate that it walked upright. This wascertainly an early entry for the two-legged race and some dare to say that itmay be one of the many missing links. Certain features, like the teeth ofOrrorin tugenensis, suggest this species could even be more closely related toHomo sapiens than the many Australopithecus species it predates. Like ourmolars, the molars of Orrorin tugenensis were small compared to any of theaustralopithecine teeth. Their teeth also had very thick enamel like ours.Australopithecus afarensis lived from approximately 4 - 2.7 million years agoalong the northern Rift Valley of east Africa, and possibly even earlier. Theyseem to be the root ancestors to all subsequent hominids who were reasonablyadapted for upright walking. But some of the bones in their feet were slightlycurved and looked like the bones you would expect to see in a human ancestor whoclimbed trees. Although they probably lived in flat savannah areas,Australopithecus afarensis was capable of climbing trees in times of danger, andit is possible that they slept in trees, like baboons do in areas where thereare no caves for shelter. Australopithecus afarensis is classified as an ape,not a human: a hominid ape closely related to human beings but not necessarilyan ancestor.So, maybe my friend Jana was right after all. When the apes came down from thetrees and started walking upright, we became human; because the origin ofbipedalism must be seen as the major step in human evolution. Walking around ontheir hind limbs, leaving their forelimbs free for other jobs, was an unusualmode of locomotion for mammals. Suddenly, many things associated with beinghuman became possible. Such as fine manipulation with the hands and carryingfood back to base camp. This does not necessarily mean that four million yearsago primitive hominids evolved upright walking to develop a ‘food-sharing’economy. This kind of behaviour only arose several million years after thedevelopment of upright walking.Australopithecus africanus, or ‘southern ape of Africa’ was actually the firstdiscovery of an early hominid in Africa. They lived between 2 and 3 millionyears ago and probably stood around 4 feet 6 inches tall, which means theywalked upright. Raymond Dart found the well-preserved skull of a child, the‘Taung baby’, in South Africa in 1924 and set the world alight with speculation.Could this be the missing link? For quite a while this speculation did therounds until it became quite clear that the concept of a ‘missing link’ is farmore complex than just one skull. This discovery led to an intense focus onAfrica as the probable site of human origins and early development. ButAustralopithecus africanus shows no signs of tool use or any kind of permanentliving site. Their huge teeth and skulls with prominent dorsal crests and largejaw muscles, show that they specialised in eating tough plant material. Theymust have been vegetarians, while our supposed ancestors evolved as omnivoreswith a taste for meat.The next group of hominids lived around 2.2 - 1 million years ago. They wereAustralopithecus robustus. This seems to have been a more robust version ofAustralopithecus africanus which seems to have outlived its relative in southernAfrica. Also referred to as Paranthropus robustus, or ‘robust near-man’, butvery few fossils of these hominids have been uncovered.At this point we really kick in with humanity. Homo habilis, is the earliestknown species of the genus Homo. The first human species. It existed fromapproximately 2.2 - 1.6 million years ago in east Africa. Only a few fossilremains have been unearthed so far, but they all exhibit a clear trend towards alarger brain size. Homo habilis brains were about 30% larger than those ofAustralopithecus africanus.Next in line was Homo erectus who lived from approximately 2 million to around400,000 years ago. Coming across this information was to me like finding theholy grail. As we will uncover later, it is around this time that the tamperingwith genetics first begins to pop its head out of the pages of prehistory. Basedon ancient scriptures on clay tablets from Sumer, the many steps of humanitywere captured and preserved for us to unravel. These dramatic tales will belooked at in great detail. Homo erectus had a large brain ranging from 900 to1,200 ml. This was a fifty-percent increase in brain size over the older Homohabilis. The largest brain sizes of Homo erectus fall within the range of modernhumans, although the brain is configured somewhat differently than our own, itnevertheless provides a crucial link to the origins of Homo sapiens and our veryfirst direct relatives.The following statement is the kind of scientific babble that truly demonstratesour need to make empty pronouncements, when there is actually not much to say.“The transition from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens, the earliest forms of our ownspecies, occurred approximately 300,000 to 400,000 years ago.” Do yourself afavour and ask any paleoanthropologist to explain to you how exactly thistransition occurred! Unfortunately there is no clear explanation for thisprocess and they rely on some imaginary sequence of events and environmentalconditions that would have speeded up the evolutionary process. What seem to bemissing are the many gradual steps from one form to the other. It is simply notfeasible that the last female of the species woke up one morning and gave birthto a completely new species.What is however very important and impressive is the fact that they found itemssuch as wooden tools and weapons which give evidence of a hunting life­styleamong Homo sapiens. There is much speculation about a 300,000 years old skullwhich was found near Petralona in north-eastern Greece by Dr. Aris Poulianos in1997. He claims that it is the most complete find of early Homo sapiens andbelieves that human civilisation existed on Earth over one million years ago. Hehas produced a variety of tools and other implements which indicate that these‘humans’ had the ability to communicate with speech. There is much more to beexplored around this find, so for now I would like to return to what ishistorically documented in Sumerian tablets.Once again I ask you to place this in your memory banks, as it will be usedfurther as evidence of our birth as a ‘slave species’. A number of 130,000year-old skulls have been found in southern and east Africa, once again givingus a link to the story of human creation. But we will discover that our creationwas followed by 200,000 years of exploitation by a more evolved species whoappeared on this planet out of ‘nowhere’. The rest of the chapters will slowlyintroduce us to these progenitors of the human race, expose the readers to thecalculated steps that were taken to create the ‘primitive worker’ as they calledit, and the years of enslavement that followed.Why is it that we can trace slavery and the obsession with gold all the way backto the very beginning of human origins? Therein lies the terrible truth aboutthe reasons for our existence, our ignorance and our genetic origins. All ofthis information has been carefully handed down to us in cuneiform clay tabletsfrom the earliest days of writing. These tablets will also explain our naturaltendencies; why we look the way we do, and why we could have possiblyexperienced such rapid stages of mental evolution in the past few hundred years.Deep inside our genome, in between all the brutal and barbaric genes, there is anatural tendency for compassion, love and peace, which is encoded, but switchedoff. Sometimes it breaks through the clutter, as the genome evolves and allowsus to move closer to a completely reconstructed DNA; one step closer to aperfect genome and total enlightenment on both the physical and spiritualfronts."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 [../Text/toc.html#chapter5]THE GENOME: HUMAN SOFTWARE PROGRAMME [../Text/toc.html#chapter5a]By the time we reached the year 2000, there were two terms in the globalvocabulary which spread fear and confusion among people around the world.‘Millennium bug’ and ‘cloning’. But hindsight is an exact science, and inhindsight it certainly seems that the first feared item, namely the ‘millenniumbug’was possibly a conspiracy by the global computer industry to rake inbillions of dollars on the back of ignorant consumers. The millennium came andwent with virtually no hiccups but the coffers of the IT sector swelled withunimaginable wealth. The other term that was brandished about carelessly by themedia and swashbuckling journalists trying their best to impress their readerswith their knowledge of this new science, was ‘genetic engineering’. This washighly unfortunate as it was inevitably followed by another new buzz word:‘cloning’. This was very sad, as those two words immediately conjured upgruesome images in the minds of the global population, of ‘butcher-like’scientists, hacking and splicing human genes, while creating an endless numberof humanoid monsters and other unimaginable creatures who will overpopulate theworld. People were imagining horrific tales of human-animal clones and manyother inter-species clones of unthinkable horror. There was talk of cloningextinct animals like the mammoth, sabre tooth tigers and even some dinosaurs.This was however a typical sensationalistic response by the media in an attemptto attract readers and audiences. You see, if they were to report responsibly onthe subject, keeping the facts as scientific and realistic as possible, theywould not have had as large a response from the consumer, whose perception ofscience and progress is pretty much driven by Hollywood.But the lack of understanding of this exciting new field of science was suddenlythrust into the limelight of global politics and attracted the attention ofreligious groups worldwide. In a flash the world had a new ‘evil’ to fight.Lengthy debates on cloning and genetic engineering erupted all over the world,causing one of the most controversial issues of the new millennium. The truth isthat genetic engineering is the most exciting development in the history ofHumankind. As we develop this knowledge and refine our skills in this area, wewill come ever so closer to dealing with most, if not all disease in livingcreatures, but more importantly, we will come to understand our imperfectgenome. This knowledge will help us in speeding up our evolutionary process byunlocking the ‘Junk’ genes which will most likely help speed up our spiritualevolution. What this really means, is that we will not only be able to deal withour physical disorders and malfunctions, but also our mental and spiritualshortcomings. This means we can speed up the evolution towards a violence-freeglobal community that strives for absolute physical and spiritual harmony. Thisis what excites me most about this new science of genetic engineering. Butbefore we can elaborate on this subject, we need to dispel some myths andmisconceptions you may have heard from your mechanic while he was changing youroil.In short, genetic engineering deals with the study of our genome, splicing,duplicating, copying, replacing and any form of manipulation involving genes inour DNA. There is so much interest in the actual activity of genes, and whatkind of effect they have on our bodies, that there is very little time to dreamup the creation of monsters. My assumption is that the most active area ofgenetic engineering is the study of genes for medical research and medicalapplications. After all, we are driven by the ‘greed’ gene, and in a globalcapitalist economy, genetic healing is where all the money and power of thefuture will be. It is now known that genetic engineering will most likely beable to treat any human disease imaginable. It follows that the world will soonbe run by two major players. The media – telling us what to think; and genetics– allowing us to be what we want to be. But we first have to understand muchmore about this field of science before we can make such claims convincingly.So what are genes? We talk about genes as if we see them on a daily basis. As ifwe all have a stash of genes somewhere in our bodies and we can reach in andgrab a handful whenever we need to. Well, to a certain extent this is true,because every cell in our body (with the exception of a few) holds our geneticmaterial in the nucleus of the cell. These are called eukaryotic cells and couldalso be put into the animal cell category, where the chromosomes are in thenucleus of the cells, surrounded by a nuclear membrane. The other kind of cellsare called prokaryotic cells, but we are not dealing with those in thisinstance.Our DNA performs the most complex activities imaginable, and yet the structureof the DNA molecule is so incredibly simple, that it truly baffles the mind. Iam extremely concerned to find that the majority of source material I used,called DNA the ‘most complex molecule in our body’.I strongly disagree. The simplicity with which the molecule is put together isanother indication of the miracle of life and the absolute supreme intelligenceof the creator God with a big G, or the Supreme Being, or whichever name makesyou feel comfortable. I always imagine DNA as a very long line of Lego blocks,made up of only three different colours. If we consider that DNA is a molecularstructure that contains all the codes and information needed to build, controland maintain a living organism, we once again stumble upon the subtle hint thatwe should live forever because DNA should control and maintain a livingorganism. All the programmes and codes that control our body are in this tinymolecule. The structure is actually so simple, that it raises another question.Could the DNA be somehow extended to whatever length we want it to be? Since weonly use 3% of our DNA at present, this suggestion may seem a little premature,but you never know what our future needs may be. I would like to suggest, thatonce we have come to terms with our genetic material and unravelled the mysterybehind its code, we will be able to sculpt future DNA molecules exactly as weneed them. On the other hand, that may already be pre-programmed into themolecule itself, as part of its evolutionary function. In a sense, like themetric system. All you do is add a zero, and you create a new unit of measure.See… that’s how simple it is. But let’s take a quick tour of the genome todemonstrate. For those with molecular science as a major, please skip thissection.Every cell in our body has a nucleus. In this nucleus lies a longdouble-stranded molecule shaped like a twisted ladder, called DNA:deoxyribonucleic acid. This ladder is broken up into 46 chromosomes which pairup into 23 pairs. One side of the chromosome is derived from the mother, theother side from the father. People born with Down’s Syndrome have one extrachromosome, totalling 47 chromosomes, causing their unusual features and brainactivity. Each side of the twisted DNA ladder chromosome is made up of onlythree components. A sugar known as deoxyribose, phosphate, and any one of fourbases which are: adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine. They are represented bythe letters A, T, G and C. That is why scientists get very excited when theyfind traces of phosphate on Mars, which could indicate life possibly driven byDNA. The sugar and the phosphate bind together to form the two parallel sides ofthe DNA ladder and the bases join each other from each side to form the rungs ofthe ladder. But the bases making up the rungs of the DNA ladder can only join ina specific sequence. A joins with T, and G joins with C. It is this specificcombination of A-T and G-C, which contains the codes for life and all thecomplex functions that keep us going. A short stretch of this chromosome, with aunique sequence of A, T, G, C, is referred to as a gene. And because of theunique sequence of the bases, this gene is specifically coded to control aspecific function in the body. This gene can also be identified and mappedbecause of its unique sequence of components. This is referred to as ‘genemapping’. The largest human chromosome contains around 280 million DNA basepairs, and it is estimated that the entire human genome consists of about threebillion base pairs. All this genetic material in the cells of a human is calledthe genome.But genes make up only a tiny fraction of the entire genome. This amazingdiscovery forms the central doctrine of my arguments in this book. Incredibly,our active genes only make up about 3% of the total DNA in our chromosomes. Why?Between each gene there are long stretches of DNA which do not appear to codefor anything. Why would such a complex molecule be created with only 3%functionality? Scientists refer to this as ‘Junk’ DNA because they have notdiscovered what secret messages it is hiding if any. This clearly makes no senseaccording to the evolutionist theory. If the genome was evolving from a simpleto a complex structure, these long sections of the DNA would not exist. It wouldmake sense that a relatively small number of genes may have evolved over time,only to become obsolete, but the fact that 97% of our DNA seems to be inactiveleaves many questions unanswered.One of the obvious arguments for the state of our overextended genome, is thatit was genetically manipulated or tampered with during the early days of ourexistence as a species. Our genome could have been created or copied from anexisting genome of another species, or even tampered with to allow only a smallportion of it to function. If we are able to do this today, why could an equallyadvanced group of beings not have done this to us humans a long time ago? Theancient evidence from our prehistory spells out very clearly that this isactually what happened. We will cover the actual translations of clay tabletswith reference to this in later chapters.When it was decided to sequence the entire human genome, the ‘Junk’ was includedin the project just in case it might have as yet undiscovered significance. Ipredict that such functionality will be discovered as we evolve and discovermore and more. The outcome of the Human Genome Project was that scientistsmanaged to sequence and map our human genome. All three billion base pairs. Thesurprising thing is that 99.9% of the sequence is the same in every single humanon Earth.The Human Genome Project was started in 1990 with its objective to basicallydraw a map of the entire human genome and thereby gain a basic understanding ofthe entire genetic blueprint of a human being. From this map they could thenstart to identify unique sequences which indicate genes and their specialfunctions. The progress on the Genome Project convinced researchers that thethree billion base pairs of the human genome could be fully sequenced by 2003,two years ahead of the original schedule. This success, coupled with the growingsense of urgency and recognition of the value of DNA sequence information, ledto a major acceleration in human genome sequencing in early 1999. Theinternational consortium of public domain laboratories committed to produce a‘working draft’ of the whole genome in the year 2000, as an intermediate step inthe programme, while the complete and fully accurate referenced sequence wouldbecome available during 2003.The international sequencing consortium was releasing new data continuously, assoon as it was available. By the end of 1999, over one billion bases of theworking draft were in the public domain, and amazingly, the ‘two billion basemilestone’ was passed during March 2000. The first complete working draft was amajor scientific milestone for Humankind. This was achieved in June 2000 and thedraft provided an overall outline of the genome. This became an extremely usefulresource for biologists everywhere, for the very first time. But the draft wasnot a fully accurate sequence – work on it continues, and probably will for along time to come as they discover hidden secrets in this seemingly simplemolecule.As is the case in all science and discovery, we are always taken by surprisewhen we least expect it. The genes of many forms of life have an additionalsurprising feature. The genes contain stretches of DNA, called exons, each ofwhich codes for part of a protein, and introns, which are stretches ofnon-coding DNA. The relationship between the inactive introns and junk DNA isnot understood. Genes consist of alternating introns and exons, and theprogrammed genetic codes are contained in several scattered exons, rather than acontinuous stretch of DNA. The largest part of the DNA consists of seeminglynever-ending stretches of junk DNA. In humans, 97% of DNA consists of non codinggenes while in very simple creatures like fruit flies only 17% of the DNAcontains non-coding genes. This is another possible indication of strangemanipulation that must have occurred at some stage in our distant past and tiesup perfectly with the 97% junk DNA discovery. The non-coding introns make nosense in the evolutionary scheme of things. It also means that yeast with only4% non-coding genes and fruit flies with 17% non-coding genes are more evolvedthan humans, within their own DNA structures. At the time of writing this bookthe non-coding gene percentage in apes was not clearly established yet.Bacteria have no introns and biologists are uncertain whether early life formslacked introns, and whether they only evolved into our DNA relatively late whencomplex multi-cellular life arose. That might be so in primitive organisms, butthe perplexing genetic code of humans leaves many questions unanswered. I thinkthe scientists should revisit their theories and turn them around. They shouldfamiliarise themselves with the scriptures of the Sumerians which clearlydescribe genetic manipulation in the process of creating the ‘Adamu’. Thisinformation will help them fill in some of the missing links in the great puzzleof human origins.The arrangement of genes into introns and exons enables the encoded message inone gene to be read in more than one way. The process is called alternativesplicing and has allowed scientists to code as many as 500 different messagesfrom one small stretch of DNA. Alternative splicing is a recent discovery andbiologists do not yet know how important it is in life. What it does point tovery clearly, together with the knowledge that we only use 3% or less of ourgenome, is that we have a long way to go for our genome to become fullyfunctional. It also shows how enormously complex the encoding for humanity canbe, in only a few genes.I raise the primary question once again. What will humans be capable of when thefull potential of the genome is unlocked? OR…What capability was humanity deprived of when all this potential was unpluggedat the point of our creation?We have hardly stumbled upon this incredible discovery, when the insatiablehuman ‘greed’ gene pops its ugly head out. While the people of the world aresquabbling over the ethics of genetic engineering, cloning and other processes,which are mostly driven by emotional outbursts and very little understanding,greedy pharmaceutical giants are attempting to lay claim to and patent some ofthe newly discovered genes. Already they are seeing the future and the fact thatif they can take ownership of some of our genes, they will control all medicalprocedure involving such genes in the future. It does not take a rocketscientist to see where this can lead to. If you ever believed in a conspiracy tocreate a super race of humans on Earth, hold onto your hat. This may just be thebeginning. Once the control of gene therapy lands in the hands of the rich, thiskind of science fiction fantasy will become an instant reality. This is what weshould guard against as the human race. Stop worrying about the cloning and themonsters and the babies without parents, but rather worry about the exclusivecontrol of the human genome by a handful of giant medical firms. As research andknowledge grow, money will be able to buy you everything. Height, hair, eyecolour, muscle tone, sexy features, health and even eternal life. I suspecthowever that the ‘eternal life gene’ will be the last one we shall conquer.There does however seem to be a level of sanity and fairness in global legalcircles. It seems that the patent applications by some of these giants have beenoverturned, as genes are regarded to be the intellectual property of all humansand cannot be exclusively owned by one group or individual. What was suggestedis that companies can protect newly discovered medical procedures or drugs,which results in a desired treatment through genetic manipulation. This willprotect their discoveries from exploitation for the normal 15 to 20 year period,while they recover their research and development costs. This way all the peoplecan benefit from progress without any socioeconomic discrimination.During the past two decades, the first major breakthroughs in finding genesassociated with hereditary diseases were announced. These included examples suchas cystic fibrosis, haemophilia (A and B forms), muscular dystrophy, andHuntington's disease. Each one of these is an example of an inherited diseasecaused by defects in a single gene. More recently, genes have been discoveredwhich contribute to more complex diseases, notably cancers of the bowel, or ofthe breast. These are two examples of the many diseases in which other factors,both in other genes and in the environment, also affect the onset of thedisease. Complex diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and manypsychiatric disorders all involve multiple genes, unlike some defects caused bysingle genes. Yet the multiple gene disorders are by far the most commonconditions affecting human health. Until recently, their sheer complexity haslimited progress in our understanding of these diseases. The access to the humangenome sequence, with a complete catalogue of all human genes, has opened theway to tackling all these conditions, to understand the underlying biology ofeach disease and speed up the development of new and better cures.But sequencing the human genome is only a first step. Now we know that a singlegene can produce more than one protein and that a different set of proteins isfound in each type of cell in the body. The big challenge facing scientists isto map the human ‘proteome’. This map will unveil which proteins are made bywhich genes and which combination of proteins is at work in each type of cell.This process is a little more complex than just mapping the genome and will mostlikely take a lot longer than ten years. But it will transform our understandingof how genes build humans.Since 1999, we have identified a huge number of genes and their activity. Thespeed of new discoveries in genetics has been astounding. Let us take a quicklook at a short list of genes that have been identified and linked to specificactivity. It will give you a glimpse at some of the crucial functions in ourbodies, which we will be able to manipulate in time. Many genes have also beenidentified in plants and animals. As strange as it may seem, their relevance tohuman development can often be paramount. For example, identifying what genesmake plants and insects resistant to radiation and many other characteristicsthat would be of benefit for human survival.Genes in the following areas of activity have been identified:Asthma; lung cancer; breast cancer; Alzheimer’s; hearing; large family of cancergenes; male fertility; radiation resistance – 107 genes; Parkinson’s; humanhereditary genes; fat and obesity; sleep-wake cycle; UV light resistance inplants; hair loss; pain; vision; embryonic development; emphysema; azoospermia;colon cancer; neurodegenerative disease; psoriasis; tumour suppression;epilepsy; skin cancer; juvenile diabetes; cell death clock – 150 genes; learningdisability; bipolar depression; Finnish company Jurilab discovered over 200 newgenes linked to heart attacks and coronary disease.This sample is just a drop in the ocean. Thousands more genes have beenidentified and by the time this book is released, there will be many more. Thereis so much more going on in this field of science that I cannot resist justoutlining a few more examples:Scientists are working on a novel kind of DNA vaccine which could protect peopleagainst a wide variety of conditions: from snake bites to HIV, by directlytriggering the production of antibodies.Biotechnologists in Massachusetts are taking animal genes that makegrowth-promoting proteins and putting them into oysters, to make them maturefaster and produce pearls sooner. The first oysters to undergo the treatmentgrew 2.5 times faster than ordinary oyster shells and they also took less timeto make bigger pearls. What this will do to the value of pearls is anyone’sguess at this point.In a study of identical and non-identical twins, a medical team in London hasshown that acne is 80% genetic. Environmental factors, such as eating the wrongfoods or wearing greasy make-up, are relatively unimportant. They are close toidentifying the genes which control the activity of acne, which will lead tomore effective and cheaper acne treatment.Hans-Hinrich Kaatz and his colleagues at Jena University in Germany did anexperiment which showed that genes introduced into genetically modified plants,jump between species into bacteria in the guts of the animals eating the plants.Could these kind of jumping genes have played a role in speeding up evolution,by jumping from virus to host and altering the host’s genetic structure? Thistheory is presented very strongly by Sir Fred Hoyle in his book Our Place In TheCosmos and we deal with it in more detail in the Panspermia chapter.Researchers in Cincinnati are discovering how small changes in a gene couldinfluence a person’s tendency to abuse opiates, and distinguish between a personwho is unlikely to abuse heroin or one predisposed to it. Discoveries like thiswill make it easier in future to pinpoint and prevent addictions. Researchershave confirmed this finding and have found several new variants of the gene, oneof which appears to protect against drug addiction.A group of genes called ‘novel genes’ apparently undergo a change when a personstarts to develop prostate cancer. This can be used as an early warning system.Now all they have to do is figure out what to do with this gene and they mayreverse the process.Mutations in the FOXP2 gene on chromosome 7, have been found to cause specificlanguage impairment. The gene seems to be necessary for the proper developmentof human speech and language.The 17 CREB genes play a vital part in the mechanism of learning and memory. Ifone of them is not working, no long-term memory can be formed. They are switchedon in real time, when the brain lays down a new memory. This means that the actof learning actually turns on these genes. It is a great argument for theevolution of genes and DNA, as it clearly displays a way in which ‘nature’ workstogether with ‘nurture’. This is the kind of interaction between stimulus andresponse, which may unlock the introns and junk genes under specific conditions,causing the release of previously unused genes, resulting in further evolutionand activation of the genome.Vasopressin and oxytocin are hormones that stimulate bonding behaviour. Thevasopressin receptor gene lies on chromosome 12 in humans and is controlled by apromoter whose length varies between species. In rodents it seems to play a partin forming monogamous pairs, which means to fall in love, in human terms.Different promoter lengths have also been found among humans. This is possiblythe reason why some people cannot hold down a normal relationship. It could alsomean that the probability of divorce is as highly inheritable as is thepossibility of a long and happy marriage.Now, here is some emerging evidence about that elusive ‘violent’ gene I havebeen referring to. Research at the Institute of Psychiatry in London offers afascinating hint of how antisocial behaviour can be affected by an interactionbetween genes and environment. They examined a group of New Zealanders forevidence that an abusive childhood can induce antisocial behaviour. And theyfound that indeed it can. But far more strongly in people of one genotype. Menwho had been maltreated as children and had ‘low-active’ genes for monoamineoxidase A on the X chromosome, were much more likely to get into trouble withthe law. They could be described as violent and display antisocial traits in apersonality test. Those with ‘high-active’ genes were broadly resistant to theeffects of childhood maltreatment. The difference between the high-active andlow-active genes lies once again in the promoter lengths. Long and shortpromoters produce low activity, intermediate promoters produce high activity.A gene called p53 defends you from disease and decay, but p53 also dictates howlikely you are to get cancer and how fast you age. It is probably the mostimportant molecule in the formation of cancer. Faults in the gene itself, or anyof the activities it controls, are likely to be involved in the development ofnearly all tumours. After 25 years of research, we are finally beginning tounderstand how p53 works, and how it either causes or prevents cancer.Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers have identified a large number ofnew genes that control the formation of tiny, hair-like cilia that cover thesurfaces of many organs in a wide variety of creatures. Cilia are also widelypresent in the human body, including the brain, nose, ears, eyes, lungs, kidneysand sperm. These genes are important because cilia are critical for transportand as sensory structures, wherever they are located.The purpose of presenting some of these basic examples is to demonstrate how farwe have come in the field of genetics over the past 25 years. Things that wouldhave been far-fetched then, are commonplace today. We have pushed the boundariesof knowledge way beyond what we thought would be possible. But as we learn, werealise how little we know. It’s as if every new page is just the introductionto a whole book. We must remind ourselves that some of the new truths we havelearnt, will be proven wrong with time. But the need for discovery andexploration is well encoded in our genome and only extinction will put a stop toit. So while we are discovering new scientific breakthroughs and celebrating itsrelevance to our species, we should also celebrate the ‘uncovering’ of oldtruths, from pre-history. The clues and the information that were left behindfor us by our ancient ancestors, in the hope that we may build on theirexperiences, without having to learn much of their hard-earned knowledge allover again. We are a fragile species on a knife’s edge, precariously balancingbetween the rapid evolution towards the universal community of beings, or thedestruction and extinction not only of humanity, but the entire planet. The roadforward is pretty clear. But we must find a speedy solution to the millennia ofpropaganda, religious oppression, dogma and fear which have been entrenched sodeeply in humanity, that it will take some kind of miracle from the real God, torelease those who are trapped by it.Since 1977 when split genes were discovered, much has been written about whyintrons and junk DNA exist. There have been countless theories all taking a stabat this perplexing genetic phenomenon. Like the relationship and relevancebetween introns and exons; various selection mechanisms; selected genereproduction; adaptive genes with a ‘fitness’ advantage; constructionalselection and constructional advantage; the ‘nature-nurture’ controversy; lowand high pleiotropy; genotype-phenotype relationship; evolution of proteins; theeffect of original ‘proto-genes’; critical and non-critical regions; selfishDNA; competition between DNA sequences; new genes evolving and being added tothe genome; useful genes; exon shuffling; high and low modularity; folding genesand their effects; competition between exons; random intron insertion; and manymore complex and even simple issues. Insane stuff, isn’t it?What strikes me is that seemingly all these philosophies have approached thesubject from the perspective that introns and junk DNA are just a waste of spaceon the genome, whose only possible function is that of their relevance ofposition. They may play a role in DNA division, but because all the introns arediscarded by mRNA (messenger RNA) before it duplicates the split DNA strand,introns are actually perceived as an unnecessary waste of space, and adisposable by-product which just happens to be present in our genome. But sinceall human DNA is 99.9% identical, why is this wasted space still present in ourDNA, and how could DNA have evolved into this form when evolution favours thedominant gene? Scientists should shake their own personal dogma about wisdomderived from archaeological discoveries and pay more serious attention to theidea that we may have been created some 200,000 years ago in the image of ourmaker. The makeup of our DNA has a great deal to do with that specific incident.There does not have to be a conflict between evolution and creation. But mostscientists are so blinded by the evolutionist doctrine, that they bluntly refuseto take seriously the relatively new Sumerian translations of the creation ofthe ‘Adamu’. If we can just get our heads around this ‘incredible fairytale’from our distant past, we may just be able to tie up the various loose ends thatdon’t seem to add up. Chromosomal Adam and mitochondrial Eve have both beendated back to the same time around 200,000 years ago. We all share the samegenome with all this wasted space on it, and according to our ‘Adam and Eve’, wehave all had it since the point of creation. These are critical clues, whichlead me to reach only one logical conclusion. The genome was meant to be thelength it is, which happens to be the same length of that of our maker, ourgenetic donor. The genes have however been tampered with, resulting in theremoval or shutting down of most of them (97%), leaving behind an unintelligent,primitive and subservient creature. But many of the undesirable genes of thismaker remained behind in the newly created DNA. If we can get our heads aroundthis, it must mean that much of our anatomy and character is inherited from ourmaker. Let us not forget the very important words which many of us live by, thatwe were created ‘in the image of our maker’.If this is the case, then we need to ask, who was our maker(s)? How evolved werethey? How smart were they really? How much of their genome did they use comparedto ours? Because according to my theory, if they had the perfect completegenome, they certainly did not behave accordingly. They certainly created a bigmess on this planet, leaving their offspring to survive and fend for themselvesin the kindergarten of the universal community of beings. Is this the way wewill behave when we start to colonise Mars?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6 [../Text/toc.html#chapter6]PANSPERMIA [../Text/toc.html#chapter6a]I have often wondered why so many depictions of aliens from space carry suchresemblance to us humans. All those who claim to have been abducted, or thosewho have been contacted by aliens, mostly describe them in very similar fashion.The strange thing is that these aliens seem to have features similar to humansand not some other insect-like monster from space. Is it because the individualwho claims to have seen these aliens may simply be hallucinating or projectingour own image onto them? Or could it be the influence of mass media and the manymovies that have graced our screens depicting aliens mostly in a humanoid form?Or could there possibly be a more logical or possibly even scientificexplanation for this curious phenomenon? Since we have come to know that theEarth is not the centre of the universe, and that the universe is quite possiblyendless, we can start opening our minds to new possibilities. But like manythings we ‘seem’ to have discovered in the last two centuries on Earth, we findout that they have already been discovered by our distant ancestors. It isespecially true for the subject of astronomy. The ancient Mesopotamians,Egyptians, Greeks, Chinese and Americans, all had a superior knowledge of thecosmos compared to us today. They knew things about the planets and our solarsystem that we in the so-called western world only rediscovered in the latterparts of the 20th century.One such cosmic phenomenon which was reintroduced into modern cosmology in the1970s was the ancient Greek concept of Panspermia. This word can be translatedas ‘seeds everywhere’ and its first recorded advocate was a Greek philosopherknown as Anaxagoras of Clazomenae in Asia Minor, born about 500 BC. He was froma noble family, but wishing to devote himself entirely to science, he gave uphis property to his relatives and relocated to Athens, where he lived inintimacy with Pericles. Shortly before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War hewas charged with impiety, which was, ‘denying the gods recognised by the State’.He not only had the honour of giving philosophy a home in Athens, where itflourished for a thousand years, but he was the first philosopher who introduceda spiritual principle which gives matter life and form. Anaxagoras laid down hisdoctrine in a prose work entitled On Nature of which only fragments arepreserved. Anaxagoras postulated the idea of independent elements which coexistin space and air, creating life. He called them ‘seeds’. They are the ultimateelements of combination and are indivisible, imperishable ‘primordia’ ofinfinite number, and differing in shape, colour, and taste. Later writersreferred to these seeds as ‘omoiomereia’ which was an expression of Aristotle,meaning “particles of like kind with each other and with the whole that is madeup of them”.It is fascinating how the ancient ‘gods’ seem to make their appearance in thestrangest places at the strangest times. Here we are trying to unravel theorigins of a completely different subject, and yet we find that our protagonistAnaxagoras’ life was greatly influenced by the ancient gods because he ‘deniedthe gods who were recognised by the state’. It is very clear that these ancientgods must have had a firm hold on the Greek authorities. The fact that aphilosopher was jailed because he disobeyed the gods, goes a long way insupporting the outlandish theory that these gods must have had a real hold overthe ancient kings. And as we will find out, their control was absolute.When Panspermia was reintroduced in the '70s by a handful of serious scientists,it was met with loads of criticism and the kind of ridicule which has beenexperienced by most visionaries throughout human history. Somehow Aristotle gotin on the act some 2,400 years ago with his theory of ‘spontaneous generation’,which had become the preferred philosophy until recent times. It was howevergrossly abused and misused by creationists ever since to support theirnarrow-minded religious beliefs, which portray a romantic picture of Adam andEve in the garden of Eden.But then in 1864, Louis Pasteur shocked the scientific world with his landmarkexperiment, disproving the concept of spontaneous generation. This discoveryalso had a practical impact on medicine, proving that germs are the primarycauses and carriers of disease. In a simple experiment using a sterilised flask,he showed that a culture can grow in the flask only if germs enter it, and thatplain air cannot initiate the growth of micro-organisms. “There is no knowncircumstance in which it can be confirmed that microscopic beings came into theworld without germs, without parents similar to themselves.” (Louis Pasteur,1864.). He clearly demonstrated that life comes only from life. If thisprinciple had been accepted as the fundamental theory on the origins of lifethen, today we may still be unsure how life on Earth began, but at least wewould approach the question differently. We would assume that life here had tobe seeded somehow and we would investigate the possible mechanisms for suchseeding. Is it possible for bacteria and other microscopic organisms to come toEarth from space? Can they survive harsh conditions, radiation, extremetemperatures for long periods of time? Maybe even millions of years?Since Mr. Pasteur made his discovery, many scientists have supported hisfindings with their own voices and their own experiments. But the real twistcame in the '70s when British astronomers Sir Fred Hoyle and ChandraWickramasinghe rekindled international interest in Panspermia. While theirstatements were quickly dismissed by the majority of the scientific world as anold-fashioned philosophy, their experimental evidence could not be ignored. Butas time passed and these renewed theories attracted more interest from a growingfield of scholars, the evidence presented became overwhelming. Suddenly,Panspermia attracted a new, more appropriate name in the form of ‘CosmicAncestry’. But to prove this Cosmic Ancestry theory required some solid proofand evidence. After all, scientists all say they work with evidence… don’t they?This is really the fundamental difference between them and theologians… or isit? It seems to me that as time passes by, the tenets of science are firmlyrooted in the speculative and the possible, more often than in the proven. Evenin the face of irrefutable evidence there is always an element of error that mayhave crept in. This is the stuff of science. Always has been and probably alwayswill be, at least until we attain that perfect genome status, which willhopefully elevate us beyond the need to know the physical, while putting usfirmly in touch with the spiritual.So, to argue the possibility of life arriving on Earth from space requires someproof of life in space… and if it does exist, how does it reach Earth… and onceit has reached Earth, what kind of role can it possibly play in the creation oflife, evolution or the speeding up of evolution? This is what Hoyle andWickramasinghe proved in the early '70s. By using spectroscopic analyses oflight from distant stars, they showed that there was evidence of life in theinterstellar dust. This dust exists throughout space as leftover matter from thecreation of stellar systems and contains microscopic organisms like bacteria. Itis also possible that there may be viruses and other organic material present inthis so-called dust. It got there as a result of cosmic collisions of spacebodies like planets and even supernovas, which occur when a star explodesspreading its content over vast distances of space. By definition this reallymeans that the universe must be filled with life of all kinds. Given its sizeand age, there have been cosmic collisions occurring for billions of years. Theadditional fact that the universe is growing at the speed of light, creatingunimaginable numbers of stars and planets, creating more matter that can collidein space, spreading more living organisms throughout space, every millisecond ofEarth-time. Now that we have the evidence, the next step is to convince theworld that such life could actually reach our planet, or any other planet.Obviously these organisms will only survive and flourish on planets withconditions favourable for their growth. So how does this dust filled with lifereach our planet and other planets?We will discuss the presence of asteroids and comets in space. Comets areprobably the most fascinating objects in the universe. I say universe, becausethe assumption is that if they exist in our solar system they will most likelyexist in others. The more we study comets, the more they take us by surprise andevery year reveals amazing new facts. The latest estimates are that all thecomets in our solar system actually outweigh the total mass of the planets. Ifthis is true, and much of the evidence about their ability to distribute livingorganisms throughout space is also true, it certainly turns comets into theprimary distributors of life in the universe.Comets are thought to be leftover matter from the creation of solar systems andhave been described as giant ‘dirty’ snowballs on some kind of orbit around thesun. These orbits are very erratic and can vary from a few years to manythousands of years. Asteroids, on the other hand, are thought to be leftoverpieces of planets or moons due to cosmic collisions. There is still a lot ofdebate about the difference between the two. It is possible that asteroids arejust the remains of old comets whose ice and dirt have been burnt off andevaporated over thousands of years of travelling in space – either by gettingtoo close to the sun or too close to other large bodies which radiate heat; oreven the constant radiation of distant stars and solar winds. As comets andasteroids fly through space they pick up bacterial life from the interstellardust, which gets embedded in the ice and rock. The ice in comets covers andprotects the microscopic organisms on their journey through space. The cometbecomes the carrier for the living organism and together they can journey forlonger than humanity has been on Earth. The latest findings are that microscopiclife can survive indefinitely under the right conditions. This means that oncethe 'living space dust' is embedded in the comet, it can survive for as long asit takes to be deposited on some hospitable planet.The tail behind the comet is quite spectacular and can stretch for millions ofkilometres. It consists of gas and dust which is discharged from the coma(nucleus head) and will contain many of these microscopic living particles.Thousands if not millions of comets have come into close proximity to Earth,leaving behind billions of miles of living space debris from their tails. Thesecomets cross the paths of many planets, leaving behind the living debris waitingto pounce on an unsuspecting cosmic body. When the comets are close to the suntheir activity increases and they discharge as much as one million tons of gasand living dust into space every day. As the planets orbit the sun they willinevitably travel through this living debris, which get trapped by thegravitational pull of the planet.But how many of these comets can there possibly be? Millions may have passedclose to the sun in the past, but would the solar winds not drive their spacedust away, into deep space? This is where that amazing human nature resurfaces,to remind us of how suspicious we are of each other and how obsessed we are withconflict. In the '60s when space activity increased around the Apollo moonlandings, US intelligence photographed many explosions in the outer limits ofthe atmosphere, while on the lookout for enemy missiles. They were obviouslywaiting for an attack from the Soviets and therefore these cosmic events musthave really given them a scare. But luckily they soon realised that it was notthe enemy, but comets and other space objects between 30 and 50 metres indiameter, which were exploding when entering the upper atmosphere. Thisinformation was apparently kept classified until 1994 and the realisation ofwhat was actually happening possibly prevented a full scale nuclear war.It seems that US intelligence has lightened up a little since the fall of thethe USSR, because on the 28 of May 1997, NASA announced the incredible news thatthousands of comets “as large as houses”, enter Earth’s atmosphere every day.They actually break up and are destroyed at between 1,000 and 20,000 kilometresabove Earth. The principal investigator for NASA’s polar spacecraft instruments,Dr. Lewis A. Frank, described their descent as a “relatively gentle cosmicrain”. This information also feeds the theory that all the water on Earthactually also arrived from space.The miraculous thing about comets, is that because they are made up mainly ofice, organic compounds trapped inside, such as bacteria, viruses and evenlarvae, can remain in suspended animation for thousands of years. In fact, it isnow believed that bacteria, spores and viruses can survive in comets forever,until they are either destroyed or deposited in a life-friendly environment.There have been many scientists who vigorously supported the distribution oflife from space, before Hoyle and Wickramasinghe reintroduced it to the world.Sir Isaac Newton was just one of them. He was convinced that the continuedarrival of cometary material on Earth was essential for life on this planet.Since then it has been calculated that roughly 1,000 tons of cometary debrisenters the Earth’s atmosphere annually.But comets and asteroids either crash into us, or they explode in theatmosphere, or they burn up in the atmosphere. Remember that these cosmic bodiesare travelling in space at incredible speeds of between 10 km per second to asmuch as 100 km per second. But because there is no friction, the speed is not afactor. It does however become a factor when these objects get sucked towards aplanet and enter its atmosphere. The friction in the atmosphere starts to slowthe objects down, heating them up in the process. This has been one of the majorhurdles NASA had to deal with, to protect the space shuttles against burning upon re-entry from space. We saw the tragic accident when some of the protectivetiles were dislodged and the shuttle Columbia disintegrated because of theintense heat which resulted, while on its way back to Earth from theInternational Space Station.So now we know that there are constant minor cosmic collisions in which Earth isinvolved and we have witnessed some spectacular collisions betweennear-neighbour Jupiter and a giant comet in 1994. We recognise that the planetsand moons bear the crater scars of giant collisions from the distant past andthe asteroid belt looks like it could be the leftover matter from a planet thatwas destroyed in a cosmic collision. Is it not possible that at some stage inthe distant past Earth was also involved in a cosmic collision? The kind ofcollision, which could be responsible for the strange phenomenon that all theland on Earth at the beginning of Earth-time, was concentrated together on oneside of the planet, while the other had a gaping hole filled with water? Acollision of this kind between Earth and another planet would have resulted inthe contamination and sharing of the seeds of life between the two planets. Asthey moved apart, the one settled in an orbit around the sun where Earth is atpresent, while the other planet was spun into an orbit that took it into deepspace, very similar to the orbits of many comets. As these planets evolved andlife on them evolved, they would have shared many similar species of animals andplants originating from the shared seeds of life, transferred between themduring their collision. Should we be surprised to find similar kinds of animalspecies and plant species on both planets? It seems highly feasible that giventheir shared seeds of life, they should be evolving along similar paths. As thelarger of the planets round the sun every couple of thousand years and theirhumanoid inhabitants come to Earth to observe the activity on such a beautifulplanet, should we be surprised that the so-called ‘aliens’ we encounter sharemany human-like features with us? We will revisit this topic later as we unravelthe Sumerian scriptures.EVIDENCE OF CRATERS ON COSMIC BODIESVirtually all cosmic bodies have craters, which remind us of the violent cosmicpast during which the seeds of life were transmitted throughout the universe.[../Images/64-1.jpg] [../Images/64-2.jpg] Asteroid Eros Comet Wild 2[../Images/65-1.jpg] [../Images/65-2.jpg] Tswaing crater, Pretoria, South Africa1.8km across created by a 30m meteor Craters on Earth’s moon[../Images/65-3.jpg] [../Images/65-4.jpg] Planet Mercury Callisto - Moon OfJupiterWhile some comets and asteroids explode in the atmosphere, and others explodejust before impact several kilometres above ground, as a result of thetremendous air pressure which builds up ahead of it, some actually do end upcrashing into the ground. I am sharing this with you because it’s the kind ofstuff we always see in sci-fi thrillers, but we never realise how real it allis. As they say, ‘truth is stranger than fiction’, and this certainly applies tothe stuff that is going on around us in space.The best known atmospheric explosion of a meteoroid happened above Tunguska incentral Siberia on the 30th June 1908. The explosion flattened the forest forroughly 15 kilometres in every direction, completely devastating thousands ofsquare kilometres of the forest. It was apparently heard up to 600 kilometresaway and seen over 1,000 kilometres away. There are reports from Paris, France,that shortly after the event, pedestrians stopped to see an eerie, unusual glarein the east. The object was most likely a meteor, estimated to be around 60metres in diameter, because a comet that size would have exploded higher in theatmosphere. But nobody investigated the site until 20 years after the explosion,which leaves the evidence a little sparse. There must be some sort of magneticcomet target in Siberia because a similar atmospheric explosion occurred againin 1947. Poor Russians. An atmospheric explosion is much gentler on the invadingmeteor than a full impact. It allows the content of the meteor to be dispersedover a wide area without being destroyed by the shock of the impact. The effecton the planet is however much more devastating when the object explodes abovethe ground. This is what the bomb experts in the 2nd World War realised beforethey dropped the first nuclear bombs on Japan.In March 1965, a 7-metre object exploded approximately 30 kilometres aboveRevelstoke in Canada. Investigators arrived promptly and recovered manyfragments a few millimetres in size. The amazing thing was that most of themwere not altered by heat, proving that a plausible delivery mechanism for livingcells from space is not only feasible, but most certainly possible. But thegreatest volume of organic space matter comes to Earth in the form of dust. Thisdelivery system far outweighs the deposits from impacts of asteroids and comets.Okay, so if life can survive a large impact, how does it survive the trip insmall dust particles through the atmosphere? Surely the heat or the X-rays andeven UV radiation will kill microscopic organisms that are so exposed? Somestartling discoveries have been made about this method of the transport of lifefrom space to Earth.Besides being able to survive UV radiation levels 3,000 times higher than humanscan, many bacteria actually thrive at temperatures higher than boiling point.Since bacteria and viruses have been known to possess the ability to mutate veryrapidly while spreading new forms of disease, causing havoc in the medical fieldand in the preparation of antibiotics, it is plausible that they could mutatevery quickly from a state in which they reside in space, to an adapted state forconditions on Earth. Bacteria actually have built-in cellular equipment that canhelp them survive sudden heating in space. They are called ‘heat-shock’proteins, which respond in seconds to external stimuli in bacteria. It seemsthat these heat shock proteins are closely related across a wide range ofspecies. This is simply one protective mechanism which allows these organisms toarrive alive on Earth, despite drastic and sudden temperature changes. I amconvinced that these proteins will be the subject of great interest to geneticengineers, once they have figured out how to incorporate those genes into thehuman DNA. With genetic engineering, anything is possible, even developing a newhuman characteristic similar to that of a bacterium that can resist suddenchanges in temperature. This would help our human space exploration endeavoursgreatly, and probably be a necessary scientific process to help NASA reach moreinhospitable places in space.To get back to the vulnerability of organisms in space, it has also beenestablished that a dust layer only a few microns thick will protect thecontained microbe against UV radiation very successfully. So the organisms movetowards Earth through the mesosphere, about 120 kilometres above the surface ofEarth where various gases may also protect them from X-rays. Then they descendthrough the stratosphere for a few days where they are protected from UVradiation by the ozone. After this they drop quite quickly to the surface. Thiscan be on mountain tops, rivers, deserts or wooded areas, basically spreadinginto every nook and cranny of the planet.We have all seen shooting stars at night and many of us quickly make a wish,because somewhere back in time this became a ritual for some unknown reason. Iwonder if the origins of this tradition have anything to do with ancientpeople’s beliefs that comets and shooting stars were often associated withplagues and diseases? The wish was possibly more of a prayer for health andprotection against the disease announced by the fiery messenger in the sky.Shooting stars are actually small meteors that enter the atmosphere and fall tothe ground while burning up. Most of them evaporate, but many do land up on thesurface of Earth. So every time you see a shooting star, you may be witnessingthe arrival of extraterrestrial life on Earth. But if shooting stars burn up inthe atmosphere, will the microorganisms survive the trip? When tiny meteoroidsof a few centimetres crash to Earth they burn up and evaporate. Particles thesize of a pinhead will move at about 10 km per second and heat up to about 3,000degrees Celsius. This is enough to kill any organism entering the atmosphere.But bacteria and viruses are much smaller than pinheads and they do momentarilyheat up to about 500 degrees Celsius after entering the atmosphere. Is thisenough to destroy them?The University of Wales experimented with Escherichia Coli bacteria underextreme temperatures to determine if the bacteria can withstand quicktemperature bursts of up to 700 degrees Celsius for periods of about 20 seconds.The amazing thing is, the bacteria survived and after being placed in a nutrientbroth, it grew back to normality. These experimental temperatures are moreextreme than that which would apply to a micro-organism. The organism would slowdown quickly, only being exposed to high temperatures for a few seconds, afterwhich it will gently descend to Earth.In the '70s Hoyle and Wickramasinghe received high levels of ridicule for theirproposals but through their excellent scientific corroboration, their criticswere silenced, and today it is pretty much universally accepted that spacecontains the ‘ingredients’ of life. But their theory went a bit too far for somewhen they suggested that all life comes from space. Including bacteria, viruses,protozoa, seeds, pollen, other bits of organic material containing more complexDNA and even larvae.There is another theory for evolution of life on Earth referred to as ‘Gaia’.This was introduced in the early '70s by James Lovelock who proposed that lifecontrols Earth’s environment to make it suitable for life. It is this Panspermiaand Gaia combination of theories that others have referred to as CosmicAncestry.A strange combination of Darwinian evolution and spontaneous creation. Itpostulates that while evolution drives all living organisms, life has alwaysexisted in the universe before it arrived on Earth, and Earth was just anotherdestination point in the universal path of natural selection while life wasspreading to other planets. Well, that’s how I understand it at least. I findthis very confusing and unnecessary to say the least. What seems more logical isthat all the planets in the universe have had, or will have continuous exposureto new life from the interstellar soup of microscopic life. Some planets havehad life for much longer than others and have been able to evolve more overtime. But the big question remains – where did the original life forms beginbefore they were distributed throughout the universe so successfully? This is aquestion for philosophers more than biologists and scientists, so I will leavethis subject for them to debate. We will see that some of the questions aboutour origins as humans may point us towards some unorthodox answers about themuch bigger question regarding the origin of life. I must point out that myobjectives in this book are more to do with uncovering our human origins, andnot necessarily finding the origins of life. The following events have beenpresented as evidence for the theory of Cosmic Ancestry. It does not seem to domuch more than present irrefutable evidence to support Panspermia in itsoriginal form:• 19 May 1995: Two scientists at Cal Poly showed that bacteria can survivewithout any metabolism for at least 25 million years; they are probablyimmortal. • 24 November 1995: The New York Times ran a story about bacteria thatcan survive radiation much stronger than any that Earth has ever experienced. •7 August 1996: NASA announced fossilised evidence of ancient life in meteoriteALH 84001 from Mars. • 27 October 1996: Geneticists showed evidence that manygenes are much older than the fossil record would indicate. Subsequent studieshave strengthened this finding. • 29 July 1997: A NASA scientist announcedevidence of fossilised microscopic life forms in a meteorite not from anyplanet. • Spring, 1998: A microfossil that was found in a meteorite andphotographed in 1966, was recognised by a Russian microbiologist as amagnetotactic bacterium. • Fall, 1998: NASA’s public position on life-from-spaceshifted dramatically. • 4 January 1999: NASA officially recognised thepossibility that life on Earth comes from space. • 19 March 1999: NASAscientists announced that two more meteorites hold even stronger fossilisedevidence for past life on Mars. • 26 April 2000: The team operating the massspectrometer on NASA’s Stardust mission announced the detection of very largeorganic molecules in space. Non-biological sources for organic molecules solarge are not known. • 19 October 2000: A team of biologists and a geologistannounced the revival of bacteria that are 250 million years old, strengtheningthat case that bacterial spores can be immortal. • 13 December 2000: A NASA teamdemonstrated that the magnetosomes in Mars meteorite ALH 84001 are biological. •June 2002: Geneticists reported evidence that the evolutionary step from chimpsto humans was assisted by viruses. • August 2004: Photos of fossilisedcyanobacteria in a meteorite were reported by a NASA scientist.Source: Brig Klyce - www.panspermia.org [http://www.panspermia.org]Throughout history comets have been associated with diseases and plagues whichfollowed closely after the comets’ appearance and disappearance. We also nowknow that thousands of small comets evaporate in the upper atmosphere daily,releasing their precious content to rain down on us. Viruses and bacteria canmutate rapidly, infiltrating our cells and causing random changes to specificgenes, which may result in evolutionary changes quite rapidly in a chosenspecies. This leads to the conclusion that rapid jumps in the physical evolutionof species can occur and have occurred.One such beautiful example, which was reported in New Scientist in the November13 edition of 2004, is the sudden appearance of bats in the world some 50million years ago. This is a real evolutionary dilemma, because until now, therehave been no fossils found of any intermediate animal linking their rodentancestors to modern bats. But a gene called BMP2 changed all this around 50million years ago. This gene is present in bats but not in mice. How did thisgene suddenly appear? Given some of the theories we have covered in this book,it is possible that the genome caused itself to evolve as part of the ‘selfimprovement process’ within a species. This seems a little far-fetched as itwould mean that humans could also evolve in this direction and start to fly, ifour ‘feedback’ or natural process of selection determined that we as humanswould be better off flying. But herein lies the rub as far as I can see. If ourhuman genome already has its ‘foundation’ or its entire structure pre-erected,it must be in some sort of state of suspension just waiting for the rightsequence of genes to fill the empty space. It will therefore reject any aliengene combinations and only allow predetermined genes to fill the inactive spacestaken up by junk DNA. But this is a theoretical situation with humans, becausewe suspect that our DNA has been tampered with. This situation will however notapply to creatures like rodents, which evolved into bats. So what else couldhave caused the BMP2 gene in bats to suddenly appear? Realistically, as FredHoyle has shown, it could have been a viral effect on the DNA of the speciescausing some kind of mutation in the cells, which resulted in the subtle butdramatic change in its genetic structure.[../Images/70-1.jpg]BACTERIUMBut what is a virus? And what actually happens when a virus infects our body?There are thousands of different viruses recognised by biologists, but it ispossible that millions may exist. We all know viruses very well from gettingcolds and flu. A relatively common virus can sometimes cause unimaginablecarnage and death in humans. The 1918 flu epidemic killed around 20 millionpeople and every year about 36,000 people die from a simple bout of flu in theUSA alone. The Hutchinson Dictionary of Science describes a virus as follows:“An infectious particle consisting of a core of DNA or RNA, enclosed in aprotein shell. Viruses are not cellular and they can only reproduce by invadingother living cells where they use the host cell’s system to replicatethemselves. In the process they can actually disturb and alter the host's DNA.The healthy human body reacts by producing an antiviral protein calledinterferon which tries to prevent the infection from spreading to adjacentcells. Viruses mutate very quickly to prevent the host from developing permanentresistance.”[../Images/71-1.jpg]SPOREWhen we get flu, the viruses attack our cells, break the cell wall and spill thecontents into the spaces between cells. This causes a number of unpleasant sideeffects, swelling, pain, runny nose, headaches, inflammation and more. Then itinteracts with our DNA by first splitting the double-helix strand and attachingitself to one of the strands. The virus then replicates itself many times, whileour body tries to fight this invader with its own immune defence system. At somepoint the virus exits the cell, leaving our DNA to recombine the two strands ofthe double-helix once again. It can happen that the DNA strands recombineincorrectly, resulting in different activities of the genes. In an instant wehave the beginnings of a possible mutation or even an initial step towardsevolution of that organism. Viruses can mutate so quickly, it is impossible tokeep up with the development of new vaccines. It is clear to see that virusesare perfect organisms that are made for survival. If they have the ability toinvade our genome and cause dramatic disfigurative disease and death, is it notpossible that they can be equally responsible for genetic mutations that havethe opposite effects, which can lead to positive evolutionary steps? Would itnot be in the interest of the viral DNA to develop a stronger, more resilienthost to ensure its own continued survival? A perfect argument for the ‘selfishgene’ in some respects.Bacteria on the other hand are microscopic organisms, each one consisting of asingle cell which has no nucleus. Bacteria can be found virtually everywhere onEarth. Even in the most inhospitable places with high acidity, high temperaturesand low temperatures. Some bacteria are parasites that can be very harmfulbecause they produce toxins. Others can be beneficial to humans and sometimeseven vital for our survival, like the digestive bacteria in our stomachs.Bacteria have DNA but also additional small circular pieces of DNA calledplasmids. These plasmids carry additional genetic information and move freelybetween bacteria even if they are of a different species. Plasmids are alsoresponsible for bacterial resistance to antibiotics but they are very usefultools in genetic engineering. The staggering thing about bacteria is theirability to reproduce in as little as 20 minutes. They normally divide into twonew equal cells through a process called binary fission. Other single-cellorganisms like amoeba also divide in this way. Scientists estimate that we haveonly identified between 1% and 10% of bacteria on Earth. This figure willprobably remain this low, as new bacteria arrive from space every minute of theday. New Scientist published an article in October 2004, in which they describelightning as “nature's own genetic engineer”. When lightning strikes the ground,it kills the organisms within a specific radius, but the bacteria further awayhave been shown to undergo changes in their DNA. Timothy Vogel from theUniversity of Lyon, said that the bacteria actually take up any kind of “stray”DNA as a result of the shock: “This could explain why gene swapping is so commonamong bacteria.” They also suggest that this phenomenon will help bacteriaevolve very quickly. Until now scientists have been puzzled by the rate ofevolution in bacteria because the natural rate of new DNA uptake did not matchtheir findings. This new discovery has gone a long way to explain the rapidrates of evolution in various life forms on Earth.Most people think of bacteria as nasty little things that should be obliteratedwith new knowledge… ‘We don't need bacteria… they just cause trouble and make ussick.’ But we should realise that life on Earth would most likely be impossiblewithout bacteria and when scientists say that the universe is teeming with life,they can back it up because of the properties of bacteria.Let’s first look at the crucial role bacteria play in human life. We have morebacteria in our bodies than we have human cells. They pass from mother to babyin breast milk virtually as soon as the baby is born. It is now known that thestruggle for equilibrium by bacteria in babies plays a vital role in theirdevelopment. While some bacteria are harmful and may cause the slowing down ofdevelopment and growth, other bacteria are vital for our health. It is now knownthat giving young babies various probiotics, for example Lactobacillus, willreduce conditions like eczema and allergy later in life. The following are thepredominant bacteria living in our gastrointestinal tract:• Stomach - Lactobacillus; Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; Enterobacteria;Yeasts.There is between 0-1,000 bacteria per ml. • Duodenum - Lactobacillus;Streptococcus; Bifidobacterium; Staphylococcus; Enterobacteria; Yeasts.100 - 100,000 bacteria per ml. • Small intestine - Bifidobacterium; Bacteroides;Lactobacillus; Streptococcus; Staphylococcus; Clostridium; Enterobacteria;Yeats.1,000 - 10,000,000,000 bacteria per ml. • Colon - All the above plusFusobacterium; Peptostreptococcus; E. Coli; in huge quantities of up to10,000,000,000,000 bacteria per gram.Source: New ScientistWhen Fred Hoyle says that there is organic life everywhere in the universe, henot only substantiates it with scientific proof, but he also explains that suchproof of life is only possible if we take into account how bacteria canmultiply. Then suddenly it all makes a great deal of sense and we can easilyexplain where such an abundance of life in space comes from. If you take asingle bacterial cell in favourable conditions, the average time for it toduplicate itself is about two hours. One makes two, two makes four, four makeseight and so on. This means that by the end of the first day you will have acolony too small to be seen by the naked eye. But in two days the colony of 1000will become 1,000,000 which suddenly becomes just visible with the naked eye andis about a tenth the size of a pinhead. After 4 days you will have1,000,000,000,000 bacteria which will weigh about 1 gram. In 5 days the colonywill weigh about 1 kilogram and in 6 days you will have a ton of bacteria. Everyday the weight will grow by 3 zeros, which should give you a pile of bacteriathe size of Mount Everest in just 11 days. It will take only 13 days to producethe weight of Earth in bacteria, our galaxy in 19 days and the estimated visibleuniverse in just 22 days. So when people ask how it is possible that there issuch an abundance of organic life in the universe, you can explain it to themvery simply by using these facts.It seems that airborne infectious diseases, plagues and epidemics literarilydescend upon the people of the world like a blanket from the sky. And yet formillennia people believed, and men of science and medicine believed, that thesediseases were passed on from person to person. It does not need a scientist toconclude that it is impossible for these infections to spread worldwide, fromperson to person within hours or a few days, and yet this happens every yearwith the coming of the flu season. These diseases can be linked to the periodicappearance of a number of comets which leave behind their millions of tons ofliving debris as they fly by the Earth on their irregular orbits. This is alsotrue for the horrific plagues of the past. It seems to tie up quite logically. Acomet flies in close proximity to our planet, filling space with deadlyunearthly pathogens; a few weeks later the planet flies through this debrisminding its own business, but collecting deadly bacteria on its way. Before youknow, the world is covered in this microscopic alien species, causing diseasesand havoc because our bodies have to generate a brand new form of resistancewhich we do not possess.Some archaeologists think that the Pharaohs used their knowledge of viruses andbacteria to cast so-called spells on their tombs. By including an ancient strandof bacteria or viruses in their tombs, these organisms simply went into‘suspended animation’ while trapped inside the tomb, only to be reactivated whenthe tomb raiders opened the tomb up a few thousand years later. The unexplaineddeaths of well known archaeologists shortly after entering the tombs havepuzzled scholars for decades. If we attempt to explain it in terms of viruses orbacteria, we can rapidly remove the ‘dark wizardry’ out of the equation. Thebacteria have been locked up for a long time and probably do not exist on Earthin their original form any more. This means that our bodies are not used to thebacterium and cannot develop antibodies quickly enough. The result is swift andtragic. Other examples of this kind of pre-historic contamination are bacteriathat have apparently survived for 4,800 years in the brickwork of Peruvianpyramids; and for 11,000 years in the gut of a well-preserved mastodon; andpossibly even 300 million years in coal.But some bacteria have an even more effective survival strategy, they formspores. Spores are bacterial cells with thick protective coats in a completedormant state.In this form they can basically survive forever. Many plagues of the OldTestament can be explained very comfortably by bacterial phenomena. In just oneexample around 1,200 BC, God punished the Philistines for an attack on theHebrews, by ‘emrods in their secret parts’. Emrods are translated as bubos whichoccur as a result of bubonic plague. The plague among humans has become welldocumented since the 14th century and some scientists still cling onto thetheory that it was caused by fleas which carried the bacterium to humans fromrats which were infested with the Pasteurella pestis bacterium. While this mayhave been the case in a small number of infections, we have clearly shown inChapter 11 how impractical the spread of such an infection is, when attributedto rats and fleas only.So what have we learnt in this chapter? That cosmic collisions have beenoccurring for billions of years; that asteroids and especially comets arecarriers and distributors of life in the universe; that life exist in abundanceeverywhere in space; and that life comes to Earth from space every second ofevery day as it has been for millions of years. We also discovered that bacteriaand viruses can mutate very rapidly, possibly causing plants and animals tomutate by interacting with their DNA, and that electricity and otherenvironmental factors cause bacteria and viruses to mutate on their own. Allthis information leads to the conclusion that Panspermia is no longer a dubioussector of science, but the predominant theory of how life arrived on Earth andthat larger cosmic collisions between planets would result in the transfer andsharing of much of their respective organisms, which would lead to a parallelevolutionary development on two separate planets.So, if we can accept these scientific findings of the past 30 years, why shouldwe not accept the possibility that a species similar to us may have evolved onsuch a parallel planet? All we need to do now is to prove that such a planetexists in the depths of our own solar system and we may very well have theanswer why aliens are often described with a striking resemblance to us humans.The strangest thing is that it has been revealed to us many times in the past,but we seem to be determined to ignore it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [../Text/toc.html#chapter7]PLANET X [../Text/toc.html#chapter7a]I was 22 years old, during my first year out of varsity, trying desperately tobecome a pop star. But deep inside, the heart of a closet-scientist was beating,constantly being attracted by news that made my muso buddies yawn with boredom.The news clip of a Planet X appeared on TV as suddenly as it disappeared. I wasriveted by the story of scientists thinking they may have discovered a large newplanet beyond Pluto in our own solar system. The report was very convincing asit quoted some credible sounding cosmologists. But that one single occasion wasthe first and the last time I heard about it. I expected to read about it in thepapers the following day or in some weekly magazines but I was bitterlydisappointed. None of the papers carried any stories of such content and nobodyelse remembered anything about it either. Unfortunately this was about 13 yearsbefore the internet and finding information regarding this kind of topic was noteasy, especially in South Africa where the media was well controlled by theApartheid government. Strange objects in the sky? That sounded too much like acommunist threat. So, for a brief moment my curiosity and imagination wasstirred, only to fade under the pressures of nightly gigs and stars of adifferent kind in my eyes. In the years to come I was steadily drawn to thecosmos and literature of a diverse nature. I never realised how seriously theidea of Planet X was being taken and how vigorously it was pursued by a largenumber of astrophysicists and other cosmologists. The news report that impressedme so much was based on a similar article in the New York Times on 19 June 1982,which suggested that something big, far beyond the reaches of the solar system,is tugging on Uranus and Neptune, causing gravitational fluctuations that areresulting in irregularities in their orbits. The force suggested a large object,far away and unseen, which could lend some credibility to the speculation of theexistence of a planet in deep space.The discovery of planets in the last 200 years had more to do with the scienceof mathematics rather than the building of bigger and more powerful telescopes.In the same way that astronomers predicted the existence of Uranus and Neptunesome 200 and 150 years ago, they now predict the existence of a large planet waybeyond Pluto. Because of the mathematical irregularities in the gravitationalorbits of the outer planets, they were so certain that such a further planetexists, that they called it Planet X.[../Images/77-1.jpg]Is it possible that the Asteroid Belt was previously a planet known as Tiamat?Our solar system is in a relatively quiet part of the Milky Way, our galaxy, butit was born out of a violent past, which is evident from the large number ofimpact crater sites on all the planets around us. Take a pair of binoculars andlook at the moon for a little while; you will not believe the number of cratersyou can see. Our closest celestial body has been bombarded by asteroids andother flying space debris for billions of years. The same can be said forMercury, Venus and Mars. The many moons of the other gaseous planets also carrythe scars of our violent cosmic past. It is actually a miracle that our planethas escaped a serious cosmic collision for long enough to allow life to developand flourish. Well it did until around 65 million years ago they say, when thelast giant asteroid crashed into Earth apparently causing the extinction of thedinosaurs. This asteroid is referred to as K-T. But let us take a broader lookat our place in the universe to get a more realistic perspective of the bigpicture.The Big Bang still seems to be the popular scientific theory for the creation ofthe universe and all things in it. This theory postulates that some 13.8 billionyears ago the universe was born out of a point of singularity, which explodedcreating stars and galaxies while expanding at the speed of light. I recentlyattended a lecture given by South African born astronomer Dr. Tony Readhead, whoheads up Caltech's Cosmic Background Imager project. He shared some of thefascinating images from deep space, generated by the new generationbackground-imagery radio-telescopes. After taking the packed auditorium on ajourney through time away from Earth into the depths of the universe, Iliterally felt as if I was travelling through time. The images of galaxies andcluster galaxies and quasars truly boggled the mind. But when he presented animage of the stuff beyond 13.8 billion years, it sent a shock through my entirebody. It was pitch black. Nothing existed beyond this point. Nothing that wecould see or imagine. We had just travelled beyond the edge of the knownuniverse. The amazing thing is that with all the knowledge in the world, nobodycould even hazard a guess about what might exist beyond this point. It ishowever possible that if you carry on moving beyond this point for a long, long,long time, you may reach another universe. Because, given infinity, everythingwill happen. But this really gets too close to opening myself up tophilosophical attack, so let’s get back to the more familiar part of thephysical universe.So the universe continued to expand, creating new stars at an unimaginable rate.It seems that planetary systems such as ours, with all the planets, their moonsatellites, as well as other bodies are formed from gas and dust accompanyingthe birth of their own star, in our case the Sun. The first stars which formedfrom the primordial hydrogen and helium of the Big Bang could not have had anyplanets because there were no heavy elements present as yet. These elements thatare necessary for the creation of planets, only made their appearance once thesecond generation stars started exploding and scattering such heavy elementsthroughout the universe. These elements necessary for planet-building were builtup in the stars by nucleosynthesis. Once a star is born, the debris that resultsfrom this event is scattered throughout the universe, ready to get absorbed intothe new planets which begin to form around the star.As I mentioned earlier, as recently as 1994, there was still great scepticismabout the existence of other planets in the universe, outside of our solarsystem. But since then many new planets have been discovered. Now it isbelieved, mainly because of the continual discovery of new planets, thatplanetary systems do not form in isolation, they are the norm. Interstellarclouds are so large that when one of them collapses, it breaks up into enoughpieces to form hundreds, if not millions of stars like our Sun. Theseinterstellar clouds are like astronomical nurseries, constantly giving birth tonew stars. These stars then form a loose association known as an ‘open cluster’of stars, which is dispersed as the individual stars follow their own orbitsaround the galaxy. The magnetic fields generated by the young stars keep astrong grip on the material that surrounds them. This force will trap all matterextending far from the core of the star. But as the core of this new stellarsystem collapses to form a star, some of the material from which it is beingformed, remains out at a distance from the core of the star. It is kept out fromthe centre of the cloud by the residual spin of the whole system, while itsettles down into a disc of star dust around the young star. Discs like thesehave been detected around young stars, which largely confirm our understandingof how planetary systems are formed. A similar disc effect can be seen aroundthe large planets like Saturn, but only much, much smaller in size .The heat of the star blows away the lightest materials like hydrogen and heliumthat are closest to the star. The material that gets left behind is made up ofbillions of tiny grains of dust that collide and stick together, building uplarger lumps of what are the beginnings of new planets. These lumps become smallrocks, then big rocks, and even bigger asteroid-size rocks. While these rocksorbit the Sun in swarms, they bump into each other while gravity keeps pullingthem tighter and tighter together. The largest lumps have the highest gravityand attract more and more material until they grow into large planets and moons.[../Images/79-1.jpg] [../Images/79-2.jpg] 1.

Primordial disc spreads around thestar resulting in planet formationSource: NASASo now we have our solar system with the closest star to us, our Sun, giving itlight and heat and life. Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are the four innerplanets of our solar system. But where do all the asteroids and comets comefrom? Between Mars and Jupiter there is a ring of cosmic rubble known as theasteroid belt. It is believed that the combined content of this asteroid beltwould constitute a planet about four times the size of Earth. This is afascinating bit of information from the world of modern science, because theancient Sumerians had the same knowledge about the size of the 'possible' planetbefore it became the asteroid belt. In the well known 'Enuma Elish' or the Epicof Creation, the clay tablets describe in detail how the large planet theycalled Tiamat, was smashed to pieces in a cosmic collision. It further describesthe planet as having been a 'water giant' with 'golden veins' being exposed inher 'belly' as the moons of Nibiru smashed into her. It further explains howEarth inherited its water and its wealth in golden ores. It all came from planetTiamat. The details in the Epic of Creation are so vivid that it goes way beyondimagination. How did the authors of those clay tablets know so much, more than5,000 years ago? Can the asteroids possibly be the remains of a large planetwhich was destroyed by some celestial collision a long time ago? Today we knowthat the asteroid belt is made up of similar materials to the four innerplanets. This would suggest that there should be golden ores in the manyfragments whizzing around the Sun. The incredible coincidence is that the claytablets tell us the same. They clearly outline that the rich golden ore on Earthis very similar to that in the pieces of the asteroid belt. The tablets whichdescribe the Epic of Creation are no ordinary stories. They give us a detailedsequence of events that caused the creation of our planet Earth. We are told inno uncertain terms taht Earth is the largest remaining piece of the originalplanet called Tiamat, which was shattered and became the asteroid belt.[../Images/80-1.jpg]Beyond this belt of gold, there are 4 planets known as ‘gas giants’ which mostlikely have a small rocky core while the rest of the planet is made up ofvarious gases, giving them their distinctive colours. All this knowledge andresearch was rewarded in April 1999 when the first multiple system of extrasolarplanets was discovered 44 light years from Earth. Upsilon Andromedae is aSun-like star, which was found to have three giant planets, two of which orbitcloser to their parent star than the Earth is to the Sun. From that moment on,the previous belief that planets were not the norm in the universe had changedfor ever. At the time this publication went to print, astronomers had discoveredapproximately 130 extrasolar planets. Our own solar system is estimated to be4.5 billion years old. The bombardment of planets by space debris most likelystarted just after 4.5 billion years ago and ended 4 billion years later.Although we have reached a fairly stable period in our solar system, there arestill many life threatening monsters flying around in our own cosmic backyard.Comets have been sighted and written about for thousands of years. They havebeen seen as messengers of God or omens of evil. But where do they come from?There are really two known sources of comets. The Kuiper Belt, which is justbeyond Neptune, is said to contain a billion comets, which are ice-and-rockbodies left over from the formation of the solar system. The other source ofcomets is known as the Oort Cloud which basically surrounds our entire solarsystem and is said to contain a million million comets, more than all the starsin the entire Milky Way. I remember in the '80s when I first watched CarlSagan's ‘Cosmos’, they were estimating that there were 100 million stars in theMilky Way. By the year 2004 it was estimated to be 100 billion stars. This isanother quick indication of how our knowledge is evolving and how it shapes ourperceptions. One of the theories of how the Oort Cloud actually formed, is thatduring the creation of the solar system, besides all the material that made upthe giant planets, there must have been many frozen balls of ice and dust thatwere influenced by the gravity of the gas giants, in the same way that objectsin the asteroid belt came under the influence of Jupiter. It is possible thatsome of these icy objects were pulled into orbits, taking them close to the Sun,and as a result evaporated. Those that did not evaporate, were flung out fromthe region of the giant planets and ended up in giant orbits, possibly takingthem 100,000 times as far from the Sun as Earth. This is a distance of some 15million million kilometres, which is so far away from the Sun, that the dirtysnowballs were partly influenced by the gravity of other stars. Over billions ofyears their orbits got smoothed out and they became a spherical shell of cometsaround the solar system, now known as the Oort Cloud. Although this is a theory,the Oort Cloud remains a reality, consisting of all those billions of comets,large and small.The comets that we see from time to time are all on elongated elliptical orbitsaround the Sun. They broke away from their parent cloud and were hurled towardsthe Sun. They keep coming in close to the Sun as they round it, and then getflung out into deep space with a kind of pendulum effect. Their orbits can bemany thousands of years. What is very interesting is the similarity of theorbits of these comets and the theoretical orbit of the elusive Planet X. If youchoose to believe the Sumerian scriptures, the orbit of Planet X, which theycalled ‘Nibiru’, is very similar to that of the comets that orbit the Sun. “Alarge elliptical orbit” is what the clay tablets called it, all those thousandsof years ago. But since we modern civilised humans only discovered the lastthree planets in our solar system in the past 220 years, it is difficult for usto comprehend how someone 6,000 years ago could have known so much about oursolar system and other planets beyond. This is a very disturbing reality whichclearly points to our gross lack of knowledge relating to the cosmos in the 21stcentury. But just very recently we were handed a clear reminder of what somemaverick astronomers have been trying to prove for a few hundred years, and inthe process restoring some lost pride in the modern day cosmologists – theexistence of Planet X. This is not some fancy science fiction name made up bywacky students, but simply the Roman numeral X, which stands for the number 10.Planet X is the tenth planet in our known solar system. One other interestingpoint I should raise, is the accidental symbolism that also dates back to Sumerand a certain ‘planet of the crossing’ which was often represented by a cross ontheir clay tablets and cylinders. We will examine these ancient artefacts laterin the book but for now let us examine a story about a French astronomer,Alessandro Morbidelli, who in 2003 dared to suggest that there may be a largeplanet way beyond Pluto, which is on an elongated elliptical orbit around theSun that lasts about 3,600 years. The similarities between the facts in hisarticle and the Sumerian texts are quite staggering. The interesting thing isthat seemingly, the French astronomer had never heard of the Sumerian stories ofthe planet called Nibiru.And so the obsession with Planet X goes on. In February 2003, a prestigiousFrench monthly called Science & Vie, published an update on the planetary makeupof our Solar System, in light of recent discoveries in the Kuiper Belt. Thearticle made the sensational announcement that there is one more, unknown,planet in our solar system. The writer called it “A phantom planet whosepossible orbit is too elongated to be seen”. The article was based on statementsby Frenchman, Alessandro Morbidelli, an astronomer at France’s observatory atCôte d’Azur. He suggested that while the solar system was chaotic in thebeginning, there was a celestial collision involving a planet that existed wherethe asteroid belt is today. This all happened about 3.9 billion years ago and asa result of those events the so called ‘Phantom Planet’ is caught in thisunusually long elliptical orbit of several thousand years. He further stated, “Iexpect that one day we will discover a new, Mars-sized planet!”. He alsoprovided the journal with a proposed sketch of the elongated orbit whichincluded a speculative guess on where the planet may have been at that point intime. Is it a coincidence that this sketch is virtually identical to that ofZecharia Sitchin, which he proposed in his book The 12th Planet in 1976? Sincethis French astronomer is not the first to be talking about Planet X with suchcertainty, it seems to me that this kind of speculation is too close to becoincidence. There must be something more to this obsession than merespeculation by a handful of ‘wacky’ scientists n search of an invisible planet.Not so invisible it seems, as many scientists have presented mathematicalcalculations that point to the existence of something in deep space whichsupports their calculations.[../Images/83-1.jpg]Sitchin has become a leading authority in the analyses of ancient Sumerian claytablets. He is said to own the largest private collection of over 800 ancientcuneiform clay tablets. Sitchin has studied these and other tablets extensivelyfor many years and has deciphered and also interpreted many complex messages andpresented startling theories, which are now being taken more seriously bygrowing numbers of broad-minded scientists. One of the many stories inscribed onsome of the tablets was a long complex tale of Nibiru, the home planet of theAnunnaki, and ‘gods’ of the Sumerians. This knowledge of the Sumerians, is whatthe French astronomer seemingly rediscovered, around 28 years after Sitchinfirst published it in The 12th Planet after his translation of these ancienttablets.• In the beginning the solar system was “chaotic”. • There was another‘supplementary planet’ where the asteroid belt is now. • This was Tiamat fromthe Sumerian texts. • A celestial collision ‘disturbed and rearranged’ the solarsystem outlined in the Enuma Elish or Epic of Creation. • Based on the findingson Earth’s moon, the collision occurred some 3.9 billion years ago. • In theaftermath of the collision, the solar system acquired the “Phantom Planet”Nibiru which was later renamed to ‘Marduk’ by the Babylonians after their god. •Its orbit is elliptical and not circular. • At its perigee, the point closest tothe Sun, it passes between Jupiter and Mars. • The orbit lasts thousands ofEarth years. Sitchin applied the Sumerian Shar, which equals 3,600 Earth yearsper one Nibiru orbit. Similar to many known comets.Source: Sitchin 1976 & Morbidelli 2003It is truly remarkable that here we have an author, scholar and scientist in hisown right who started to expose the world to the hidden realities of our ancientpast in the early '70s, and a modern-day astronomer who virtually quoted Sitchinverbatim, while exposing his own findings some 28 years later.What is also interesting is the elliptical orbit of the early comets during theformation of our solar system. To date, comets have puzzled astronomers, causingmany unsubstantiated speculations to surface. While all of the planets, exceptPluto, orbit the Sun in the same general plane and in the same direction, allmoving more or less in a circular orbit, the comets seem to follow their ownpaths without obeying any of the normal rules. Comets move in elliptical orbitsthat move in random planes, in the opposite direction to the planets. They areflung deep into space, sometimes for hundreds and thousands of years in theirorbits. The Enuma Elish tablets, also seem to provide a plausible explanation asto where the comets originated from and why they behave so strangely. We willcover this in a closer look at these mysterious clay tablets a little later. Thecurrent theory on comets seems to be supported by astrophysical evidence thatthe comets, which eventually settled in the Oort Cloud, started out on verylarge elliptical orbits which took them so deep into space that they wereaffected by the gravity of other stars. This caused a fluctuation in the comets’orbits. Over millions of years this resulted in the large numbers of cometssettling down in a large stable orbit, which basically surrounds our solarsystem today, and is known as the Oort Cloud. Some of the comets in this clouddo however remain at distances far beyond the edge of the solar system, possiblyas far as half way to the nearest star. You can weigh up the evidence and startformulating your own decisions. If this can happen to a comet, why not to aplanet? The proposed phantom planet must have entered the solar system prettymuch on a similar path to the comets. From the outer edge of the solar system,turning between Mars and Jupiter, and out across the paths of all the otherplanets once more, on its way into deep space. Such a planet weighing manymillions of times as much as a comet, would take much longer to settle down intoa stable orbit around the Sun. So it is possible that it will continue on itselliptical orbit for a long time to come before it finds a stable path aroundthe Sun. And if such a planet is on an orbit of some 3 600 years, it seems tofit that it could have been the subject of debate and influence on Earth around5000 BC and subsequent intervals of 3,600 years before and after.We have to return briefly to the asteroid belt located between Mars and Jupiter.Although I casually mentioned that it is probably the remains of a planet, itshould be taken in with an understanding that the knowledge about this part ofour solar back yard is still very speculative. Astronomers are at odds aboutwhat might have caused this phenomenon. But the asteroid belt certainly adds agreat level of intrigue to our very own solar system. The ancient Sumerians hadseven clay tablets on which is inscribed the Epic of Creation, or as they calledit, the Enuma Elish. The reading of these tablets accompanied their new yearcelebrations which seemingly describes the struggle between good and evil. Butsome scholars like Zecharia Sitchin have analysed these scripts differently. Heexplains them as an historic event which describes the creation of our Earth andits moon. Our moon is an interesting celestial body, which is surrounded by muchspeculation about its origins. Scientists seem to feel that the moon is too bigin relation to Earth to have been created as its satellite during the formationof the solar system. If one compares the moon to all the other moons orbitingthe planets, we find that the other moons are considerably smaller in proportionto their planet. In fact, our moon is the 5th largest satellite in our solarsystem, comfortably comparing with the sizes of the large moons of Jupiter,Saturn and Neptune. Our moon is simply far too big to have been formed undersimilar conditions to the other moons. The physics would not have allowed such alarge satellite to form at the point of creation around a planet as small asEarth.The more popular theory on the origin of the moon is known as the ‘Big Splash’.This theory was first introduced by astronomer-artist Bill Hartmann and hiscolleague Donald Davis, both at the Planetary Science Institute, Arizona in1975. Astronomy Now featured an article in May 2002, which describes the BigSplash as such:“…the Earth had only recently coalesced in solar orbit when it suffered adevastating blow. Along came a rogue protoplanet… more than half the size of theEarth itself and slammed into the proto-Earth in a glancing impact. Thecollision vaporised the outer regions of both worlds to considerable depth, andthe core of the impacting planet sank to the centre of the Earth where the twocores merged into one. Debris, about 80 per cent of it from the Earth's crustand mantle, was flung into orbit. Gradually, particles in the orbiting debrisring began to lump together through agglomeration and then gravitationalaccretion, until the mess had all been swept up and a single, large satelliteremained. Only this theory fits the data. But until recently, even this idea hadserious problems, because it left the Earth and Moon system spinning too madly.Now, this problem has been largely fixed, and the vast majority of researchersare in agreement that the Big Splash, ad hoc though it might seem, representsthe true picture.”I would say that in many ways the ‘Big Splash’ theory resembles the story of theEnuma Elish described by the Sumerians. What was also created in that collisionwas the asteroid belt. Let us focus on this part of the solar system again. Itis amazing that only a tiny fraction of the total weight of the asteroid belthas been ejected over time. This is mainly ascribed to the gravitational effectof Jupiter. But it is also possible that at some stage a giant asteroid wasejected towards the Sun, collided with Earth, melted much of the rock andmetals, and was ejected as a giant satellite that was caught in Earth’sgravitational orbit, cooled down and became our moon. That is another theory forthe origin of the moon. But the Sumerians had a different story about the moon’screation altogether. The story is interpreted as follows. A planet called Tiamatwhich existed in the place of the asteroid belt was involved in a cosmiccollision with an invading planet called Nibiru. This planet was later renamedas Marduk by the Babylonians. It was caught by the gravitational pull of our Sunin a long elliptical orbit. It became the 12th planet of our solar systembecause the Sumerians counted the moon and Nibiru as part of the planets. Itmakes perfect sense why such a planet would be depicted by a cross, graphicallydepicting its path and place in history, crossing the paths of other planets.There are numerous clear references to this planet in a multitude of claytablets and cylinder seals from Sumer and other civilisations dating muchfurther back in time. This planet is always symbolised by a cross. Both Nibiruand Tiamat had their own moons, which were involved in a spectacular cosmiccollision. The result of all this was the destruction of Tiamat, which becamethe asteroid belt; the creation of the Earth from the largest chunk of Tiamat;and the capturing of an existing moon of Tiamat or Nibiru, which was trapped bythe gravitational pull of the newly formed Earth. This is why the moon is solarge compared to the size of Earth. Because it was originally a moon of a muchlarger planet. It was this fateful event which developed the seasons and tideson Earth, which contributed to the very unique life forms here on Earth.New Scientist devoted the cover of a recent issue to ‘The planet that stalkedthe Earth’. In the article the writer offered theories about a “rogue planet”involved in a cosmic collision. What is most fascinating, is that the articlecalled the “Phantom Planet” Theia, without any explanation. Is it possible thatthe writer was thinking of Tiamat?But why do we know so little about this planet? For a start, its 3,600-yearorbit is way too long for our short human time frames. We can hardly relate tostuff that went on 200 years ago on Earth, how could we possibly come to termswith a planet and a possible civilisation that come within our reach every 3,600years? The fact is, that many clues have been handed down to us over time.Detailed information was captured by thousands of scribes over thousands ofyears, capturing their ancient experiences on a young planet, for futuregenerations to absorb, but our civilisation has come along and discarded allthis knowledge under the premise that it cannot possibly be true. My grandfatherrefused to believe that man walked on the moon and I thought he was very naïveand ill informed. So let us imagine that there really is such a planet outthere, a ‘radiant planet’ called Nibiru, as it is referred to by the Nibiruansin several ancient inscriptions. Furthermore, if there is life on this planet,who are the inhabitants, and what effect have they had on our planet Earth? Thisis a question which has been asked millions of times by regular people withinquisitive minds and scientists who have been more involved in the search forsuch a Planet X.During the search for this elusive Planet X, various other objects werediscovered in our distant solar system, in recent times, right on the edge ofthe Kuiper belt. Pluto and its moon, Charon, are often thought to be very largemembers of the Kuiper belt, referred to as Kuiper Belt Objects (KBO). Theaverage size of the other KBOs are thought to be between 10 - 50 kilometres indiameter. If one of those had to collide with our precious Earth, it would haveconsequences so severe, that it would push the entire planet with all its liferight to the edge of extinction. This belt is probably the main source of theshort-period comets which orbit the Sun less than every 200 years, like Halley’sComet. Some other comets like Kohoutek, are on much larger orbits andastronomers predict that its orbit can range between 7,500 and 75,000 years.This is pretty much in line with the kind of thinking behind the orbit of PlanetX. When Pluto was first discovered in 1930, it was often referred to as Planet Xbut it soon became clear that this could not be the celestial body that wasexerting such turbulence on Uranus and Neptune. Remember that scientistsdiscovered that these two planets had disturbances in their gravity and orbits,but Pluto was simply too small to have such an effect on them. For this tohappen, the body causing these effects had to be many times the size of Pluto.The debate goes on, some frantically searching for the lost Planet X, othersdismissing it as utter nonsense.Very recently, another KBO was discovered. Quaoar is 1,250 kilometres indiameter, which is about half the size of Pluto, and is the largest KBO known todate. A study of the outer solar system suggests that it may not be a cemeteryfull of dead, frozen bodies. The study revealed that this KBO could have been‘warm’ at some stage in the past. This supports the theory that planetaryprocesses such as volcanism, can occur on objects at extreme distances from theSun. This volcanism could add support for the existence of planets at such largedistances from the Sun. The Sumerian tablets describe the planet Nibiru asexactly that: “A radiating planet” which was symbolised by a cross, to indicatethe ‘planet of the crossing’ but also radiation in the form of heat emergingfrom the planet. We are told in the clay tablets about the importance of thethick atmosphere, which protects Nibiru against the long cold periods while deepin space, when the planet is furthest from the Sun, as well as the hot periodswhen it is closest to the Sun. It would ultimately be their wounded atmospherethat brought the Anunnaki from Nibiru to Earth.Scientists have found about 1,000 KBOs so far, but little is known about theircomposition because they are so distant and faint. However, the detection ofcrystalline ice, suggests that Quaoar is, or was, being heated by somethingother than the Sun. Could it be the close proximity of the radiant Nibiru on itsoccasional fly-by? This was proposed by David Jewitt of the University of Hawaiiin Honolulu and Jane Luu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology inLexington, USA. The two researchers discovered the first KBO in 1992, and thenmade these latest observations. They said that it would have to be an object ofsubstantial size to have such a profound effect on this KBO. Could this be areal clue pointing towards a distant giant Planet X?If we look at the detailed descriptions of the celestial battle between gods andthe collisions of planets which the Enuma Elish (Epic of Creation) describes sographically, it sounds almost too fantastical to believe. It all seems so farback and so far away that we struggle to see its relevance to our existence atthis point in time. But all we have to do is lift our eyes at the sky to realisehow vulnerable we are to a cosmic attack. Maybe not by other planets, but bygiant asteroids and even comets. Every so often we hear the news of a largeasteroid that passed close by planet Earth, without us even spotting it, untilit had gone by, unnoticed. This kind of ignorance could cause our extinction inthe blink of an eye and cause a cosmic collision of spectacular proportions, nottoo dissimilar to the spectacular events described in the Sumerian tablets.There are possibly many thousands of giant asteroids flying around the solarsystem, many of which come very close to the Earth. These are called Near-EarthAsteroids (NEA). Eros is an elongated NEA, which is 33 x 13 x 13 kilometres insize. Large enough to destroy our planet and all life on it. About 250 NEAs havebeen found so far, but many, many more exist. The largest known NEA is 1036Ganymede, with a diameter of 41 kilometres. According to astronomers there areat least 1000 NEAs whose diameter is greater than one kilometre and which coulddo catastrophic damage to Earth. Even smaller NEAs could cause substantialdestruction if they were to collide with Earth.This brings us to the dramatic events at Tunguska, Siberia, on the 30th of June1908. A meteorite measuring some 90 - 200 metres in diameter exploded above theground just before impact. It completely scorched the snow-covered forest belowfor some 2,100 square kilometres and destroyed some 80 million trees. If thatwas a city, you can just imagine the drama. But around 65 million years agothere was a far more devastating collision with planet Earth. A large asteroidabout 10 kilometres in diameter crashed into the Earth near the Mexican Yucatanpeninsula and as a result caused the extinction of not only the dinosaurs, butall land animals over 30 kilograms, and large sections of plant life. The impactwould have penetrated the Earth's crust, scattering dust and debris into theatmosphere, causing huge fires, volcanic activity, tsunamis, and severe stormswith high winds and even highly acidic rain. The impact could have resulted inchemical changes in Earth’s atmosphere, increasing concentrations of sulphuricacid, nitric acid, and fluoride compounds. What is more, the heat from theimpact’s blast wave, would have incinerated all life in its path. After theimpact, dust and debris which were thrust into the atmosphere would have blockedmost of the sunlight for months and lowered the global temperature. Organismsthat could not adapt to the light and temperature changes would die out. Sinceplants’ energy is derived from the Sun, they would likely be the first to beaffected by such changes in the climate. Many families of phytoplankton andplants died out, and the Earth’s oxygen levels may well have dramaticallydecreased. This would have affected oxygen on both land and in the oceans,suffocating those organisms that were unable to cope with the lower oxygenlevels. The drama continued. Many major changes in the food chain resulted fromall of these environmental upheavals and the herbivores starved soon after theplants died. Then the carnivores would have had to eat each other, andeventually also died out. Their large carcasses must have provided smalleranimals with food for quite a while.This must have surely been one spectacular explosion. To remind us just howspectacular such cosmic explosions can be, all we have to do is cast our mindsback to the most observed cosmic event in human history. In 1994, when 21 piecesof the Shoemaker-Levy comet crashed into Jupiter. The whole world came to astandstill to watch this spectacular event while all the telescopes were pointedat Jupiter to bring these dramatic pictures into our living rooms. The largestparts of the comet caused explosions one million times bigger than all theatomic explosions ever exploded on Earth put together. In other words, if thatcomet had hit Earth, we would not be here today, nor would the planet in alllikelihood.So you see, it is not so hard to visualise a cosmic collision. We are veryfortunate that we have the magic of TV to remind us of the Jovian event. Allthat the Sumerians had some 6,000 years ago, were some clay tablets and a scribewho captured the events in cuneiform writing, instead of video.So, now that we have explored our universe, our solar system, comets, asteroidsand cosmic collisions, is there enough content for us to substantiate theprobability of an elusive Planet X in the distant parts of the solar system,which pays us a visit every 3,600 years or so? We will explore many moreunexplained pieces of the Great Human Puzzle, which lead me to believe thatthere is such a planet out there. We will also discover that this planet is notonly linked to our existence here on Earth, through a strange sequence ofevents, which included the transfer of the seeds of life between planets in thevery beginning, but also through genetic manipulation, long after life haddeveloped and evolved on both Nibiru and Earth. The genetic manipulation thatour more evolved cosmic relatives inflicted on us some 200,000 years ago, iscarefully laid out for us in ancient tablets. I will urge you to once againconsider the total knowledge we have of the cosmos, and how much we seem tolearn every day from our scientists who study the skies. Once you have concludedthat our knowledge is still in its infancy, the obvious conclusion must be thatwe simply cannot say. What keeps haunting me, is how carelessly we discard allthis information left behind, by dedicated scribes from another time when theworld was a completely different place. It seems that if this knowledge does notconform to the way we would like to see our ancient history, we are not so keento accept it into our body of knowledge. To end this chapter on an inspirationalnote, here are some statements on the subject of Planet X, by scientists,visionaries and broad thinkers of the past and present.“That Mankind’s progression from Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age) to Mesolithic(Middle Stone Age) to Neolithic (New Stone Age) and then the great Sumeriancivilization, had occurred in intervals of about 3,600 years is a fact. That Anuvisited Earth, approved the grant of civilization (knowledge, science,technology) to Mankind is certain. But as I have tried to explain in my recentseminars (though not yet in a full length book), the visits to Earth and thenearing (at what is called perihelion) of Nibiru do NOT coincide. This is apoint of immense significance, which those who have only read my first booksomehow ignore.”(Zecharia Sitchin)“In the fields of archaeology, geology, and astronomy the last few years havebrought a vast array of facts to corroborate the claims that there were physicalupheavals of a global character in historical times; that these catastropheswere caused by extraterrestrial agents; and that the nature of these agents maybe identified. The memory of the cataclysms was erased, not because of lack ofwritten traditions, but because of some characteristic process that later causedentire nations, together with their literate men, to read into these traditionsallegories or metaphors where actually cosmic disturbances were clearlydescribed.”(Immanuel Velikovsky)“Dr. Robert S. Harrington, former head of the US Naval Observatory, calculatedseveral parameters of Planet X and its orbit. Harrington started from theperturbations in the orbits of Neptune and Uranus, knowing that Pluto could notbe responsible for them. The observations he used were supplied by the NauticalAlmanac Office of the US Naval Observatory and go back as far as 1833 for Uranusand 1846 for Neptune.”(Harrington Paper)Albert Einstein remarked that:“A great many empirical data indicate that at each point of the Earth’s surfacethat has been carefully studied, many climatic changes have taken place,apparently quite suddenly. This is explicable if the virtually rigid outer crustof the Earth undergoes, from time to time, extensive displacement...”(Albert Einstein)"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8 [../Text/toc.html#chapter8]HUMAN NATURE [../Text/toc.html#chapter8a]We seem to take so much care to bring our children up in the proper fashion.Depending on what culture you may come from, the variations on the word ‘proper’can be quite extreme, relative to each other’s dogmas. There are manyestablished cultures throughout the world, each one with its own peculiarcustoms, rituals and belief systems. In the last 100 years we have gone from twoworld wars, a possible third one, to several localised conflicts like Korea,Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and other skirmishes which have been described asminor uprisings, like the one in Haiti. It is quite amazing that despite thepockets of conflict during the last 50 years of the 20thcentury, we haveexperienced possibly one of the most peaceful and tolerant chapters of our humanhistory. I make this statement with great reservation, because until we haveeliminated all conflict from society we will not be free. This period willhowever always be remembered for the collapse of the Soviet Union and turningthe giant communist China into the fastest growing economy in the world andeveryone’s favourite trading partner. But we should be aware that there areother forms of conflict or aggression than pure outright war. We have becomeexperts at highly persuasive techniques of convincing others to follow our lead,while it may not necessarily be to their benefit. Wealth and military power willallow you to call the shots without having to fire a single bullet and sometimeswe conveniently overlook such incidents. It is either that our violent geneshave mutated into ‘clandestine’ violent genes, or we have attained new geneswhich have mutated into displaying their violent nature in more subtle ways.In his latest book entitled DNA - The Secret of Life one of the founders of theDNA, James Watson, writes: “Understanding genetics is not just understanding whywe look like our parents. It is also about coming to grips with some ofHumankind’s oldest enemies: the flaws in our genes that cause genetic disease.”This statement feeds my argument superbly. Why should our genome be soincomplete and so full of flaws if we have been evolving for millions of years?It just does not add up and it indirectly supports the theory of our DNA beingtampered with early in our existence. I refer frequently to the ‘violent gene’and the ‘greed gene’ because I firmly believe they truly exist in our geneticmakeup. The evidence is all around us. If we behave in a certain way, there mustbe something driving it from within. And our DNA is the master programme whichpredetermines all our characteristics. Just as we cannot refute the fact thatsomeone has blue eyes, when it is clearly visible, we cannot refute the factthat we display violent behaviour, when it is also clearly visible. And yetthere is the other side of our character, the benevolent and peaceful traits,which must have a group of ‘genes’ that control such traits. What drives thisstriving towards harmony by a growing number of earthlings is a mystery, sincewe have now established that the ‘violent’ gene is well embedded in our DNA. Wehave seen a dramatic shift towards tolerance between the global cultures, whereonly 100 years ago imperialism was still the major quest of the global powers,annihilating weaker cultures in the name of god and king. But while society hasbeen narrowing the gap in some sectors, a growing gap in other sectors has beendeveloping. Religious intolerance is a truly worrying factor to world peacebecause with religion comes a virtually indestructible force that drives it fromwithin, fanaticism! As long as certain groups of people believe that they occupya moral and religious high ground over other groups, we are staring a recipe fordisaster in the face. All the efforts by the politicians to create a stableglobal trading environment will mean absolutely nothing as long as we have thethreat of religious fanatical violence. Unless we can point out a new religiousroad of moderation to the hoards of religious faithful in the world, there is agreat risk that this whole issue is possibly still coming to a violent head.There is another global development which drives the ‘violent’ genes in some ofus in much more subtle ways. Economic warfare. The gap between the rich and thepoor is the most worrying aspect of globalisation and it is not diminishing, itis growing ever wider. While you have one group or one nation achievinggreatness at the expense of another, there will never be a state of harmony onEarth. As I pointed out earlier, our brain is an immensely complex organ, whichwe may never come to understand completely. The brain seems to play a kind ofinterface role between the physical and the spiritual aspects of our being. Itis the computer which is driven by an extremely well-developed software packagecalled the genome. But the brain computer can only function at the rate at whichthe software package allows it to and the software requires constant upgrading.This upgrading can only come through the action of DNA. Many scientists havemade daring pronouncements about the amount of brain capacity which we humansuse, but the truth of the matter is that the brain has a capacity that we cannotbegin to estimate. As advanced as it is, our brain can only perform thefunctions that have been programmed into the genetic software. The more advancedthe software, the more amazing things the brain can do. And just like yourcomputer software constantly updates itself from some remote Microsoftreservoir, your genome software constantly strives to update itself from thereservoir of our evolving DNA. There is also however a constant tussle between‘nature’ versus ‘nurture’. While some of us are being nurtured into becomingbusiness leaders, others who grow up in less privileged societies are‘naturally’ marginalised to remain the working class which provides the ‘slaves’who drive the global machine.We cannot escape our past, which is pretty much built on exploration, invasions,occupation, domination, crusades and warfare, during which the stronger culturewould simply attack the weaker one as part of its unquestionable right to expandits area of influence. But just because we know the past and are starting tounderstand the complex effects of conflict, does not mean we know how to dealwith this genetic defect, as James Watson so correctly points out. Our geneticdefects do not only effect our physical health, but our mental state. It is thismental state of ours which is controlled by our ‘faulty’ DNA which drives usinto conflict situations. For us to be able to deal effectively with ourinsatiable need for conflict, we must know exactly where we come from and why weare the way we are, so that there may be no speculation, as this kind ofuncertainty becomes an underlying justification for our behaviour.Unfortunately, all the effort expended on our human psychological shortcomingshas been based on speculative assumptions of our human origins. The complexityof human nature, therefore, goes back to our creation. African-Americansociologists claim that it will take their society another several hundred yearsto overcome the underlying effects of slavery. And this was just a temporaryoppression of one group by another without any surgical or genetic manipulation.Just imagine the damage that was handed to humanity at its creation by severelypruning its genetic capacity. The volatile path of human history has left uswith scars that we need to heal in an attempt to begin to understand our humannature.On a personal level, I have always been an eternal optimist, a messenger ofpositive energy, finding the good in everyone and constantly creating. Creatingwhat, you may ask? Creating anything. It seems that when humans are busy doingsomething creative, their minds tap into the non-violent portion of the genome.An example can be as basic as working in the garden, planting some flowers. Thelevels of therapy derived from gardening are well documented. It goes on toother simple examples like building a tree house or fixing an old chair. It canget as mundane as writing a shopping list. The creative process seems tooverride the activity of the violent gene. There are incredible stories from warsituations where the opposing armies would stop to play a game of soccer, beforereturning to killing each other. This pop-philosophy causes a dilemma however.What about the people who create weapons of war? What happens to therelationship between creative genes and violent genes in their system? Is itthat they are so absorbed by the creative process of actually creating somethingnew that they are completely removed from the effects of their creation? Or, canit be that the violent gene has become so cunning inside of us, that it supportsand drives the creative gene to feed its own survival needs? Some of thesephilosophies have been explored in great detail under the guise of the ‘selfishgene’. But these are all answers we will find with time. As for now, at least weare raising the questions, being allowed to explore by our evolved andenlightened society, to examine new boundaries which would have had us burnt atthe stake a few hundred years ago.It is such a great pity that Communism was corrupted by a group of power hungryindividuals who used the communal benefits to feed their own greed. Thebehaviour of the fallen Communist leaders flew right in the face of theirgospel. I believe that under more evolved human conditions, maybe some time inthe future, this doctrine of sharing could be more useful to the human race.Because in its theoretical make up, it is a kind of utopian answer to manyglobal problems. I will most probably be shouted down by millions of capitalistsbut I still believe that the original idea of sharing has a lot to do with ourhidden genetic structure. The people of southern Africa have a communalphilosophy they call ‘ubuntu’, which is based on the principles of sharing andcaring for the whole village or community. This concept predates the communisticideals by many thousands of years and could actually be its early origins. Itseems to have worked very successfully for thousands of years, until the tribeswere invaded by the colonialists and forced to break up their ancient traditionsin favour of democracy and capitalism. Was this a smart or a stupid move? You bethe judge, but it seems to me that the survival of the global commune may becomedependent on some of the simple philosophies of the oldest cultures on Earth.Capitalism is a recipe for disaster, but the wealthy and powerful corporationswho dominate the world will never admit this for as long as they are in thedriving seat. They will continue to exploit and enslave large amounts of peoplefor as long as they are on top. Then they will eventually be toppled by anothergroup that will do exactly the same. We have to ask ourselves: where is this allleading to?A perfect genome will have no need for violence, greed, vanity and all the othercharacteristics which have caused human suffering for so long. So, as we evolveand we need less and less to feed the materialistic reservoirs of our psyche, wewill become more comfortable with the global concept of sharing? Once again,this sharing thing is not really new to humanity. We are involved in communalsharing on various scales: in our homes, extended families and even offices, butto be taken to its extreme, we would have to eliminate any form of materialreward from the global equation.This concept must be completely unthinkable to anyone in economics or thefinancial markets, because as they see it, the world is driven by economics, inother words, money. The only problem is that money makes money and in the end itgets us nowhere. The pursuit of money has been a major driving factor behindmany wars. The simple expression ‘the rich get richer and the poor get babies’is very real and very dangerous for future prospects of human survival, becausethe babies of the poor become the slaves of global corporations in the modernworld.What used to be brutal wars waged by thousands of men in bloody hand to handcombat in open fields, has been replaced by global terrorism, which is probablymore sinister and difficult to guard against. But the largest threat to oursurvival is ‘economic terrorism’. This relative newcomer to global dominationhas replaced nuclear superiority and has been waged quietly from behind closeddoors of the giant multinationals against the smaller unsuspecting nations.After all, it is much wiser and more profitable to invade a country by takingover its economic assets and owning its wealth and natural resources, thanblowing them up first, before you take them over. So, in essence nothing haschanged since Alexander the Great or Attila the Hun. Only our methodology haschanged. The violent gene is still in all of us. While some of us have learnt tosuppress it somehow, possibly through our own evolutionary process, a new moremenacing gene has taken centre stage. The greed gene.If you ask any regular person on the street, they will tell you that they wantpeace and harmony in the world but many people are still prepared to fight forpeace. You have probably seen those T-shirts that say ‘fighting for peace islike fucking for virginity’. You can’t get much closer to the truth than that.But standing firmly juxtaposed to all the violence and greed in the world is aseemingly endless river of goodwill. But because the media have become obsessedwith blood, guts and gore, we hardly ever get to hear about the good news in theworld. On an average day there is far more good news to cover in the world thanthere is bad news, but that is not the choice of the editors. This is a verystrange aspect of human nature which must have its roots in some macabre geneticdysfunction we do not understand yet. But editors seem to be convinced that‘good news does not sell’. I have had this debate with a number of TV and radioproducers who tend to dismiss my suggestions of ‘good news content’ with largeamounts of arrogance, as if they knew exactly what the average man on the streetwants to consume in the news. Well, I believe they have become slaves to theviolent and greed genes driving our character. They have settled into the safezone of using violent sensationalism to sell their news. They are not braveenough to push the boundaries of their own genetic makeup and explore the deeperneeds of the global society. How much longer will the media survive on feedingus such negative news? How much longer will the average person put up withconsuming and digesting the sensationalism dished up to us as ‘crucial’knowledge without which we could not function?The amount of goodwill and benevolence that people display on a daily basis istruly staggering, but it largely goes unnoticed in the face of the negative newsbeing shoved down our throats. From Mother Theresa to social workers andvolunteers in conflict situations; the Red Cross; the Red Crescent; a multitudeof aid organisations and charity institutions; animal rights groups; orphansupport groups; soup kitchens; night shelters; a seemingly endless list of NGOswith some cause at heart, there is so much goodwill in the world it is quitesimply overwhelming. The concept of sharing seems to be deeply entrenched inhuman culture. By the time you see a disaster on TV, some internationalbenevolent organisation has already arrived to deal with the situation. One ofmy favourite quotes is “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”. Ialways felt that somehow this should be one of the principal philosophies weshould subscribe to in our turbulent state of mind. The recognition of good andbad is clearly visible in the eyes of little children when you tell them storiesabout evil characters, they burst into tears very quickly. Instinctively, theydon’t like the bad guys and they want the good to conquer evil. You never reallyhave to explain the difference between good and bad, they seem to instinctivelyknow who the bad guy is and who the good guy is. And yet some grow up choosing aviolent path and others do not. Is it social conditioning together with aprogrammed violent gene that causes some children to grow up into monsters? Howcan a pure little baby who cries when the evil stepmother raises her voice atCinderella, turn into a global dictator who does not count his victims by thedozen, but by the million? The fact that there have been peacemakers likeMahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, who have inspired most of the world to engagein dialogue rather than war, has been an inspiring closure to the 20th century.This is all juicy fodder for the preachers of ‘nature vs nurture’ theories. Arewe a product of our environment, or are we a product of our DNA programme?Psychologists have been speculating for years about the triggers for violenceamong humans. There have been fantastic theories, like the effect of yourparents, your friends, your neighbourhood, the climate, disease, the stars and ahost of other extrinsic factors that play an important part in our behaviour.That may very well be the case, but they are just the triggers that stimulatethe violent gene inside. The chain reaction which follows the stimulation of theviolent genes will differ from person to person. This is where it becomes evenmore complex. If we have been created with a restricted genome, our creator musthave done so purposefully. It is clear from the Sumerian tablets that our makershad an advanced knowledge of science and medical procedure. But it does not meanthat they, themselves, had a perfect genome. And if we are genetic offshootsfrom a more advanced ‘human’ species who settled on Earth in the distant past,we must retain parts of their genetic structure. The fact that we have reachedthe capacity to contemplate these once unimaginable prospects, is a clear signthat there is much more to this fairytale than first meets the uninformed mind.Our level of development in the 21stcentury must be very close to that of theAnunnaki astronauts when they first arrived on Earth. My guess is that in a 100years or so, we will be ready to absorb the full truth of our ancestry and theauthentic origins of the human race. The evidence will be more compelling, thefearful grip of religious dogma will be more fragmented and people will besearching for real answers rather than the mumblings of conservativepower-mongers.The giant gap between the ‘HAVES’ and the ‘HAVE NOTS’ is bigger than everbefore. Just compare the giant social chasm separating a rocket scientist who istrying to land a probe on Mars, and the situation of a homeless personcontemplating to rob someone for ten bucks. The disparity between humans isstaggering. And if we were all born equal, we have certainly done everything inour power to change that. A very disturbing aspect of human nature which musthave deep-seated roots somewhere in our genome as well. Are some humans morevaluable than others? If our bodies are disposable but our souls are not, shouldwe not do away with the imperfect bodies, keeping only a few on this planet,until such time that a more perfect genetically created body has evolved? Atthat point we could allow humanity to multiply to their hearts’ content, becausetheir DNA will not allow us to do anything damaging to either the planet orHumankind.Just look at our insatiable need to explore. We have done quite well in 30 yearssince the first Viking space probes were launched on a planetary expedition intothe depths of our solar system. We have done very well in such a short space oftime. We received photographic images of all our planets, before the probefinally left our solar system and disappeared into deep space en route todistant stars. This obsessive desire to explore and conquer is very strong inour genes and as I point out in other chapters, a quest of humanity since ourcreation. We can trace it back as far as the Garden of Eden. It all startedthere, when Adam disobeyed his god and wanted to try a new experience. He justhad to know more, explore, push the boundaries, without even knowing why he wasdoing so. It was very simply a natural response which was dictated to him fromdeep inside his DNA. Poor guy, the father of all humans and he himself wasreceiving mixed messages from the very start! No wonder we are all so confused.Since then, we have a much better understanding of our place in the universe. Wenow know that we are not the centre of creation, something that I was stilltaught as a boy in Grade One, and we have had physical interaction with many ofthe planets around us. So the next step in our quest to conquer, would clearlybe settling on another planet. The fortunate thing is that there are nointelligent creatures living on any of the local planets. We would surely befaced with a moral dilemma if we found an advanced creature living on one ofthem. What would we do? It all depends if the creature was more or less advancedthan we are, I suppose. This would play a major role in the way we dealt withthem.So let us imagine that the creatures on Mars are more or less as evolved as weare. The first thing that would happen is our natural instinct for defence wouldprobably kick in. We would display high levels of concern that we may beattacked and colonised by our planetary neighbours. So we would face a number ofoptions. Reach out a hand of friendship; attack; or sit back and wait. It isoften said that history has taught us nothing, and this is where we will mostlikely prove it all over again. In conflict situations, a surprise attack willnormally catch your opponent off-guard or even better, unprepared. Pre-emptivestrikes are justified based on the pronouncements of people like George W. Bushand many of his disciples. So, we would probably do the latter and forget thelessons from history. Once we have surprised the Martian people and subdued theminto subservience, we would occupy them and immediately start to import ourglobal culture. But what culture would it be? American culture of course. Afterall they are paying most of the costs, so they will have first option tointroduce whatever culture they feel fit. What if the USA acts alone in thisinvasion of Mars and occupies the Martians against the will of the rest of theworld? Suddenly we will all be at risk of an attack by a Martian force anytimein the future. Can you see the deeply rooted signs of a violent gene? I knowthis is just a silly hypothetical example but it is not that far removed fromwhat is happening on Earth! But as far as we know there is no advancedintelligent life on Mars, so the settlement and colonisation would not have suchserious consequences, yet. It is however quite probable that this kind ofinvasion happened here on Earth some 445,000 years ago. We will expose all theevidence left behind on thousands of Sumerian clay tablets. From the annals ofhuman history, we can also deduce that the consequences of invasions can becatastrophic.Many books have been written on the possibility of human settlement on Mars.Strangely enough it does not seem to be as insurmountable as we originallythought. Knowing the human hunger for exploration we will send explorers tosettle on Mars at some stage in the future. Many brilliant minds have beencompiling the necessary steps for human life to flourish there. The three mostimportant criteria are: an atmosphere which protects the settlers against cosmicradiation and contains the necessary gases for us to breathe without a supportmechanism; water and food. The latest announcement by NASA scientists predictsthat we could create a liveable atmosphere within 200 years. There have beenbrilliant proposals to achieve all of them and it will probably happen in timeto come. So let’s just imagine for a moment that if we manage to populate Mars,solve the oxygen and water problems and start active communities on thisneighbouring planet, one of the first resources we will need is labour. Whilerobots may be able to perform some of the tasks, human involvement will beunavoidable in the form of actual people who can do all the physical work, whichwe will need to create a stable sustainable community on Mars. Buildingstructures, reservoirs, roads, mining, food preparation, healthcare and so on.If we did not face the moral dilemma imposed on us by religion, would we ratherwait for a number of years to get some help from Earth, or would we seek adifferent solution? The journey to Mars takes more than three years at presentspeeds of space ships and would only be able to deliver a very small number ofpeople. In that case, would we rather consider the possibility of cloning menand women who are properly educated and skilled in the various tasks needed onMars? Will the same moral rules that prohibit human cloning on Earth also applyon Mars? If we could get the emotion and the religious interference out of theequation, cloning would surely be a realistic option. After all, the babies willbe well cared for, educated and protected by the Martian authority. Everythingwill be provided for them. At a point in the future, when the new Martian humanshave matured and are capable of procreating themselves, we would have introducedour family values that we hold so dear on Earth. So you see, cloning does nothave to be such a bad thing. It can help us to advance into space, without theconstant physical intervention from Earth. It would make the space pioneersself-sufficient and independent. And like a general in a war situation, thegeneral on Mars would most likely decide on the most effective action to dealwith the situation, without having to wait for instructions from his leader backhome. Will this situation arise on Mars? Maybe… possibly… probably. It alldepends on how impressive the advancement in space travel will be in the nexttwo to three decades. If we can break the bonds of gravity, come to understandand use electromagnetic science more effectively; replace archaic combustionpower with a new propulsion system, all of this is possible.The question remains, how will we deal with the labour problem on the newplanets we conquer? In this lies the human moral dilemma, which is very closelylinked to our own origins and evolution. The human nature that shapes us and ourthoughts; the drive for exploration and invention; the shortcomings of ourgenome and our imminent understanding of it, all play a part. We are so close toseeing the whole story of humanity but there are still some hurdles to cross. Itis an incredible story which will liberate us from our moral imprisonment andalso free us from the cradle of humanity, planet Earth. All of this isprogrammed into our DNA, each and every one of us. All we need to do is toexhibit patience and restraint as we decode our human programme and unlock thedormant genes that will liberate our spirits.Let us go back to Mars. We have now successfully landed, set up a base, andspent a few years – with the help of advanced science – to speed up thedevelopment of an atmosphere, generating oxygen from the carbon dioxide trappedunder the surface and we’ve even brought up water from the underground ice. Wealso planted thousands if not millions of trees and other vegetation, likegrasses, which include cereal, maize, barley, oats, wheat and more. They allgrow well with the fertiliser we created from nitrogen and phosphate, and theirrigation system keeps it all hunky dory. We then face the first dilemma oflabour. Suddenly things get out of hand and start to grow and evolve around uson Mars. We have an urgent need for additional manpower. But we soon overcomethis dilemma by taking the necessary steps to deal with the situation, and wecreate a whole army of cloned babies. They are bought up in comfort and loved bytheir minders and creators, providing everything they need while educating themin the necessary skills they will need to perform specialised functions from theearly age of 16. As the years go by we ‘create’ more environmentally-adaptedcloned human babies to supply the needs of the Martian expansion. Mating amongthe cloned adults is strictly prohibited, because of unforeseen physicalproblems and controlling the numbers of humans in the colony. In fact, theclones were originally created without the sex chromosome to prevent them frommultiplying on their own. But after two decades we realise that it is quicker toallow the clones to mate among themselves under controlled conditions. A quickgenetic procedure allows them to procreate on their own for some years. We teachthem the importance of monogamy and chastity and family values. They experiencethe meaning of parenthood and responsibility for the first time. Suddenly wehave a new Martian race of humans who were born of Martian parents and all theirexperiences are restricted to their Martian history. But these Martians were notcreated as slaves, but as equal humans. So the community and population on Marsgrow and their needs grow along with them. The rare precious metals which arebeing extracted and shipped back to Earth, become a highly sought-aftercommodity among Martians and they start to adorn themselves with it as a symbolof their achievement. As time goes by this metal becomes so desirable that itbecomes the local currency. Martians everywhere start to trade with thiscurrency so that it begins to affect the supply to mother Earth. Soon afterthis, the trade with the metal is outlawed and it goes underground. Within ashort space of time, a new elite Martian mafia-type organisation emerges whichstarts to control much of the power, while criminal activity surges. With thissudden arrival of material and monetary desires of the Martians, comes a wholenew and most serious dilemma. There are now 12,875 people on Mars and complexsocial problems start to creep into all spheres of life. The most worrying isthe emergence of social classes, skewing the balance of equality. Since this wasoriginally a government-funded expedition, all the people who were enrolledplayed a vital and integral part in the mission to Mars. They all received thesame remuneration, while all their daily needs and requirements on Mars wereprovided for by the expedition funds. The original team worked smoothly, withoutany conflict, as they each had a special function to fulfil, and each member wasa crucial part of the team. But suddenly this all changed, and a new workerclass emerged. Should the worker be treated the same as the first members of theteam? Or are they to be regarded as lesser ‘equals’, since they were created formore menial work? And how will they be remunerated? With food, clothing,entertainment, free sporting facilities and other things that will satisfy theirneeds while they live happily in the growing Martian community? Or do they getgiven some form of monetary remuneration which is deemed to be proportional tothe job they perform? With the one option you will create a ‘Communist’structure where everyone is equal and expected to contribute towards the benefitof the whole group ; but the other option is to plant the seeds of a capitalistsystem which comes with its own instant set of problems of greed and ownership.Which is the lesser of the two evils? With the first system it may happen thatpretty soon some individuals will start to drag their feet, not performing attheir peak and causing dissatisfaction among the other workers who have to makeup for their co-worker’s laziness. The other system will create instant classstructures where some get richer while the others get disgruntled with theirlot. Corruption and greed will permeate the communities with a long list ofundesirable social side effects ...Now I would like you to take a deep breath and attempt to answer this question.If it is possible that we as the human race are on the verge of colonising otherplanets, is it not possible, given the very murky surroundings of our ancestry,that we ourselves have come through a similar set of events here on Earth? Isthere not a real case for examining the evidence from prehistory to present acase based on more scientific and physical evidence, rather than the man-madereligions that keep the human race trapped in a cycle of religious dogma, guiltand fear?Fear is a powerful tool which has been used by dictators for eternity. The fearof punishment, physical harm, torture and gruesome death has haunted humanitysince the beginning. But the fear of spiritual torture is equally strong. Theinsane fear of going to hell after death, where you will burn for eternity, isvery real to billions of people on Earth today. The fear that was instilled inus by our maker was the blueprint which was followed by political leaders andreligious leaders ever since. These powerful tools have not only been used bygruesome dictators, but also by the more cunning leaders of the modern world asa clever tool of propaganda. The global media have given world leaders instantaccess to their people. With this access they can create and control arelentless propaganda campaign, so subtle that often their strongest critics donot recognise it. I am always amazed how the giants like BBC and CNN candiscriminate or choose sides so blatantly, when they refer to “the Israelisoldiers” and in the same sentence they call their opponents “Palestinianmilitants or terrorists”. In an instant they legitimise the one group whilereducing their opponents to a distasteful group of barbarians. If I recallcorrectly, that is not the way they referred to the ANC when Nelson Mandela waspart of this militant group of revolutionaries. They were called ‘freedomfighters’ with a just cause to reclaim their land. So what is going on in theMiddle East? Have the world's media decided that the Palestinians are just abunch of brutal barbarians who deserve to be annihilated? Whether we like it ornot, this subtle play on words will eventually influence our personal judgment,as the years of repetition wear down our ability to distinguish truth frompropaganda. George W. Bush used the media very skilfully after the 9/11 attackto make the American people fearful of almost everything. He used the media tomake them believe that everyone was a threat and everyone wanted to attack them,invade them and overthrow them. A clever manoeuvre to unite his people behindhim and follow blindly as he leads them into a new global conflict of culturaldomination. This instilled fear suddenly justified all acts of war against othercountries based purely on the propaganda of the US government. The really sadthing is that the poor American people are completely oblivious to thisdevelopment which has completely consumed their lives. They are happy to paytheir taxes, strengthen their army, and invade the whole world to prevent themfrom possibly engaging in any future acts of aggression against the ‘land of thefree’. Does this sound familiar? Is this not very close to what Alexander theGreat and the Roman Empire did 2,300 years ago? If you add the element ofeconomic warfare waged by the largest economy on the rest of the world, you havea very grim picture of how civilised the modern world really is. The truth is,that we are in a constant state of conflict of some kind. The most prevalent andthe most dangerous is the growing economic conflict. Until recently there wasonly one player with total control of global economics. But through anunexpected sequence of events, the impossible has occurred and placed the formereconomic giant under threat. The sleeping dragon has awakened, and through thesheer numbers of people, China has shifted the balance of economic powerdramatically in a few short years.So what is the outcome of all this military and economic warfare? There is nooutcome; warfare will continue to be the biggest threat to the human race and itwill continue to cause unimaginable suffering amongst people everywhere. Itseems that there is nothing we can do to temper the violent gene. Until we startto come to grips with genetic engineering, until we actually located this geneand its related genes, or until we actually evolve a little more. Together withits newfound friend, the ‘greed’ gene, they make a devastating slice of DNA, sopowerful, with so much control over humanity, that it will be very difficult tofight it with our minds. And even though many will tell you that the mind can doanything, the programme in our genes reigns supreme. There has to be a latent‘violent’ gene hidden in all our genomes. This ‘violent’ gene and the ‘greed’gene, are stimulated by a variety of triggers, to come out of hiding and getactivated. These triggers depend on various factors that influence our lives aswe grow, and possibly even the activity of other genes. There is a possibilitythat it is not really a violent gene, but just one element of a cluster of genesthat has a completely different function when working together. And just like acomputer will malfunction if the software programme is not complete, a specificgene will function improperly when it has been disturbed by extrinsic factors.This too, we will discover as our knowledge of the genome increases.George Soros is possibly the world’s wealthiest and most active philanthropist.He has made immense wealth and at the same time has been involved in continuousdonor funding activity all over the world. He is truly a strange phenomenon,because to make money and build an empire like he has, takes a specific type ofcharacter which is normally associated with drive, commitment, cunning,ruthlessness, being relentless and often cruel, but also a visionary and a goodstrategist. The kind of characteristics displayed by military leaders. It makessense that the fight for economic victory follows a parallel path. But GeorgeSoros is better known for his benevolent attributes. The amount of money hespends on financial support for needy countries and thousands of othercharitable institutions around the world is truly inspiring. This is a veryunusual characteristic which seems to be growing amongst the high profilewealthy individuals globally. But Soros still leads the pack by a long way. Thecurious thing is his ancestry. Being of Greek origin places him very close tothe main centre of activity of the Anunnaki of the ancient times. Just humour mefor a while as I try to unravel the possible genetic links to our makers. Themain residences and palaces of the Anunnaki were in the Middle East when theyfirst arrived. This is where they settled and ruled from. This is also wherethey made certain crucial decisions that were then implemented. Like thedecision to create a human-like clone to perform all the hard labour on Earth.If the first humans were created in this part of the world, using a mixture ofAnunnaki DNA and Homo erectus DNA to create a new species, it means that theremust have been a period when the Middle East had a growing population of the newhuman species, evolving as they performed menial tasks for their masters andgods. It is also likely, given the human nature of promiscuity, that the “sonsof the Nefilim saw the daughters of man” and they had sex with them, creating awhole new genetic pool which was more advanced than the Homo sapiens ‘slavespecies’. Is it therefore possible that there is a genetically more advancedgroup of people in the Middle East who have a more advanced genome in certainrespects? These may be the wealthy but benevolent individuals who have evolvedfaster and started to feel the effects of newly released genes which the rest ofus are yet to experience. Is this also a possible reason why all over the worldwe have great people who emerge out of the morass of human conflict to shine alight of new wisdom and a new vision, as they lead by example? Gandhi andMandela being just two examples. Could they be more evolved genetically becausetheir ancestors had more Anunnaki blood in their bodies than human blood?It is curious that some wealthy people are overcome by guilt of some sort oncethey have amassed large amounts of wealth. I suppose it is the realisation thatyou can’t take it with you, which leads to all kinds of internal moral clashes.We have been given some 80 years on average to do something with our lives.Since we have been liberated from the ‘slave species’ status into which we wereoriginally created, we face a dilemma. What do we do with all this time onEarth. I predict in this book that as our genome evolves, it allows our mind tointeract on different levels with the world around us. It stands to reason thatan evolved mind will interact differently with the universal spirit, or God witha big ‘G’ as I like to call it. This relationship between human and the divinewill unquestionably impact on the way those individuals behave and how itchanges their opinions about worldly issues facing Humankind. But for the meantime, while various structures which were imposed on us as a primitive speciesstill prevail, we are slowly unlocking the chains of bondage and inventing newpastimes, hobbies and knowledge.It is incredible how certain sectors of the global economy have influenced theway we behave, dress, speak, court, make love, and engage in war. The pastcentury is filled with a number of fantastic examples of this impressionablehuman trait.Let’s take a look at the tobacco industry for example. Before the advent of themoving pictures, smoking was not such a ‘hip’ thing to do. Suddenly the silverscreen was filled with stars who all held long sexy cigarettes in their hands.Lighting a cigarette became a signature scene in virtually every movie asdirectors fell in love with the way their cameras captured the swirling smoke.Within a few short years smoking was associated with glitz and glamour, andeveryone wanted to look as cool as their favourite movie star. Personal healthwas not on their mind, their image was the main thing. Is it possible that thecigarette companies may have had something to do with those early movies? Usingthe power of mass media to attract new consumers?Soap operas have had such a huge impact on the behaviour of people that itabsolutely boggles the mind. Millions upon millions of people across the worldgather every day to worship at the TV, watching their favourite soapiereligiously. It has become a ‘pseudo religion’ for some and they will not go outat night before getting their dose of surrealism. At the risk of soundingsexist, I have heard confessions from women who claim that they plan their daysbased on the storyline in their favourite soapie. It affects their moods, theirneeds, their relationships and their lives. Is that not a clear sign of adisturbed civilisation in search of reason? So where does this disturbed globalpopulation come from?As we uncover the dusty tablets of wisdom left behind by our ancient ancestors,we will begin to see the clear evidence that we are the reluctant by-product ofan advanced group of beings who populated the Earth some 443,000 years ago. Theevidence is overwhelming that they created humans as a ‘primitive worker’ toease their workload in the gold mines, essentially creating the first slaves andentrenching our obsession with gold. We will discover with absolute amazementhow closely our behaviour resembles that of the Anunnaki who created us. Becausewe were endowed with much of their DNA, we should not be surprised that we areshowing the same character flaws, which eventually destroyed their own unity onEarth. We look like them, we behave like them, and slowly our DNA is evolving toits original configuration as possessed by our makers, the Anunnaki. In essence,we are the aliens on this planet called Earth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9 [../Text/toc.html#chapter9]GOLD: THE ENDLESS OBSESSION [../Text/toc.html#chapter9a]I have been asked several times throughout my life what I would change if I hada chance to do it all again. Maybe I was very lucky or ignorant or possibly evenarrogant, but I would change nothing. My childhood days were filled with so muchlaughter, non-stop fun and adventure, growing up on the gold fields of SouthAfrica, that I cannot imagine having it any other way. For those who have neverhad the pleasure of visiting the gold fields of the West Rand, South Africa, donot be disappointed, because the fields are not actually filled with gold. Thename does however suggest a landscape filled with shiny, glistening mounds ofgold as far as the eye can see. All you have to do is reach out and take it. Onthe contrary, the West Rand is a rather flat grassland, full of mielie (maize)fields, whirlwinds, dust, afternoon thunderstorms and sinkholes. There is asmall range of hills that seems to run all the way from Johannesburg toPotchefstroom for about 150 kilometres. As you travel this two-hour stretch ofroad, you come across your typical mining settlements, which have between 200and 5,000 residents. They have great names like Zuurbekom, Westonaria,Randfontein, Venterspost, Waterpan, Hills Haven, Libanon, Fochville and thefamous Carletonville. The one common feature that links them all together is thearray of mine shafts. Small ones, giant ones, concrete ones and steel ones. Sinkholes are a fascinating phenomenon in these parts, mainly as a result of man’shunger for gold. As the mining activity underground drains the water, it allowsthe dolomite rock formations to become dry and brittle. With time and pressure,they eventually cave in and cause sinkholes on the surface with devastatingeffects to humans. These sinkholes can range from a few metres across to akilometre across and their depth normally varies from hole to hole. TheVenterspost Golf Course, where I mastered my enviable handicap of 22, was builtaround such a sinkhole featuring some daunting drives that force you to clearthe hole instead of water. On many occasions we would be forced to venture downinto the giant sinkhole in search of lost balls. More often than not it wasworth the trek, as the booty provided us with golfing riches every 12-year-oldcould only dream of… Balls for Africa.Everything on the West Rand revolved around gold which had a knock-on effectinto every possible industry imaginable. The villages were, and are still today,designed to provide the families of mine workers with everything they need tokeep them occupied. This obviously applied only to the white miners, while theblack migrant labour-force was crammed into men's hostels that developed verydisturbing socio-economic problems with time. But for the fortunate ones, it wasswimming, golf, tennis, squash, bowls, badminton, jukskei, club house activityand constant social events. This was like paradise for any growing child. Whatmore did we need? Every mining home had the spoils of their underground toil ondisplay, normally consisting of a range of gold ore rocks, clearly showing therich sediment arteries of gold and other metals. These rocks would inevitably beabove the fireplace, in the middle of the table holding down the crochet clothor even converted into a home-made ashtray. It's incredible to think that asmuch as 60% of the modern world's gold came from this area which stretches about200 kilometres in diameter and also includes large parts of the Free State.While this geographic location may not have been terribly relevant to me and allthe other gold miners in the '70s, it would certainly start to raise manycrucial questions in my mind by the mid '90s, when it started to become clearthat the so-called ‘Cradle of Humankind’ was located right here in southernAfrica. Is it not curious that it was here in southern Africa where the Sumeriantablets claim that most of the original gold mining activity took place, shortlyafter the Anunnaki first arrived on Earth some 450,000 years ago? And accordingto the tablets, it is also here, at the southern tip of Africa where the newlycreated species was put to work some 200,000 years later when the ‘Adamu’ wasfirst created. Should we be surprised that these amazing historic facts all seemto tie up? Yes we should, because we know by now that history has taught usnothing, so once again we look at these incredible coincidences and we refuse tobelieve what they are telling us.But back on the West Rand in 1970, to the hundreds of thousands of peoplegrowing up in this mining industry, it was all they knew, and it was all theyneeded. To the point that I personally always felt sorry for the kids in thecity. I could never understand what all the ‘other people’ were doing living incities and other parts of the country. What could be more important than gold?What else was there? Our lives were so consumed by the activities surroundingthe gold mining industry, it was truly difficult to imagine a life other thanthat. After all, our fathers were the guys responsible for getting the shinymetal out of the ground – the bars of gold which were the envy of the wholeworld. I distinctly remember the sadness that surrounded underground rock fallsresulting in deaths of people you knew very well. Like my friend's father whodied underground in the pursuit of gold, or people swallowed up by sinkholeswhile playing tennis on a Sunday morning. But while there were regulartragedies, we somehow justified it and believed that it was all okay, because wewere part of the big plan to provide the world with gold. Life simply carried onand every day more trucks filled with gold would leave our backyard to bedelivered to someone, somewhere in the distant corners of the world.Looking back at this scenario some 30 years later, there seems to be very littledifference between my father's underground toil for the shiny yellow metal, andthe original primitive miners who worked the gold mines at the dawn of humanity.They both came into this world with a finite number of years to live, performedtheir duty, and made some invisible god richer. The similarity between the humanslave species at the dawn of humanity and the modern mine worker is quitestartling. If we examine the Sumerian texts and see how the new ‘primitiveworker’ was treated by his ‘gods’ while working the mines, performing the hardlabour for his masters while being provided with everything they needed in theGarden of Eden, we realise that nothing much has changed in thousands of years.The primitive workers must have also wondered where all this shiny metal wasgoing to. It would be whisked away by the gods never to be seen again. Why wasit so important to the gods? What made this yellow metal so sought-after? Whywere the workers not allowed to keep any of it… or own it? Why were theypunished so severely if they kept any of it? Why was so much effort put into itsrecovery? Where did it all disappear to? Who was using it… and for what? Butthese questions were probably never answered in ancient times. While we maythink differently today, do we really know where all the gold goes to? And whoactually ends up using it for what purpose? We think we know… we have all thescientific answers and the economic indicators thrown at us daily providing uswith a warped sense of confidence because the ‘gold market is stable’.Explanations of what happens to all the precious metals on Earth fills the pagesof economic dailies, but I still suspect that there is much more to the story ofgold which is not known nor understood by the well informed human race in the21stcentury. It feels as if there is a greater monster somewhere in the skyconsuming much of the precious metal spoils from Earth.Why are we so obsessed with gold? What caused this sudden prehistoric obsession?Why was it gold and not some other precious metal? Why is it that we can tracethis obsession all the way back to the cradle of Humankind? The sudden emergenceof civilisation some 11,000 years BC went hand in hand with agriculture,structured communities and domestication of animals by the new ‘thinking man’.There seems to be no sensible explanation for this. Anthropologists areperplexed by man's virtual disappearance or slow regression before the greatflood of some 13,000 years ago, until they suddenly re-emerged with a newvigour, and as if out of nowhere, civilisation emerged in the Near East. It wasfrom there that all these suddenly acquired skills spread around the world.These are now accepted statistics by most scholars. They had hardly appearedfrom the dregs of the flood, and already they had gold, and their fascinationwith the pale metal was as visible as it is today.One other thing which however still perplexes historians, is the speed at whicha wide variety of new agricultural produce kept coming out of the Near East,starting from around 8000 BC or even earlier. It was as if the Near East hadbecome some kind of a botanical incubator, constantly producing newlydomesticated plant species. How was it possible that primitive man, who wasstill living in caves, suddenly gained such advanced knowledge? This time hasbeen described as the end of the Palaeolithic period or Old Stone Age, and thebeginning of the Middle Stone Age or Mesolithic period. It means that man wasstill completely consumed by stone in all his day-to-day activity. His dwellingwas made from stone, villages were protected by stone walls, his tools were madefrom stone, he covered his dead with stones and so on. So who was holding hishand, dragging him towards civilisation, showing him the way, impartingknowledge as quickly as man could absorb it? There seems to be a clear linkbetween Noah's landing on fertile land, planting the first vines and theemergence of civilisation in the Near East. It is very curious that thisprimitive man, while emerging from the Stone Age, already possessed advancedknowledge of refining and processing gold, even for thousands of years leadingup to this point.Was the same hand that helped man with agriculture behind his gold miningexploits? It certainly seems like a plausible explanation. Or do you stillbelieve that primitive man just slowly evolved into knowing all about thisadvanced technology? I could possibly buy the alluvial gold theory, because itis reasonably easy to find it in rivers, sieve the mud, retrieve the gold andpolish it. Alluvial gold nuggets vary from very small to reasonably large andoften shine in the water, which would have attracted the attention of many apasser-by. But the problem is that many of the prehistoric mining sites wereactually ore installations. This complicates things a bit. Even the subtledifference in the appearance of gold in its alluvial state, compared to the wayit looks like in ore sediments, takes a trained eye to recognise. I simplycannot imagine primitive man walking along some 12,000 years ago, stubbing histoe on a rock, which led to the inadvertent discovery of ore gold mining. He sawthat the rock was different from others. On closer inspection he identified goldsediments in the rock. He instinctively knew that if he crushed the rock hecould extract gold from it. But first he had to go through the followingprocess:“Sodium cyanide solution is allowed to leach through a pile of finely-groundrock that has proven to contain gold and silver, and is then collected as goldcyanide and silver cyanide solution. Zinc is added to the solution,precipitating out zinc, silver and gold metals. The zinc is removed withsulphuric acid, leaving a silver and gold amalgam that may be further processedinto the individual metals. The cyanide technique is very simple andstraightforward to apply, and popular in areas where mine tailings may containsurprisingly large quantities of valuable metals. There can be significantenvironmental damage caused by the use of this technique due to the hightoxicity presented by the cyanide itself.”(Source: Wikipedia.org)I have a real problem believing that primitive man engaged in this process ofhis own accord long before he even knew about agriculture and other basicaspects of civilisation. The only known reference to this kind of knowledgeexists in the Sumerian tablets. Do we take them seriously or do we discard theinformation captured on these tablets? Many historians have chosen to discardthis knowledge and by doing so have denied Humankind a true glimpse at theinexplicable behaviour of ancient humans. Why has there been this fanaticalobsession with gold since the earliest days of humanity? Why is this obsessioncontinuing today? When did man first decide that gold made a great necklace andstarted adorning himself with the shiny metal? What were early man's realreasons or motivations? Many people believe the answer is simple, they will tellyou that it is the rarity of gold that makes it so desirable. But it somehowdoes not answer the question satisfactorily. Why did primitive man need gold inthe first place when there were so many other shinier objects to adorn himselfwith? What made gold so rare and more desirable than all the other worldly shinystones and metals? Besides the alluvial gold which may have been exhausted veryquickly, who taught man to extract metal from ore?The history of gold is a fascinating tale. As far back as we can go, humans havealways been obsessed with it. The gold rush of the 1850s; the Vatican; theSpanish Conquistadores; the Vikings of the Dark Ages; the Romans; the Greeks;the Egyptians; the Mayas; Incas; Olmecs; Toltecs; the Mesopotamians; Akkadians;Sumerians and the mysterious Anunnaki were all obsessed with gold. Gold has beenthe obsession of kings for ever. It was also the chosen item of sacrifice by‘god’ and many of the other ancient gods, when demanding offerings from theirhuman subjects. It has been a symbol of wealth and success in most religions andthe Old Testament is filled with references to gold in a multitude ofsituations. This includes the strict instructions from God to Moses, about thedimensions of the Ark of the Covenant and the materials that were to be used inits construction. The following instructions come directly from Exodus 37.• They are to make an Ark of acacia wood, 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27inches high. • Overlay it with pure gold; overlay it both inside and out. Alsomake a gold moulding all around it. • Cast four gold rings for it and place[them] on its four feet; two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.• Make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold. • Insert the poles intothe rings on the sides of the Ark in order to carry the Ark with them. • Thepoles are to remain in the rings of the Ark; they must not be removed from it. •Put the [tablets of the] testimony that I will give you into the Ark. • Make amercy seat of pure gold, 45 inches long and 27 inches wide. • Make two cherubimof gold; make them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat. • Makeone cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. Make the cherubim of onepiece with the mercy seat at its two ends. • The cherubim are to have wingsspread out above, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and are to face oneanother. The faces of the cherubim should be toward the mercy seat. • Set themercy seat on top of the Ark and put the testimony that I will give you into theArk. • I will meet with you there above the mercy seat, between the two cherubimthat are over the Ark of the testimony; I will speak with you from there aboutall that I command you regarding the Israelites.These are pretty detailed instructions. If I had to receive a plan like thistoday, I would be quite curious to know why the sizes and materials had to be sospecific, if all that this fancy ‘chest’ was supposedly for, was to carry somevaluables from Johannesburg to Bloemfontein. Is it possible that instead of justbeing a container for the future commandments, the Ark was also some kind ofcommunication device? After all, God said to Moses, “I will meet with you thereabove the mercy seat, between the two cherubim that are over the Ark of theTestimony; I will speak with you from there about all that I command youregarding the Israelites.” Surely the all-powerful-god could speak to Mosesanywhere? Rather than confining him to a designated seat with his head betweensuspicious ‘cherubim’! Were the extended ‘poles’ not just for carrying thedevices, but also antennae to receive transmitted messages? Were the ‘cherubim’some sort of speaker system between which Moses had to sit to hear God'smessage? It is all very curious and highly suspicious once you remove thereligious emotion from it. The historic reality is that gold has played a veryunusual role in the entire history of Humankind, often crossing the line tobecome religious practice or rituals. Why would God have such an insatiableappetite for gold? Before we speculate any further about the possible reasonssurrounding such a divine hunger for gold, let us first take a look at the metaland what the real fuss is all about. What makes this metal so special?Gold is a remarkable metal with an unparalleled combination of chemical andphysical properties, which make it invaluable in a wide range of everydayapplications essential to our modern life. Many thousands of everyday appliancesrequire gold to ensure a smooth performance for long periods. Gold is virtuallyindestructible and is completely recyclable and immune to the effects of air,water, and oxygen. Gold will not tarnish, rust or corrode. These properties makegold a vital component in many medical, industrial, and electrical applications.Gold is the most non-reactive of all metals. It never reacts with oxygen, thatis why it will not rust or tarnish. The golden mask in the tomb of Tutankhamenlooked as brilliant when it was unearthed in 1922 as when it was entombed in1,352 BC. Gold is among the most electrically conductive of all metals and isable to convey even a tiny electrical current in temperatures varying from-55°Celsius to +200°Celsius. It is therefore a vital component in computers andtelecommunication equipment. It is the most ductile of all metals, allowing itto be drawn out into tiny wires or threads without breaking. A single ounce(28.4grams) of gold can be drawn into a wire eight kilometres long. It can beshaped and extended into extraordinarily thin sheets. One ounce of gold can behammered into a 12-metre-square sheet. Gold is the most reflective material ofinfrared energy. This means that high purity gold reflects up to 99% of infraredrays. This makes gold ideal for heat and radiation reflection for astronauts andfire-fighters. But at the same time, gold is also an excellent conductor ofthermal energy or heat. It is used to transfer heat away from delicateinstruments. For this reason, a 35% gold alloy is used in the main engine nozzleof the Space Shuttle, where temperatures can reach 3,300°Celsius.So what did ‘god’ have up his sleeve when he gave Moses such preciseinstructions? Did someone capture all those instructions in writing or were someof the more intricate details omitted simply because the writer could not reallyunderstand the finer details? Why were the ancient ‘gods’and not only humans soobsessed with gold? When you start weighing up all the little coincidences, andyou pay attention to the Sumerians, they begin to make a lot of sense. Mostpeople still carry the naïve view that man simply stumbled upon gold byaccident, it became a tradable commodity admired by kings, eventually becomingthe global currency driving stock markets up and down. I just cannot buy thissimplistic view which is largely based on our current perception of the metal inthe 21stcentury. The history of gold mining has very sketchy roots which are asmurky as the rest of ancient human history. The oldest tangible writtendocumentation we have available to us from very ancient history, are theSumerian clay tablets and seals, but these seem to be rejected by many resistantscholars. The last decade however, has seen a giant and radical swing towardsaccrediting these tablets with some merit. As more and more tablets have beenverified and translated, mavericks like Zecharia Sitchin have received moreserious acclaim, and the tablets started to make a real impact on the ‘holygrail’ of science with their outlandish theories on our ancient ancestors andcreators. So if we accept the contents of the Sumerian tablets, we will have toaccept the fact that gold mining goes back several hundred thousand years, longbefore any of us could fathom. But as we will see, it all fits perfectly intothe Great Human Puzzle and provides us with riveting information to dispel allthe rubbish which we have been indoctrinated with over hundreds of years. Youwill have to be brave to face the real truth, because it is not what the globalestablishments would like you to believe. This leaves me personally with onlyone conclusion. The ancient ‘gods’ who populated the world and enslavedHumankind may still be active among us in ways which we cannot comprehend, notallowing knowledge to spread, keeping their firm grip through religiousoppression over their ‘slave species’.There are very clear references in the Sumerian tablets to the introduction ofkingships by the ‘gods’, the role of high priests as the carriers of the ‘gods’instructions’ to their people, and the ongoing mining activities in search ofthe precious metal that brought the Anunnaki to Earth in the first place. Thepriests and kings were often summonsed to a meeting with ‘god’ during which theywould receive very specific instructions to convey to their people. This was acommon event in the Old Testament, with people like Abraham and Moses, beingjust two of the more famous examples of how god interacted with man, giving himexplicit instructions. Why is this not happening today? Or have we just becometoo wise for the conniving ‘gods’ of biblical times? In the ‘Story ofHumankind’chapter we will cover in great detail the creation of the ‘Adamu’ andthe ‘primitive slave worker’ who had to toil in the mines of southern Africadigging for gold, for their gods. But I trust that I should set the scene inorder to explain some of the fundamentals derived from thousands of Sumeriantablets which form the foundation of the claims I make in this chapter.The slow and steady translation of Sumerian tablets gives us a peek into ancienthuman history for the very first time and turns everything we have been taughton its head. They give an extended written account of the entire history of therise of civilisations on Earth, but it is not what most would expect. And yetwhen you evaluate all the stuff compiled in this book, it will hopefully make asmuch sense to you as it does to me. Here is a short outline of the complex storyof Humankind, as told in the Sumerian tablets, merely to serve as a guide toexplain some statements in this chapter:The Anunnaki were astronauts and explorers who settled on Earth some 443,000years ago under the command of Anu, hence the Anunnaki. His two sons Enlil andEnki were given the control of their new space base. They came in search of goldto help mend their planet Nibiru's failing ozone layer and atmosphere. Over timethey sent as many as 600 explorers and workers to Earth, set up a multitude ofmining operations in southern Africa and a space command centre in the Near Eastat Eridu, the oldest settlement on Earth. After some time and complaints fromthose Anunnaki who had to toil in the mines, they created a clone, which was amixture of their DNA with that of the Homo erectus creature that lived on Earth.They called this first ‘primitive worker’ ‘Adamu’ and after some time theycreated a female partner for him to procreate, instead of being carried bysurrogate Anunnaki females. “Let us create a Lulu, a primitive worker, thehardship work to take over… By the mark of our essence to fashion him.”(Translation from Sumerian tablet.)The new slave species became highly sought after by the Anunnaki in the NearEast and so began to toil there as well, away from his African cradle. TheAnunnaki also had a base established on Mars from where they could send largershipments because of the lower gravity. This was before the cosmic events thatcaused the great flood on Earth and also caused Mars to lose its atmosphere.Those who lived on Mars were called Igigi, but the cosmic events forced theIgigi to desert the planet and return to Earth. The sons of the Anunnaki and theIgigi were referred to as the Nefilim in the book of Genesis and otherliterature. ‘Those who descended to Earth from heaven’. Even Genesis tells usabout these Nefilim who came to Earth and ‘saw that the daughters of man werebeautiful and had children with them’. This created a whole new species ofhumans called the Aryans who lived separately from the rest and influencedfuture civilisations to a great extent. They were followers of Marduk, who wewill hear a lot more of later. All these activities happened for very soundreasons. The planet Nibiru is on a 3,600 year orbit around the Sun, just likethe orbit of many comets. On one of its approaches to the Sun, Nibiru cameunusually close to Earth and Mars, causing great geological upheavals thatresulted in the Great Flood some 13,000 years ago. At the same time the presenceof Nibiru also caused Mars' atmosphere to be ‘sucked away’. The Anunnaki sawthis approaching global catastrophe as an opportunity to wipe out the slavespecies that they created and which had grown to very large numbers by then. Theslave species had become a big problem that was not going away. They neededconstant supervision, care and feeding like little helpless children. They werebecoming unruly and some even began to develop thoughts of independence,breaking the bonds of labour and slavery in the mines. But the biggest problemfor Enlil was that some of the Nefilim were having children with the humanfemales, creating a whole new sub-species and exacerbating the problem. At theoriginal point of creation of the ‘Adamu’ there was much disagreement betweenthe two commanding brothers. Enlil was completely opposed to the creation of anew species and now he had the perfect opportunity by allowing a naturaldisaster to eliminate the human problem. But Enki who was the creator ofHumankind, told some of his own offspring to save themselves in a submersibleboat. The rest is part of human history. But the close proximity of Earth toNibiru, had a devastating effect on the large planet Nibiru as well, once againdisturbing its atmosphere. Just when the Anunnaki thought they had saved theirplanet Nibiru and were going home, the gold mining had to resume. As fate wouldhave it, they were grateful that some humans survived. But this time they wouldgive them knowledge and teach them all they needed to know about civilisationand survival, while they slowly began to be absorbed into the extended family ofgods. The gods divided the world into a number of regions, allocating eachregion to one of the more senior Anunnaki children on Earth. Disagreements andgreed began to consume the ruling gods, with one of them called Marduk/Ra/Amun,proclaiming himself to be the ‘one god above all’. He expanded his influenceover the world against the will of the rest of the Anunnaki gods, causing astandoff. Marduk seems to be the ‘one god’ of the Old Testament who began toprohibit the worship of other gods by humans. He was also referred to as the‘god of vengeance’ who about 2,500 years BC began to force humans everywhere toaccept him as the only god. He promised reward and sympathy to those who obeyedhim and great punishment to those who did not. He also began to promiseimmortality to his followers, the Pharaohs being the major and first benefactorsof his promises. It is for these reasons that we see the unusual obsession withthe afterlife among the Egyptian kings. The rest of the Anunnaki decided thatthey had to act decisively and with extreme force against Marduk. This was thetime that involved Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible. The destruction was violentand widespread, with dire consequences. But somehow, Marduk escaped theonslaught, and the events only made him more feared and worshipped by thesurviving humans. And so his related extended family in northern Mesopotamia,the Aryans, invaded the lands to the east and Europe to the west, conqueringhumans everywhere and imposing their Aryan supremacy on them. And such is theremaining status quo in the world today.I must tell you that I am not making any of this up in a moment of fictionalinsanity. As ridiculous as these tales may sound, they are no more ridiculousthan what is happening in the world today. But you can be the judge of theevidence presented, and you can decide whether you want to remain a slavespecies, or whether you want to begin exploring the new options presented to usas we unearth more and more prehistoric artefacts which tell us a completelydifferent story about our human ancestry to the one we have all been told.Let us go back to the obsession with gold. The ‘slave species’ were toiling inthe mines oblivious of their exact place in the greater scheme of things. Theyknew that this was the only thing required of them. They lived in compounds notdissimilar to those used on South African mines even today. Everything wasprovided for the slaves, but they had no choice, no freedom, no future otherthan toiling in mines. They were born into mining slavery and they died asslaves on the mines. But there must have been slaves who rebelled and escapedinto the dense African bush, to form small family units, learning to survive ashunter gatherers. The Khoi-San people were most likely some of those. There camea time when some slaves were allowed to leave the mine compounds and live in theAfrican wild, probably when they became old and fragile, not able to do the hardlabour they were intended for. These groups of early humans formed small unitsand tribes, developing their own distinct African cultures which were filledwith mythological gods and tales that are difficult for historians tounderstand. But when seen from this new perspective it makes perfect sense whyAfrican mythology and their religions are so different from the rest to theworld. Because it was here in Africa where the first humans were created, theylived and slaved in isolation from the other emerging human communities, andthey established their own unique cultures, highly influenced by their master‘gods’. There was very little contact between these early humans in Africa andthe rest of the world, where interbreeding was taking place between humans andthe offspring of the Anunnaki, giving rise to the Aryans of the north. It ispossible that there may even have been a mutiny by the ‘slave species’ againsttheir enslavement, after some 100,000 years of toiling.After the mutiny of the slave species, when many were allowed to leave theirmining compounds, the mining continued while many of the slaves tried to live innewly-formed communities and survive without the help of their gods. Could thisrelationship between the slaves and Anunnaki be echoed in the religiousstructures of today? Could the Anunnaki still be holding a firm grip on humanactivity especially around the production of gold in modern times? Many of thesecret societies throughout history have been traced way back to the origin ofhumanity and the so-called ‘Brotherhood of the Snake’. And the conspiracytheories keep coming. The great thing about conspiracy theories is that that'sexactly what they remain. But the fact that our human origin is in question;that the role of gold in the world has dubious origins; the questionable rolewhich the church and its priests have played in the hording of gold and wealth,all point to possible conspiracies so deep that there may be more to them thanmeets the sober mind. Just to demonstrate how confused historians are about theorigins of gold and its possible meaning to early humans, here are some randomextracts of what has been said about the origins of gold:“Gold was probably the first metal known to the early hominids that, on findingit as nuggets and spangles in the soils and stream sands, were undoubtedlyattracted by its intrinsic beauty, great malleability, and virtualindestructibility.”I find this statement utterly ridiculous. Why would a soft metal have any valueto primitive hominid, ape-like creatures, when their preoccupation was withsurvival, food and shelter? But the Anunnaki needed gold and they needed aworker to get the gold from the ground.“During the stone ages the metal appears to have taken on a sacred qualitybecause of its enduring character and immortality, being worn initially probablyas amulets and later fashioned into religious objects and idols.”All very well, but why would gold, rather than any of the other metals orprecious stones take on such an importance? There is no justifiable reason forsuch behaviour by primitive early humans, unless they were imitating someone,placing value on the metal for some reason.“By the time of the early Indus, Sumerian, and Egyptian civilisations (3000-2000BC) gold had not only retained its sacred quality but had become the symbol ofwealth and social rank.”Exactly! By this time humans were given civilisation by their gods and gold wasestablished as the ‘property of the gods’. This is very well documented by theConquistadores in Mesoamerica. They were repeatedly told by the natives that allthe gold ‘belonged to the gods’. In biblical times god would reward his obedienthuman followers in various ways. Gold was one of those rewards, because it wasrevered by humans, as a divine metal. Any human who was allowed to keep gold orgiven gold by the gods as a form of reward, was admired by everyone. They wouldbe in possession of something ‘godly’ and ‘divine’, which was a huge socialprivilege, increasing the desire and demand for gold.“Homer (circa 1000 BC) writes in the Iliad and Odyssey, the epic poems ofancient Greece, describing gold repeatedly both as a sign of wealth amongmortals and as a symbol of splendour among the immortals.”There we have it. Homer had similar views on the issue with gold. Why did heknow these things, which our modern intellectuals have reduced to mythologicalmumbo-jumbo not to be taken seriously? The following statement immediatelysupports my disillusion with modern teachers of human history. This seems to bea commonly accepted view among scholars, which I find extremely arrogant,short-sighted and outright ignorant. They should read more, open their eyes andstop filling the minds of our children with half-truths and utter rubbish, whichis mostly regurgitated historical rhetoric not worthy of the paper it is writtenon.“Early references to the first discovery of gold are essentially legendary ormythical. The Chronicum Alexandrinum (AD 628) ascribes its discovery of gold toMercury, the Roman god of merchandise and merchants, the son of Jupiter, or toPisus. Similar legends and myths concerning the initial discovery of gold arereferred to in the ancient literature of the Hindus (the Vedas) as well as inthat of the ancient Chinese and other peoples.”What more do we need in the form of support for what we read in the Sumeriantablets? Obviously Alexander's historians knew more than our historians dotoday, and they must have been familiar with the extensive library at Alexandriawith its millions of books, lost to our modern historians. They did not hesitatecalling the deities ‘gods’ while today's historians very quickly reduce them to‘mythological’ figures.Here is a little more of what history sources have to say about gold: “Thediscovery of the element we call gold is lost in antiquity.” This is not true.Here is an extract from a Sumerian tablet translated by Zecharia Sitchin: “Letgold from the waters be obtained, let it for salvation on Nibiru be tested.”This was the first ever reference to gold in our ancient prehistory. Wordsspoken by Anu, the king of Nibiru, before they dispatched the Anunnaki to Earthto retrieve the gold. Do we just ignore these scripts and regard them asnonsense? Why would prehistoric men be so obsessed with gold that they wrotesuch elaborate stories about the metal? I contest that it would have beenrelevant, only if gold played a crucial role in their survival, and so it did.It was the main reason and the only reason why the Anunnaki were on Earth, andthe only reason Humankind was created.“The principal source of gold in primitive times was undoubtedly stream placers,although there is considerable evidence in certain gold belts in Egypt, Indiaand other places. The Eluvial and alluvial placers were worked in the crudestmanner by panning or the simplest form of sluicing. Exposed parts of friableveins were simply dug out, trenched, or pitted with the crudest of tools, stonehammers, antler picks, bone and wooden shovels. Only rarely were simple shafts,and drifts attempted and then only in the soft rocks of the zone of oxidation.Fire-setting was probably employed by the ancient Egyptians, Semites, Indians,and others to break up the hard quartz veins.”Why would early humans want to break up gold-bearing rock, if they did not knowhow to extract gold from ore? They must have known the procedure otherwise theywould not even have recognised gold deposits in ore. And we have evidence thatthey did use fire to break up the ore, so they must have known the rest of thecomplex procedure, including smelting at above 700° Celsius. But why be sosurprised, the Sumerian tablets tell us exactly how they went about obtaininggold from ore and how they smelted it. “How a new metal from stones wasextracted… to a place of melting and refining metals… ” the gold was taken.Throughout the history of Humankind, where there was evidence of gold, newsettlements erupted, bringing prosperity to some and desperation to others. Infact, it seems that if there was no evidence of gold from the earliest days ofantiquity, civilisation would only show signs of development much later. All theearliest human settlements seem to go hand-in-hand with gold.“Both small and large deposits that showed free gold visibly or in the pan wereworked by slaves, convicts, and prisoners of war who were assigned by those inauthority to the gold placers and mines.”The term ‘mine’ is very relevant here, as most mine shafts are dug for thepurpose of ore mining. And why would they have dug mine shafts like the ones insouthern Africa 50,000 years ago and more, if they had no knowledge of oremining?“Early references to gold mining appear in ancient Egyptian codes, on stelae, inpictograms and inscriptions in the tombs of the Pharaohs. The most ancientgeological map known, is from about the time of Seti I (circa 1320 BC) It showsroads, miners' houses, gold mines, quarries, auriferous mountains, and so on.The ancient Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Babylonian civilisations utilizedgold extensively, but their sources of the precious metal are relativelyuncertain.”This is not true! The clay tablets give us many references to gold, outliningthe mining operations, processing, smelting and usage. But the historians whowrite such tripe about the history of gold are probably the same people who givethe Egyptians credit for mining gold, but in the same sentence discredit thatwhich the Egyptians held so dear… their gods… who gave them all the knowledgeand wisdom, including that of mining for gold.“References to gold and gold mining are numerous in the Old Testament of theHebrews. Six sources of gold are mentioned in the Old Testament. They areHavilah, Ophir, Sheba, Midian, Uphaz, and Parvaim. The exact locations of allsix have given rise to much speculation. Some authorities claim that all sixsources are Arabian; others have suggested locations much farther afield.”If only they would pay attention to those mystical ancient scriptures leftbehind for us to assimilate. But unfortunately those had been classified asmythology, so no sober historian could possibly admit that such fiction hadinfluenced their professional opinion. There are very clear and detailedreferences to southern Africa or the “Abzu” as the place where the first gold inthe world came from. It also happens to be where the first ‘primitive worker’was put to work to mine the gold, and it also happens to be the Cradle ofHumankind. Is this all not a little too coincidental?There has been much speculation as to the location of Ophir, the fabulously richland, filled with gold from which King Solomon's navy brought more than 34metric tons of the metal to his kingdom. Kings 10:22 in the Old Testamentmentions cargoes of sandalwood trees, precious stones, ivory, apes, andpeacocks, suggesting the circumnavigation of Africa. Various references toTarshish suggest that the gold may have come from Tharsis, a mining town inSpain.Other favourite spots are East Africa and southern Africa, principally Zimbabwe,especially the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. The whole layout, design of the mainresidence, staff quarters, the art of building a stone structure without mortar,would have made a perfect master's residence for the ‘god’ Enki in the ‘Abzu’,as the clay tablets call it. Could this have been the head office of KingSolomon's mines? Who occupied it thousands of years after Enki “built his placein the Abzu”. There is no shortage of mines in southern Africa and over the past200 years of exploration over 500 ruins have been discovered in what was calledthe land of Monomotapa. This ancient land stretched from the coast ofMozambique, inland and included modern-day Zimbabwe. Various authorities such asBruce, Huet, Quartremere and Guillain, as well as the great majority of laterwriters on the Zimbabwe ruins, favour the claims that Monomotapa (Zimbabwe) wasthe Ophir of scripture. There is also a clear distinction between a much ‘older’Great Zimbabwe and all the newer structures which were built in much latertimes. Could this be a repetition of the Pyramid symptom? The originalstructures were built by the prehistoric Anunnaki under the leadership of Enki,as his home in the Abzu (southern African mining region). Thousands of yearslater, just as in the case of the pyramids, kings of the biblical times,Phoenicians and Himyarites built their own new structures, which do not quitemeet the style and quality of the original? In the ‘Adapted Excerpts’ from TheAncient Ruins of Rhodesia by R.N. Hall and W.G. Neal, 1904, we read about a“first or older” Zimbabwe and a more recent one. The scholars write that“massive structures which, while following generally the first Zimbabwe type,have been built in three or more high-terraced tiers rising to the summit of thehills, surrounding them, and sometimes completely covering them.” They tell usthat \"this ‘wedding cake\" feature, as it has been termed, is absent in allZimbabwe ruins built in the first period. Yet all these later Zimbabwe ruinspresent all the evidence of having been erected by nature-worshippers, andcontain the orientated temple “open to heaven,” the sacred circle, the conicaltowers “the high places”, the monoliths, and every evidence of Phallic worship.This class of Zimbabwe is represented, among many others, by Dhlo-dhlo, Regina,Meteme, and Khami people.The Phoenician connection to the ruins is striking. The monuments, stonecarvings and statues found in Zimbabwe are identical in style to those which arepredominant in Sardinia and other ancient Near Eastern cultures, including theworship of the god Baal. Explorers Neal and Hall were leading this drive at theturn of the century. They continue explaining that there is a “marvelloussimilarity” between these later Zimbabwes and many of the three thousandnauraghes, or terraced fortresses, which cover the island of Sardinia. “In boththe Rhodesian and Sardinian erections evidences of nature-worship are abundant.”The age of the Sardinian nauraghes goes back to the Bronze Age, around 3,500 -1,500 BC, and scholars like Geyard write: “I have no hesitation in consideringthe numerous round edifices of Sardinia, which are known under the name ofnauraghes, as monuments of the worship of Baal.” The Zimbabwean ruins of thelatter period resemble such monuments to the god Baal, who was worshiped between2,500 and 200 BC all over the Near East and Egypt. This gives us a clear linkbetween the advanced civilisations of the north and the distant lands of gold inthe south, referred to as Ophir during biblical times.This is an incredible breakthrough. There is constant reference to the ‘FirstZimbabwe’ and ‘Latter Zimbabwe’ which can be distinguished by their architectureand worshipping of gods. Not only do we have strong evidence to support thatKing Solomon's mines were indeed located in southern Africa, but suddenly wehave tangible evidence that there were two distinct civilisations in Zimbabwe,separated by thousands of years. The more recent or ‘Latter Zimbabwe’ was activebetween 2,000 - 200BC. They built their shrines and dwellings the same way astheir brothers up north in the Near East, praying to the same god Baal; andanother, much older prehistoric civilisation referred to by scholars as ‘FirstZimbabwe’. Those from prehistory date back to over 50,000 years as shown byarchaeologist Peter Beaumont with his discovery of ancient mines in Swaziland,Southern Africa. But the Sumerian tablets tell us that these African mines dateback as far as 200,000 years. Too incredible to digest? There is now a visibleline connecting ancient mythology with more recent history, finding a naturalmeeting place. The issue of the ‘shrines and temples’ is crucial here. While the‘latter’ biblical civilisations in Ophir (Zimbabwe) were worshipping their gods,the ‘First Zimbabwean’ cultures had no need or knowledge about worshipping anygods. It was the original Anunnaki who created the mines with their new slavespecies as the first ever gold miners on Earth. They had no need for temples andworshiping, because that kind of ritual had only been introduced to Humankindaround 4,000 to 6,000 BC, some 190,000 years later. But then came the kings andmariners of the north around 2,500 BC and they built their dwellings as lessercopies of the original Anunnaki structures, and immediately plonked theirshrines for worshipping right next door. After all, they would not want to upsetthe ‘god of vengeance’ otherwise they would have been punished. There are manyother curious similarities like names of rivers and places that also add to theGreat Zimbabwe theory.Ancient navigational plans of Phoenician King Necho some 610 years BC, settingout from the Red Sea to the south eastern coast of Africa or Monomotapa, is justone indication that the land of Ophir was actually in this part of the world.But the support for these theories has been growing for decades and the evidenceseems to be irrefutable. There was really no other part of the world which couldhave provided King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba with so much gold during thosedays of history. While many of the ancient mines in Monomotapa may have beenfilled with soil and mud during the Great Flood, some have survived to tell thetale of prehistoric mining in the cradle of Humankind.Other suggestions for the site of King Solomon's mines are southern Turkey inthe Taurus Mountains, northwest Saudi Arabia and possibly the Eldorado of theHebrews. Nubia, in the Sudan, was a great source of gold for the Egyptians. Itjust so happens that ‘Nub’ as in Nubia, means gold in ancient Egyptian. Duringthe time of Queen Hatshepsut (1,503-1,482 BC) and later, the Egyptian navybrought great amounts of gold and stibnite from the areas in Punt to Egypt. Thetwo other sources of gold mentioned in the Old Testament were Uphaz (Jeremiah10:9 and Daniel 10:5) and Parvaim (II Chronicles 3:6). Where could those placeshave possibly been? So far historians have not been able to identify any of thereferences.While the talk of gold is ever-present in the Old Testament, references togeological sites of gold and silver are relatively rare. In the book of Job itstates: “Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where theyfind it.”(Job 28: 1)Who are the “they” he mentions? Why would they be so obsessed with gold?Southern India has long been known for its golden riches, where in ancient timesloads of gold was mined. In his Bibliotheca Historica of the 1st century BC,Diodorus Siculus wrote that in India “the earth contains rich underground veinsof many kinds, including many of silver and gold... ” Once again, it points toknowledge of ore mining and not just the commonly accepted alluvial methods.In China, gold was mined and utilised during the earliest of times, includingthe Shang civilisation (1,800-1,027 BC) of the Huang-Ho River. Gold mining wasprobably introduced into Korea around 1,122 BC by the followers of Ki-ja, whomigrated from China. From Korea, the various methods of mining for gold weretaken to Japan, probably as early as 660 BC (Bromehead, 1942).“Gold was known to the early Amerindians, but the metal was not held in highregard in the period… Later, during the first centuries of the Christian era,gold assumed much greater importance in the Olmec, Zapotec, Mayan, Aztec, andother civilisations of Mexico and Mesoamerica and in the Inca civilisation ofSouth America.”This is not true. The Andean and Mesoamerican cultures have been obsessed withgold for thousands of years, most of their oral and written legends refer togold which could go back as far as 12,000 BC. These civilisations continue totell us in their literature that the “gold belongs to the gods”. This would havemade gold very important in their everyday lives and it was also the reason whytheir civilisations emerged.“Gold was not prized by the Amerindians of Canada and the United States, and theaborigines of Australia seem not to have paid any attention to the preciousmetal.”Could this have been because the Anunnaki did not find large deposits of gold inthose areas to attract their attention? And therefore any human settlement forthe purposes of mining gold only took place much later? Or their obsession withgold only reached them much later, once it became a ‘human’ obsession, inheritedfrom the gods?The past few pages were just a tiny taste of the confusion that surrounds theorigins of gold on our planet. But the confusion and contradiction get muchworse. I therefore have no problem whatsoever in turning to other scientificrecords that may be regarded as inferior or esoteric by many scholars, andrather try to unravel the real truth behind the rich ancient mythology and oraltraditions of some cultures. Gold is a central feature in most, if not allancient mythology. And yet, as strange as it may seem, after studying over 600African mythological stories, I did not find one clear reference to gold. Theremay be some hidden imagery in some of them, but the general absence of gold inthese stories is truly puzzling. It leads me to formulate some new theories. IfAfrica was in fact the cradle of the very first humans; and if they were createdas a slaves to work in the gold mines; they would have been a truly “primitiveworker” as the Sumerian scripts call them. As a primitive species, and in thevery early days of human existence, they would have had no real feeling orunderstanding for what they were doing. As far as they saw it, they were givenfood and shelter while they performed some gruelling tasks, the reason for whichthey did not understand. It was a routine, year in, year out. The ‘stuff’ theywere digging up had absolutely no value to them. They could not eat it, or useit in any way. Only many thousands of years later, when the human mentalcapacity increased dramatically and when interbreeding happened between humansand the ‘godly’ offspring of the Nefilim, did the newly-spawned more intelligenthumans, begin to give the metal value. This would have only occurred oncecivilisation and Kingship was bestowed on humans by their ‘gods’ and only afterthe global system of trade and currency entered the picture. The strange metalcould have possibly developed some kind of strange sentimental value after theslaves began to set up their own settlements in Africa, and living away from themining compounds. But they had no real understanding of the use for the metal,and the only expression of their intellect was to adorn themselves with it inmany ways, to indicate their social standing and importance. Because just liketheir South American brethren, they always knew that the gold belonged to ‘thegods’.My assumption is that like many scientific theories, ridicule will often befollowed by respect. When we go through the Sumerian texts in later chapters,you will be amazed at how simply it can all be explained if we just put ourprejudice aside and keep our minds open to new realities.You see, the first signs of ore mining in Mesoamerica date back to around 12,000years ago, before the emergence of agriculture on Earth, and around the end ofthe last Ice Age. At this stage humans did not have it easy. They wereconstantly under threat from the elements and wild animals. They were concernedwith shelter and food while leading a predominantly nomadic lifestyle. How andwhy would gold seem so attractive to them?But the oldest signs of ore gold mining get even more interesting when you visitthe so-called Cradle of Humankind, just 20 minutes north of Johannesburg, SouthAfrica. While archaeologists were making amazing discoveries about the originsof humanity, they also stumbled onto previously unexplained phenomena regardinggold mining. They discovered layers upon layers of prehistoric mining activity,which was dated back to 7,690 BC by scholars from Yale and GroningenUniversities. This inspired the excavators to search a little further, only tobe rewarded with a find of an ancient mine near the famous landmark of the LionPark. They uncovered a five-ton hematite stone which was covering a largecavern. Carbon dating a piece of charcoal near the mouth shocked thearchaeologists when they found it to be from between 20,000 and 26,000 BC. Notbelieving what they had found, they searched further and exposed more miningaccess sites dating back to 41,000 BC, give or take 1,600 years. Adrian Boshierand Peter Beaumont then extended their search to southern Swaziland where theyfound ancient mines containing twigs, leaves, grass and feathers which were mostlikely brought in by the miners. There were also notched bones, which indicateman's ability to count at such distant times. Other remains at the site date itback to around 50,000 BC. This must be a total riddle for historians,evolutionists and creationists alike. How on Earth is this possible? How willthe supporters of the different doctrines explain this? This is where I wouldlike to step in and remind the readers of my theory that creation and evolutionshould be considered simultaneously. The convergence of the two seemsinevitable. While evolution is evident in most life forms around us, there ismounting evidence of a specific time when man was created. We will have to cometo terms with the reality that the two philosophies will have to share the stagein the Great Human Puzzle.We should not be surprised that prehistoric miners were already mining gold insouthern Africa several hundred thousand years ago. After all, the geologicallandscape would not have changed at all since then, and if gold is stillavailable in such abundance in this part of the world today, it must have beenavailable then. We must remember that until 1970, gold from South Africa made upover 75% of all global gold supplies. This clearly means that the early humansknew exactly where the gold was, or they were shown by someone more intelligentwhere to dig. So, we need to ask again… why would primitive man, immediatelyafter being created, start to mine gold so vigorously? It simply does not makeany sense.Somehow the hunger for gold grew gluttonously over the years. So much so thatships were dispatched from the Old World by kings and popes to bring back asmuch as was humanly possible of this shiny yellow metal. From the birth ofhumanity people have killed for gold and continue to do so to this day. I grewup in one of those mining communities myself. This hunger for gold probablyreached its most nauseating zenith during the blood-thirsty Spanish invasions ofthe New World. The abundance of gold found in the Mesoamericas by theConquistadores, together with the mythical stories of golden cities likeEldorado and Cibola, certainly raise the question: where did the so-calledprimitive natives find all that gold? Story has it that during the 200-yearactivities of the Conquistadores, the Spaniards looted more gold from theAmericas than has been mined in the entire known world since then. This couldobviously never be substantiated, but makes for some juicy imagery. But thehistory books tell us a predictably thin tale of the history and origins of goldin the world. What is known however, is that gold has always been and seeminglyalways will be the centre of great controversy, speculation and conspiracy.At the centre of the gold gluttony was the ever-present Vatican, which supportedthe exploits of the Conquistadores. The split was said to be 90% for the Vaticanand 10% for the Spanish king. The king in turn had a separate agreement with theConquistadores who undoubtedly had a free-for-all for themselves whenoverpowering the native Indian villages of the New World while looting theirgold. It is also said that the Vatican holds most of the gold in the world. Apopular conspiracy holds that the Vatican has not only attempted to, but largelysucceeded in, stealing all the USA gold reserves, with the aid of a successionof Jesuit US presidents. As far as conspiracies go, this one seems veryinteresting because it has some landmark presidential decisions to support it.The most famous is the decision by president Nixon on 15 August 1971, to divorcethe Dollar from the gold standard. Suddenly the dollar no longer had gold tounderpin its value and became just a piece of paper with a US government stampon it. The Jesuit Order has been a powerful force in the murky waters of secretsocieties, linking them back to the formation of the ‘Illuminati’ around 1,340AD in the central German state of Hess, and even further back to theestablishment of the Rosicrucian Lodge in 1,100 AD in the German city of Worms,also in the state of Hess. The Jesuit Order was established in 1540 by amilitant Christian-soldier-turned-cleric, called Ignatius of Loyola, as one ofseveral Counter-Reformation organisations launched by the Catholics to suppressthe rise of the Protestants. William Bramley has written a riveting book whichdeals extensively with most the secret societies in our human history linking usway back to the Garden of Eden and the so-called ‘Brotherhood of the Snake’. Itmakes captivating reading as it unravels many dark hidden secrets of our ancientpast, pointing convincingly to some form of intervention by more evolved andmore intelligent beings. But while they may have been more advanced, it does notmean they were not violent nor bloodthirsty. All these ugly characteristics arestill clearly evident in humans today, as visible scars from ancient times. Fromour behaviour and the manipulative control which was exercised over us by secretsocieties, we can deduce that the influence of these strange phenomena in manyways prevented humanity from evolving faster to discover the true secrets behindour origins. But at the same time, there seem to have been other secretsocieties that had always had some form of advanced knowledge and information,which may have had the opposite effect on human progress. I will resist thetemptation of getting too involved in this topic as Mr. Bramley has covered itsuperbly in The Gods of Eden.But gold continued to play a pivotal role in human evolution to the extent thatduring the California Gold Rush starting around the 1850s, Vatican monks wouldbasically use their cloth as a front to steal the gold from the native Indiansalong the Mexican and Californian coasts. There are reports of hard labour,slavery and torture of the natives, by Catholic monks in the name of god, and inpursuit of gold for the Vatican. Gold was probably the first metal known toHumankind and references to it have appeared almost from the birth of writing.Our entire human history is inextricably linked to the production of gold. If wetake at face value what the Sumerians have written in their tablets, we learnthat we were created as a slave species by the Anunnaki, with the sole purposeto work in the gold mines. The answer to the question, ‘why is mankind soobsessed with gold from the very beginning?’ is quite simple. Gold was the firstthing known to primitive man. He was surrounded by it and consumed by it. It wasthe principal reason why he was created. The truth is however, that it was notreally man who was so consumed by gold, but his masters and gods, the Anunnaki.When we explore this early obsession with gold, we begin to understand theoverpowering effect it must have had on early humans, how it shaped theirbehaviour in times to come, and how it drove their own vanity, greed and desireto be like their gods. Very quickly, this forbidden gold must have become themost desirable possession among the human slaves. They found ways to acquire itillegally, but gold was most likely also used to reward them from time to timefor acts of obedience. So as time passed, a growing amount of gold made its wayinto human hands. Not really knowing what to do with it, or what its truepurpose was, they started using their newly-acquired forbidden fruit inunconventional ways. They turned it into bracelets, necklaces, rings, ornaments,trinkets and an ever growing list of items of which the sole purpose was to showoff its owner's elevated status in the emerging community. They made imitationsof their gods' possessions, their chariots, their dwellings, their symbols andeven their image. Archaeologists have uncovered countless numbers of effigies ofmany ancient gods. The value of gold suddenly exploded when the Anunnaki allowedthe humans to leave the compounds of the mines and live on their own in growingcommunities.This period seems to coincide precisely with the sudden emergence ofcivilisation in the Near East around 7,000 BC. Many humans settled here whilecontinuing to work for their gods. The mines in the southern part of Africacontinued to produce gold, but the human workers had now developed manycommunities that have spread over large parts of the continent. Golden artefactsattained the highest status symbol on Earth, and humans started to decoratethemselves more and more with symbolic new jewellery. The more gold youpossessed, the higher your status in the community. But it also meant that youhad something to trade with or bargain with. This was exactly what thegenetically modified human genome was waiting for. A stimulus to activateseveral dormant genes, which would cause continuous havoc for thousands of yearsto come. The greed gene, the gluttony gene, the opulence gene and a few morebeauties hidden in our DNA, of which we are equally unaware at this stage. Andso began the eternal race for possession and control among primitive humans,which is stronger today than ever before. I have always been fascinated byprimitive tribes around the world and the importance they place on decorativeartefacts and shiny objects. I could never understand that there were so manysimilarities in their rituals and their gods while they are separated bythousands of miles, oceans and continents. But the common human ancestry withits magic, shiny ingredient seems to tie it all together. The many ritualsperformed by the forgotten tribes of the world still today, and the importancethey place on ornamental and decorative objects, can all be linked to the birthof man some 200,000 years ago and the role which gold played in his evolution.This obsession with gold was quickly adopted by Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age10,000 to 4,000 BC) and Neolithic (Near or Late Stone Age 4,000 BC) humans inthe Near East after the Great Flood some 13,000 years ago, while being helped bytheir gods to attain new knowledge of agriculture, architecture, communal livingand more. We have evidence of this rapidly emerging and refined artistic culturefrom Sumerian artefacts. This know-how was successfully copied and developed tostaggering proportions by the Egyptian royalty. Everyone in the world today isacutely aware of the great Egyptian achievements and the great wealth theyaccumulated. The amount of gold found in many of the Pharaohs’ burial chambersastounded archaeologists when it was first discovered. This was something thatthe tomb raiders of the past 200 years knew very well, as they plundered theseriches from the early days of post-diluvial humanity.But by this time, some gods had decided to help man out of bondage and empowerhim with knowledge for survival. This caused unprecedented tension among theAnunnaki gods which led to argument, conflict and bloody battles for control ofa rapidly dividing world. Various gods took refuge in distant corners of theworld like the Americas, China, Australia, India or wherever they could set up asecure base for themselves. Every step of the way, the dispersed Anunnaki hadtheir human slaves to perform the hard labour in the process of building newcivilisations around them. The gods controlled the humans with an iron fist,giving them strict instructions on most things, rewarding them when they felt itappropriate and punishing them severely if the human slaves disobeyed. This ispretty much the story of most popular religions from the beginning of time,especially the Old Testament. We examine the so-called ‘wrath of god’ in otherchapters, which show us the distinct humanlike needs displayed by the ancientgods. This globalisation by the gods explains why the same strict dictator-likebehaviour was witnessed all around the world by virtually all the communities ofearly humans.While the Egyptian artistry and creation of spectacular golden artefacts wereunprecedented on Earth, the cradle of goldsmiths was in fact the Sumeriancivilisation starting as far back as 5,000 BC, according to the latest digs inIraq and Syria. Nestled between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, they set mostof the trends for global generations to follow. They traded their wheat andbarley, upstream and downstream for other goods, including gold. The Greekslater called this Mesopotamia, the ‘Land Between the Rivers’. Here the Sumeriansappeared and flourished until around 2000 BC in cities like Uruk, Larsa, Ummaand Ur. These cities had a network of well-planned streets and well-organisedsocieties. They pioneered cuneiform writing on clay tablets the size of apostcard, and wrote poetry. Their craftsmanship with wood, stone, ivory,semi-precious stones and especially gold, was astonishing. Many of these are tobe admired at the British Museum in London, the University Museum inPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania and nearer to its origins, at the Baghdad Museum inIraq, which was unfortunately decimated by looters during the George W. Bushattacks. Gold cups, helmets, bracelets, garlands and chains of delicateworkmanship, reveal an exceptional understanding of how to exploit gold's uniqueproperties of malleability, ductility and resilience. Jewellery historian GuidoGregorietti observed of the Sumerian times that, “In fact, there were moredifferent types of jewellery than there are today.”But did the Sumerians really write the opening chapter in the history of gold,or was it happening simultaneously in other parts of the world? They may havebeen the pioneers in golden jewellery production, but gold was being mined allover the world under the supervision of rebellious gods with the knowledge ofmining and the desire to claim a piece of this planet for themselves.You see, Sumer itself did not have gold, so it had to import it from somewhere.This was probably a great opportunity for the new custodian gods scatteredaround the world to bring their golden spoils to Sumer, establishing trade linkswhile keeping their human slaves back home working, fearful and obedient.Jewellery expert Graham Hughes says, “Sumerian work is flavoured with amazingsophistication, delicacy of touch, fluency of line, a general elegance ofconception, all suggest that the goldsmiths’ craft emerged almost fully fledgedin early Mesopotamia.” How is that possible? That primitive humans emerged outof the Stone Age, set up well-structured communities, and immediately showedgreat knowledge of manufacturing some of the most refined golden jewellery weknow today? Sumerian treasures reveal how well the goldsmiths understood workingwith gold. They used different alloys, and cast gold in solid or hollowornaments. They chased veins on leaves or grooves on beads using the lost-waxtechnique. Jugs or cups could be beaten into shape from a flat sheet of gold,using sophisticated heat treatment. They even beat gold into thin foil orribbon. This kind of sudden knowledge and sophistication clearly points to someform of intelligent intervention, which could only have come from their Anunnakimasters and gods.So now we know that the origin of humanity is somehow directly linked to theproduction of gold on Earth. That the human slaves were aided towardscivilisation by their gods and makers, who accidentally created the gold tradeon Earth by dispersing and forcing their own group of human slaves to mine theprecious metal. While there was gold mining activity and jewellery-making goingon in many centres of the world, Sumer was the main concentration of Anunnakigods on Earth, and therefore it became the fastest growing centre ofcivilisation, setting the standard for an accidental industry which consumesmost of the gold in the world today. This is the incredible story of thejewellery industry, which was an accidental by-product of a slave species and agroup of occupying astronaut gods. The East consumes over 75% of the annualglobal production of gold in the 21st century AD. In 2002 this amounted to2,726.7 metric tons.We must take a step back to avoid being blinded by all this incredible stuff.After all, we have come a long way in 11,000 years. We have evolved mentally andphysically. If we have much of the Anunnaki DNA in our cells, we need to askourselves, how advanced were they really? My theory is, that they were not asadvanced as I may have originally thought. I say this because the behaviour theydisplayed from the very first day on this planet, bears the symptoms of aspecies that falls way short of a complete genome. We have inherited many oftheir characteristics. I just pray that we lose the primitive desire to coverourselves with shiny metal as we evolve towards more intelligent beings. Afterall, it was all a big accident.But to protect themselves against possible competition from a new species onEarth, the Anunnaki gods ensured that the genome of the slave species wasseverely stunted. They ensured that the new human species did not live too long,was prone to disease, did not use much of its brain and had a finite memory. Butthe one thing they did not count on was the evolution of our genome and ourintelligence. Maybe they did not consider the evolutionary aspects, because theytruly did not expect to stay on this planet for so long."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10 [../Text/toc.html#chapter10]INSTANT CIVILISATION AND SUMER [../Text/toc.html#chapter10a]The word ‘civilisation’ is possibly one of the most misused words in all thelanguages of the world. We constantly refer to issues surrounding the‘civilised’ world and compare quality of life between the developed West and theemerging economies. There is constant reference to the ‘First World’ and the‘Third World’, I would like to know what happened to the clearly absent ‘SecondWorld’? Or has the civilised world decided that the gap between their superiorlifestyle and the rest of the poor bastards is so huge, that there is no casefor a ‘Second World’ culture? Although the word ‘civilisation’ does not carry anexclusive component of distinction based on financial stability or wealth of itscitizens, it certainly seems to be coined as an indicator of such criteria. Themedia talk about ancient civilisations with a mysterious tone which wouldsuggest that they were not really that civilised, but we just don’t understandhow those ‘low-lifes’ all those years ago could manage to build such impressivemonuments. Even historians, anthropologists and archaeologists are guilty ofwaxing lyrically about the great civilisations of the past, and yet they treattheir scriptures and texts with an uncanny lack of respect loaded with heaps ofscepticism. It's as if the ancients had some obscure reason to captureinformation aimed at misleading us poor 21st centurions. Our attitude is riddledwith immense disbelief, as if there was an ancient plot aimed at feeding us withdisinformation; ‘us’ greatly ‘advanced’ humans in the modern days of technology.By doing this, scholars inject a comparative system of levels of civilisation,placing us at the pinnacle of all time civilisations for obvious reasons tothem. Ancient knowledge and so-called civilisation is immediately andautomatically superseded by us, because we live in more recent times. We have tobe more civilised because we have technology, we have mass media, we live in afree world where all truth must eventually surface because we are too smart tobe fooled by false prophets. Is that a fact? I suggest we take a long hard lookat how manipulated and controlled we actually are. If civilisation was to bepenalised by some scale, based on human ignorance per capita, we would be themost penalised bunch of humans of all times. We have looked extensively at thepossible origins of humanity, yet we still do not know, we do not even suspect,where we come from. There is overwhelming evidence that the ancient Sumeriansknew exactly who they were, where they came from and who their ‘real god’ was.The god of the Sumerians, who had absolute controlling power and ruled the wholeworld. The god with a small ‘g’ and his extended family, who were turned into agroup of fairytale mythological characters by latter civilisations. But thatearly knowledge has somehow escaped us, just like the extensive knowledge of thecosmos. Is it possible that for the same reasons we misplaced our knowledge ofastronomy, and our ability to relate to our ancestry?Today, the majority of the world is so brainwashed with religion that anybreakthrough in knowledge of our shocking past is immediately relegated to therealms of the esoteric or mythological or evil or cult or heresy. We are socontrolled by the media and advertising that we base our decisions on the moodsof soap opera characters. If we get wiped out by a giant tsunami 200 metreshigh, when they uncover the dregs of our civilisation some 20,000 years fromnow, will they think that the ‘soapie’ scripts and characters were actual eventsand real people? Hey, anything is possible.If we unravel the true meaning of civilisation, we will possibly see that thepopulation of the 21st century is far from meeting the criteria. It is quitediscernable that there is a global split between ‘thinkers’ and ‘followers’. Bythis I do not mean that if you have a 9 to 5 job you are a follower, but it’srather a more direct stab at the mechanisms of fear that are successfullyimplemented at controlling large groups of people. Whether these are ofpolitical, religious or of any other origin. The 2004 USA elections are aperfect example. The majority of Americans voted for George W. Bush because ofthis fear factor. They were so cleverly manipulated by the media, that theytruly believed their candidate would protect them against the onslaught of the‘evil’ world. To the rest of the world it was very obvious as to what was goingon in the USA, but the average American truly believes that the world wants toinvade them, either by coming to live there and taking their jobs away or byspreading terror. And the USA is apparently the most advanced economy in theworld, therefore the most civilised? I don’t think so. Therein lies the proof.Just because we are more technologically advanced, does not give us thecollective capacity to reason, think or solve problems any better than ourancestors did 6,000 years ago. In fact, Greece is probably best known for itsgreat thinkers, like Socrates, Aristotle and Plato. These philosophers arequoted now more than ever before and their influence has seeped into countlesscrevices of our societies. Just like dead artists who carry a strange mystiquethat propels the price of their work to dazzling heights, the dead philosophersfrom ancient times are more revered now than during their own time.I will bet that if you placed Plato in a live performance situation to simplytalk about his thoughts on life and death, he would fill every football stadiumon his world tour. We seem to accept their wisdom and written works, but we willnot accept the written works of other ancient teachers, just because we don'tknow who they were. That is so very shallow of us, that I feel embarrassed bysuch behaviour. But as popular as those ancient wise men were, they were notseen as the prophets of their day, even though they carried such a great deal ofrespect. Why could that possibly be? The answer is clearly displayed in thechapter dealing with Jesus and other prophets. We will discover in laterchapters that so-called prophets whom we have come to worship were cunninglycontrived and planted by the ‘gods’ of the day, while the ‘thinkers’ did notfall into that category. The thinkers did not fit the profile of religiousleaders who would attract pilgrims in need of spiritual shelter. The thinkerswere too independent to be manipulated in such ways, it seems, at times causinggreat trouble between the newly created slave species and their gods.So what does the word civilisation actually mean? The dictionary describes it as“an advanced stage of human development, marked by a high level of art,religion, science, social and political organisation.” And yet the word ‘civil’means “belonging to, or consisting of the ordinary population of citizens; notmilitary or religious.” Immediately we see a distinct conflict here, sincereligion is one of the criteria that marks the levels of ‘civilisation’, yet itis explicitly excluded from being ‘civil’.Political assassinations are as common in modern days as they were in ancienttimes. And because war is declared by a political leader of a country, it meansthat a president or a king can never be civil, or civilised. The point is, thetrue meaning of the word is extremely obscure and it is used as and whennecessary by individuals who want to create a distinction between themselves andothers generally proclaimed to be less civilised. But if we take the dissectiona little further and actually try to determine our current levels ofcivilisation from the definition, we reach a rather interesting outcome. ‘Highlevels of art’ – we can say that current artistic levels are pretty high aroundthe world. Our writers, film makers, theatres and painters are creating morethan ever before, so we score high marks there. Science – this is a tough areato judge, since there is physical evidence that humans many thousands of yearsago knew more about science, medicine and astronomy than we know today. At everyarchaeological dig in Mesopotamia, there are almost always clay tablets found,some dating as far back as 3,800 BC, outlining the achievements of the ancientSumerian civilisations. They describe the cosmos, planets, medical schools andmedical procedure, surgery, eye surgery, genetic engineering, space craft, spacetravel and much more. Historians have however found these claims to beunbelievable and so they have become part of mythology rather than history.Remember that the father of modern anatomy, Leonardo da Vinci, was risking hislife as recently as 500 years ago by dissecting corpses in the middle of thenight so he could draw images of the internal organs. This was a time when thechurch had complete control over people's lives, killing and destroying anythingthat was not in keeping with their image of religious behaviour. Unfortunately,we have inherited much of this behaviour and we are practising it ‘religiously’today. So, on the scale of scientific advancement, we cannot say that we havesurpassed the knowledge of the distant civilisations. On the religious front weare less aware of the human reality than the ancient people were, mainly for thereasons that we have reduced their reality to the realms of mythology. If the‘religious’ reference as a measure of civilisation is based on religioustolerance, then we certainly are far less civilised today than our distantancestors. The last 1,000 years have seen the most brutal religious conflicts inall of human history. My conclusion is that until we start to treat the ancienttexts and tablets with the kind of respect they deserve, we will remain trappedin the cycle of ignorance that will keep a strangle-hold on our currentcivilisation. How can we claim to have any levels of real intelligence if westill do not know with certainty where we come from? What kind of civilisedspecies are we if we have no clear link to our origins? How can we expect tofind unity and harmony among the cultures of the world when all our theories aredriven by scattered groups of disparate religions, each one claiming to be thecorrect one?The fact remains that our ancient past is filled with incredible achievements bymany civilisations, which left behind traces and clues of their rise and fall.Many of these civilisations write [../Images/136-1.jpg]about the ‘prior times’or the ‘times before time’ or the ‘earlier times’, when they refer to where theyhad received their knowledge from. In times when global communication wasnon-existent, these groups of highly capable people settled in the distantreaches of the world and began to develop highly structured cities with colossalmonuments and pyramids. From the more recent Japanese, Chinese and Thai ruins,to the more romanticised Egypt, Near East, Mesoamerica and the Andeancivilisations in South America. To truly demonstrate our modern arrogance andgreed, all we have to do is look at how Columbus and Cortes responded to theancient cities and their people when they first invaded the New World in the15th and 16th century. They were so obsessed with looting gold and otherartefacts, that they didn't really give the incredible achievements that staredthem in the face much thought. The ‘greed’ gene was hard at work, drivenrelentlessly by the ‘conquering’ gene in those Conquistadores. How is itpossible that those civilisations could have appeared out of the blue, more orless at the same time in history, displaying the kind of advanced knowledge ofthe cosmos and architecture, without even knowing about each other? There aremany more examples of such inexplicable ancient activity that are stillsurrounded by wild speculation today. Easter Island, Stonehenge and the GreatZimbabwe Ruins are just a few. But let's take a short trip through some of theseancient sites to see how they all seem to be related to each other. Let us tryto answer the recurring question, who could have possibly been responsible forsuch a connection in those ancient times? The ever-present Anunnaki gods ofcourse! As we work our way through this book we will uncover that the ancientmythological gods in all of human civilisation were not figments of the people'simagination. We will also discover that they were not weird and supernaturalmanifestations of the spiritual world; or any other hard-to-explain beings fromthe fourth dimension. They were in fact a group of early explorers and settlerson this planet under the leadership of Anu, their supreme commander and hencetheir name, the Anunnaki. They are the ancient astronauts who the Sumeriantablets speak about in great detail and we will show beyond any doubt that theAnunnaki ruled the world for over 400,000 years, performing the roles of gods asthey nurtured their primitive creation, the ‘human slave species’ into a stateof civilisation. It was one of the members of the full extended Anunnaki familywho was in charge of the various activities on their newly settled planet, whichwould have also included the Great Zimbabwe settlement. The full story of theAnunnaki astronauts from Nibiru is told in great detail as it is written in manyhundreds of clay tablets. It is not very difficult to see that it was they whocrossed the skies in their ‘chariots’ and were equally worshipped, while to acertain extent also feared, among all the ancient civilisations on Earth. So donot panic, you will be enlightened with the full story.[../Images/137-1.jpg] [../Images/137-2.jpg] ROSETTA STONE Details from theRosetta Stone showing 3 different scripts in 2 languages - Egyptian and GreekThe archaeologists of some 200 years ago were shocked when they first started toscratch around in Egypt. Everyone believed that Greece was the place that gavethe world the concept of civilisation. Napoleon had heard a great deal aboutthese impressive ruins and pyramids, so when he arrived in Egypt in 1799 withhis army and an entourage of scholars, one of his objectives was to help unravelthe secrets of the pyramids. He clearly did not achieve that, but what they didfind in Rosetta, was a stone slab which became known as the Rosetta Stone, andwhich has become one of the most important archaeological finds ever. Itmeasures 114 x 72 x 28 centimetres. For those in the USA this translates to 3ft9 inches long, and 2ft. 4,5 inches wide. The stone had three inscriptions. TheEgyptian hieroglyphic text was accompanied by a Greek translation which wasunderstood by scholars, and a third inscription on the stone was written inDemotic, a cursive script developed late in Egyptian history, used almostexclusively for secular documents. Thus the stone displayed the same text inthree scripts, but only two languages, Egyptian and Greek. It was quicklydiscovered that all three contained the same message. And because the Greekcould be translated immediately, it provided real clues for the very first timeto the unravelling of Egyptian hieroglyphs.To a large extent this propelled the dissection and translation of thehieroglyphic texts, only to astound the scholars with the news that the Egyptianroyal dynasties stretched back to around 3200 BC. This was another typicalexample of our lowly-civilised state in the so-called modern days, as it sentshockwaves through the archaeological worlds. Very soon they discovered that theHellenic alphabet, which influenced the Latin and our own alphabets, actuallyemerged somewhere in the Near East. The Greeks admitted that a Phoenician calledKadmus, originally brought the alphabet from the East. It had the same number ofletters and the same order as in ancient Hebrew, but by the 5th century BC thepoet Simonides of Ceos increased the number of letters to 26. Alexander theGreat may have been a relentless warrior but he also collected much informationabout the Persian empires which he defeated in 331 BC. His advisers concludedthat they must have originated from the Aryan people or ‘lordly people’.According to his knowledge the mysterious ‘lordly people’ appeared in thedistant past near the Caspian Sea and spread East all the way to India andfurther south to “the lands of the Medes and Parsees”, as those lands werecalled in the pages of the Old Testament.Cyrus the Great was an Aryan king and the founder of the Persian Empire whoconquered almost all of the known world some 200 years before Alexander. Thestrange thing is that by the time Alexander rose to power, the Aryans hadsettled and controlled all of Europe and were the descendants of the same Aryanancestors as the Persians. So what started happening at this time was thatAryans were fighting Aryans without actually realising it.The newly emerging finds and clay tablets from the Near East caught the interestof archaeologists, but it was only in 1843 when Paul Emile Botta started thefirst professionally planned excavation in Mesopotamia. The land which is modernday Iraq, between and surrounding the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, was producingremarkable treasures, many bearing illegible cuneiform texts, which was thestyle of writing used by the Sumerians. The name cuneiform was first coined in1686 by Engelbert Kampfer, who mistook the texts he saw in Persia to bedecorative patterns and described them as “cuneates”, which roughly means‘wedge-shaped impressions’. But as the wave of treasure seekers andarchaeologists poured into this part of the world to excavate Assyria andBabylonia, thousands of cuneiform clay tablets were found among the many moundsscattered throughout the region. There were even actual libraries of tabletsfound, neatly bound together. One word was translated from the cuneiform to be‘Dur Sharu Kin’ which meant ‘walled city of the righteous king’ whom we callSargon II of Assyria. But that was not all they unearthed. There were statues,bas-reliefs which would stretch for longer than a mile if displayed; palaces,temples, houses, stables, towers, warehouses, columns, gates, walls, terraces,gardens, decorations of a wide variety and more mind-boggling evidence of a welldeveloped civilisation. But the centre-piece of the city was the 7-step zigguratpyramid referred to as ‘the stairway to heaven’ for the gods. All of this tookonly five years to build some 3,000 years ago. This is a demonstration of realachievement. Today, we cannot put a time-frame to construction on such a scale.One other crucial bit of information they acquired was that the common languageof Assyria and Babylonia was Akkadian. This was truly fascinating, but theirsurprise did not stop there. There were post-scripts on many tablets, statingthat they were copied from earlier originals. Who could have written suchoriginals? And where are those originals now?What is also interesting are the chief deities of the two cultures. Assyrianshad ‘Ashur’ the ‘all-seeing’ as their chief deity. Babylonia had ‘Marduk – theson of the pure mound’ as their chief deity. But the pantheons of the two godswere the same, reconfirming our earlier suggestions that the gods of pre­historywere active over a wide area of the world. According to the Akkadian tablets,the kingdom of Akkad was started by Sharrukin, the “righteous ruler” who claimedthat it was Enlil who pointed out the land to him and allowed him to govern it.We will discover that Sharrukin was not the only king who made such a statement,there is written evidence of many more kings who attested to the same. It wasalways some god who actually appointed them as the king of a specific land andallowed them to govern the people while receiving messages from his god. This isa very clear link to our pantheon of gods who ruled the world. Not only did theycreate the ‘slave species’ worker to toil in the gold mines, but the evidencebegins to pile up that they introduced all aspects of civilisation to theirhuman offspring sometime between 9,000 BC and 3,000 BC all over the world, whichincluded kingship.Suddenly we take a leap of 2,000 years back in time from Sargon of Assyria 3,000years ago, to Sargon of Akkad 5,000 years ago. Akkadian was the first knownSemitic language, before Hebrew, Aramaic (which was the language of Jesus),Phoenician, and Canaanite. And this Akkadian language was derived from anearlier one, which they refer to in their post-scripts. But the most relevantinformation which was obtained from these Akkadian tablets was a text dealingwith the names, genealogies, deeds, powers and duties of the gods. In Genesisthere is a wonderful reminder for some doubtful historians, about the actualexistence of a place called Akkad which was indeed started by Sargon, who claimsin the tablets that “at the wharf of Akkad, he made moor ships” from lands farand wide.Genesis:“And the beginning of his kingdom: Babel and Erech and Akkad, all in the land ofShin'ar.”The excavations in Akkad delivered remarkable finds. The most precious was thelibrary of king Ashurbanipal at Nineveh, where they uncovered 25,000 tablets ofAkkadian texts, many of which were once again described to be copies of “oldentexts”. Based on the syllabic style of the Akkadian language, the scholarsbelieved that it must have originated from an earlier written language, similarto the Egyptian hieroglyphs. Their suspicions were rewarded when one of thetablets from Ashurbanipal ended with the following statement: “23rd tablet:language of Shumer not changed.” But as outlined by Zecharia Sitchin, it was afurther text by King Ashurbanipal himself that really crowned the booty. This iswhat it says:“The god of scribes has bestowed on me the gift of the knowledge of his art. Ihave been initiated into the secrets of writing. I can even read the intricatetablets in Shumarian; I understand the enigmatic words in the stone carvingsfrom the days before the Flood.”[../Images/140-1.jpg]A MAP OF MESOPOTAMIASome of these tablets date back to the origin of the Akkadian empire around 2350BC and truly challenged the knowledge of historians of their time and continueto challenge most of humanity today. Was it a bunch of ‘nonsensical’ garbagefrom days gone by, or was it a true historic entry reflecting a real historicalevent? We need to make these choices once more. The choice that will irrevocablyalter the way we perceive our human ancestry and our human origins. It wasFrenchman Jules Oppert, who suggested in 1869, that because the Mesopotamiansproclaimed their legitimacy by taking the title ‘King of Sumer and Akkad’ thatwe should call the ancient peoples ‘Sumerians’ and their land should be called‘Sumer’. And so his suggestions were adopted. Little did he know that the oldbiblical name for Sumer was Shinar, as it states in Genesis that “the royalcities of Babylon, Akkad and Erech were in the land of ‘Shinar’ (Shumer).”Suddenly the references on the Akkadian texts made sense. Among the many tabletsthey found, were long lists of words which made no sense to anybody for longperiods. But when the link between Akkadian and Sumerian was made, scholarsrealised that the strange ‘wordy’ tablets were actually ancient dictionaries ofSumerian-Akkadian words, which gave them a glimpse at the first written languageon Earth. This played a major part in speeding up the translations andunderstanding of many ancient tablets, but it did not necessarily open the mindsof the translators. Over and over again, historians, anthropologists and otherscholars would restrict the Sumerian tales to the subject of mythology. Afterall, we know it is impossible that there were all these different ‘gods’ flyingaround the world all those years ago!!! We know there is only one ‘god’… the godof the Bible, or Koran or Kabala, or Hindus, or Buddhists, or Bahai, or so manyothers. In essence we are not any different to the people of ancient times. Eventoday, different groups of people pray to a different god. We seem to be quiteokay with this situation even in the 21st century. We all have our own faith andwe all steadfastly believe that our god is the real god. If we accept it today,why can we not accept that it was so in the distant past as well? The onlydifference was, that the ‘gods’ of the past had constant contact with humans, asit states in the Bible, Koran or Sumerian scriptures. Those gods wereomnipresent, making their appearance in a flash, either in person or sending‘angels’ in their place.It took 56 years of excavation to unearth the ancient city of Lagash in Sumer.They began in 1877 and had not finished by 1933. But the effort produced anunprecedented amount of archaeological material. We learnt from the efforts ofscholars and from very neatly preserved records at this site, that the city had“righteous rulers” who were called ‘EN.SI’ and that over a period of 650 yearsthere were 43 EN.SIs who ruled Lagash. We also learnt from the records that anyEN.SI could only assume the throne with the approval of the gods. Were thesemerely in their minds? And if so, how could the rest of the population allow theking to assume the throne if the gods were not visible or audible to theordinary man? Surely the people of the time would not have stood for it unlessthey were convinced that the new EN.SI was really appointed by god. A depictionof Ur-Nammu, the ruler of Ur, was unearthed, in which he is depicted beingordered to build a temple for his god according to strict instructions. Butother biblical heroes like Moses, Solomon and Ezekiel also built buildings fortheir gods after being instructed. Solomon received ‘wisdom’ from god afterwhich he built the temple in Jerusalem. Ezekiel saw a godly vision of a personwho had a bronze appearance who held a measuring rod; and Moses built a‘residence’ in the desert for his lord after getting specific instructions onhow to build it. So what is the difference between the ancient kings receivinginstructions from their so-called mythological gods, and our popular biblicalcharacters receiving similar instructions from ‘our’ one and only biblical god?Nothing, I say. The evidence is overwhelming to suggest that it was the same godor gods, dealing with different people at different times. But one of the mostimpressive constructions took place some 1200 years before Moses. King Gudearecorded his instructions in a long detailed inscription. It talks about a “manthat shone like the heaven” and he “commanded me to build his temple” and “fromthe crown on his head he was obviously a god”. The god held some kind of stonein his hand “the plan of a temple it contained”. The plan was so complex that hesought the advice of a goddess who pointed out all the ‘right’ people or deitieswho could help him. He then recruited 216,000 people to complete the job. Anundertaking on such a scale is unthinkable in the 21st century. But the abilityto coordinate, control, house and feed such a large number of builders,indicates that the ancient Sumerian civilisation was well advanced as far backas 3,000 BC.But the real achievements of the Sumerians only became evident as the tabletswere transcribed and understood. It is now evident that Sumer was the origin ofall culture and civilisation on Earth, giving us all the foundations of what weknow today. The staggering thing is that the knowledge of the Sumerians has beenlost in translation or lost in antiquity, because some of the activities theymake reference to find us at a loss, completely overwhelming the translators.Ancient Sumer had thousands of scribes who worked relentlessly at capturing mostof their daily activities. There were all kinds of scribes in temples, courtsand in trading houses. Junior scribes, high scribes and royal scribes, capturingeverything in clay. There is so much information captured about their lives andactivities that it leaves us with a very clear picture of how organised theywere. The records are not really of a spiritual nature but instead theyinadvertently indicate how controlled they were by their demanding gods, whoneeded to be pleased on an ongoing basis. They also speak of measuring fields,calculating prices and recording harvests of crops.[../Images/143-1.jpg]SUMERIAN KING LISTProbably the most important document ever discovered by modern humans. It listssome 149 kings and rulers on planet Earth, starting with ten rulers before theflood which spanned some 240,000 years. It goes on to name rulers of manydynasties and outlines when “kingdom” was lowered to Earth from Heaven by theAnunnaki, or the biblical Nephilim. The list also outlines the coming to Earthof the Igigi or biblical Anakim from their space colony. We also read that itwas Ninurta, the biblical YAHWEH, who destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.Here is a quick overview of the Sumerian ‘firsts’. Besides their architecturaland engineering feats, they invented:• Writing - which included the precursor to the printing press. With theircylinder seals engraved in hard stone, which could be rolled in clay leaving aclear imprint; they could supply educational materials to teachers and schools.• Schools - which were headed by ‘ummia’ – ‘the expert professor’. • There isevidence of corporal punishment at schools for being absent, lack of tidiness,loitering, making a noise, misbehaving and even having untidy handwriting. •They wrote pharmacopoeia and captured literary debates in clay. • Theyintroduced the first bicameral congress; library catalogues; codes of law;teaching methods and curricula; health and even exercise. • Sumerian textilesand apparel were so sought-after that invading armies would fight over thespoils of clothing as it is mentioned in the book of Joshua 7:21 that someonecould not resist ‘one good coat of Shinar’, although such looting was punishableby death. 3,800 years BC they had advanced weaving technology which alsoresulted in the ‘TUG’ later known as the Roman Toga. The Sumerians referred toit as the ‘TOG.TU.SHE’ or ‘the garment which is worn wrapped around’. • Fashion,hairstyles and jewellery all originate from here. • They gave us the firstmathematical system with the ability to do complex mathematical calculationswhich were based on the ‘sexagesimal’ system where 10 is combined with a‘celestial’ 6 = 60. • The 360 degrees in a circle; advanced astronomy; thecalendar; the 7-day week; kilns; bricks; high-rise buildings like pyramids andziggurats; ceramics and even art and sculpture were all first created in Sumer.• Furthermore there was metallurgy and the moulding of soft metals like gold,silver and copper. • The creation of bronze by smelting copper with tin. • Theywere the first to develop an exquisite range of decorative jewellery. • Theyeven introduced the first money in the form of the silver Shekel, therebyconverting thousands of years of what must have been a strictly socialisticsociety without any use for money, into the first capitalist economy. • Theirextensive knowledge of agriculture was astounding. The planting and harvestingof cereals; the manufacture of flour for different kinds of breads, pastries,biscuits, cakes and porridges.The Sumerian cuisine was well-refined and they certainly got a lot of practicepreparing lavishly extensive menus for their gods who had a great appetite. Yes!The gods would actually demand different types of food to be prepared and placedin their temples as offerings. This would include wine from grapes and palmdates, milk yoghurts, butter, cream and cheeses. The gods of the city of Urukdemanded five different beverages and foods as a daily sacrifice. The Sumerianseven wrote poems about food.Decimal Sumerian (Sexagesimal) “In the wine of drinking 1 1 In the scented water10 10 In the oil of unction 10 X 10 10 X 6 This bird have I cooked (10 X 10) 10(10 X 6) 10 and have eaten.” (10 X 10 X 10) 10 (10 X 6 X 10) 6SEXAGESIMAL COUNTING SYSTEMThe large library of King Ashurbanipal at Nineveh gave us a good insight intotheir world of medical practice as they outline areas like therapy, surgery andcommands and incantations. It also covers subjects like fees charged by surgeonsand penalties that had to be paid if they messed up. The surgeon would lose ahand if he damaged the patient's eye during a temple procedure with a lancet.There is reference to ‘water physicians’ and ‘oil physicians’ or ‘A.ZU’ and‘IA.ZU’ as referred to by Zecharia Sitchin. They even refer to possible cataractremoval and bone scraping. A 5,000-year-old tablet found in Ur refers to a ‘Luluthe doctor’ and there were even vets who were known as doctors of ‘oxen andasses’. All these texts make it very clear that these people practiced medicineand not any form of sorcery. On the social front they also introduced alcoholwhich is evident from the Arabic and Akkadian roots of ‘kohl’ and ‘kuhlu’. Thiswas obviously also used in medical applications and some instructions were givento use wine, beer or honey as solvents when taking powders by mouth. And wheredo you think the Romans got their knowledge of bitumen, asphalts and petroleumfrom, which they used so successfully in building and warfare? From theSumerians of course. The reference to the discovery of the ancient city of Ur,claims that it was found under a “mound of bitumen”. And the origin of the word‘naphta’ comes from the word ‘napatu’ which can be translated as ‘stones thatflare up’. One of the cornerstones of civilisation and development, the wheel,was also first used by the Sumerians. Not to be outdone by those on land, theship-makers had their own dictionary which outlines 105 types of ships by size,function and destination, and which also includes 69 Sumerian terms for theconstruction of ships. There were 3 primary types of ships. Cargo, passenger,and those exclusively used by the gods.I trust that by now you must be thinking, that maybe there was a lot more to theinteraction between the so-called gods and our ancient ancestor. But this isonly the beginning. The evidence keeps piling up higher and higher as we workthrough the clay tablets linking them to the many activities and events of ourdistant past. We learn that the Anunnaki gods were our original advancedancestors who came to Earth with a very specific purpose – gold! From theirarrival on Earth in search of gold some 443,000 years ago; to the creation ofthe ‘Adamu’ as a ‘lulu amelu’ or primitive worker; to the creation of ‘Eve’shortly after that; to the graphic descriptions of the hard work in the goldmines of southern Africa; to the flood; and the subsequent civilisation that wasbestowed on the ‘slave species’ to help feed the flood survivors, while pushingever harder to extract enough gold to save their planet Nibiru's atmosphere.What a mouthful… but what a ride. You are going to be amazed to see how easilyall the pieces of the puzzle fit together and you will question why it has takenso long for the truth to start filtering through. The answers are all writtendown for us to absorb, but you will discover how our creators and ruling godshave carefully manipulated Humankind into a subservient species, fearful oftheir god with a small ‘g’.Back to the digs in Mesopotamia now: what was really impressive, was theSumerians’ sense of the law. For long periods it was thought that the AkkadianKing Hammurabi set out the first code of laws in history, the Code of Hammurabi.The excavations in Mesopotamia found otherwise. Long before Hammurabi, who issaid to have ruled around 1,792 -1,750 BC, there were several kings or rulerswho were all instructed by their ‘god’ to write down and institute various codesof law. One such ruler was from the city of Eshnunna. Some of the laws he wasinstructed to lay down dealt with the price of food, rental of wagons and boats,property laws, family matters, slave issues, and rights for the poor. But beforehim, and acting under strict instructions from the great gods to “bringwell-being to the Sumerians and Akkadians”, was the code of Lipit-Ishtar, rulerof Isin. But unfortunately only 38 of his laws have been recovered on tablets.Around 500 years before Hammurabi circa 2350 BC, lived Urnammu who was the rulerof Ur. He was instructed by the god ‘Nannar’ to lay down a code of law to dealwith thieves. They are described as “grabbers of the citizens’ oxen, sheep anddonkeys”. The laws also included topics dealing with social behaviour. “Orphansshall not fall prey to the wealthy”; “widows shall not fall prey to thepowerful” and “the man of one shekel shall not fall prey to the man of 60shekels”. As if this was not impressive enough, a further 250 years before thisand almost 1,000 years before Hammurabi, there was the EN.SI called Urukaginawho was forced to introduce “necessary” reforms around 2,600 BC. He wasinstructed by his god ‘Ningirsu’ to “restore the decrees of former days”. Theone question that immediately springs to mind is, that if these reforms were sonecessary, their civilisation must have been around for quite some time before.Scholars call this find a “precious record of man's first social reforms basedon a sense of freedom, equality and justice”. I am not sure about that statementbecause we now know that there were more sinister forces at play during theemergence of human civilisation. I feel conflicted about the motives of bothEnlil and Enki in such activities although they certainly both had theirrespective motives.[../Images/146-1.jpg] [../Images/146-2.jpg] CODE OF HAMMURABI CODE OF UR-NAMMUEnki and Enlil were half-brothers and sons of Anu, the supreme commander of theplanet Nibiru. Enki was the first to arrive on Earth 445,000 years ago in searchof gold, and to set up a base before more Anunnaki would arrive to extract theprecious metal. But the two had completely diverse personalities. Enki was thehumanist and creative scientist, with the heart of a poet, while Enlil was thepolitician with a passion for control. He was on a mission to control humanitythrough religious violence, fear and oppression, as he was never in favour ofcreating this ‘new slave species’ – while Enki was the actual scientist whoplanned and created the human species. It is therefore not surprising that hewanted to uplift humanity in an effort to speed up their evolution. We learnthrough the tablets that Enki felt a very close link to his new creation. Whichof the two was instrumental in orchestrating these ‘law reforms’ is not clear atpresent. But like all hidden agendas, it will eventually emerge. My instincttells me that they both probably had something to do with the injection of legalprinciples, but each one had a slightly different motive. We know what happenedin the end, we are the living proof of all those laws today. And yet some partsof the world had a completely different approach to the laws that governed theircultures. This is one possible piece of evidence which highlights how the tworival Anunnaki brothers tried to control humanity in their own way, each onetaking control of different parts of the world for themselves. It is beginningto feel as if Enki may have been instrumental in the setup of the very firstsecret society which William Bramley calls “The Brotherhood of the Snake” rightafter the eviction from ‘Edin’. After having a run-in with his brother Enlilabout the upliftment of ‘Adam and Eve’, the creator of humanity Enki, realisedthat the slanderous campaign against him as the ‘serpent’, the ‘evil snake’,would be fiercely enforced by Enlil.Humans would be controlled, whatever it took, and Enlil was an accomplishedstrategist and a master of propaganda. Enki had to resort to a more clandestineapproach to uplift Humankind. One such distinct possibility was theestablishment of a small group of humans who were introduced to more advancedthinking, information and technology. The start of the so-called ‘secretsociety’ had arrived. How else can we possibly explain the incredibly advancedthinkers and philosophers in ancient times? And small groups of more informedand technologically astute people? As astounding as the sudden emergence ofcivilisation was all those thousands of years ago, the sudden appearance ofadvanced thinkers is equally puzzling. Where on Earth did a small group ofindividuals with such clear minds suddenly emerge from? Who helped them to seethings so differently? Why were they so much more informed and enlightened thanthe rest of the humans who were nervously worshipping a vengeful god? They musthave had a mentor of some repute. An advisor or guardian who introduced suchadvanced ideas to them. William Bramley traces these ‘secret societies’ all theway back to the Garden of Edin (as the Sumerians called it), but there arehowever a few areas where they get very closely entangled with the manipulativeactivity of Enlil, who proclaimed himself the only god of man, the god of theBible who continued to dispense punishment to his disobedient subjects andrewarded those who toed the line. These historic inconsistencies of greatviolence and yet great benevolence are starting to take on a whole new slant aswe unravel the motives of the two patriarchal brothers of the Anunnaki, whoestablished the settlement here on Earth some 445,000 years ago. We will exploremuch more of their actual behaviour from the clay tablets known as The Lost Bookof Enki which was meticulously presented by Zecharia Sitchin in 2002.[../Images/148-1.jpg]Classic Greek representation of Zeus fighting his brother in a disagreement.We will find that this is the identical story to Enlil and Enki during theirargument in the Garden of Eden. Enki was represented as the serpent and wasbanished from Eden for attempting to help the first human couple. Notice theserpent’s tail taking the form of a double helix DNA. The wings are a constantsymbol throughout all mythologies that talk about the winged serpent, creatorgod.But back in the days of Urukagina the ‘law maker’, the bench would consist ofone royal judge who was chosen from 36 men, and three to four other judges whomade up a kind of jury. Meticulous records were kept of contracts, courtproceedings, judgments and sentencing.One more interesting ritual which was inherited by the Hebrews and Jews is theten-day period that marks the beginning of the New Jewish Year. During thisperiod Jews are supposed to take stock of their activity from the year gone byand based on their deeds, the fate of the new year will be determined for themby god. This entire process has been adopted from the Sumerian culture, wherethe god Nanshe would come down every year to evaluate the performance of thehumans, not based on material wealth or conquest, but rather whether they “didthe righteous thing”. Their fate for the year to come would be determined basedon the outcome of such an evaluation by the god Nanshe.Professors at the University of California at Berkley, claim that they have beenable to read and play cuneiform notes from a tablet dated to around 1,800 BC. Itseems that in Sumer, music and songs were performed in temples and many originallove songs have been unearthed. They feature the words while the musical scoresare captured in the margins. We will discover that Inanna, the goddess of love,was the one who led the artistic explosion. The tablets refer to her constantlyas being highly sexed, enjoying singing and playing instruments, and writing andreciting poetry. During the excavations at Nippur, which was the religiouscentre of Sumer and Akkad at some stage, they found around 30,000 texts, many ofwhich are still being studied. The wealth in cultural finds continued inShurupak, where schools dating back to the third millennium BC were uncovered.From the mound of Tell Brak in northern Mesopotamia archaeologists uncovered theancient capital of the Akkadian empire, the city of Nagar, dating back to 2,000BC. It is also the home of one of the oldest religious sites, the Eye Temple.But at Ur, the birthplace of Abraham, excavation efforts delivered weapons,chariots, jewellery, helmets made of gold, silver, copper and bronze,magnificent vases, the remains of a weaving factory, court records and atowering ziggurat pyramid. More fascinating information in the form ofinscriptions were found at Umma, which referred to “earlier empires” and at Kishthere is another ziggurat pyramid and other monumental buildings which date backto at least 3,000 BC. The Sumerian city of Uruk or ‘Erech’, which is situated onthe banks of the Euphrates River, is still considered by many as the first truecity in the world. This city boasts the oldest stone construction known to date,which is a limestone pavement dating way back into the fourth millennium BC.They also found a potter’s wheel, a kiln, and exquisite coloured pottery amongother items. Until the 1990s the general consensus was that the earliest citiesarose between 3,500 BC and 3,800 BC, but this time-line is slowly being pushedback by new digs in Syria, Turkey and Iraq. All this activity in the ancientNear East is strongly supported by the writings in the Book of Enki dating backfrom about 2,050 years BC. This precious prehistoric account of early humans,outlines the activity of the early settlers on Earth and their explorations ofthe whole region and the establishment of their own settlements as far back as445,000 years ago. We can now start to paint a more complete picture of what wasgoing on in the greater Mesopotamian area over many thousands of years. In anarticle from 18 September 2004, New Scientist magazine ran an in-depth featureon the ‘road to civilisation’ in which archaeologist McGuire Gibson from theUniversity of Chicago makes some startling, and yet expected discoveries. Therehave been many hints over the past few decades, that civilisation must haveemerged virtually immediately after the end of the last Ice Age in the Near Eastand also in the Mesoamericas, some 9,000 years BC. Now there is real evidencethat clearly supports those earlier theories.The excavations at Uruk point to settlements already springing up around 8,000BC, but it was only around 3,500 BC that it had grown into a real city whichcovered about 2.5 square kilometres with a population of around 50,000. PaulCollins who is an expert on the Ancient Middle East at the Metropolitan Museumof Art in New York, says that, “There would have been major buildings,monumental structures on the scale of the Pantheon,” which would classify it asa city. But to be classified as a city it also needed to have evidence of‘zoning’ between administrative centres, residential areas, markets and so on.It also needed fortification to demonstrate that it was worthy of defending.Uruk had all these criteria in abundance by 3,500 BC. But Eridu was the firstSumerian city according to ancient texts. Many of these claims in scripture wereconfirmed when archaeologists uncovered an ancient temple dedicated to god Enki,‘Sumer's god of Knowledge’ at the site. It appeared to have been built andrebuilt many times, but as they dug deeper they struck virgin soil dating backto 3,800 BC.Not far from Tell Brak in the north lies Tell Hamoukar, which has been studiedby McGuire Gibson's team for some time. They have also found evidence of awell-defined city by 3,700 BC, which covered about 12 hectares enclosed by adefensive wall. The many mud-brick ovens found in the city suggest that therewas large scale preparation of food going on at the site.It is astounding that every time archaeologists embark on a major dig in thegreater area of Mesopotamia, they unearth older and more impressive evidence oforganised communal living and a well-evolved culture and civilisation datingfurther and further back. New Scientist points out that David and Joan Oatesfrom the University of Cambridge, who have been studying the site since 1976,first uncovered second and third millennium BC artefacts. In 1981, theyuncovered hidden under the foundations of the city wall, deposits from 3,000 BC.It took them another ten years to come back, but when they did they uncoveredreasonably undisturbed records from the fourth millennium BC and even earlier,which included the ruins of a large building with very thick walls and a heavydoor dating back to the late fifth millennium BC. It seems to have been somekind of official administrative building similar to those visible in thepresent-day Arab world. Joan Oates is convinced that there will be digs whichwill uncover more ‘fully fledged cities’ in the southern parts that are olderthan 4000 BC. At the same time Gibson has pointed out the abundance of potteryand other artefacts scattered all over the region, which includes theMediterranean and Arabian peninsula. This indicates that the “pulse of trading”was strong all over the area. Yet another site called el-Queili, which is only afew kilometres east of Uruk, was discovered but it has not been touched since1980. At the time, the last bit of excitement to emerge from the site were theremains of what Joan Oates called “strikingly large houses” dating back to 6,000BC.In his book The Goddess and the Bull, Michael Balter writes about the excitingdiscoveries further north in Turkey, at the site of Catalhoyuk on the Anatolianplateau. Since 1958 this site has delivered an astonishing wealth of prehistoricartefacts. They have uncovered hundreds of structures, “astounding art”, andmuch more evidence pointing to the existence of settled life as far back as7,000 BC. It is evident that there is much more hidden below the sands of timeall over the area in which the Anunnaki first touched down. They obviously didnot remain exclusively on the edge of the Persian Gulf at Eridu, but manyancient Sumerian texts indicate that they set up homes and other settlementsfurther north-west, right across Asia Minor and into present-day Turkey. Theirinfluence must have spread through Greece and Macedonia and even further northinto ancient Europe, even as far north as Scandinavia. We can basically deducethat wherever there were mythological gods, there must have been the presence ofthe Anunnaki. As modern archaeologists scratch and dig they will undoubtedlyuncover the evidence necessary to irrefutably prove the sudden emergence ofcivilisation virtually immediately after the last Ice Age some 11,000 to 12,000years ago.There is however more physical evidence of even more archaic cultures and ‘low’levels of civilisation dating back 77,000 years in southern Africa. The beadsdiscovered at Blombos in South Africa prove that humans were involved in thedevelopment of ornamental or decorative pieces a long, long time ago. This doesnot however mean that the peak of what would be called ‘civilisation’ had beenacquired by them at that stage. They were mostly nomadic hunter gatherers wholeft behind a trail for us to unravel. These very early signs of human presencein southern Africa go hand in hand with the Cradle of Humankind which ispositioned just north of Johannesburg. It is now accepted by most scientiststhat the first humans on Earth lived in this part of the world. We will readdetailed descriptions in the clay tablets, corroborating these latest theories.How the Anunnaki “created the ‘Adamu’ in their image and from their essence” totoil in the gold mines of southern Africa, as far back as 200,000 years ago. Isit a coincidence that the latest scientific dating of Adam and Eve places themin the same place at the same time?ANATOLIA AND THE NEAR EAST[../Images/152-1.jpg]ARTEFACTS WITH EXAMPLES OF THE BALKAN-DANUBE SCRIPT[../Images/152-2.jpg]Source: www.iatp.md/davaBut while we have been focusing on all this activity in Africa and Mesopotamia,further north west in the Balkan-Danube region there were signs of greatactivity as far back as 9,000 BC. From a small village called Rast in westRomania emerged a small figurine covered in “strange geometrical and abstractmotifs” which resembled some form of previously unknown style of writing. But itwas only in 1989 that Marija Gimbutas first observed the markings on the“Madonna” and realized that these strange “decorative inscriptions” did notfollow any set patterns or repetitive structure with predetermined spatiallogic, which suggested that it must have been some form of early Proto-Europeanwriting, dating back to over 5,000 BC. This shook the scientific world, makingit older than the oldest known Sumerian texts by about 2,000 years. And so wasborn the Balkan-Danube Script mystery, now referred to as the oldest writtendocuments known to man. There was much controversy about the suggested newwritten language at first, but now most scholars agree that the staggeringdiscovery was indeed a Proto-European written language. The amazing thing isthat to date, nobody has been able to decipher it or venture a guess as to whatkind of language it was, or where it originated from. We do however know quite alot about the activity of the Proto-European culture dating back as far as 9,000BC. Scholars write that trading activity started on the western side of theAegean Sea when the tribes of hunter-gatherers adopted new knowledge fromAnatolia and began to move westwards. Their newfound techniques allowed them tocreate beautiful pottery, human figures, copper and other metal artefacts. Theirwriting technique and influence spread through the Danube valley, southernHungary, Macedonia, Transylvania and northern Greece. It is important to notethat they also built palaces, temples, ships and created new weaving techniques.Copper forging technology appeared around 5,500 BC which should not surprise us,since we have already seen that at another place in Anatolia, where theseProto-Europeans apparently acquired all their knowledge, we found evidence of awell-established civilisation at some 6,000 BC, who knew how to work with allthe metals, including bronze.[../Images/153-1.jpg] INDUS SCRIPT[../Images/153-2.jpg] [../Images/153-3.jpg] [../Images/153-4.jpg] Examples ofthe Indus script which has not been deciphered to date.Some characters have been identified as symbols for god and star.[../Images/153-5.jpg]It now makes complete sense that the Sumerians who were forging metals 6,000years BC in Catalhoyuk, which also happens to be in Anatolia, expanded theirknowledge to the Proto-European cultures. It is also more than probable that theAnunnaki used a different written language from the Sumerians. Could it be thatthe indecipherable script from ancient Europe was actually the written languageof the Anunnaki?It is astonishing that the ancient Indus Valley writings date back to 3,300 BC,only 500 years later than the Sumerian cuneiform texts. Those Sumerian gods wereclearly covering large parts of the world. We know this from the clay tabletsthat point out how the Anunnaki gods travelled the world, setting up differentregions of people, under the control of different gods. The Near Eastern godsrefer to travelling to distant lands in every direction, and the east wasobviously one of those places they disappeared to, while setting up settlementsthere and searching for gold. The ancient Indus Civilisation is another exampleof how archaeologists keep digging their way deeper back in time. Suddenly, therecent discoveries which surround the early Harappan/Ravi Phase, pushed back theestimated date when writing first emerged in the Indus Valley by 700 years.There are many very clear and obvious links between the Indus gods and theSumerian gods. Historians agree that there is a definite link to Anu, Enlil,Enki, Ninhursag and other Anunnaki gods in the Harappan culture, art, potteryand writings. One such example is the depiction of the celestial symbol of Anuon an Early Harappan polychrome pot.HARAPPAN POT WITH A SYMBOL OF A STAR AND A FISH.[../Images/154-1.jpg]In Harappan culture the symbol of the star not only means‘god’, but also ‘anu’ or ‘sky’. The star image was originally the exclusivesymbol for the sky god Anu. It just so happens that Anu was also the leadingdivine god of the Sumerian pantheon of gods. This particular form of the starsymbol also represented the radiant planet Nibiru in Sumerian culture.The symbol of the fish is one of the most popular motifs of the early Harappanperiod. The fish also represented the concept of god and symbolised the ‘god ofwaters’. In Sumerian history Enki was often represented as a fish-like deity andan aquatic god who controlled the waters.The symbols of serpents and stars and other instantly recognisable Sumeriandeities are clearly visible in much of the ancient Indus culture. It is nowevident that the major Hindu gods are, in essence, Sumerian deities withdifferent names. The evidence is visible in the pictorial tablets, seals andother art depicting gods and deities. The seven divine goddesses depicted onIndus tablets overseen by a superior god are suspiciously similar to the sevenAnunnaki goddesses, who gave birth to the first group of ‘primitive workers’ onEarth while being overseen by Enki or possibly his son Ningishzidda, whoaccording to Sumerian scriptures was the one who created the genetic pool forthe original humans.The ancient Indus Valley Civilisation, situated between modern-day India andPakistan.[../Images/155-1.jpg]But the Indus Civilisation goes back a lot further, which corroborates thelegend that the Vedic poems date back as far as 8,000 BC, surviving only throughoral transfer until they were written down for the first time some 3,000 yearsBC. Asko Parpola, a leading figure in ancient Indian culture, points out thatthe Indus Civilisation can be traced in an unbroken chain from a period some8,000 BC, through the Chalcolithic 5,000-3,600 BC; to the Early Harappan period3,600-2,600 BC and finally the Mature Harappan period around 2,550 BC,eventually collapsing after 1,800 BC. There is abundant evidence of close tiesto Mesopotamia which included well-developed trade, maritime trade and closecultural contacts. The neighbouring cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were welldeveloped as early as 3,000 BC. They had similar structures made from the samebricks; they served as capitals for their provinces and were part of a unifiedgovernment that had extreme organisational skills. This is the kind of influencewhich would have been imposed by the Sumerian gods to enable them to exercisecontrol over the humans in that part of the world. The Harappa people even usedSumerian irrigation techniques in the lands along the valleys. The Indus Valleyhas its very own unsolved ancient secret treasure, known as the ‘Indus Script’.The amazing thing is that just like the Balkan-Danube Script, there has beenvery little progress made in deciphering the Indus Script in over seventy yearsby the smartest people available. Is it possible that this may be a derivativeof a similar Anunnaki script used by the Proto-Europeans? After all, theevidence slaps us in the face, that the Anunnaki were as active in the IndusValley as they were in the Proto-European cultures.EXCAVATIONS AT MOHENJO-DARO[../Images/156-1.jpg]This ruin from around 2500 BC shows the remains of a Harappan bath pointing tothe close cultural similarities between the Greeks, Romans and Indus Valleycivilisations.We should really not be surprised by this broad influence of the Sumerianculture and the discovery of ancient undeciphered scripts. Is it possible thatthese scripts may have been used by the more advanced Anunnaki as a form ofcommunication while they explored the world? The explorers of the 15th centurydid exactly the same when they moved into the Americas. They certainly did notland in one place and stay there, because it ‘looked kind of okay’. Theycontinued to move inland in all directions and proceeded to explore. It ishighly ironic that thousands of years after Earth was populated by gold-seekingtravellers from another planet, the gene which we inherited from them, surfacedso viciously when the Spaniards discovered the golden riches of the Americas inthe 15th century AD. It therefore stands to reason, that when the Anunnaki hadexhausted the gold deposits in the Near East, they explored the rest of theplanet Earth. They had actually started looking around the planet much earlier,long before the gold ran out. They were fortunate to have the benefit ofadvanced technology and flight which took them to slightly more remoteterritories like Mesoamerica and the Andes. The tablets refer many times to theways in which they scanned the seas and the lands for signs of gold under thesurface. The tablets also carry more dramatic inscriptions of their risinglevels of concern about the state of their Planet Nibiru. The amount of goldthat was being produced on Earth was not enough to deal with their degrading‘ozone’ problem. We might think this as very strange or possibly laughable thatsuch an advanced species would have a problem with their ozone. Well, thinkagain. What is one of the most pressing environmental concerns on Earth today?Global warming and the ozone layer. Very simply the ozone protects us againstall the deadly rays which are present in space. The two main culprits are ultraviolet rays and X-rays. Without the ozone we would literally fry like chips inheated oil. Or like turning on a giant microwave oven in space pointing atEarth. The point is that if we are experiencing these kind of problems here,right now, they will be experienced on many other habitable planets in thegalaxy. So before you dismiss this ‘ozone thing’ as a far-fetched hallucination,think again. It is real, it is right here, right now, on the very planet we callhome. How will we deal with the ozone problem in a 100 years from now when itreally starts to destroy crops and arable land? I don't know … maybe by then wewould have found some amazing new compound on Mars or Europa or Titan or any ofthe other celestial bodies within reach in our solar system to produce thepossible saving grace.[../Images/157-1.jpg]CIVILISATIONS OF MESOAMERICAOne of the most perplexing events in human history is the sudden emergence ofcivilisation in the Americas, which introduced the world to the Incas, Olmecs,Toltecs and the early Mayas of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mesoamerica. Historiansand archaeologists just cannot agree on the times and possible dates when thesemysterious cultures suddenly appeared, displaying pretty much all the samebehavioural characteristics of the people in Mesopotamia. Such a suddenappearance of organised people in a distant continent is just too incredible todescribe as a coincidence. It points irrefutably to an extreme example of theSumerian-Anunnaki expansion over the world in search of gold. And gold there wasplenty of in the Americas. This sudden emergence of civilisation in Mesoamericahappened virtually at the same time as it was exploding in Mesopotamia, shortlyafter the end of the last Ice Age. The ancient secrets of the Mayas and theIncas have kept archaeologists and historians guessing for many years. How onEarth is it possible that a virgin civilisation could have emerged out of theblue some ten thousand miles away from the so-called origin of civilisation inMesopotamia, across the Atlantic, 11,000 years ago, unless there was someinterference by the highly mobile Anunnaki? It defies all laws of probabilityfor such an event to happen randomly on a planet where the only activity wasseemingly restricted to the land between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean.As suddenly as civilisation emerged in the Near East, the Proto-Mayans appearedin Mesoamerica. They had all the knowledge possessed by well developed cultures.They knew all about agriculture, they built cities and pyramids as impressive asthe Egyptians and they even knew how to extract gold from ore. Many theorieshave arisen about the origins of the Incas, Mayas, the Toltecs and Olmecs, whocollectively shaped the Andean and Mesoamerican cultures over thousands ofyears.EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL MAYAN PYRAMID[../Images/158-1.jpg]But the Anunnaki had more than just gold on their minds when they arrived in theAmericas. They were also in search of tin. Tin is the necessary ingredient whichtogether with copper, makes up bronze. At this time in Earth’s history bronzewas becoming the metal of choice. Indications are that tin supplies inMesopotamia were running dry and Inanna or Ishtar makes clear references in herSumerian texts to “tin mountains” in Mesoamerica. She was asking permission fromthe superior gods to go in search of tin in the new lands. “Let me set out onthe road to the tin ores. Let me learn about their mines.” These tin mountainshave been identified as the areas around Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. Even today,tin production is continuing in many parts of this region. The Anunnaki referredto tin as the ‘divine’ metal and called it ‘AN.NA’ which means ‘heavenly stone’.They called the combination of copper and tin into bronze ‘ZA.BAR’ which means‘gleaming double metal’. Ancient references to rich alluvial sources of tin haveconfused mineralogists, as pure tin is very rare. But David Forbes, who was amineralogist researcher in South America, was astounded when he was shown achunk of pure tin actually encasing a rock, as opposed to being encased in therock, showing that such deposits must have existed in antiquity, if they stillexist today. They did not come from a mine. The mines and rivers in that areawere also rich in gold and other metals. He was convinced that people who workedthose rich river deposits knew about tin and gold and how to process it from itsore.[../Images/159-1.jpg]ANDEAN CIVILISATIONThe fascinating tales of the Andean legends begin with the god Viracocha who wasthe ‘creator of man’ and the ‘god of heaven’, who came to Earth in greatantiquity, settling down on the shores of Lake Titicaca, close to the ancientcity of Tiahuanacu, ‘place where the gods are born’. Inca tales and legends alsotalk about the capital city Cuzco as being established by the ‘children of thesun’ who were created and instructed by the great god Viracocha when he firstsettled at lake Titicaca. There are many versions of the settlement of the firstpeople. One such tale comes from Juan de Betanzos, who writes that Viracochacreated the world in two phases. Many of these ancient fables carry the samestoryline as the Bible and the Sumerian scripts, which talk about the flood as adividing event. An ancient Quechua tale says that the creator god “on the firstoccasion, made the heavens and the Earth” then he created mankind. But “thispeople did some sort of wrong to Viracocha and he was angered by it”. Itcontinues that “those first people and their chief he converted into stones inpunishment”, then after some time of darkness “he made men and women out ofstones”. Then he apparently gave them all tasks and abilities and told themwhere they should go and stay. It has many similarities with the Biblical floodstory, before and after the flood. Noah was also told to ‘go forth andmultiply’. There are other stories about the original Andean or Mayan or Incaforefather called Manco Capac, who was created by god. He was the first to bemade a king by god and was the first monarch. Some say that he arrived by boatfrom another place across the sea, while others talk of god giving him a goldenwand called ‘Tupac-yauri’ which means ‘splendorous sceptre’. With this goldenwand he had to go in search of a destined land and was said to have started theInca capital city of Cuzco. He was the first Inca, after whom they were allcalled the ‘children of the sun’.The Popol Vuh is called ‘the sacred book’ by the Quiche Mayas. It is their mostrevered book and one that has survived for centuries, written in Roman scriptshortly after the Spanish invasion in the 16thcentury. This is a copy of theoriginal which has been lost to antiquity, but it contains come fascinatingstories. It mentions that “the first people created by god were imperfect” whichcorrelates exactly with the detailed description of the many attempts by Enki,Ninhursag and Ningishzidda, to create the first ‘primitive worker’.Many people throughout the ages have made pronouncements and told tales aboutthe ancient civilisations of the Americas. The origins of these Proto-Americanshave also been linked to the highly controversial existence of the island ofAtlantis or Poseidia. Plato was already referring to such people from Atlantisin 350 BC, when he wrote about the Mesopotamians and Proto-Europeans beingattacked by the ‘islanders’. He wrote that some 9,000 years had passed since thewar between “those on the outside” and “those on the inside” of the “Pillars ofHercules”. The ‘pillars’ refer to Gibraltar which divided the Atlantic ocean andthe Mediterranean. This would place the time at around 9,500 BC, just after thelast Ice Age. This Ice Age date plays a pivotal role in all of pre-history, asit crops up over and over again as a landmark for the beginning of mostactivities by modern humans, whether they were in Mesopotamia or the Americas.The end of the last Ice Age brought the sudden emergence of civilised man in anumber of places around the world and is regarded by many as the first ‘flood’that swept the Earth, causing Humankind to have to start from scratch. We shouldtherefore not be surprised when many scholars claim that the first peoplearrived in the Americas from the lost island of Atlantis at the time when thelast Ice Age ended. It would make perfect sense since their island was about tobe swallowed by the giant tidal waves which caused the great flood of that time.In December 2004, we saw how devastating a relatively small Tsunami can be toislands in its way. Imagine what a flood ten to twenty times that size would do.This is why the original people settled on the mountainous shores of the lakeTiticaca, far away from the flood waters and close to rich sediments of gold,tin and other metals. This was also the time during which agriculture andfarming were introduced to man, as outlined in many Sumerian tablets, especiallythe Lost Book of Enki, which describes in great detail the times and activitiesand relationships between the Anunnaki gods and the newly created humans.There is clear evidence of crops being cultivated in the Teohuacan Valley some7,000 years BC, but there is also evidence that there was probably somedevastating flood leading up to this date, which only allowed civilisation tocontinue much later in about 3,100 BC. Barry Fell, a professor at Harvard,successfully proved that the Americas were being visited as early as 5,000 BC byProto-Europeans and Africans. Roman vases have been found on the seabed nearBrazil; Roman coins were found off the beach in Massachusetts; Carthaginianvases were found off the coast of Honduras, but the permission to investigatethe wreck was denied, in order to protect the historic importance of Columbus.Professor Fell also speaks about many sites in the Americas which have beenfound containing Carthaginian and Celtic writings. Many Punic inscriptions havebeen found on gravestones, cairns and in stone cellars, dating back to theBronze Age between 1,200 and 3,000 BC. There are also inscriptions in theoriginal Celt written language of Ogham from the pre-Roman times of France andSpain. On a stone carving of a ship from Tarshish, there is an inscription thatsays: “Voyagers from Tarshish, this stone proclaims.” This was translated fromthe Tartessian Punic language. The Southern American pre-history can really bedivided into two regions where the Anunnaki gods were active. Mesoamerica whichincludes Mexico, and South America – mainly Peru and Bolivia, where according tothe Incas it all began. The Mayans of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico had thegold, while the Incas and their ancestors had the tin.One of the most incredible ancient finds in all of archaeological history wasthe Mayan calendar. When it was first discovered it perplexed all who tried tofigure it out. But it took the persistent investigative work of a Germanlibrarian by the name of Ernst Forstemann in 1880, to break the code and unravelits incredible mystery. When the Mayan calendar was finally explained, it showedthe incredible knowledge that they possessed of the cosmos, solar system and themovements of planets, including our own moon. The Mayan calendar became known asthe ‘Long Count’. Instead of using irrelevant points of reference to historicfigures by which to develop a calendar, they used the movements of the Sun, moonand Venus to calculate precise points in time, to the ‘first’ rising or ‘birth’of Venus. All the Mesoamerican cultures believe that there are five different‘ages’ or ‘Suns’. After many years of deciphering the Mayan mathematicalformulas, scholars agree that the beginning of the Long Count started on the13th August 3,114 BC and will end on 22 December 2,012. That means that theperiod is 5,126 years long. What the exact significance of the length of the‘age’ or the end date is, is not clear. But it's not a long time to go, so let'sjust wait and see. Some scientists claim that it has to do with a shift in theEarth's magnetic field, when the north and south poles move away from theircurrent positions and establish new magnetic poles.GIANT OLMEC STONE HEADS[../Images/162-1.jpg]Erik Parker stands in front of a giant Olmec head. Just one example of severalsuch works of art discovered in the jungles of Mexico. Notice the distinctAfrican features and protective head gear on both heads. This has baffledhistorians for ages.The mystery of the Mesoamerican civilisations continues with the Olmecs. Theyappeared in the Tabasco area of Mexico as suddenly as all the others. But theirdistinctly ‘African’ physical features were completely different from the otherlocals. They seem to have appeared around the beginning of the Mayan Long Countsome 3,114 years BC. The colossal stone head found at Veracruz in 1862 showsconvincingly that their features were distinctly African. Several other giantheads have been found and all of them show the same African features. On othercarvings they were almost always depicted with some kind of tool in their hands,digging for gold. In many of the depictions on rocks and seals and stelae, theirtools are reasonably detailed and it becomes clear that these were sophisticatedpeople with a good knowledge of ore mining.Let us analyse the situation for a second. If you had discovered gold in afaraway land and needed experienced miners to deal with the perils of getting itout of the ground, would you attempt to train the inexperienced people from thesurrounding districts, or would you rather bring in a team of well-trainedminers who could get on with the task immediately, while sharing their skillswith the locals? Many scholars believe that is exactly what the ancient ‘mininglords’ did. The Anunnaki gods came to America to mine for gold and brought theirexperienced miners from Africa. It provides a very simplistic explanation forthe appearance of the Olmecs or ‘rubber people’ in Mesoamerica. It also explainswhy there was so much gold when the Spaniards first invaded it some 4,500 yearslater.To truly understand the magnificent golden riches that greeted the invaders, wejust need to mention the Peruvian city of Cuzco. There the Conquistadores foundthe great ‘Temple of the Sun’ which had walls covered with gold. There werechapels and burial chambers honouring ancestors, filled with a variety ofstatuettes and images. It boasted an artificial garden where all the plants,shrubs and trees were made of gold. In the courtyard, there was a mock field ofmaize where every stalk was made of silver and the delicate ears made of gold,which covered around 20,000 square metres or two hectares. The Spaniards soonrealised that they would have to fight for the gold as all these Americancultures believed that gold was a gift from the gods and it belonged to thegods. So it is our deduction that the Olmecs were a group of miners from Africawho were brought to America to mine for gold by their Anunnaki-Sumerian masters.And at this point, in our highly informed civilisation of the 21st century,there seems to be no better explanation. After all the Anunnaki have come tothis new land to get more gold and they needed experienced miners. Who better tobring along for the task than the African miners of gold who had been created bythe Anunnaki for that specific task, and who had loads of experience by then?Many of the depictions of Olmec miners show some form of advanced fire tool,which they point at the rock face. It almost seems like a device that produced aflame or beam to heat or cut the rock. They even show these miners with a kindof headgear that produced beams of light. Too much to swallow? Well, these stonecarvings and depictions have survived for over 5,000 years, and even today westill mine for gold, using hand held tools and lamps on the helmets even at ouradvanced levels of sophistication. So why could they have not done so? It mayjust be that the Olmecs had a smarter way of doing it. They must have known agreat deal about engineering and construction because their pyramids and otherlost cities are as impressive as any of the Mayan or Egyptian structures. Theyare remembered for building what is possibly the oldest pyramid in the Americasand introducing the ‘dot and bar’ counting system which was apparently used bythe Mayas to develop their ‘Long Count’ calendar in later years. They alsocultivated maize and other crops and introduced a ball game with a rubber ball,which may just be the predecessor to basketball and soccer. They were known asthe ‘rubber people’, the meaning of the word Olmec. The latter Spanish miningengineers have often spoken of “prehistoric gold mines” at Mexican sites.If you have doubts about the African connection to the Olmecs, here is a curiousbit of information. The Olmec style of writing is very similar to the writingused by the Vai people of West Africa. They also spoke a language that had astrong resemblance to that of the Manding (Malinke-Bambara) language spoken inWest Africa. Is that just another coincidence? It is believed that the Olmecpeople introduced writing to the New World and they had both a syllabic andhieroglyphic script. The decipherment of the Olmec writing of ancient Mexicoprovides us with keen insight into the world of the Olmec. Rafinesque publishedan important paper on Mayan writing in 1832, that helped to decipher the Olmec'swriting.[../Images/164-1.jpg]The great Olmec centres that developed at La Venta, SanLorenzo and Laguna de los Cerros, and the smaller centres such as Tres Zapotes,were not simply vacant religious sites, but dynamic settlements which includedartisans and farmers, as well as priests and the rulers. Then there were theToltecs, Aztecs, Zapotecs, Mixtecs, and other groups who lived and influencedthe ancient cultures of the Americas over many thousands of years. Each onepointing to the other whence they received their knowledge about gold mining andother skills. The most amazing thing is that all these ancient American cultureshad one thing in common – they all worshiped the same deity who was known as the‘Winged Serpent’ or ‘Flying Serpent’.He went by different names. This major god was called Kukulkan by the Mayas,Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs, Viracocha by the Incas, Gucumatz in central America,Votan in Palenque and Zamna in Izamal.The pre-Columbian Inca Civilisation was extraordinary in its development ofhuman society and culture, ranking with the early civilisations of Egypt andMesopotamia. There are several myths about pre-Inca civilisations and as withall ancient civilisations, legends and ancient stone carvings and theirmonuments speak of creation by gods who came from the skies, yet no one iscertain how any of these civilisations came into being. Many just seem to springup as if out of nowhere.So were these gods actually real? Did they really come from the sky to createman in all these different parts of the world? Once again, the similarity toMesopotamian and biblical legends are too close to be coincidental, especiallyif we take into account the vast distances between the continents with theAtlantic Ocean in between. There is a pre-Incan legend that speaks of Viracochawho is depicted in many forms, which is not unlike gods in other civilisations.He was known as the ‘good god’, but the warrior side to his personality was alsooften shown. We see him as the enlightened god in white robes who bringsknowledge, and the warrior god with staves in his hands and a sun symbol aroundhis head, not unlike that of the sun god Ra in ancient Egypt. Viracocha, as thefeathered serpent god, is one of the great mysteries of ancient Americancultures. But there is a clear link to the activities of the Anunnaki in thispart of the world and Viracocha is the main protagonist leading the rest of thegods who came in search of gold. The only question is, which of the featheredserpents is he? Enki the ‘Lord of the Earth’, who is always depicted as a wingedserpent, or his son Ningishzidda, whose symbol is also the entwined serpent,representing his knowledge of medicine.Quetzalcoatl was the good god and hero of the Nahuatl people. He was the‘Feathered Serpent’, hero god, giver of all their knowledge. The story goes thathe established the city of Tula around 3,200 BC, taught the people about maizefarming and gave them other important knowledge. He was fair-skinned. But hisbrother was jealous and cast him out. Quetzalcoatl promised that he would returnto “establish rule of law and enlightenment”. It is this kind of characterdescription which closely resembles Enki or his son Ningishzidda. As weexplained, both had serpents in their Sumerian depictions.But there are many other fascinating tales about the relationship between thegods, the people and their obsession with gold in the Americas. We alreadyoutlined the golden riches that greeted Cortes, the Spanish explorer, when hefirst set foot in this part of the world. He was astounded by the amount of goldthere was. The cities were covered with it. The thing that amazed him, was thatall the locals explained to Cortes how they smelted the metal in small pots andcast them in bars. They also explained that “once it was ready it was sent tothe capital, returned to the gods to whom the gold had always belonged.” Thisseems to be a constant mantra with the ancient American cultures. They allclaimed that the gold belonged to the gods. To the Aztecs, gold was a ‘divinemetal’. The Toltecs in Mexico were mining it 1,000 years BC already and theIncas believed that it was “the gods who caused gold to be so valued”. They alsobelieved that gold was made from the gods' tears. Sitchin compares this notionto the voice of god as it spoke through the prophet Haggai. “The silver is mineand the gold is mine. So sayeth the Lord of Hosts.” Once again the similarity isa little too close for coincidence. The Mayans called gold ‘teocuitlatl’ whichmeant ‘the gods’ excretion’– his tears and his perspiration. But the serpentconnection has another twist which links it to the Near East and our Anunnakigods.There is a very good reason why the symbol of a snake is so prominent in Earthhistory. Once again it is revealed to us by the Sumerian tablets. After Alalufirst landed on Earth, he went in search of water north-west of where Eridu waslater built, and at the shores of a lake or a river, he saw a snake for the veryfirst time. It is obvious from his reaction that snakes were not known onNibiru. “A hissing sound he could hear; a slithering body by the poolside wasmoving.” After killing the snake in a reflex action he examined it withamazement. “The slithered body lay still… like a rope its long body was, withouthands or feet was the body…”. Alalu pondered this creature for some time,wondering if it was the guardian of the water or what purpose it might haveserved. Later, when Enki and his first team of exploring astronauts landed tojoin him, he showed them the serpents. It makes good sense that they would haveused this creature as some kind of symbol on their new planet, since it was thefirst creature they saw. The Mayan word for serpent is ‘can’ which is parallelto the Hebrew word Canaan, and that is why the god from Canaan got the title of‘serpent’.After Quetzalcoatl settled in the Americas, he established his first city inlandat the great river Nachan, which means ‘place of serpents’. It stands to reasonthat there would be snakes of a wide variety present in that part of the world,but it is also very close to the Hebrew word for serpent ‘Nachash’. ArthurPosnansky found a series of inscriptions on rocks on the shores of Lake Titicacathat links the ancient Peruvian script to inscriptions found on Easter Island.For those who don't know Easter Island, it is an extremely remote island in themiddle of the Pacific between Australia and South America, which sports a longline of giant ‘heads’ carved out of rock. As incredible as it is, both thesescripts, which originate a great distance from each other, Titicaca and EasterIsland respectively, are related to the Indus Valley script and the writing ofthe Hittites of Mesopotamia. From a series of archaeo-astronomic calculations,Prof. Rolf Muller concluded that the structures at Machu Picchu, Cuzco andTiahuanacu are at least 4,000 years old, which would explain how the Indus andMesopotamian texts could have influenced their sister cultures on the other sideof the world. But how would they have arrived there? With the help of theever-present Anunnaki gods of course.In the biblical story of Cain and Abel we are told that the two brothers weregiven separate tasks to help provide for the growing family of man. As with allof biblical stories, we find tales of exact parallel in Sumerian scriptures thatpredate the Bible by at least 1,000 years. In this case, the story is told ingreat detail, describing the brothers Ka-in “He who in the Field Food Grows” andAbael “He of the Watered Meadows”, as they go about their respective chores ofplanting crops and breeding domestic animals. Just like the Bible says. WhenAbael's animals started to eat Kain's crops, a fierce fight erupted between thebrothers during which Ka-in killed Abael. Although he was filled with remorseand realised his grave mistake, the Sumerian gods decreed that he should bebanished away from their land of Edin to toil on his own, without the help ofthe Anunnaki gods. Marduk was the firstborn son of Enki who arrived on Earth tobe with his father on this exciting adventure, exploring a new planet. Mardukhad the following to say: “…let Ka-in's life be spared, to the ends of the Earthlet him be banished!” Enki agreed with him. “Eastward to a land of wandering forhis evil deed Ka-in must depart…” Enki concluded. And so it was that Ka-indisappeared to a distant land. We can speculate where it may have been, but afurther clue is provided later, when it is revealed that it was a land of highmountains, steep valleys and a great lake high in the mountains. There could bea number of places like that in Europe, which could be linked to the earlyProto-European farming activity. But this event took place way before the flood,which would eliminate ancient Europe as a possible candidate territory forKa-in’s place of settlement. Large parts of Europe would have had snow and iceand would not have been very pleasant to farm in. The southern hemisphere is amuch more likely candidate to fit the geographical description.Another crucial clue is given to us by Ningishzidda who was another son of Enki,involved in the ‘genetic creation’ of ‘the Adamu’. This bright young scientistwas a master at genetic engineering and he certainly got lots of experience onEarth in the early days according to the Book of Enki, which was compiled andtranslated by Zecharia Sitchin. In this incredible book we learn virtuallyeverything we wanted to know about the origin of humanity and the activitiesthat brought us to the days of Abraham. Ningishzidda explains how he geneticallycreated Ka-in not to be able to grow a beard. “By Ningishzidda was the lifeessence of Ka-in altered. That his face a beard should not grow, Ka-in's lifeessence Ningishzidda changed.” It is well established that the native people ofthe Americas do not really grow beards, because of a subtle geneticdifferentiation from the Europeans. This is a vivid clue pointing to the strongprobability that Ka-in eventually ended up in the mountainous lands of the earlyInca civilisation, in Peru, near Lake Titicaca. The Incas refer to ancient timeswhen their progenitors arrived from a distant land in the west. Is it possiblethat it was Ka-in, after whom they were named? In-ca = Ca-in?The world is filled with incredible mysteries from distant prehistoric timeswhen man was supposed to be a wandering nomad, living in caves and struggling tosurvive. Then suddenly after the Great Flood of around 11,000 BC, he emergedfrom the caves with instant knowledge of many things, praying to a number ofever-present gods who seemed to be active all over the world. There are hundredsmore examples of other civilisations in Africa, Asia, Japan, Australia and otherislands scattered around the world, which also miraculously received greatknowledge from some mysterious place sometime shortly after the Great Flood.What we need to establish is the realistic probability that all this knowledgejust suddenly came to primitive humans without some sort of assistance from amore advanced power. The ancient scripts of the Sumerians provide us withthousands of snippets of ‘tough-to-argue-against’ evidence that suchintervention actually occurred. All we have to do is remove it from the realmsof ‘mythology’ where it has been positioned by ignorant historians, and acceptthat those were times that we cannot possibly comprehend today. We can hardlyunderstand how a man like Hitler could marshal up so much support to take on thewhole world in our own lifetime and exterminate millions of people. If it wasnot for the visual evidence, and if we had to rely on oral tales of the eventsfrom only 65 years ago, we would find it hard to believe. Mind you, there arepeople who still do not want to believe the whole Second World War saga with itsextermination of the Jews, even in the face of all the evidence we have. It istherefore not surprising that we find it difficult to accept written evidencefrom thousands of years ago, which meticulously outlines the steps of Humankindon Earth.One of the most compelling examples of interaction between gods and humans isthe story of Egypt. Archaeologists, historians and other scholars havespeculated for the past 200 years as to the origins of the great knowledge ofthe Egyptians. The truth is that their entire culture stems directly from theSumerians with all their major gods, and they inherited virtually everythingfrom the Sumerians, except their writing. We learn from the tablets that theAnunnaki divided the world into a number of regions and appointed various familymembers to take care of their own regions, with explicit instructions to teachthe ‘earthlings’ the art of civilisation. In a strange twist of fate they neededthe earthling's help after the flood, to make the Earth habitable again. Anuinstructed them to “rebuild the cities where they stood before” the flood. Theywere to appoint kings and priests to each city through which they wouldcommunicate their instructions to the people. They taught them to make bricks,to build extravagant buildings, how to calculate, introduced wheeled chariots,laid down laws and a judicial system and much more.Nowhere was the interaction between gods and kings as pronounced as in ancientEgypt. The firstborn son of Enki was Marduk. He was appointed as the god ofEgypt, where he was worshipped as ‘Ra - The Bright One’ and later ‘Amun -TheInvisible or Absent’ god. Enki was known as ‘Ptah -The Developer’ andNingishzidda was worshipped as ‘Tehuti -The Divine Measurer’. But Marduk wasrebellious from the word go and started to introduce a whole new way of doingthings. He introduced a count of 10 instead of 60, he divided the year into 12months, and had temples built everywhere in his honour. He orchestrated thebuilding of a great temple for Anu and Enki, and he was instrumental indictating the Book of the Dead to instruct Pharaohs and Kings on what to do ifthey wanted to be taken up to ‘heaven’ by him after death. It explained how toreach the ‘Duat’ or ‘Place of Celestial Boats’. Although Marduk proclaimed hissupremacy over all other gods, causing much unhappiness among the otherAnunnaki, he was not endowed with knowledge of eternal life by his father Enki.“Then all manner of knowledge, except that of dead reviving to Ra he gave” - issaid about Enki in the tablets. But Marduk (Ra) constantly made those claims tothe Pharaohs and priests of Egypt, laying down a strict set of rules and ritualsthey had to perform to reach the eternal afterlife in the heavens. What he wasreferring to was life on planet Nibiru. Another compelling entry by Marduk inThe Book of Enki, which outlines his deception of the Pharaohs was: “Let thekings of my region of Neteru offspring be, to Nibiru in an afterlife journey.”Neteru was the name used for the Anunnaki observers who were supposed to keep aneye on the region. Marduk/Ra decreed that the kings appointed to rule over Egypthad to be offspring from Anunnaki and Earthlings, to make them superior to mereEarthlings. Once again this explains why so many of the Pharaohs believed thatthey were actually gods themselves. But it was that kind of relationship betweengods and mortals, and the power of ‘eternal life’ being usurped by Marduk, andhis encouragement of the kings to obey him and follow him into the afterlife,which led to the many murals in Egyptian tombs depicting dramatic scenes oftheir journey to the land of eternal life. These depictions have amazedhistorians for centuries while searching for the real meaning behind them.Travelling in a ‘Boat of Heaven’ across the skies to eternal life andimmortality. Over and over, historians have tried to explain these images asdramatised depictions of the Egyptian religion. But it was much more real thanthat. It now becomes very clear where the Egyptians got those ideas from. It wasa cunning manipulative Anunnaki god, who was promised the command of the planet,now demanding his rightful place on the ladder of importance among the gods fromNibiru.PYRAMIDS OF GIZA[../Images/170-1.jpg]From left to right: Menkaure, Khafre and Khufu or Great Pyramid. Notice the twosmaller queen’s pyramids in the foreground. The Great Pyramid is the only oneremaining wonder of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World.The pyramids of Giza have perplexed historians and archaeologists alike, makingall kinds of pronouncements about the origins of the pyramids. The popularopinion is that the great pyramid was built by King Khufu (Cheops) of the4thDynasty, during his reign some 2,589 years BC. This has been contradicted bymany scholars over the years, who claim that Khufu was merely a ‘user’ of thepyramid, that the pyramids of Giza already existed by the time he took thethrone. Any inscriptions that may have been found in or on the pyramid were madelong after it was completed. There are so many inconsistencies in the story ofthe building of the pyramids by the Pharaohs, that it keeps attracting newtheories. If the pyramids of Giza were built by Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, asis claimed by historians, the progression seems back to front. Would it not makemore sense that the latter kings would have wanted to show their supremacy? Inthat case the first pyramid would have been the smallest, followed by the largerone, eventually ending with biggest one, the Great Pyramid. This is a simpleprinciple of progression that the Egyptians understood much better than we dotoday. There are many arguments raised by writers, like Graham Hancock in hisbook Fingerprints of the Gods, that go a long way to establishing that thepyramids were built long before the Egyptian Civilisation came into existence.They certainly were not built to be tombs for kings. It seems to follow that theearly Egyptians would have been highly impressed by these giant monuments oftheir gods, and they tried to imitate them. The later pyramids became greattributes to their gods of which they were very proud, but the results were notalways that successful. It is clear that all the imitation pyramids built by theEgyptian Pharaohs, were much smaller, did not possess the complex passages ofthe Great Pyramid, and often collapsed. They obviously did not have theknowledge of the Anunnaki who were the original builders of the Giza pyramids.The latter kings could never match the size and the angles of the originalstructure.Once again, the Sumerian texts give us a very different version of the pyramids'origins, and again these seem to make much more practical sense than any of themore popularised ‘fairytale’ versions. It was the talented Ningishzidda who theEgyptians worshipped as ‘The Divine Measurer’ who planned, measured, modelled,and perfectly built the three pyramids of Giza. His reason was far more pressingthan a giant tomb to be buried in. The Book of Enki describes it very vividly.But before he built the final thing, he first made a smaller scale prototype.“The rising angles of four smooth sides with this he perfected. Next to it alarger peak he placed, its sides to Earth's four corners he set; By theAnunnaki, with their tools of power, were its stones cut and erected. Beside it,in a precise location, the peak that was its twin he placed; With galleries andchambers for pulsating crystals he designed it.”They called the erections “Ekur – House Which Like a Mountain Is”. What becomesquite clear from this short extract, is that the pyramids had a far moreimportant role to play in the lives of the Anunnaki. The flood had wiped outtheir space port, landing places, measurements, beacons and other supportstructures that they had developed for regular take-off and landing with theirspace craft. The two pyramids were new indestructible beacons with specificchambers for “pulsating crystals” to help point out the landing places whenapproaching from space. They would not allow another flood to upset their baseon Earth. The pharaohs who followed took inspiration from these great structuresand started to imitate them with less success. Engineers have pointed out thatthere are very definite differences in the knowledge that went into building theGreat Pyramids, and the many other smaller imitations that followed. Clearly,the kings and pharaohs did not possess the knowledge of the more evolvedNingishzidda. The pyramids also proved the supremacy of the gods to theEgyptians, who worshipped them fanatically.So far we have learnt that ancient civilisations sprang up all over the worldshortly after the Great Flood of around 11,000 BC. They all showed remarkableknowledge and understanding virtually overnight, which could only have happenedif there was some form of intervention from the Anunnaki gods who ruled theworld and explored every corner in search of gold. The ‘primitive worker’ wasserving his purpose well, but now the humans who survived the flood had a morecrucial function to perform than just to dig for gold. They had to provide forthe growing population on a planet where much of the arable land was destroyed.The ‘slave species’ had been promoted to ‘provider’, and for the first time theAnunnaki conceded that they were dependent on their slaves. In these dramatictranslations we stumble upon the only two common denominators that can be tracedall the way to the birth of Humankind. Our obsession with gold and slavery."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11 [../Text/toc.html#chapter11]WRATH OF GOD [../Text/toc.html#chapter11a]I was watching a documentary on Alexander the Great, when I started wonderingwhy he was so admired by his followers, and what made him so ‘Great’. Is it thenumber of empires and kingships he overthrew, or the number of cities which fellunder his sieges, or the number of people who supported him in his quest toinvade the whole world? Is it possible that he was more feared than admired? Itseems that he is even more admired today by historians and the general populacethan he was in 333 BC. He is referred to in encyclopaedias as the conqueror ofthe Persian Empire and probably the world's greatest military leader of alltime. He has inspired many novels and movies which have used him as a role modelfor the personification of a man's man, strong and steadfast, determined,reaching for the impossible and succeeding in the face of insurmountable odds.Basically, he personifies the kind of story book hero that does not exist onEarth today. A deep thinker, strategist and great leader of men. In a shortspace of twelve years, Alexander conquered virtually all of the known world ashe marched his army of 40,000 men from west to east; invading cities andvillages one by one, often killing all the men, women and children, or savingthe women and children but selling them into slavery. He plundered the wealth ofthe cities, royal treasuries and took all their booty. After overpowering thecities, he often burnt them to the ground.Those who obeyed him were rewarded with unspoken treasures, while those whoresisted him were brutally murdered. Prisoners of war were either released ormurdered, all depending on his mood on that particular day. The globalpopulation at this time was estimated to be around 100 million and much of thiseventually fell under the rule of Alexander the Great. This great leader of menwas also known to have killed his father Philip II, a number of members of hisarmy who disagreed with his judgment and even his close friend and confidantwhose advice conflicted with that of the great Alexander. This man went so faras to declare himself a ‘god’, believing that he was above mere mortals and theson of the great Zeus, god of gods.Where does this potential for violence, oppression and punishment come from? Arewe merely imitating something or someone from days gone by? Someone who wasinstrumental in controlling the formative years after our creation? If you lookat the history of Humankind all the way back to the days of Adam, Cain and Abel,it is one long horrific tale of betrayal, murder, warfare, oppression, rape andpillage, jealousy, envy, greed and continuous unspeakable horror inflicted byman on his fellow man. But the passage of time has a strange way of smoothingout the terrible truths of the past. Time has the ability to somehow legitimisethe horrors committed in days gone by. History books have a tendency to glorifysome of the acts of past leaders, when in reality they should be condemned bylatter generations. Alexander was just one such ‘great’ warring hero of thedistant past. There were many others and most of them are revered as greathistorical leaders, forever imprinted in our memories. In truth, they were justinsatiable, power-hungry thugs who used their influence and wealth to accumulatemore and more.Attila the Hun is another great leader of the past who is described somewhatdifferently by historians. Why is that? Because he did not have an empire beforehe started to invade and rule other kingdoms? Because his tribe was described asnomadic? He was just doing what all the other kings were doing, expanding histerritory by force. This is how a historian by the name of Rit Nosotro writesabout Attila.“Attila the Hun has been known as a ruthless barbarian, fierce and uncivilised.The devastation that he delivered to his enemies and the terror that heinstilled in them during his lifetime caused him to become known as ‘The Scourgeof God’. While most people see Attila as being just a ferocious warrior, themore obscure side of him shows us that he was also a great king, possessinggreat leadership abilities and management skills. Attila the Hun was born inapproximately 406 AD to the ruling Hun family, his uncle being the king.Although we do not know much about Attila's childhood other than that he wastaught to ride a horse, shoot a bow, and fight in hand-to-hand combat at a veryyoung age. By his late teens, he was leading the Huns in merciless battleagainst their enemies, the Visigoths. He pillaged numerous towns causing utterdevastation. No one could match him in battle, and by his thirties, he was theHuns' leading commander.Before Attila's time, the Huns were a nomadic, barbarian race. They came fromAsia and first reached the outskirts of the Roman Empire in the late 4thcentury. The Huns conquered the barbarian Ostrogoths and drove back theVisigoths. The Eastern Roman Empire was threatened by these vicious Huns until418 when Rome and the Huns negotiated peace terms. To secure peace, importantpersons, such as the young Attila, were exchanged as hostages between the Romansand the Huns. During Attila's two years in Rome, he was awed by the grandeur ofthe Empire. Upon his return home, he vowed to someday go back to Rome not as ahostage, but as a conqueror.”Why is Attila seen as a ruthless barbarian, while Alexander was ‘great’, and theRomans were imperial and ‘civilised’? It almost feels as if we are legitimisingtheir individual rights to conquer others, based on their socio-economic status.Because Alexander was the king of a wealthy empire he was allowed to invade anddestroy. But because Attila was the leader of a lowly group of bandits, heshould not possess such privileges. So what makes us in the 21stcentury socaptivated by these warring heroes of the past? Do we not have heroes like thisin the modern world? Or how long do we have to wait for some of the more recentpotential candidates for ‘great military leader’ status, to be so recognised anddecorated? Alexander conquered the world in the name of Macedonia, while JuliusCaesar conquered the world some 300 years later in the name of the Roman Empire.The war stories go on. But still they are ‘great’ leaders of the past. Justrecently we had a great military leader who tried to conquer the world and inthe process got very close to doing so. He had the full fanatical support of hispeople just like Alexander did; his followers all believed that they shouldconquer the world; he was admired by them as a great leader of men; a greatstrategist and someone they would follow to the end of the world in battle. Hemobilised his well-trained and well-equipped army, killing many in the name ofhis empire, he wiped out cities and villages as part of his expansion plan, heoccupied new lands and countries, declaring them part of the new empire. Helooted wealth and riches as part of his victories and depending on his mood, hewould eliminate anyone who stood in his way, even his close friends and allies.The kind of man which history books often praise as a ‘great leader of men’.But this great leader was Adolf Hitler, and our history books have not been askind to him as they have been to Alexander and to the Romans. So what is thedifference between Adolf Hitler, Alexander, Atilla the Hun and Julius Caesar?How much time will need to pass before historians start to include Hitler in thesame revered group of great military leaders of the past? Or is it the visualreminder of the horrors of war that will exclude Hitler from this ‘great’ groupof leaders? It certainly feels that time does soften the blow while the morerecent dictators were captured on film which blows the romantic perception ofwar in an instant.In other chapters we have explored the DNA, our genome, and its capacity tocontrol all of our emotional and physical characteristics. We raise the argumentthat we are the slaves to our DNA. And as we cast our critical mind back to theevents which shaped our history, all we can see is violence, conflict anddestruction. It's as if Humankind simply cannot escape the grip of its violentbehaviour. Once again, I must remind you that the violent gene runs ‘deep andstrong’ in our bodies and we must begin to identify this behavioural pattern ofhumanity, so that we can begin to understand it. Mumbo-jumbo psychology will getus nowhere. The harsh reality is embedded in our genome. Our propensity forcruelty and violence was unconsciously bred into us by our maker at the point ofcreation. And because we were made in the ‘image of our maker’, it must surelymean that we inherited more than just his physical features. There is thedistinct possibility that if we were created as genetic experiments, or as Ihave called us, a ‘slave species’, other genetic characteristics liketemperament and even our potential for violence would have been transferred tous. From genetic studies we have already found that most of our genome issomehow switched off. This could mean that the ‘maker’ created a potentialgenetic imbalance, by purposely disabling certain genes, and allowing others toremain as the master programme which controls us. So, by extrapolation, if wehave parts of our maker in us, surely this must mean that such a ‘maker’ musthave the violent gene embedded in its genome? Is this why there are so manyhorrific tales of brutality by ‘god’ towards man throughout ancient history?Could this god have been a mere advanced being, merely exhibiting his neo-humantraits of jealousy, vengeance, retribution, punishment and other very normalcharacteristics typical of the human species? Is it at all possible that Godwith a big ‘G’ could behave in such a barbaric human way?The wrath of god should really be called the wrath of man. How is it possiblethat God, the creator of the universe and all things in it could haveintentionally created such a hateful and violent creature as the human? Andafter creating us in this disturbing way, in his image, the God of love and theGod of forgiveness, turned into a god of retribution, punishment, vengeance, butalso a god of reward if he got what he wanted. And mostly he wanted a load ofmaterial things like gold, silver, saffron, foods of a wide variety, specialfavours and he even requested his pilgrims to go to war in his name, destroyingman, woman and beast. The Bible is filled with these kind of stories which aretoo close for comfort to the materialistic and obsessive desires by mortalbeings, and are not becoming of the benevolent God who lives in spirit, fillingevery crevice of the universe.Here is an interesting comparison between the brutality of modern dictators, andthe vengeance and brutality of god. Note that I use ‘god’ instead of ‘God’, aswe are beginning to discover that there is a vast difference between the two,which has evaded simple man for millennia.We are going to indulge in four multiple choice quizzes to get to know ‘our god’a bit better. I urge you to take out a pencil and mark your answers as you workyour way through them.[../Images/style.jpg]First quiz: ‘The Wrath of Dictators’Objective: Please answer the following questions in an attempt to determine thenumber of living things that were killed by dictators, or in the name ofdictators in the past.

The answers to these questionsare purely hypothetical, because these questions were actually taken, word forword, from a Bible quiz on a respectable Christian website. All we did was toreplace the word ‘God’ with a notorious dictator or killer. I trust you are ashorrified as I was when I first saw this. I had shivers running down my spine.It reads more brutally than any horror movie I have seen. And yet, this is thestuff we teach our children because it was written by some men thousands ofyears ago, claiming that they were instructed by ‘God’ to perform these gruesomeacts. I ask you to read these questions and answers with an open mind. But atthis stage, it seems that we are incapable of separating right from wrong, as wekeep justifying these acts of horror, because they were performed in the name ofgod. Ask yourself the following; if you were to commit such acts today, in theway they are described in this quiz, apparently in the name of god, what wouldhappen to you and how would the global community react? The answers are actuallypretty simple because they have occurred many times in the past, and they willprobably continue to occur for many years to come. If you were to kill or maimone person, you will be tried and receive a prison sentence of some length,possibly life or even the death penalty. If you were to kill a small number ofpeople, you would be called a mass murderer or a serial killer and you would getlife or death, but you will be immortalised in books, documentaries and movies.You may claim insanity, in which case you will live in luxury in an asylum whereeverything is provided for you, till you die. You will make millions from thebook you write and the movie rights you sell to the highest bidder. But if youkill a few million people, and you take control of power in a small countrywhere you continue to rule through oppression, torture and fear, you will becomea dictator who is untouchable by the other governments of the world. Unless youare Saddam Hussein and you have inexhaustible wealth in the ground of your land,in which case you will be toppled by the strongest global regime of the time,against the advice of their allies, because the booty is too huge to resist.Either way, the so-called ‘wrath of god’ is too horrible to imagine, and thereality is too incredible to digest. And so, we teach our children the storiesabout the ‘wrath of god’, and we fill them with fear instead of love andcompassion. Such is the nature of the defective genome lurking in our cells,keeping us entrapped in a cycle of fear, violence and unspeakable crueltytowards our neighbours.The quiz that follows points unquestionably to a violent gene passed onto us byour maker. It smacks of an obsessive human characteristic that is predisposed todivide and conquer through intimidation, violence, brutality and fear. Where isthe God of love, the God who asks us to love our neighbour; and to love thyenemy; and to turn the other cheek; and to forgive them for they do not knowwhat they are doing? Prepare yourself for a spine-chilling experience. It istruly unbelievable when presented in this format. I, for one, cannot accept thedelusional ramblings of a handful of men from the past, when they justify theirhorrific actions in the name of god. This is not my God, this is not the God whoin a moment of infinite creativity, gave birth to the universe and filled itwith an infinite number of souls to roam the width and breadth of the creation.There is so little we know about the spiritual realm, but there will come a daywhen we will evolve to the point where our genetic make up starts to open up theportals of our mind to the greater spiritual world, to which we have been deniedaccess, mainly due to our incomplete genome.THE FIRST COMMANDMENTS[../Images/180-1.jpg]INSTRUCTIONS OF SHURUPPAK:Sumerian on clay, Sumer, 2,600 BC. This Early Dynastic tablet represents theearliest literature in the world. Only 4 groups of texts are known from the dawnof literature. The instructions are addressed by the pre-flood ruler Shuruppak,to his son Ziusudra, who was the Sumerian Noah. Shuruppak's instructions can besaid to be the Sumerian forerunner of the 10 Commandments and some of theProverbs of the Bible. Line 50: Do not curse with powerful means (3rdCommandment); line 28: Do not kill (6th Commandment); line 33-34: Do not laughwith or sit alone in a chamber with a girl that is married (7th Commandment);lines 28-31: Do not steal or commit robbery (8th Commandment); line 36: Do notspit out lies (9th Commandment).There are so many similarities between the Sumerian tablets and the books of theBible, that it instantly begs the question; how is it possible? If you look atthe tone used in the books of the old testament, you will see that it carries astrong resemblance to the Sumerian transcripts regarding the behaviour of theAnunnaki, who came to Earth in the distant past. We will study their behaviourand their actions that resulted in the creation of our own human species,fast-forwarding the evolutionary process while restricting the genome of the newspecies to the bare essentials. From the Sumerian tablets it will becomeblatantly clear that the gods who ruled the world in the distant past were meremortals with human-like needs and desires. They may have had advanced knowledge,skills and scientific ability, but this did not make them God. The strictinstructions they gave man were blatantly designed to exercise absolute controlover their newly-created ‘slave species’. The messages that the so-calledprophets of the Old Testament wrote about, and the messages they conveyed to thepeople of their world, were cunningly devised by the Anunnaki to keep man in hisplace and punish him if he stepped out of line. The wrath of god falls perfectlyin line with this kind of ‘control-freak’ behaviour and should never be confusedwith the will of God, the God with a big 'G'.CREATION OF THE WORLD[../Images/181-1.jpg]DEBATE BETWEEN BIRD AND FISH – PART OF THE SUMERIANCREATION STORY.Sumerian clay tablet, Babylonia, circa 1,900 BC. About 50-60 sources for theCreation of the Hoe are known. This clay tablet predates the Old Testament by atleast 1,000 years. Could this have been one of the many ancient sources thatinspired the authors of Genesis?Commentary:Text 1 is a part of the Sumerian creation story, as a literary debate betweenthe bird and the fish in which they argue for their usefulness in the universe.It has a substantially variant form of the published text, and the end isunpublished. Parts of the text are similar to Genesis 1:20-22. Text 2 deals withthe Sumerian belief that the hoe, one of their basic agricultural tools, wasgiven to them as a gift by the gods.It opens with the Sumerian creation of the world and of man, with parallels tothe Bible's two creation stories: \"The Lord hastened to separate heaven fromearth\" (Gen. 1:6-10); \"and Daylight shone forth\" (Gen. 1:3-5). It also predatesthe 2nd creation story of the Bible: \"The Lord put the (first) human in thebrick mould, and Enlil's people emerged from the ground\" (Gen. 2:7).The next Bible quiz is just another item of proof in our gallery of evidence. Itpaints a gruesome picture of god and exposes his true identity. This was not theloving God some of us have come to imagine, but rather a materialistic,obsessive and vengeful human-like being whom Humankind got to worship as god. Itis confusing why these ancient gods of the world would allow someone like JesusChrist to shake their absolute control of Humankind, but if we just read betweenthe lines, their devious strategy bowls us over with its undermining brilliance.In a few short years Jesus turned the oppressive teaching of the Old Testamenton its head and completely changed the way humans should deal with their needsand their own humanity. Was he the son of God? Of course he was! But now that weknow who the god of the Old Testament really was, the identity of Jesus exposesa whole new plot in the entrapment of Humankind. Did he have special powers? Itcertainly seems like it and once we have looked at the Sumerian texts it willall start making very clear sense. We will come much closer to understanding whothe ‘Prince of Peace’ was and why his message was so important to humanity atthat specific point in time. So let us take a few steps back now, from thePrince of Peace to the horrific, vengeful, barbaric acts perpetrated in the nameof god by men in the times of the Old Testament. What was said is probably quitedifferent from what was written. What is read and understood is most certainlydifferent from what was said in the beginning. The ancient tablets have exposedthe real truth.The Bible quiz you have just completed is posed by the Landover Baptist Churchin an attempt to spread the word of God. All it does, is support the notion thatGod is not who we have been led to believe. The original objective was todetermine the number of living things killed by God, or in the name of God ineach of the circumstances posed in the quiz.[../Images/style.jpg]Answers to the ‘The Wrath of God’ quiz: 1.

Could those possibly be the commands and the wishes of theGod of Love? I do not believe that for one minute. It stinks of manipulativehuman characteristics of monumental proportion. It is amazing how ‘god’ choosessides, favouring one group of his creation over another, wilfully andmaliciously guiding people to their death. He changes his mind virtually on adaily basis about his chosen people. Sometimes he delivers them from harm's way,at other times he purposely leads them to be slaughtered like sheep. This godclearly displays the kind of characteristics which he passed onto us. And weunmistakably display the traits that we could only have inherited from ourmaker, since he passed his genetic material onto us; genetically engineered intous by the scientists of the ancient world, who arrived here on Earth to set up abase camp and mine the rich minerals in the ground for use on their planetNibiru.ANU THE SUPREME GOD[../Images/185-1.jpg]Two separate tablets showing Anu, the supreme commander of the Anunnaki beingserved by human slaves. Note the star symbol representing his godly status andthe radiant planet Nibiru.All this will be breathtakingly revealed when we start to examine the Sumeriantablets. But if you think that I was lucky and found a few random out of placeexamples in the bible, you are very mistaken. The old testament is filled withacts of horror on virtually every page. It seems that whoever was trying tocontrol us had a very good strategy. Fear, punishment and reward. Just look athow successful it has been. There are still people today who live by thosevalues 4000 years later. It was actually very simple back then. Just rememberthat the Anunnaki gods were dealing with a new, primitive, un-evolved anduninformed species on Earth, one with no history, no memory, no legends, noculture. Everything they experienced was brand new to them. It was easy to findthe leaders among them, appoint them in a position of authority by giving themthe exclusive ability to converse with their maker ‘god’ and bring instructions,warnings, reward and retribution to the followers in the name of ‘god’. And sothe embryonic relationship between the new species and its god evolved overseveral thousand years, while the uninformed slaves were entrapped in the worstkind of slavery possible; the fear of their creator.Look how long it takes to rehabilitate battered animals. Some of them cannot besaved. Some will be fearful of their brutal master for the rest of their lives.With justifiable reason, because the master beats them and hurts them for noapparent reason. In this instance, there is no difference between the ‘doganimal’ and the ‘human animal’. The fear of the vengeful god runs so deep insome cultures that it will take hundreds of years to erase it, and replace itwith the opposite emotion and response. The gods got themselves into the perfectposition of power and control over their primitive creation. We were given clearinstructions as the new slave species; do not question, do as you are told, haveblind faith in your maker, because if you question or disobey, you will bepunished. And as we have seen in the very graphic quiz, the punishment was swiftand severe. So if you are still not convinced that we had a vengeful,manipulative creator here on Earth in some kind of advanced human form, here area few more extracts from the Old Testament to send shivers up your spine. Onceagain this food for thought is provided by the Landover Baptist Church.[../Images/style.jpg]Second quiz: ‘The Love of God’Objective: Please indicate how many people our loving God brutally slaughteredin each of the following settings:1.

It goes a long way insupporting my theories about the true identity of ‘god’ our maker, depicting hisobsession with taking control of the new species, which was proving to be ahandful. After all, they could not allow the slave species to get out of hand,when they were created as slaves. They were not here to have a good time. Afterthis blood-thirsty display of ancient times, we can take a look at how closelyit compares to the military activity we are capable of today, showing that we,the slave species, have evolved much closer to the levels of our makers, theAnunnaki. Unfortunately our evolution has not always been for the better. Pleasehold onto your hat, the following is truly hard to believe.[../Images/style.jpg][../Images/191-1.jpg]THE SACRIFICE OF ISAACThis famous painting by Rembrandt van Rijn depicts the Old Testament story thatepitomises the brutality of the biblical god. It was this very god who orderedAbraham to take his son Isaac to a distant mountain, far from the peering eyesof others, and murder him in cold blood. All this, simply to determine ifAbraham – essentially god’s first ‘snitch’ – could be trusted to obey god’sorders.Third Quiz: ‘God's Favourite Ways To Kill’Once again this quiz was posed by the Landover Baptist Church, providing us withall the evidence we need to show that the so-called god of man, was no more thana power-hungry and brutal humanoid with advanced powers. This is how theBaptists justify god’s brutality:“We all know God has historically killed or tortured those who rub Him up thewrong way. What you may not realize is that God's methods of maiming are asvaried as his reasons for smiting people. A Biblical scholar/True Christianshould have no difficulty determining God's favourite way of torturing and/orkilling less desirable folks in each of the following circumstances.”Brace yourself for some spine-chilling biblical facts:1. Which of the following are among God's methods of punishing those who breakHis commandments? 2. How does God handle people who make Him jealous by having areligion different than ours?

I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

Then Saul, (who also is called Paul) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him. And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord? And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.” (Acts 13:8-11)And if you think I am done trying to prove a point, you are mistaken. When Istarted uncovering the brutality in the Bible and the way it has been passeddown the generations and used as a tool of oppression, fear and punishment, Iwas so shocked I could not sleep for weeks. We have to separate ourselves fromthese barbaric acts of self-righteous bigots from days gone by, who havehijacked the true spirit and meaning of God, and by so doing imprisoned anentire planet for millennia. We must separate the true spirit of God from thewhims and needs of the advanced beings who settled on Earth and planted theseeds of a violent society among humans, into which we have evolved socomfortably, seemingly oblivious of our origins and true purpose. So here issome more food for thought especially for those who are still not convinced.Another quiz from a righteous religious group.

If God said that we areall born in sin… all this graphic killing in the name of God seems a littlearrogant, since we were told by Jesus “He who is without sin, let them cast thefirst stone”, and we are also supposed to “turn the other cheek”. What is goingon here? Which part of the Bible should we actually subscribe to? Not one part Isay. It has become clear that this was not a book inspired by the divine God ofthe universe, but a sadistic, manipulative advanced being, obsessed with keepingHumankind under control.This may be a good time to put this book down, make a cup of tea and try toabsorb all this stuff. It may just take you some time, but hopefully you willeventually start to distinguish god from the God.During our violent path to this point in time, we have fought endless wars andin the process developed some truly remarkable technology. The research anddevelopment that has gone into military weaponry, naval equipment andaeronautical science has been astonishing. In the past 100 years we have createdweapons of such awesome power that they could destroy the people of the world ina matter of hours if they were deployed. These deadly weapons come in a varietyof forms, but the most feared are WOMDs (weapons of mass destruction). You mayremember hearing a great deal about these during the Bush-Iraq episode. TheseWOMDs can be nuclear… atomic, hydrogen, neutron and other varieties; they canalso be biological… anthrax, botulism, smallpox, mustard gas, the list isendless. What they have in common, is that they can kill millions of people in amatter of seconds. While the bombs are usually dropped from the sky on theirdesignated recipients with pinpoint accuracy, their delivery may vary. It mayeven be guided by a laser. The biological kind is more versatile. They can bedelivered in a bomb, distributed by the wind, in viruses and other microscopicpathogens that develop into a plague, in the drinking water, in food, medicationand other ingenious carriers. While the bombs explode with a mighty glare of thesun, obliterating everything in their path for hundreds of kilometres,biological weapons sneak up on their victims unexpectedly. You can die quickly,in a few seconds or you can suffer for days maybe even years before youeventually die a horrible painful death that seems to have no cure. The mostimpressive aspect of biological weapons is that there is no antidote for most ofthem. Just imagine the kinds of human minds who invented these as possiblesolutions to a problem, or as one of the options to choose from when planning aconflict situation. The long-term benefits of both kinds of weapons arelegendary. It is now known that many of the world's governments haveexperimented on humans with biological substances for over 60 years, in thepursuit of WOMDs development. All the global powers who were jostling forsupremacy were involved in some form of BW (biological warfare) experimentation.In their book entitled Plague Wars, Tom Mangold and Jeff Goldberg give us agruesome overview of the history of biological warfare. And while they subtlydraw our attention to some quotes from the Bible which may resemble biologicalwarfare, they may not have been aware how close to the truth they were. TheGermans were not the only ones who desecrated human rights in this regard. TheYanks performed tests on their own soldiers in Korea and in Vietnam, theRussians did similar things, but it is the Japanese who possibly have the mosthorrific record of keeping prisoners alive for months while performingunspeakable tests on them. Dr. Ishii was a Japanese monster in charge of a hugearmy of so-called doctors who performed thousands of gruesome experiments onprisoners during the 1930s. They had built several BW research facilitiesthroughout Manchuria, turning the whole region into a giant BW laboratory. About24 kilometres south of Harbin, was a complex of 76 buildings with labs,dormitories, greenhouses, barns for animals, and “special prisons for human testsubjects”. They would inject the people with every unthinkable toxin to studyits effect. They would let them stay alive, sometimes tied to their beds inexcruciating pain, to witness the developing effects of these toxins. They wouldamputate limbs and disembowel their victims who would scream in agony, sometimesonly dying much later. All in the name of science.In 1995 The New York Times ran an article which was a discussion between theircorrespondent and an ageing Japanese soldier who was present at one of thesedissections. A 30-year-old farmer was taken captive, tied to a bed and dissectedwithout an anaesthetic. This is what was written:“The fellow knew that it was over for him and so he did not struggle when theyled him into the room and tied him down. But when I picked up the scalpel,that's when he began screaming. I cut him open from the chest to the stomach andhe screamed terribly and his face was all twisted in agony. He made thisunimaginable sound, he was screaming so horribly. But then he finally stopped.This was all in a day's work for the surgeons…”This kind of behaviour can only be explained by our malfunctioning DNA. No othercreature, other than the human, is capable of such horrific acts against theirown kind. But we must have inherited this DNA from somewhere? Our fascinationwith biological weapons and man's suffering associated with it, goes backthousands of years. The Sumerian tablets carry gruesome details of how peopleperished from the “evil wind” which was caused by the gods' deadly weapons.The weapons that we are exposed to in science fiction movies amaze us, and yet,somewhere deep inside we believe that it could be possible. Maybe not today, butsometime in the future. Is the future already here? Do such incredible weaponsexist? How much do we really know about the latest technologies used by weaponsmanufacturers? There are many who claim that lasers and other new precisiontechnology weapons exist, which work with photons, ions, electrons andultra-high frequency radiation. Even ultra low frequency sound waves are nowwell developed as weapons and most likely well guarded as national secrets bytheir respective governments.So, where am I going with this? It is uncanny how similar the effects of modernweapons are when described verbally, to the many descriptions of annihilationand destruction referred to in the Bible. The similarities are too close forcomfort. If we were created by a more advanced human-like species with aknowledge of genetics some 200,000 years ago, it must surely mean that theywould also have had the knowledge of the kind of weapons that we have developedon Earth since then, as we evolved into our current state of consciousness. Andif we compare the wars and conflicts that are started on Earth today, often as aresult of minor misunderstandings or even a conscious demonstration of power byone leader over another, it is very easy to reason that the advanced gods ofpre-history used such technology to control and punish their creation in anattempt to keep them fearful and obedient. There are many passages in the Biblethat clearly point to such violent activity, which could only have beendelivered by WOMDs. Many of these biblical situations are virtually identical tosituations described in the Sumerian tablets in which the gods were eitherleading, guiding, observing, engaging, rewarding or punishing the people.A similar story, which we will expand on later, was depicted in the Biblesurrounding the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. All these violent acts weresupposedly performed by god against the sinful people on Earth. They seem tohave been attacked with biological weapons and possibly even nuclear weapons.But if you think that such references are restricted to the ancient biblicaldays, you are mistaken. The presence of the ‘god of vengeance’ is reported ingreat detail by William Bramley in his book Gods of Eden. Between 1347 and 1350,the whole of Europe and surrounding lands were struck down by the ‘Black Death’which arrived from Asia, supposedly carried by the fleas transferring it fromrats to humans. In those days little was known about the disease, but today weknow there were actually two kinds: Bubonic Plague and Pneumonic Plague.Today we have a bit more scientific information about these diseases and howthey spread. The plagues would return to Europe every ten to twenty years,killing many millions until the 1700s. It is estimated that over 100 millionpeople died from the Plague during that period. The people of the world hadnever experienced anything like this before. Or so they thought. It was like aplague from biblical days. Swelling of the lymph nodes, which were called‘buboes’, vomiting and fever, resulting in death within two days. Or, shivering,rapid breathing, coughing up blood, high fever, and death in three to four days.The strange circumstances surrounding the breakout of this disease has puzzledscientists for years. The required contact with rats has caused great confusion,as the disease would strike isolated communities miles apart, while sparingothers. There would be very little rodent activity and it would normally happenduring summer in areas that were not necessarily heavily overpopulated.According to Bramley, the outbreaks would usually occur after the appearance ofa “foul smelling mist” which went hand in hand with “seeing unusually brightlights in the sky”. These mists and lights were the most frequently reportedevents of those times, just before the plague suddenly descended on them. Itseems that these ‘lights and mists’ had more to do with the plagues thatfollowed than the large numbers of rats. Bramley continues with some staggeringinformation. One year before the first outbreak in Europe, a “column of fire”was reported over the Pope’s palace in Avignon, France. Another report from thatperiod talks about “a ball of fire” which was observed over Paris and remainedvisible to observers for some time.Is it possible that the ancient gods of Sumer and Egypt, who flew around intheir ‘sky chariots’ and ‘boats of heaven’ could still have been active asrecently as the 13th century? There is growing evidence to support such aridiculous idea. But historians call the ancient events “mythological” while themore recent ones were just “figments of people’s imagination”. How convenient.Once more our precious historians dismiss events which cannot be explained, onlyto replace them with a more popular version of their own truth, one which doesnot seem too ridiculous to the global populace. Is it possible that while theancient Anunnaki gods were trying to keep Humankind enslaved with religiousdogma, they were also attempting to reduce the growing numbers of their slavespecies, which would allow them to exercise greater control over humans? Itcertainly seems as if such crazy ideas may pack a punch after all.The people of those Dark Ages, were extremely superstitious, and the churchexercised immense control over what people did and what they thought and whatthey believed. Those were days of high comet activity, which is well documented,and comets were therefore also always associated with an impending plague ofsome sort. Between 1298 and 1314 there were seven large comets reported overEurope. But in those days the people would call every bright light in the sky acomet. In 1557, Conrad Lycosthenes published a book with one of the longesttitles ever.A chronicle of prodigies and portents that have occurred beyond the right order,operation and working of nature, in both the upper and lower regions of theearth, from the beginning of the world up to these present times.This was a bestseller of its time that talks about a “comet” that was seen overArabia in 1479. “A comet was seen in Arabia in the manner of a sharply pointedwooden beam…” This description certainly does not sound like a comet at all.Today it would most likely be called a UFO. But I have steered clear of UFO talkin this book, rather asserting that we have much closer historical links to thegods of the ancient world, who were described as flying in ‘sky ships’ and‘boats of heaven’. It does however seem that the dark ages of Humankind were aperiod of high UFO activity, whether we like to accept it or not. Similarreports from Asia also described the death and destruction which followedunusual aerial phenomena. This is a report by one Asian historian:“They were confused, exaggerated, frightening, as reports from that quarter ofthe world so often are: descriptions of storms and earthquakes; of meteors andcomets trailing noxious gases that killed trees and destroyed the fertility ofthe land.” (Bramley)The outbreak of plague was usually preceded by this kind of aerial activitywhich could range from a few minutes before the horror affected humans, to aslong as one year. Another report claims:“In 1117, in January, a comet passed like a fiery arm from the North towards theOrient… a year later a light appeared more brilliant than the sun… followed bygreat cold, famine and plague of which one third of humanity is said to haveperished.”(Bramley)This event refers to one third of the population in that specific region and notnecessarily the whole world. But to those people, it was the whole world. Thelink between comets and the Plague continued. There were 26 comets reportedbetween 1500 and 1543. A further 15 or 16 were observed between 1556 and 1597,while in 1618 another nine comets were observed. Does this not strike you asbeing highly suspicious at all? When last did you see a comet? Even if you didsee one recently, which is highly unlikely, since the last visible comet thatpassed Earth was comet Encke, in December 2003, which was hardly visible to thenaked eye. But these comets in the distant past were apparently seen by many,during the day as well as at night. They were not described as a distant fieryball with a long tail, but described more as a bright light hovering for all tosee.A report came out of Vienna describing events in 1568: “When in sun andmoonlight a beautiful rainbow and a fiery beam were seen hovering above thechurch of St Stephanie… followed by a violent epidemic in Austria, Swabia,Augsberg, Wuertemberg, Nuremburg and other places… carrying off human beings andcattle.”Each time these comets appeared, the people would be struck down with thePlague. In 1606, a comet caused the death of 37,000 in Prague, and 46 415 in theNetherlands. But the horror of the Plague was not only restricted to attackswith some kind of biological substance from the sky.Have you ever wondered where the classic image of ‘death’ being portrayed as askeleton demon carrying a scythe actually originated from? Other reports of“frightening human-like figures dressed in black” were also common sightsshortly before the Plague would strike. Appearing on the outskirts of towns andvillages, these figures normally entered the fields of wheat or oats with somesort of spraying device, distributing what must have been infectious poisons onthe crops. Bramley describes yet another such reported incident:“In Brandenburg there appeared in 1559 horrible men… fearful faces and longscythes with which they cut at the oats, so that the swish could be heard at agreat distance, but the oats remained standing.”The appearance of such “men” was followed by an immediate outbreak of the Plaguein Brandenburg, for example. The so-called scythes must have been a sprayingdevice of some sort, the kinds which we would spot a mile away on a modern farmtoday. I have personally spent days on my dad's farm, spraying for larvae with asimilar device. The reports did not stop there, more were reported from Hungaryas pointed out by Bramley.“There appeared so many black riders…but who rapidly disappeared again…andthereupon a raging plague broke out in the neighbourhood.”William Bramley points out that “the scythe came to symbolise the act of Deathmowing down people like stalks of grain.” And these reports of the Plague havebeen recorded from all over the world. In China in 1333 “after a terrible mistemitting a fearful stench and infecting the air.” If you ever smelt a burst gaspipe you would be able to relate to the stench. Poisonous gas or deadlybiological gaseous compounds do not smell pleasantly. They generally also have achoking effect on the victims. The reports make it clear that the deadly Plaguedid not spread from person to person, it afflicted everyone at the same time.How could it be the result of infected fleas on rats? This is a very dubious bitof disinformation, which begins to sound more and more as if the real facts havebeen withheld from us. Another event in China describes the situation as such:“During 1382… the air grew putrid… the plague did not pass from one man toanother, but everyone who was killed by it got it straight from the air.”I believe I've made my point. There are however many more examples, which wouldbegin to sound repetitive. The biological warfare hostilities against humanswhich we witnessed in the 20th century, showed us the gruesome effects of suchpoisons. It seems that while these kinds of event were taking place in the first600 years of the previous millennium, we have 4,500 year old Sumerian tabletsdescribing similar atrocities brought upon Humankind by the so-calledmythological gods of ancient times. Even the Bible has many descriptions ofplagues and pestilence being unleashed on the human race by the ‘god ofvengeance’. What a wonderful thread it is that holds it all together. So who isthis god of the Bible who has kept us so fearful for thousands of years? Onething is for sure, this god certainly puts his money where his mouth is, when heexecutes his violent threats against his ‘beloved’ human creation. There can beno mistake in our conclusion that the god of the Bible is not the God we allhoped he was. But rather a powerful, anxious, advanced being, whose ‘primitiveworker’ or slave species has grown out of control on this planet. The advancedbeings who the humans have come to worship as gods have mostly withdrawn fromEarth, as the conditions began to turn against them and they lost control overthe large numbers of humans being born. Their ‘little’ experiment to create the‘Adamu’ was an initial success, but it turned out to be the Great Human Tragedy.So much so, that some 4,050 years ago some of the Anunnaki gods attempted towipe out all of Humankind, with an all-out nuclear attack on all their mainsettlements. These events are dramatically recorded in the Bible, Genesis 18,during the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.Genesis 18: 23 -29 – God Destroys Sodom.“The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. Then the LORD rained onSodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the LORD out of heaven. And heoverthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of thecities, and what grew on the ground. But Lot's wife, behind him, looked back,and she became a pillar of salt. And Abraham went early in the morning to theplace where he had stood before the LORD. And he looked down toward Sodom andGomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, thesmoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace. So it was that, when Goddestroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out ofthe midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived.”It is evident from the Bible that god destroyed more than just the two cities,as it also talks about the rest of the valley. But the event is described evenmore vividly on clay tablets dated back to over 4,500 years and predating theBible by some 1,000 years. The graphic description in the ancient clay tabletsleave us with no doubt at all, that the god of the Bible was not our friend, norour saviour, but was most certainly our vicious and vengeful maker. It is in hisimage that we have been created and it is his violent DNA which we haveinherited.These are translations of Sumerian tablets by Zecharia Sitchin describing theevents on that fateful day when the gods decided to destroy the world andHumankind with it:“The evil thing to carry out Ninurta and Nergal were selected… The five citiesof the valley he finished off, to desolation they were overturned… steam to theheavens was rising… With fire and brimstone they were upheavaled, all that livedthere to vapour was turned… The horizon with darkness it obliterated… By adarkening of the skies were the brilliance followed, then a storm to blow began…Gloom from the skies an Evil Wind carried… Wherever it reached, death to allthat lived mercilessly it delivered… Like a ghost the fields and cities itattacked… No door could shut it out, no bolt could turn it back… In the streetswere their corpses piled up… Cough and phlegm the chests filled, the mouths withspittle and foam filled up… Their mouths were drenched with blood… The waterswere poisoned, all vegetation withered… Everything that lived behind it wasdead, people and cattle all alike perished.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12 [../Text/toc.html#chapter12]SLAVES AND SPIES [../Text/toc.html#chapter12a]Romans 6:22Slavery is a common theme in the Bible.“But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God…”2 Peter 2:19Is this an admission that man has been conned by the gods?“They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity for aman is a slave to whatever has mastered him.”‘The apple doesn't fall far from the tree’… ‘like father, like son’… are justtwo simple idioms which pretty much capture what actually happened to humanityin its ancient past. When attempting to trace back the well-hidden path to ourorigins, I stumbled upon numerous fascinating subjects that stopped me in mytracks quite unexpectedly. Subjects that required more scratching, moreinvestigation. Some of them are so common in our history and our daily lives,that we never give them a second thought, and they have manifested themselves ashuman habits and behavioural characteristics which have become entrenched in ourcultures and societies. Subjects like gold and jewellery came up and we had toscratch the surface to see why gold has been associated with humanity since thecradle, and how gold has so profoundly controlled many aspects of our evolution.We realise that while we take gold for granted today and we don't give it asecond thought, there must have been some event in the deep dark history ofhumanity that caused gold to gain such an elevated status and resulted in amultitude of socioeconomic spin-offs that are at the centre of our lives today.Like jewellery, currency, trade exchange, stock markets, fashion, and more. Thelittle bit of scratching that we do in this book has hopefully revealed some ofthe hidden secrets behind gold's relevance in our human history.You can try this yourself at home, I recommend it. Look at any of the habits oractivities you engage in and try to trace it back to its origin among humans onEarth. You will be amazed at how much you find out about Humankind and ourbehavioural patterns.One such fascinating subject which attracted my attention was the concept ofslavery. Just like gold, slavery seems to have been around since the dawn ofman. I will try to trace it back to its very start and point out why we are soentangled in such a barbaric act even today. Just think about it for a second.Where and when did man suddenly decide that he could own another person? Amoment in which one person elevated himself way above the other and proclaimedhis complete supremacy over the other. The concept of enslaving another personis arguably the most abhorrent act of humanity and the most barbaric display ofour true character which is indelibly programmed into our genome. It's as if wecould not really escape this kind of behaviour, as if we were predetermined tobehave in such a way. What is even more unbelievable, is that the god of the OldTestament does not seem to have a problem with slavery. In fact, on variousoccasions god actually instructs men on how to treat their slaves and how todish out punishment to disobedient slaves. In fact the whole idea of slavery wasembraced and accepted throughout the entire Bible, right to the end ofRevelations. There are over 130 references to ‘slaves’ in the Bible, here arejust a few of them to get you thinking about it:Genesis 21:10“…and she said to Abraham, ‘Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for thatslave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.’”Genesis 44:10“ …Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will befree from blame.”Exodus 3:7 - 10Clearly showing god's favouritism towards one group.The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I haveheard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned abouttheir suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of theEgyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, aland flowing with milk and honey – the home of the Canaanites, Hittites,Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. And now the cry of the Israeliteshas reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. Sonow, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out ofEgypt.”Exodus 21:20-21“ If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as adirect result, he must be punished, but he is not to be punished if the slavegets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property.”Leviticus 22:11Even priests were allowed to have slaves.“But if a priest buys a slave with money, or if a slave is born in hishousehold, that slave may eat his food.”Deuteronomy 24:7It was okay for others to be enslaved, but it was deemed to be 'evil' in theeyes of god, to enslave other Israelites.“If a man is caught kidnapping one of his brother Israelites and treats him as aslave or sells him, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from amongyou.”2 Samuel 6:20David seemingly liked to have some fun with his slave girls, which was notalways to the liking of others. Maybe she was just jealous.“When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul cameout to meet him and said, “How the king of Israel has distinguished himselftoday, disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgarfellow would!”1 Kings 14:10The repetitive sound of the god of vengeance and fear continues in these words:“Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I willcut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel - slave or free. I will burn upthe house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone.”Genesis 9:25Once more god condones the act of slavery.“Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers.”Exodus 9:20People prepared themselves against violent acts of god.“Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bringtheir slaves and their livestock inside. But those who ignored the word of theLORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.”Leviticus 25:44-45A very clear endorsement of slavery and enslaving other nations.“Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from themyou may buy slaves. You can will them to your children as inherited property andcan make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelitesruthlessly.”1 Samuel 8:17Warring, conquering and slavery were the order of the day under god's rule.“He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become hisslaves.”Ezra 9:9A perfect example how god cunningly turned mankind into obedient slaves byshowing them snippets of mercy and goodwill. This would have been a reference toCyrus the Great, who freed the Jews from Babylonia, and allowed them to go toJerusalem. But we must remember who Cyrus was. He was an Aryan Persian king whowas under the influence of the Anunnaki gods, manipulating humans into all kindsof submission.“Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shownus kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia: He has granted us new life torebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall ofprotection in Judah and Jerusalem.”Nehemiah 9:36God continued to enslave humans, making them grateful for small signs ofbenevolence. Promising reward for obedience and punishment for defiance.“But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our forefathers sothey could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces.”Esther 7:4God continues to oppress humans.“For I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter andannihilation. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would havekept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king.”Psalm 123:2And humans keep hoping to please the vengeful god while they waited for hisbenevolence. God's barbaric rule over humanity continues with false promises:“As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maidlook to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the LORD our God, till heshows us his mercy.”Jeremiah 34:9Even the Jews had Hebrew slaves.“Everyone was to free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was tohold a fellow Jew in bondage.”Zechariah 2:9The god of war sends his loyal human ‘slaves’ to plunder and kill others.“I will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunderthem. Then you will know that the LORD Almighty has sent me.”Matthew 20:26-28“Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be yourservant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave.”Acts 7:7God cunningly sets up his people to be forever grateful for his intervention.“But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,” God said, “and afterwardthey will come out of that country and worship me in this place.”Acts 7:9“Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave intoEgypt. But God was with him.”Revelation 6:15“Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty,and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of themountains.”Colossians 4:1God makes it clear that humans are his slaves.“Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know thatyou also have a Master in heaven.”1 Peter 2:18-21Here we have a disciple of Jesus justifying slavery, all because god will rewardthem for their suffering, they should accept their lot. He even suggests thatHumankind was made to be slaves. It shows the incredible hold this brutal godhad over Humankind. Constantly subjecting them to hardship and violence.“Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to thosewho are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh. For it iscommendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he isconscious of God… But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this iscommendable before God. To this you were called…”We can go back to the ancient wars and argue that the concept of slavery aroseout of situations where prisoners were taken and kept as slaves or sold asslaves. Alexander the Great would not only enslave the conquered armies, but hewould take entire towns, cities and even entire nations of mothers, fathers andchildren to be enslaved. If they were not kept by the conquering side, theywould be sold into slavery to some other king in exchange for gold or whateverthey might have agreed to be a fair price for such a valuable booty of humans.The mere thought of this kind of behaviour makes us physically ill today, andyet we forget that slavery only really reached its peak on Earth in the last 500years.There is evidence of slavery in Sumer right at the dawn of so-calledcivilisation. When we analyse the Sumerian word for ‘slave’, we find that ittranslates into ‘mountain man’ or ‘mountain girl’. This is a crucial bit ofevidence for my theory of a slave species. If man, ‘the Adamu’, was created as aslave to work the gold mines on Earth, he would have inherited much of hismaker’s DNA. This means that the very first things early humans had to deal withas a brand new species, were gold and slavery. This is what they were not onlyborn into, but intentionally ‘created’ to do. It stands to reason that if ourmaker had the genetic makeup to commit such acts, the offspring would mostcertainly display very similar characteristics. The offspring must surely be a‘chip off the old block’. And here we are, some 400,000 years later, displayingexactly the same kind of characteristics, completely oblivious to their origins.It is highly ironic that man was created and toiled in Africa from the beginningof time as a slave to the Anunnaki gods, but from the moment the newcivilisation emerged after the flood which ended the last ice-age, the so-calledcivilised and free human, did exactly as his Anunnaki ‘father’ did. He capturedslaves and started behaving exactly like his maker. Suddenly the two expressionsat the beginning of this chapter, ‘the apple doesn't fall far from the tree’ and‘like father, like son’ make so much more sense.Just picture the children in small isolated communities. They will inevitablygrow up to do one of the things their fathers or mothers did in the small remotevillage. They will absorb the local culture, they may weave, plant certaincrops, breed a certain farm animal, wash in a certain way, eat in a certain way,worship the same way and marry a partner (or more) according to their tradition.Any suggestion of doing things differently is seen as heresy to those who haveupheld those traditions for years. They are not aware of the other worldlypossibilities, and their frame of reference is restricted only to what they grewup with. To the western world this may sound a bit far-fetched , but let meassure you that this kind of activity permeates much of Africa, Asia, SouthAmerica, eastern Europe, the Middle and Near East. In fact, even in theso-called ‘very’ advanced societies like the USA, there are little villages andsmall towns which have upheld their traditions for centuries, completelyseparated from the rapid modernisation that has taken place around them.When the Anunnaki gods decided to help humans learn the skills of survival afterthe flood, not all humans were convinced that this was a good idea. Someprimitive humans most likely did not trust the brutal gods who had oppressedthem for so long, and therefore many of them remained in their mountainhideouts, too scared to enter the newly established settlements of people. Itmust have looked to them like a new version of the labour camps that persistedfor millennia around the gold mines. This is why the newborn civilisation didnot explode in large numbers of people, but was rather stimulated by itsacquisition of know-how virtually overnight. But the global gods eventuallyfound those hidden communities of rebellious slaves and imposed their control onthem in the most remote locations. This is all very clearly illustrated in theso-called mythologies of even the most remote tribes of the planet. They all hada similar relationship with the omnipresent gods. But as the new civilisedcommunities' needs for labour increased, they would do what came naturally tothem: go into the mountains or the neighbouring village and catch themselvessome slaves. After all, those ‘mountain men’ and ‘mountain girls’ were nowdeemed to be wild and primitive in their eyes: ‘Like father… like son’.But the irony does not end here. When humans adopted their new wisdom bysettling into communities, domesticating animals, planting crops and takingslaves captive in the mountains around them, where did they turn to for theirsupply of slaves next…? Africa. The cycle of life has now been fully completed.The newly civilised slave species returns to its place of birth to captureslaves for their own needs. Does that sound out of line to you? Well it shouldnot. The violent gene was strong in our DNA then, some 11,000 years ago, and itis still as strong as ever today, let there be no doubt about that. The greedgene is still firmly encoded in our DNA and a whole host of other genes thatdrive our violent, blood-thirsty behaviour. Slavery is what the human specieswas born into, and slavery is what we have known until today.The incredible thing is that virtually all ancient cultures in the world werepractising slavery at some stage, starting with the Sumerians and Egyptians.Then came Hammurabi, the priest king of Babylonia who lived around 2123 to 2181BC. This was a new breed of human king who showed distinct signs of mentalevolution in the lineage of human-species-leaders. In essence he was the firstgreat king who established the first metropolis on Earth, Babylonia. The Code ofLaw which he laid down in clay was one of the first recorded sets of laws inhuman history. Hammurabi displayed an uncanny feeling for human rights in theface of his own people's tradition in slavery. He detailed many laws pertainingto slaves. Slaves were allowed to own property, enter into business, and marryfree women. Formal release by the owner was permitted through eitherself-purchase or adoption. Nevertheless, even by this humanitarian code, theslaves were still considered as merchandise. The ‘Code of the Hittites’, whichwas applied in western Asia from 1800 to 1400 BC, was even more humane byconceding that a slave was a human being, although of an inferior order. Theancient Israelites experienced slavery in Egypt, while in the Indus Valley thefirst documented evidence of slavery coincides with the Aryan invasion of about2000 BC. Indian literature indicates that slavery was allowed throughout Indiafrom the 6th century BC to the beginning of the Christian era, but there is nodoubt that slavery was alive and well millennia before that. In ancient Persia,slaves were actually bred for supply purposes for the hungry slave markets.Persian victories in the Aegean islands of Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos resultedin the enslavement of entire populations. China's entire history is virtuallybuilt on a slave culture going all the way back to Huangdi, the ‘Yellow Emperor’and mystical ancestor of all Chinese, the Xia Dynasty, which started in the 21stcentury BC.But the first true slave society in history probably only emerged in ancientGreece between the 6th and 4th centuries BC. At the slave markets of Athens,Rhodes, Corinth, and Delos, a thousand slaves would change hands in anafternoon. Just imagine that kind of setup at the San Francisco harbour in 2004…the modern human mind would not be able to cope with such a desecration of humanrights. This must surely be a visible indication of humanity's general state ofmental and spiritual evolution. But things were different in Greece 500 yearsBC. After a major battle, as many as 20,000 captives would go on sale. Some saythat Aesop, the legendary story teller, was a freed Greek slave in the 6thcentury BC. Next in line was Rome, which became even more dependent upon slaveswhen a form of agricultural slavery called ‘estate slavery’ was introduced.After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, slavery persisted inArab lands and in central Europe. Many ‘Slavs’ were captured and taken as slavesto Germany where it seems they retained their derivative name from ‘Slave’. Atthis stage, slavery across the world was unstoppable and man's cruelty and greedreached unprecedented heights. From the very first day of civilisation, manpractised what he was taught by his maker: obsession with gold and keepingslaves.Slave-owning societies continued and included the Ottoman Empire, the Crimeankhanate, the Inca Empire in Peru, the Sokoto caliphate, and the Hausa ofNigeria. It extended to the central Asians such as the Mongols, Kazakhs, andvarious Turkic groups who also kept slaves. As unbelievable as it seems, slaverywas even practised by some native North American Indian people such as theComanche and the Creek. Even in Africa there was slavery among its own people.This is how firmly our genetic inheritance is entrenched from our maternaldonors, the seven original Anunnaki females who gave birth to the first group of‘slave species’, but we will find out more about them a little later. Africanchiefs would first sell off their prisoners to the slave traders from Europe.When these ran out, the chiefs would line up their own criminals and wrong-doersto be sold into slavery. When this was not enough, they would simply grab remoteand ignorant villages capturing all and sundry for the slave markets. I hopethat this is proof enough of the violent gene and greed gene embedded in ourDNA.I do however suspect that there will be many who still have a problem with thisconcept, so let me take it a bit further. Some men would even sell their wivesor children into slavery to pay off their own debts. This barbaric, geneticallyinherited behaviour reached its apex in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries whenan estimated 20 million slaves were captured in Africa and shipped around theworld to places like Brazil, Caribbean and North America, while trade withinAfrica itself continued. The first slaves to have been brought to South Africacame from Angola on board a Dutch ship called the Amersfoort in 1658, only sixyears after the first settlement by the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope. Andbecause I am South African, I have a particular interest in the slave history ofthis beautiful part of the world. So let's use this as a full chronologicalexample. The rest of the world's slave trade between the 15th and 17th centuriesevolved in similar ways. According to Mogamat Kamedien, these are the eventssurrounding the establishment of slavery in South Africa.FORMATION OFTHE DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY – THE VOC• 1602 : Chamber Representatives of the Netherlands Parliament grants a foundingcharter to the Dutch East India Company to establish an Indian trading empire inthe East.DUTCH COLONIAL SOUTH AFRICA• 1652: The Dutch East Indian Company started a refreshment station at the Capefor its VOC shipping fleet on their way to the East and/or on their return tripsfrom Batavia (present day Java as part of Indonesia). • 1658: The first shiploadof slaves are brought to the Cape, from Angola, on board the ship, theAmersfoort. • 1666: Slaves built the Castle Fort Good Hope. • 1679: Foundationsare laid for the Company Slave Lodge. • 1693: Slaves at the Cape outnumber freepeople for the first time.They are mainly from the Indian Ocean, Mozambique, Madagascar and Mauritius. •1717: VOC decides to retain the institution of slavery as the main labour systemfor the Cape. • 1725: Evidence exists that runaway slaves had been living at themountainous Hangklip for extensive periods, between Gordon's Bay andKleinmond/Hermanus. • 1754: The governor, Tulbagh, consolidated the numerous VOCslave regulations into a single placaaten, the Cape Slave Code. • 1754: A censustaken of the Cape colony at the time showed the two populations, both slaves andsettlers, to be roughly equal to about 6,000 each.1st BRITISH OCCUPATION• 1795: The British take over control of the Cape and remain in chargethroughout the 19th century. • 1796: The British outlaw torture and some of themost brutal forms of capital punishments.2nd DUTCH RE-OCCUPATION: THE BATAVIAN REPUBLIC• 1803: The Dutch temporarily re-occupy the Cape of Good Hope for a shortthree-year stay.2nd BRITISH OCCUPATION: BRITISH SOUTH AFRICA• 1806: Company slaves are released from the Slave Lodge under rule of the thenGovernor, the Earl of Caledon. • 1807: The British outlaw the Trans-Indian Oceanslave trade. It was now illegal to be a slave trader buying or selling slaves,but it was still legal to own slaves. Prohibition on the importation of overseasslaves resulted in the increase of exchange value of Cape born Creole slaves.1st SLAVE REBELLION• 1808: The Koeberg Slave Rebellion in the Swartland near Malmesbury, led byLouis of Mauritius, is defeated at Salt River. Resulted in the capturing of 300farm slaves as dissidents. • 1813: Het Gesticht, the fourth oldest churchbuilding in South Africa is erected in 1813 by the inhabitants of Paarl as ameeting house for non-Christian slaves and ‘heathens’ in the town. • 1823: TheBritish House of Commons discuss the conditions of slaves at the Cape of GoodHope. A commission of enquiry is appointed due to relentless pressure of theAnti-Slavery Abolitionists lobby.2nd SLAVE REBELLION• 1825: A second slave uprising at the farm, Hou-den-Bek, led by Galant van dieKaap, is defeated in the Koue Bokkeveld, near Ceres. • 1826: Collapse of theCape wine industry.SLAVE AMELIORISATION LAWS• 1826: The Colonial Office intervened by forcing local colonial assemblies tobring the local amelioration legislation into effect through Ordinance 19 of1826 promulgated at the Cape. This was in line with the Trinidad Order, aimed atthe sugar plantation slave owners. Thus the British introduced ameliorisationlaws in order to improve the living conditions of slaves as well as a series ofpractical ameliorisation measures to make punishments less cruel; and the Officeof the Protector of Slaves is established with Assistant Slave Protectors inrural towns and villages away from Cape Town. • 1826: Appointment of theGuardian of the Slaves. • 1827: Coloured Persons qualified for the municipalfranchise of Cape Town, and a Malay property owner was elected as Wardmaster. •1828: Ordinance 50 of 1828 liberated the Khoisan into the category on par withFree Blacks and placed all Free Black persons i.e. both Hottentots and VryeSwartes on equal legal footing with white colonists within the judiciary system.• 1830: Revised provisions of Ordinance 19 by the British Parliament resulted inthe renamed Office of the Protector of Slaves. • 1830: Slave owners ordered tokeep records of slave punishments. • 1831: Stellenbosch slave owners rioted byrefusing to accept the order to keep registers of slave punishments. • 1832:More than 2,000 slave owners assembled in Cape Town to hold a protest meetingdemonstrating against this government order, which was adopted without properconsultation.SLAVE EMANCIPATION• 1834: Slavery is abolished in British colonies on 1 December. ‘Liberated’slaves now fall into the category of Free Blacks, although the ‘freed’ slavesare forced to serve an extended four-year apprenticeship to make them “fit forfreedom”. • 1835: Ordinance No. 1 of 1835 introduced the terms of apprenticeshipat the Cape, including the appointment of special magistrates. • 1836: Start ofthe Great Trek by 12,000 frontier farmers (Voortrekkers), who demonstrated theirunhappiness about the government's policy to release slaves from the control ofFree Burghers as slaveholders. • 1836: Non-whites were finally accorded similartreatment to white colonists in their interaction with the public institutionsof the local authorities.END OF SLAVE APPRENTICESHIP PERIOD• 1838: End of all slave apprenticeships.• 1838: About 39,000 slaves are freed on Emancipation Day,1 December in 1838. Only 1.2 million pounds was paid out against the originalestimated compensation amount of three million pounds which was initially setaside by the British government as compensation monies for the about 1,300affected slaveholding farmers at the Cape of Good Hope.CAPE ‘MASTERS & SERVANTS’ LABOUR LEGISLATION• 1841: The Masters and Servants Ordinance was promulgated regulating andcriminalising labour relationships between employer and employee in favour ofthe former slave masters based on the past Cape Slave Codes originally issued bythe VOC as ‘Placaaten of India’.By the 17th century the slave trade was regarded an ‘honourable and noble’business in Europe through which many companies generated immense wealth andcaused untold misery. As the inhumane elements of this trade started to beexposed by small groups of liberals in the 18th century, many of the so-calledhonourable businessmen fought their accusations with all their wealth andinfluence. By the end of the 19thcentury, one by one, the guilty culprits signedvarious ‘abolition of slavery acts’ under pressure from enlightened activists.Argentina 1813; Colombia 1821; Mexico 1829; South Africa 1834; USA 1865 just tomention a few. It was however only in 1948, when the United Nations released the‘Proclamation of Human Rights Declaration’, which in essence prohibited slaveryworldwide. But the United Nations left a huge loophole in the previousdeclaration, which took another eight years to rectify. They were forced to adda further declaration which dealt with “slave trade and institutions similar toslavery”. To most people today this bit of information will come as a horrificshock: how is it possible that slavery was only officially prohibited in 1956 bythe so-called ‘free and civilised’ world? Let me remind you of an earliersentiment which suggests that “if we don't know where we come from, how can wepossibly know where we are going?” For as long as people keep their eyes closedto new evidence and their minds poisoned against new possibilities, we willcontinue to propagate the ‘slave species’ characteristics which our maker sosuccessfully implanted in us. We were created as a slave species and to this daywe remain a slave species, held captive by our ignorance, lack of clarity aboutour human origins and the stunted genome with which our maker has endowed us.Even after the 1956 UN proclamation, the inhumane trade in people did not stop.11,000 years since the emergence of civilised man nothing has really changed.Saudi Arabia only signed the ‘abolition of slavery act’ in 1963 and Mauritaniain 1980. Is it not incredibly ironic that it is once again in Africa, the cradleof man, the birthplace of slavery on Earth, that we find the last place to letgo of this abhorrent custom? Slavery is so deeply and firmly rooted in theAfrican ancestry, that it seemingly cannot be escaped. But slavery is stillalive and well in the 21st century. It seems that certain parts of our DNA havenot evolved at all. In 1988 slaves were sold in Sudan for 30 pounds, and in 1989China launched a national campaign against the trade in ‘women and children’slaves. The effort uncovered 9,000 cases of slavery in that year alone. My guessis that this was only the tip of the iceberg in China.In this technologically advanced global village where every sensational event isreported by global networks within seconds; where communication has becomechild’s play; where we look at Mars rovers with a certain amount of impatiencebecause we want them to do more stuff, and do it quicker... how free are wereally? We spoke about economic warfare in earlier chapters, but it should alsobe referred to as ‘economic slavery’. This applies to individuals as well aspoor countries. In this case the conquering armies do not take prisoners asslaves, they simply enslave the entire country economically. The totalindebtedness of poor countries to wealthy countries is so incredibly vast, thatit most likely can never be repaid. The strange thing is, that most of the poorcountries of the world are those who were raped for slaves by the West forcenturies. This rape of many nations understandably resulted in the completecollapse of such countries, that all eventually had to ask for assistance fromthe aggressor. What a conniving and calculating bunch of ‘civilised’ humans weare.Today, the slavery principal continues under this economic banner extremelysuccessfully. The poor countries are exploited for cheap labour, they become thedumping grounds of global unwanted produce, deadly unwanted chemicals andnuclear waste, basically continuing to be enslaved on virtually every level;even their terra firma has become enslaved. Their currencies remain weak, theirpeople remain poor and they have no choice but to allow the bullies to abusethem. But the abuse does not always come from outside the borders. The slaveryproblems in China are potentially nothing to what is brewing right next door inIndia. The highly discriminating class system called ‘caste’, which originatesfrom the Portuguese casta, meaning breed, race or kind, is still widelypractised throughout India. Although this form of discrimination is officiallyprohibited, it is alive and well, serving as a legitimate cultural form ofslavery, which holds close to half the population of one billion Indiansenslaved in poverty and misery, with virtually no way out. Once you areclassified as a Dalit or ‘untouchable’ your lot has been determined for life. Itis virtually impossible to elevate yourself to one of the four higherclassifications which may make your life more bearable. There are approximately200 million ‘untouchable’ Dalits in India today. They may not marry anyone froma higher class, they may not use the same amenities as others, they must at alltimes be invisible to the higher castes, getting out of their way so that noteven their shadows may touch in passing. In some situations, towns and villageswill insist that Dalits carry a bell to warn any other higher castes of theirapproaching ‘vile’ presence.So how free are we really? You may think that because you live in a First Worldeconomy you are okay, that you are the master of your own destiny and that youare nobody’s slave. Well, think again. The successful westerners are slaves totheir jobs; their boss; their mortgage bond; an array of credit cards; car loan;overdraft and other significant entrapments of society. The modern economies arestructured to attract as many consumers as possible, with the promise of somesort of credit. Even your student loan can enslave you for years. Once you arehooked, the onus is squarely on your shoulders to pay the creditor withoutdefault. You may tell everyone that “this is your new home”, but the reality isthat it actually belongs to the bank. They just allow you to work your backsideoff for 20 years, paying them a large sum every month, making nauseating amountsof interest from you in the process. So who is the slave? If you cannot pay,they auction your home at market value, in many cases still leaving you with alarge debt to cover. Now that you are really deeply in trouble, they blacklistyou, which dramatically reduces your chances for employment, of keeping a bankaccount, and making back the money which you owe them. The credit card is thesame. You pay for your Caribbean trip with your card, feeling very fulfilled.Upon your return, you realise that your company has gone insolvent and the cardbecomes an instant trap. You have to sell your car to pay off the card and nowyou can't get around to launch your new business. The worst and most clandestineform of slavery is the good old student loan. Thousands of companies will giveyou a student loan with the condition that you work for them to pay it off aftergraduation. The snag is that they decide on your measly salary as an apprentice,which means that you have to work for them for years while earning very little,essentially becoming extremely cheap labour. This happens year in, year out,around the world to millions of graduates. Basically, our lives revolve aroundwork and money. We behave like confused slaves on this planet, not knowing wherewe are going… why we are here… and who is really in control? Why are we chasingthese castles in the sky? Is there a hidden message here? Could this possibly bea hangover from prehistory, when early man was promised a trip up to god’scastle in the sky… and to live in the house of the maker, but only if heperformed valiantly and pleased his master? Really… why are we so caught up inthis chase for materialistic rewards, if we know that we can't take it with us?The answer is simple. We are still slaves living in the 21st century, but ourpath to this point in time has been so meticulously planned by the ‘gods’ of ourprehistory, that we could never expect to recognise the clues or symptoms. Ourarrogance prevents us from even believing such wild and extravagant theoriesbecause “we are the masters of ourown destinies”.Our entire history is riddled with temptation from a variety of sources. Frombiblical promises of heavenly wealth and eternal life, to the Sumerian tabletsoutlining the promises of great reward in the houses of the gods. But only ifyou behaved, obeyed and performed the tasks that were assigned to you. Is thisthe seed which has driven man to toil and perform for ever? Is it a hangoverreflex response from days gone by, when the Anunnaki gods were still on Earth?It certainly smacks of something which eludes us to this day. After all, we arethe slave species and so we shall behave. All that has happened in the past fewthousand years, is that we confused the reason with motive, which has resultedin the continuous frantic chase for material stuff. We want to accumulate andhoard. There is so much baggage and disinformation piled up in our humansubconscious, that we cannot possibly begin to unravel it without huge amountsof investigation and especially introspection. Because the messages we arediscovering from our distant ancestors are not the fairytales we expected tohear.The people of the ‘free’ western world are enslaved economically, culturally andreligiously. But if you ask them, they will deny it. We are enslaved to ourjobs, our banks and our governments. If you don't pay your tax, you will go tojail. This blissful ignorance is exactly what the ‘maker’ had planned. The Towerof Babel incident was a wonderful example of how the gods conspired to keephumanity enslaved through their ignorance. The Sumerian scriptures make similarreferences to the incident as is described in the Bible, where the gods haddecided that man had grown too wise and was speaking one ‘language’. The use ofthe word ‘language’ could be metaphorical for knowledge. The gods felt that ifthey left man to his own devices, he would be capable of anything. This posed abig threat to the gods, when suddenly Humankind displayed the potential to standup against their maker and oppressor. At that point the gods decided to “go downfrom their heavenly abode and confuse their language”, which they did. It is notexactly clear what they did to humans, but it certainly extended the slavementality for millennia. What is very interesting however, is that Genesis 10ends with the sons and descendants of Noah, scattering around the world,belonging to different clans and speaking different languages. Then suddenly,Genesis 11 starts with the following statements.Genesis 11: 1 -9. The Tower of Babel:“Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As men movedeastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. They said to eachother, ‘Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly.’ They used brickinstead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, ‘Come, let us buildourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may makea name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.’ Butthe LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building. TheLORD said, ‘If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to dothis, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us godown and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.’ So theLORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building thecity. That is why it was called Babel, because there the LORD confused thelanguage of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face ofthe whole earth.”This entire passage smacks of a ‘master-slave’ relationship. This is virtually acopy of the Sumerian tablets where the gods were also very unhappy that theslaves were making rapid progress, gaining knowledge and showing signs of higherintelligence. It's fairly plain to read between the lines that ‘god the master’panicked and took the necessary steps to prevent people from gaining skills andknowledge. The principle of ‘divide and conquer’ was implemented verysuccessfully among the emerging human threat. The simple fact that the sons ofthe gods were having children with the daughters of man was a huge problem. The‘new human offspring’ were even more intelligent than their human mothers,because they had more of the gods’ DNA which allowed them to achieve more andevolve quicker.Genesis 6:1-4:\"When men began to increase on earth and daughters were born to them, the divinebeings saw how beautiful the daughters of men were and took wives from amongthose that pleased them. The LORD said, ‘My breath shall not abide in manforever, since he too is flesh; let the days allowed him be one hundred andtwenty years.’ It was then, and later too, that the Nephilim appeared on earth -when the divine beings cohabited with the daughters of men, who bore themoffspring. They were the heroes of old, the men of renown.\"There is no doubt that the fathers who were the sons of the gods alsocontributed to the technological know-how of their children. We can deduce fromthis kind of activity on Earth, that man's evolution was speeded up rapidly,which went against the explicit wishes of the ruling gods. They wanted to keep‘man’ stupid. So, it is of particular interest that in Genesis 6 verse 7, godsuddenly became ‘plural’ and plans to go down with some of his associates tosort out this problem. “Come let us go down and confuse their language.”Who was god talking to and who went down with him? And why would god lookunfavourably on human technological progress? Why would god not want his specialcreation, man, to be able to do ‘other’ things. Why would god be so freaked outwith man's rapid advancement?The Tower of Babel incident was preceded by an earlier attempt to get rid ofhumans because they were already posing a prior threat to the gods. Once againthis indicates an ultimate act of oppression which outlined the control that thegods maintained over the slave species while plotting their complete demise. Forsome reason the gods decided that their creation ‘man’ was evil and that all heknew was evil; that's pretty much how the Bible puts it. I sense that the godshad had enough of the humans and realised that they had created a ‘monster’which could rise up and bite them. The Sumerian tablets tell the story of animpending tidal wave that would destroy most of humanity, especially those wholived near the coastal areas. In December 2004, we saw how easily 300,000 peopledied from a relatively small Tsunami in large parts of the world. Imagine what a100-metre high tidal wave could do to the world. But the Anunnaki already knewof such a giant wave which would sweep the Earth as a result of their planetNibiru coming back into close proximity to the world. So they decided that theywould allow this wave to destroy humanity and in one fell swoop help them totake care of their growing human problem. It is estimated that there were fourmillion of the slave species on Earth by this stage, far outnumbering the gods.This made the gods very nervous, so they would allow the slaves whom theycreated, to be destroyed because their behaviour was showing signs ofuncontrollable intelligence.Did the slaves start asking too many questions? Did they start evolving tooquickly and were they absorbing advanced technical knowledge without the gods’permission? It certainly seems that way. By now you must have figured out that Iam of the opinion that the Bible cannot be trusted, no matter how emotional weget about it. It is surrounded with so much controversy and there is no absoluteproof who the real authors were, and under what influence they wrote thosebrutal descriptions of events of their times. Furthermore, because most of theOld Testament is a diluted version of Sumerian tablets and other ancient texts,it is therefore a paradox in itself that I am using the Bible as a major sourceof reference. This, my friends, is purely to demonstrate the inconsistency andfanatical obsession bestowed on this book by those who so dearly worship it. Bythe time we reach the story of the biblical flood, I would like to reason thatthe Anunnaki gods did not count on the rapid evolution of the human brain, whichis why the gods wanted the growing number of humans to be destroyed in theflood. In short, the human slaves were suddenly a potential threat to the gods.But one of the two leading gods, Enki, was much closer to the humans than hiscold-hearted brother Enlil. Because Enki had worked with the human slaves in theAfrican mines for millennia, he took pity on the humans and warned Ziusudra(Noah) of the impending disaster. He gave him strict instructions on what to do,to save his friends and family and his livestock. It turns out that this was notjust a random gesture of mercy, but Ziusudra was actually Enki's son with anEarthling female. This was the real motive behind his actions.The Bible puts it slightly differently. “God saw that everything man did wasevil.” Suddenly all the people on Earth were 'vile and evil' and god decided topunish them. Is it possible that the story recorded in the Bible came from anopposing point of view, from Enki's brother Enlil, who was in command of theplanet and its people? Enlil never really liked the slave species and thisprovided him with a perfect opportunity to destroy them.What could all the people on Earth have possibly done that was so vile and evil,to have enraged god so much, that he plotted to destroy all of them? Thefascinating thing is that the flood story has been told in most of the ancientcultures which pre-date the biblical story of Noah. So which one of them is moreaccurate and factual? My guess is that it should be the oldest one. This shouldmake the Sumerian flood story about Enki and Enlil and Ziusudra the mostcredible story. And this is where the plot thickens even further. The sons ofthe Anunnaki gods, who were also referred to as the Nefilim, were prohibitedfrom having intercourse with the human females for fear of creating a newsubspecies, which would be more intelligent, and a potential threat to theAnunnaki. We have heard about them before, even in the Bible. But the sons ofthe gods were young and restless on Earth, showing the usual signs of rebelliousyouth. They obviously disobeyed the instructions, especially when they saw howsexual the daughters of man were. Both the Sumerian scripts and the Bible tellus explicitly what happened next. ‘God’ decided to pull the ultimate act ofsupremacy over his disobedient slave species, which was to destroy all of them.This would allow him to clear the slate and start again with no loose ends andespecially no disobedient and nosey humans. This is how the Bible describes it:Genesis 6:4-18. The Flood:“The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward when the sonsof God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were theheroes of old, men of renown. The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on theearth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart wasonly evil all the time. The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth,and his heart was filled with pain. So the LORD said, ‘I will wipe mankind, whomI have created, from the face of the earth…’But Noah found favour in the eyes of the LORD .This is the account of Noah:Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walkedwith God. Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. Now the earth was corruptin God's sight and was full of violence. God saw how corrupt the earth hadbecome, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. So God said toNoah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled withviolence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth…I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under theheavens… Everything on earth will perish. But I will establish my covenant withyou…’”Now there is a wonderfully ironic example of favouritism by the all-loving‘god’, who made ‘all’ people equal. Suddenly Noah was his favourite one, and theonly kosher guy on the face of the Earth. This is a little too rich for me…there must have been some other motive and the motive I place before you makesmuch more sense that any others I have read. That is especially in light of theinconsistency in the story when viewed from the two brother-gods’ point of view,which presents us with a juicy bit of circumstantial evidence as to what exactlymay have happened. We had two distinct personalities in Enlil and Enki withopposing views on the slave species. Enki wanted to save man, therefore hewarned Noah (Ziusudra), who also happened to be his earthling son, but he warnedmore than just Noah. Therefore the biblical entry which proclaims Noah to be theonly righteous man on Earth makes no sense. This is where it gets reallyinteresting, because it feels as if this part of the biblical story was writtenonly after the event of the flood, from the perspective of Enlil, who suddenlyrealised that he had failed in his quest to wipe out the human race. Thisfailure to dispose of the troublesome human population forced Enlil to alter hisentire story, hiding the fact that he had failed. It really feels like a lot ofsour grapes to me and the entries in the Bible were written so as to hide thefact that god had failed in destroying the vile and evil humans, but instead hefound one ‘righteous’ man among them to take pity on. After the flood, Enki tookhumans under his wing and started to teach them all the necessities of acivilised community, at which point we witness the emergence of sudden globalcivilisation around 11,000 BC. But their rapid evolution scared Enlil,especially when the humans built the tower of Babel in an attempt to reach theirgods in the sky. So, it was probably the spiteful Enlil who destroyed the towerand caused them to scatter over the world in another attempt to slow down theirprogress. They were after all, his creation, his slaves and he could do withthem as he pleased. It may come as a surprise to learn that there are literallyhundreds of ‘Flood Stories’ in early human history.SUMERIAN FLOOD STORY[../Images/230-1.jpg] Neo-Sumerian on clay, this is mankind's oldest referenceto the Deluge, together with a tablet in Philadelphia, the only other tabletbearing this story in Sumerian. In this transcript Ziusudra, the Sumerian Noah,is described as “the priest of Enki”, which is new information. Other tabletsoutline that he is actually the son of Enki.The Sumerian flood story is the oldest forerunner to the Biblical account of theflood. (Genesis 6:5-9:29) According to the British Museum, their‘Neo-Babylonian’ tablet with the Flood story as a part of the ‘Epic ofGilgamesh’, is the most famous tablet in the world. The tablet shown here isover 1,000 years older than the one in the British Museum.ENLIL DECIDES TO DESTROY Humankind WITH A FLOOD[../Images/231-1.jpg] The Atra-Hasis epic is the Babylonian flood story writtenin Old Babylonian on clay in Babylonia circa 1900 BC in cuneiform script. Whenthe Neo-Babylonian account of the flood story as part of the ‘Gilgamesh Epic’was discovered in the 19 th century, it caused a sensation. It turned out thatthis was an abbreviated account extracted from the Old Babylonian Atra-Hasisepic, written some 1,000 years earlier. The flood is the climax of the wholestory in which the gods created the human race to take over the hard labour onEarth. They were created with the power to reproduce, but were condemned to dieas a result of age. The human race multiplied and made such a noise that thechief Sumerian god, Enlil, could not sleep. He therefore plotted to reduce theirnumbers, first by plague, then by famine. In each case the god Ea (Enki), whowas mainly responsible for creating the human race, frustrated the plan. Enlilthen got all the gods to swear to co-operate in exterminating the whole humanrace in an impending flood. This failed because Enki saved his favourite,Ziusudra, by allowing him to build an ark and so save the human race and theanimals. This tablet starts after the famine attempt by the gods had justfailed, Enlil plotted against Humankind and came up with another plan.Partial tablet translation:“…THEY BROKE THE COSMIC BARRIER! - THE FLOOD WHICH YOU MENTIONED, WHOSE IS IT? -THE GODS COMMANDED TOTAL DESTRUCTION! ENLIL DID AN EVIL DEED ON THE PEOPLE! THEYCOMMANDED IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THE GODS, BRINGING A FLOOD FOR A LATER DAY, ‘LET USDO THE DEED!’ ATRA-HASIS…”This is a good time to take a look at some of the other flood stories fromaround the world, to see the incredible similarities in these stories which werewritten on different continents, thousands of miles apart, by ‘primitive’people, hundreds of years apart. Does that not ring very loud alarm bells withyou? Mark Isaak has compiled an incredible collection of these stories atwww.talkorigins.org and I would urge you to see his website for trulycaptivating reading. Here are a few excerpts:Greek:“Zeus sent a flood to destroy the men of the Bronze Age. Prometheus advised hisson Deucalion to build a chest. All other men perished except for a few whoescaped to high mountains. When the rains ceased, he sacrificed to Zeus, the Godof Escape. An older version of the story told by Hellanicus has Deucalion's arklanding on Mount Othrys in Thessaly. Another account has him landing on a peak,probably Phouka, in Argolis, later called Nemea.”“The Megarians told that Megarus, son of Zeus, escaped Deucalion's flood byswimming to the top of Mount Gerania, guided by the cries of cranes.”“An earlier flood was reported to have occurred in the time of Ogyges, founderand king of Thebes. The flood covered the whole world and was so devastatingthat the country remained without kings until the reign of Cecrops.”Roman:“Jupiter, angered at the evil ways of humanity, resolved to destroy it. He wasabout to set the earth to burning, but considered that that might set heavenitself afire, so he decided to flood the earth instead. With Neptune's help, hecaused storm and earthquake to flood everything but the summit of Parnassus,where Deucalion and his wife Pyrrha came by boat and found refuge. Recognizingtheir piety, Jupiter let them live and withdrew the flood. Deucalion and Pyrrha,at the advice of an oracle, repopulated the world by throwing ‘your mother'sbones’ (stones) behind them; each stone became a person.”Scandinavian:“Oden, Vili, and Ve fought and slew the great ice giant Ymir, and icy water fromhis wounds drowned most of the Rime Giants. The giant Bergelmir escaped, withhis wife and children, on a boat. Ymir's body became the world we live on.”Celtic:“Heaven and Earth were great giants, and Heaven lay upon the Earth so that theirchildren were crowded between them, and the children and their mother wereunhappy in the darkness. The boldest of the sons led his brothers in cutting upHeaven into many pieces. From his skull they made the firmament. His spillingblood caused a great flood which killed all humans except a single pair, whowere saved in a ship made by a beneficent Titan.”Welsh:“The lake of Llion burst, flooding all lands. Dwyfan and Dwyfach escaped in amastless ship with pairs of every sort of living creature. They landed inPrydain (Britain) and repopulated the world.”There are many more flood stories such as Lithuanian, German, Turkish, Vogul,Egyptian and Persian. Even the Koran (11:25-48) refers to the flood, adding thatthe Earth swallowed the water, and the boat came to rest on a mountain calledAl-Judi, and one of Noah's disbelieving sons drowned in the flood.An apocryphal scripture tells us how Adam instructed that his body, togetherwith gold, incense, and myrrh, should be taken aboard the Ark and, after theflood, should be laid in the middle of the Earth. God would come from thence andsave mankind (Platt, p. 66, 80 and 2 Adam 8:9-18, 21:7-11). Here we are reallymixing the history of Humankind. Wasn't Adam dead by then? How would he knowthat a flood was looming to give such instructions? How sure are we of thesefacts?The Babylonian tale is virtually identical to the Sumerian story and even theChaldean story is filled with Sumerian influence. Remember that the SumerianNoah was called Ziusudra:“The god Chronos in a vision warned Xisuthrus of a coming flood, ordered him towrite a history and bury it in Sippara, and told him to build and provision avessel (5 stadia by 2 stadia) for himself, his friends and relations, and allkinds of animals, all of which he did. After the flood had come and abatedsomewhat, he sent out some birds, which returned. Later, he tried again, and thebirds returned with mud on their feet. On the third trial, the birds didn'treturn. He disembarked in the Corcyraean mountains in Armenia and, with hiswife, daughter, and pilot, offered sacrifices to the gods.”The Zoroastrian story:“After Ahura Mazda has warned Yima that destruction in the form of winter,frost, and floods, subsequent to the melting of the snow, are threatening thesinful world, he proceeds to instruct him to build a vara, ‘fortress or estate’,in which specimens of small and large cattle, human beings, dogs, birds, redflaming fires, plants and foodstuffs will have to be deposited in pairs.”(Dresden, p. 344)What all these stories really point to is a time and place when the gods ofHeaven and Earth conspired to wipe out all of humanity. Why? Because they wereshowing signs of independence, intelligence and possible rebellion against theirmakers. I have presented you with their motives which have been expanded on bymany scholars in numerous studies of the Sumerian tablets and other ancientscriptures. But there is one story in the Bible which in my humble opinionsupersedes all the others in presenting evidence of god’s manipulation ofhumanity. This is the story of Abraham, his son Isaac and Sodom and Gomorrah. Itreads like a plot from a Hollywood mafia movie, where certain people are set upto have their loyalty tested, before they can be trusted by the ‘godfather’ toperform certain acts which are not necessarily always kosher. Ask any writer andthey will confirm that the plot laid out in this particular story of the Biblehas the perfect structure for a screen play, which includes a ‘good-cop-bad-cop’situation, planting seeds of suspicion and distrust, while demanding absoluteloyalty: a code of silence and obedience. These events are perfect examples of a‘master-slave’ relationship, with a constant undertone of possible violence tobe inflicted on the slave if he should step out of line. It has perfectlycrafted moments of transparent leniency and hints of empty compassion towardsthe slaves who are perpetually filled with mortal fear.It all starts with the ‘god-master’ setting up his slave for personal conflictby evicting his mistress. The slave is Abraham, the mistress is Hagar. Abraham’swife Sarah supports this move as Hagar is a real threat to her because Hagar hadgiven birth to a son of Abraham, who will become a competitor to her own son intime to come. But the clever twist lies in that the god-master tells Abraham toevict Hagar personally. By doing this, the master tests his slave’s loyalty andhe drives a wedge between him and the mistress. No sooner has Hagar been left todie in the unforgiving desert, than the god-master comes to the rescue of theevicted young slave girl and her newborn son, winning her undivided loyalty,spreading the word of the loving, benevolent god.Genesis 21: 8 -21. Hagar and Ishmael Sent Away:“The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held agreat feast. But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne toAbraham was mocking, and she said to Abraham, ‘Get rid of that slave woman andher son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with myson Isaac.’ The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.But God said to him, ‘Do not be so distressed about the boy and yourmaidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaacthat your offspring will be reckoned. I will make the son of the maidservantinto a nation also, because he is your offspring.’ Early the next morningAbraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set themon her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way andwandered in the desert of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was gone, sheput the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went off and sat down nearby,about a bowshot away, for she thought, ‘I cannot watch the boy die.’ And as shesat there nearby, she began to sob. God heard the boy crying, and the angel ofGod called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, ‘What is the matter, Hagar? Donot be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. Lift the boy upand take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.’ Then Godopened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skinwith water and gave the boy a drink. God was with the boy as he grew up. Helived in the desert and became an archer. While he was living in the Desert ofParan, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.”This clever manipulation showed the gods that Abraham was extremely loyal andtrustworthy of performing future tasks. It also made Hagar eternally indebted togod for saving her and her son’s lives. But what future tasks do the gods havein mind for Abraham you might ask? Possibly the earliest recorded examples ofespionage in human history. This was however not enough of a test of obediencefor the future top spy of the gods. Before they could entrust Abraham with afull army of well equipped men, chariots, advanced weapons, large stretches ofland and wealth beyond belief, they had to devise a test of ultimate obedience,which they did. The story is famous even outside of Judeo-Christian circles.Abraham is ordered by god to take his son Isaac onto a distant mountain andsacrifice him to the gods. Their premeditated maliciousness is evident in thatthey told Abraham to ‘go to a distant mountain’, where they would be alone, sothat nobody would witness the brutal event as well as a premeditated murder. Whoknows, something may have gone wrong and Abraham may have killed Isaac on themountain that day. It was better that there were no witnesses around, orconfused relatives, to add to the growing discontent among the humans towardsthe gods. Abraham passed the test with flying colours. He was now ready toperform any task for the conniving gods. From this moment on, the gods made surethat everyone knew about their favourite boy, Abraham. Many tribal heads, kingsand even priests came to seek his favour, and in truth suck up to him to avoidany possible acts of vengeance from the gods.Genesis 22: 1 -18. The Sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham:“Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to him,‘Abraham!’ And he said, ‘Here I am.’ He said, ‘Take now your son, your only son,whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as aburnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will tell you.’ So Abrahamrose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young menwith him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for the burnt offering, and aroseand went to the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham raisedhis eyes and saw the place from a distance. Abraham said to his young men, ‘Stayhere with the donkey, and I and the lad will go over there; and we will worshipand return to you.’ Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it onIsaac his son, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two ofthem walked on together. Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, ‘Myfather!’ And he said, ‘Here I am, my son.’ And he said, ‘Behold, the fire andthe wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?’Abraham said, ‘God will provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, myson.’ So the two of them walked on together. Then they came to the place ofwhich God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood,and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Abrahamstretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of theLORD called to him from heaven and said, ‘Abraham, Abraham!’ And he said, ‘HereI am.’ He said, ‘Do not stretch out your hand against the lad, and do nothing tohim; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son,your only son, from Me.’Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught inthe thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him upfor a burnt offering in the place of his son. Abraham called the name of thatplace The LORD Will Provide, as it is said to this day, ‘In the mount of theLORD it will be provided.’ Then the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a secondtime from heaven, and said, ‘By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, becauseyou have done this thing and have not withheld your son, your only son, indeed Iwill greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars ofthe heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shallpossess the gate of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earthshall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.’”This is surely the most malicious manipulation of early man by the gods toestablish his loyalty. It also provided a model for the gods with which theycould exercise future control over their human subjects, while promising theirloyal and obedient humans rich rewards. You have to see through all thegrandstanding, posturing and impressive narrative in the Old Testament, torecognise the absolute fear under which the people lived at all times. The godswere bloodthirsty and ruthless manipulators. But they had a very good reason tobehave this way: man had grown visibly unhappy with their abuse, and man wasbeginning to form groups of resistance, which were led by rebellious gods likeMarduk, the son of Enki.At this point, building up to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Marduk hadofficially revolted against his commanding god Enlil, developing a huge globalfollowing among humans, as he promised them life after death. He also proclaimedhimself as ‘god above all’. People who were thought to be in any way involved insuch activity against the ruling gods, would be classified as vile and evil,committing unspeakable acts of sin against god, and they would be punishedseverely. It is not quite clear whether it was Enlil who committed the gruesomeacts of violence against humans, but the evidence seems to point towards Marduk,as he grew more and more desperate to take control of the world. Marduk devisedhis own plan to control his human worshippers with fear and intimidation. Afterall, it had worked perfectly well until then. His ‘recruitment campaign’ beganshortly before the rise of the Egyptian empire and lasted way beyond the eventsat Sodom. Marduk travelled the whole world, wherever other gods had settled,proclaiming himself as ‘god above all’. It worked especially well in thebiblical lands including Egypt, where the origins of the Bible are set. And sobegan the calculated recorded manipulation of Humankind by the so-called ‘god ofvengeance’ of the Old Testament.Compare this behaviour to that of some notorious dictators many years later likeStalin, Mao and Hitler and you will see there is not much difference. ‘Likefather, like son.’ The gods have taught us well and their inherited DNA isclearly visible in our actions even today. We will see some support for this ina few choice extracts from the Bible.Meanwhile, the early activists against Enlil would congregate in places wherethey would not be easily spotted by potential gossipers and spies. Theresistance kept on growing among the humans, and activists were plotting variousways to overcome the brutal gods. It is also clear that certain towns and citiesbecame strongholds of the early revolutionaries, possibly inspired by the veryearly ‘thinkers’ among humans, or the philosophers who became so highly admiredin latter days. Two such cities were Sodom and Gomorrah.So while Enlil was nurturing Abraham into a loyal general, other kings saw thatthe instability among humans was on the rise and realised that there was serioustrouble brewing. It must have been common knowledge that humans were growingincreasingly unhappy with their gods and the resistance was gaining momentum.Abraham and his followers were constantly manipulated and brainwashed by thegods with stories that the world was full of ‘sinful and evil’ people. Do me afavour!… How is this possible? How was it possible that suddenly it was onlyAbraham and his clan who were okay in god's eyes while mostly everyone else wasevil, involved in unacceptably sinful behaviour which meant that they had to bedestroyed? Ask yourself again… what could those people have been doing that wasso evil? What could they have been scheming that meant the total annihilation oftwo entire cities? Did the almighty and loving god not have other means at hisdisposal? Just imagine this kind of behaviour today. Even in outright warsituations, the aggressor usually never obliterates entire cities. Thehumanitarian element elects not to harm innocent women and children. It ismainly the soldiers who are targets in war situations. I must rush to add thatalthough this kind of annihilation is pretty much what George W. Bush did inAfghanistan and Iraq, there were however many survivors. The kind ofannihilation that describes the events at Sodom and Gomorrah, was much moremalicious, with a clear intent to kill all living things in those two cities.Abraham must have become a highly dubious person in the lands through which hemoved, so much so, that even kings started to suck up to him in anticipation ofthe gods' possible retaliation against them. But his unshakable loyalty to hisgods brought Abraham rich rewards of all sorts and made him a very wealthy man.His nephew Lot was an active participant in all of this and played a crucialrole in delivering information to Abraham, which would in turn be conveyed tothe gods and ‘angels’ when they came calling and snooping around forinformation.Genesis 13:2-15“Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. And he journeyedon from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at thebeginning, between Bethel and Ai, to the place where he had made an altar at thefirst. And there Abram called upon the name of the LORD. And Lot, who went withAbram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not supportboth of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that theycould not dwell together… ‘Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourselffrom me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you takethe right hand, then I will go to the left.’ And Lot lifted up his eyes and sawthat the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD,like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar (This was before the LORDdestroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.). So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley,and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. Abram settled inthe land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and movedhis tent as far as Sodom. Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinnersagainst the LORD.”This was a cunning plan by the gods, to send Lot right into the heart of Sodomand settle down there, while providing his uncle with information about thegrowing movement of the resistance by the so-called ‘vile and wicked’ humans.Then the gods once again reminded Abraham what his reward would be if he did notdisappoint them.“The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, ‘Lift up your eyesand look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward andwestward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspringforever...’”To illustrate how nervous the kings in the surrounding lands must have been ofAbraham, here is an extract where one such king tries to secure his future withAbraham, the ‘blue-eyed’ boy of the gods, by doing what politicians have beendoing forever, sucking up to the guys with money and power:Genesis 13:22-26. ACovenant with Abimelech:“And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the commander ofhis army, spoke to Abraham, saying, ‘God is with you in all that you do. Nowtherefore, swear to me by God that you will not deal falsely with me, with myoffspring, or with my posterity; but that according to the kindness that I havedone to you, you will do to me and to the land in which you have dwelt.’ AndAbraham said, ‘I will swear.’”Even at this point, while reassuring Abimelech that he would put a good word infor him, he starts to display the subtle signs of a snitch for the gods byreprimanding the king, and in the process demonstrating his superiority:“Then Abraham rebuked Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech'sservants had seized. And Abimelech said, ‘I do not know who has done this thing;you did not tell me, nor had I heard of it until today.’”The poor king immediately tries to save his skin and eventually succeedsaccording to the scripture. Another example of kings sucking up to Abraham infear, looking for favouritism, is the following exert from Genesis 14:17-20:Abram Blessed by Melchizedek:“After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were withhim, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is,the King's Valley). And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine.(He was priest of God Most High.) And he blessed him and said, ‘Blessed be Abramby God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be God Most High,who has delivered your enemies into your hand!’”It is painfully clear that everyone was very nervous of the tenuous situation inthe land, expecting something major to happen at any minute. There was muchactivity with gods coming and going all the time, appearing to various people,giving instructions and inflicting harm to potential enemies. And on the groundthere must have been much activity among the revolutionaries, which we can tellfrom the constant references in the Bible to the “evil and vile and sinful” meneverywhere. There is a distinct paranoia in the tone with which the accusationskeep recurring. The people and the kings of the lands also knew Abraham’s closerelationship with the brutal gods, while the manipulation of Abraham continued.Genesis 15:“God's Covenant with Abram states: ‘After these things the word of the LORD cameto Abram in a vision: Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall bevery great.’”But all this activity was just a build-up for the biggest event of them all,when the gods maliciously planned and executed a full onslaught on Sodom andGomorrah, the safe haven of the revolutionaries under the influence of Marduk,the rebellious god among the Anunnaki. Their slave Abraham had become a devotedand loyal servant who would do anything for his gods. God told Abraham that “theoutcry against Sodom and Gomorrah was great and the accusations against themwere grievous”. Then god said he had decided to “come down and verify” and if itwas so, he would destroy them completely. What basically transpired here is: Thegods instructed Abraham to go to the cities and spy on the people. Obviously theBible describes the action very differently, and Abraham is seen to be sent on amission from god, to identify any virtuous people who may live in those cities,said to be crawling with evil and vile sinners. And as history books are alwayswritten by the victors, we know very little about the people of Sodom andGomorrah, besides what the propaganda passages of the Bible declare. After all,the events were recorded by the victors who were grossly indoctrinated by themanipulative gods.Back with Abraham: Three ‘angels’ appeared to him. He raised his eyes andbehold, there were three men with him. Isn't this bloody marvellous! Thesesnoopy ‘angels’ always seem to appear when there is trouble brewing, or justbefore the shit is about to hit the fan. Abraham obviously recognised themimmediately because he bowed his head and pleaded with them. One can clearly seethe fearful ‘slave and servant’ mentality in this passage. Two of them were‘angels’ who must have carried some sort of weapons which they used later toprotect themselves, and believe it or not, the third one was 'god' himself inperson, telling Abraham what must happen. The Old Testament called the angels‘malachim’ which literally translates as ‘emissaries who carry divine commandsand messages from god’. They made it very clear to Abraham that unless he canproduce 50 virtuous men, from the inhabitants of the two cities, the cities willbe decimated. This is what really puzzles me and what drives my theory thatAbraham was weaned to be a spy for them. Why should they tell Abraham this? Whyshould he be the one to produce 50 righteous men to save the cities? It couldonly be because he was asked to snoop around and report back to the gods. Theyhave now come to seek the results of his snooping.At first Abraham showed a hint of a humanity and pleaded with the gods not tokill everyone, for there may be ‘some virtuous or obedient’ people there. Godseems to agree with this sentiment and promises not to kill everyone as long asAbraham can find “even one” virtuous person in all of those cities. What ishappening here is clearly a setup for failure. The gods have a non-negotiableplan to wipe out these rebels in these ‘sinful’ cities and Abraham is their spy.The other curious event is that Abraham's nephew Lot, actually moved into Sodomprior to this and it is probably he who was leaking information about the ‘evilsinful people’ of the city, to his uncle.So when the ‘angel warriors’ arrived at the city gate they found Lot waiting forthem. This is another little curiosity pointing to premeditation. He took themto his house where they washed and ate, but the word spread like fire throughSodom that the violent angels were at Lot’s house, coming to attack them. Onceagain it is evident that the residents of Sodom recognised the two ‘angels’immediately. Could it be because they had been seen doing this before? Justanother one of their regular appearances during which they inflicted pain anddeath on the people? Or was it because they were dressed differently, whichincluded carrying deadly weapons, way beyond the humans’ understanding? Clearlythis was a perfect opportunity for the people of Sodom to lynch the angels andhave some level of revenge, even though it would have been on a small scale.Pandemonium broke out as the activists were joined by young and old, demandingthat the angels come out. There must have been a lot of heated commotion andadrenalin flowing because this type of situation did not present itself often.This was the perfect trigger for the violent gods to react. It was all the proofthey needed to confirm that all the people of Sodom were indeed evil sinners whoneeded to be destroyed. The angels came out and “smote the people withblindness, so they could not see”. Then they told Lot to gather all his familymembers and get out of the city as they were about to destroy it. Lot did hisbest to round them up but he was met with disbelief and ridicule. In the end itwas only his wife and two daughters who fled the city with him, under cover ofdarkness.The following is the most amazing revelation of awesome weaponry and deadlyforce that the ‘angels’ possessed. The ‘angels’ told Lot, “Escape for thy life,look not behind thee, neither stop thou anywhere in the plain… unto themountains escape lest thou perish.” Basically meaning, get the hell out of here…get to the mountains and hide in the caves… well out of sight! Then the mostremarkable thing happened. Lot pleaded with them to delay the destruction ofSodom long enough for him to reach the town of Zoar, which seemed to be farenough from Sodom. The ‘angels of death’ urged Lot to hurry for they could notunleash their deadly weapons until he arrived there safely. The descriptionwhich follows in the Bible can only be compared to a nuclear holocaust. And soit must have been. The cities, the people, the vegetation; everything was‘upheavaled’ by the power of the angels’ awesome weapons. The heat and firescorched everything in its path. Its radiation and pressure wave affected peoplesome distance away.Why was Lot told not to look back and to hide out of sight? An explosion of suchmagnitude would certainly blind one as quickly as a million welding torcheswould, while the radiation with the pressure wave and the heat would incineratelife for miles away. This is exactly what happened to the disobedient andinquisitive wife of Lot. The explosions behind them must have been the mostspectacular and frightening thing they had ever heard. She must have turned backfrom sheer inquisitiveness to see the destruction… this was not a wise move. Thebiblical Hebrew version relays that she was turned into “a pillar of salt”. Butas Zecharia Sitchin points out, it was incorrectly translated – the propertranslation should be ‘a pillar of vapour’. That is pretty much what one wouldexpect from a nuclear blast.The destruction by the violent angels did not stop there. Once again we findevidence that Lot may have been spying on other people in other cities, as hemade his way from one to the other, but for some reason he was not allowed tostay. Could this be because the citizens were familiar with Lot and his closelinks to the gods? Could it be that they simply did not want Lot around? Werethey scared of a similar fate to that of Sodom? The angels of death followed Lotfrom town to town, destroying them one by one in the same fashion as Sodom. Iask you to evaluate the situation again. What on Earth were the people of thosecities accused of to deserve such severe punishment from our ‘ever-loving’ god?I will not settle for the schizophrenic story portrayed in the Bible, even ifyou do threaten me with nuclear weapons! This is not my God behaving in such adistinctly barbaric way. The anger of the innocent people throughout the landsmust have boiled over, which only fuelled the revolutionaries, causing thousandsmore to join the loud protests against the violent gods everywhere. The angelshad no need to look for troublemakers, the cities must have risen up inrebellion against them one by one. The gods simply responded with what they knewbest – violence, death and destruction of their disobedient slaves.What all this activity points to is my underlying theory that much of thisviolent global activity has everything to do with our human DNA, which weinherited from our godly makers, and the evolution thereof. As this human dramaunfolds, I am changing my opinion rapidly about the state of evolution of theAnunnaki. The evidence is mounting rapidly that they were probably not much moreevolved than we are today. If you look at some of the human rights hurdles wehave crossed in the past few decades on Earth, it certainly seems that we mayhave already surpassed their level of evolution on human rights issues. I makethis statement in the light that we have successfully passed a United Nationslaw against slavery, while the Anunnaki created an entirely new slave speciessome 200,000 years ago. What has bothered me about this whole chain of events istheir lack of vision and their seeming ignorance of the repercussions. At first,I believed the Anunnaki to have had perfect genomes which allowed them toperform super­human activities, live forever and perform amazing geneticmanipulations. But then I look at how we have advanced in genetic engineeringand cloning, and I realise that we have the same capability today, as they hadwhen they arrived on Earth some 450,000 years ago. In many ways, we humans, themiserable ‘slave species’ of the gods, are at a similar level in space travel asthe Anunnaki were all those years ago, and before long we WILL be colonisingMars. Ask yourself this question. Will our ‘human rights charter’ allow thepioneers on Mars to clone a new sub-species of humans as a lowly worker, withfewer rights than the astronaut settlers? Or will the Mars settlers be allowedto clone a slave species to do all the dirty work, and to be treated as lesserhumans? I don't think so. But while we display high levels of sensitivitytowards human rights today, our violent genes are still causing havoc amonghumanity. On that front we have a long way to evolve or to possibly treat thisviolent imperfection with genetic manipulation in the future.This brings me back to the issue of how evolved the Anunnaki genome might havebeen when they created us. It is now very clear that their intentions were tocreate a less intelligent humanoid; one who is smart enough to takeinstructions, but at the same time ignorant and subservient enough not tochallenge his maker. To achieve this they realised that cloning their ownspecies was not going to do the trick, as it would give the offspring an equalgenetic capacity to themselves. The obvious answer to the problem was to crosstheir own more evolved DNA with that of the Homo erectus, a resident specieshere on Earth. Although the Anunnaki did possess enough knowledge of genetics toclone a number of possible beings, it's much clearer now, that they probablyalso had to switch off or disconnect some of the important genes in the proposedslave species, in order to prevent certain advanced characteristics. Sitchin'stranslations of Sumerian tablets tell us in great detail about how they triedand tried again to get the egg to fertilise in the surrogate females and allowthe clone to grow into a healthy baby. They describe the Homo erectus as “Amongthe animals on the steppe they live, they know not dressing in garments… Shaggywith hair is their whole body… No creature like that has ever in Edin beenseen.” Then they tell us exactly what the purpose of the new creature will be:“A primitive worker shall be created… Our commands will he understand… Our toolshe will handle… The toil in the excavations he shall perform.” There are anumber of lamentations about their despair as they failed on several attempts tocreate the ‘primitive worker’. “We must try once more… The admixture needsadjusting… In the crystal bowl the oval of an earth female she inseminated…There was conception… This one more in the likeness of the Anunnaki was.” Buttheir attempts failed on many occasions before they created the perfect species.“Again and again Ninmah rearranged the admixtures” and finally, the result was‘almost’ perfect. The birth of ‘Adamu’ was met with great excitement by theAnunnaki, but soon they would face many new unexpected problems. The main hurdlethey needed to cross then, was to tame the wild animal behaviour of the newslave species, which naturally caused them to rebel against any kind ofconfinement or oppression. The other hurdle was to instil a sense of loyalty,subservience, obedience and especially fear, into the new slave species. And sowe meet the vengeful, bloodthirsty, strict ‘creator-god’ of humanity. He dishesout a code of strict instructions, and he rewards obedience with gifts andleniency, while dispensing harsh pain and suffering to those who disobey hisword. While it may sound unbelievable, it was virtually a foolproof plan. Thekind of plan any dictator would be proud of. Just look at how fearful we stillare of the god of vengeance. I will leave the rest of this story of creation fora later chapter while we return to the concept of slavery and how free we thinkwe really are in the 21st century.As always, just when you think you know it all, a new door opens to reveal justhow little you really know. When I started researching the global history ofslavery, I uncovered spine-chilling tales of hardship and misery of suchproportion, and stories so unbelievable, that it could make one lose completefaith in humanity. But then I reminded myself of the very simple idea that I amtrying to share with you in this book. So let me remind you once again, before Ishare some of the horrors of modern day slavery with you… we were created as aslave species… we are still a slave species… displaying all the behaviouralcharacteristics of a slave species. There is simply no getting away from theoverwhelming evidence surrounding us and filling the pages of our pre-history.It is interesting to compare the ‘slave rules’ in the code of law by KingHammurabi from Babylon, some 4,100 years ago, to the plight of sweatshop workersin Chinese factories today. To get the real effect of these modern sweatshops,let me remind you that many of the world’s largest consumer brands are nowmanufactured in China under despicable, inhumane conditions. These are the newslave markets of the modern civilised world. Even though these factories havereceived loads of publicity exposing them for violating human rights in waysthat we cannot even imagine, all the flag-waving, banner-bearing and chantingliberals in the West keep buying the products that come from these eastern slavemarkets. What they cannot see, does not affect them, so the gluttonous consumersof the West will continue to consume in ever-growing numbers, propagating thegrowth of the invisible slave trade of the East. The USA and Europe are clearlythe main culprits by virtue of the sheer numbers in the so-called First Worldcountries, while the Asian market just carries on consuming the brands whichenslave their relatives. So now that I got that off my chest, let's take a lookat a Chinese sweatshop worker's lament, together with a few more nastyrevelations about our humanity:THE CREATION OF ADAM[../Images/245-1.jpg]A representation of a Mesopotamian cylinder seal showing the creation of Adam,the first test-tube baby. We see a goddess holding Adam while the others in thelaboratory are preparing the DNA mixture and holding up a test-tube of sorts.Notice the Tree-of-Life prominently displayed behind the goddess.SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES, often called ‘FINE ZONES’.One popular method of enslaving workers is the system of imposing fines.SIDE TRACKING: Yellow lines are marked on the floor; if workers step outside theyellow lines, they are fined. OVERTIME: Most factories fix a time limit forgoing to the toilet, usually 3-5 minutes. If they stay longer than the limit,they will be fined. GOING TO THE TOILET WITHOUT PERMIT: In some factories,workers have to get a permit tag from the supervisor to go to the toilet. Theproblem is that there are usually only a few tags for large numbers of workers,mostly women.Over and above these, there are many other ‘creative’ excuses used to imposefines, such as ‘not willing to work overtime’ and ‘not greeting the generalmanager’. The high wages promised to workers in these ‘fine zone factories’ aremostly eroded to one-third or even less by all the fines imposed. In extremecases, workers end up in debt to the factory by the end of the month.It is said that the Matsushita (National/Panasonic) Co. Ltd. in Zhuhai City, hasthe following warning system of yellow cards. First yellow card is a fine of Rmb20, the second card Rmb 40, the third time, Rmb 80 and the fourth time theyreceive a yellow card they are fired. Reasons for receiving a yellow cardinclude basic acts such as talking at work, not putting their name tags in thecorrect position, etc.I ask you again. How is this possible? How did primitive man suddenly come upwith the concept of slavery? And how can modern man try to justify the continueduse of forced labour still today? We can now draw a very clear line in humanhistory and find a point when slavery first emerged. As amazing as it may seem,slavery amongst humans emerged at the same time as the sudden ‘civilisation’around 11,000 BC. Soon after the deluge, the Great Flood, Humankind began toenslave each other, doing what they were born into, and what seemed to comequite naturally.Many will argue that we have not evolved at all since then, that we haveactually gone backwards. I must agree to a certain extent that dark oppressivecults and religious dogma are of great concern, and are in some ways retardingour spiritual progress. But there is increasing excitement among the globalpopulace about new discoveries, inventions, space travel and more basic eventslike the emancipation of various peoples from dictators. Let me remind you thatit was only in 1930 that we discovered the planet Pluto, and yet today we havetwo robots on Mars beaming back visual messages to us. We have certainlyevolved, there is no doubt about that. What needs to be established is how muchour genome has evolved. If the past 100 years is a form of measure we could use,that would mean the pace of evolution among humans is most likely exponential.The more we evolve, the faster we evolve. And yet it is only the wealthy sectorsof world population which seem to be evolving in this way. One can argue that itis mere progress and not real evolution. But conversely, progress could lead usto fast-track our evolution through knowledge of our DNA. The pace of spaceexploration and IT development would certainly support such a theory. So if myassumption about the level of evolution is correct, it would mean that theAnunnaki would have evolved way past us at this stage, possibly to the pointwhere we wouldn’t even recognise them. Unless of course, we possess some uniquemutation in our genome which would have catapulted us beyond their level ofevolution. And by now we should have learnt that everything is possible, so letus not discard that theory as yet. The very sad thing is that while one fifth ofthe world's population revels in progress, the majority are trapped by poverty,hunger, disease and even slavery.News article December 2004“Around 200,000 women were forced into sexual slavery by Japan's military duringthe Second World War, when they shipped these women from Korea, China and otherAsian countries to be kept as sex slaves for Japanese troops. It was only duringthe early '90s that Tokyo acknowledged its military had been involved in settingup and running brothels for its troops. However, high court judge Makoto Nemotosaid the current administration did not have to pay compensation because it wasnot responsible for what past leaders had done. In past rulings, courts havefavoured the Japanese government, stating that the statute of limitations hadexpired, or that international labour rules did not require compensation forsexual slavery.”Slave labour in China seems to be on the increase according to news reportsdated August 2001. Young Chinese men are increasingly becoming victims of forcedlabour as economic necessity forces them to migrate to other provinces, wherethey have been promised well-paid jobs in brick factories or stone quarries. Anarticle by Bruce Gilley published in the Far Eastern Economic Review on 16August 2001, highlighted how 27 men were forced to work as slaves for 12 hours aday with no pay in a brick factory in Dingzhou, China. One of the men who triedto escape was caught, dragged back to the camp and beaten to death in front ofthe other men. It was only on 22 May 2001, after one worker managed to escapefrom the guards, that local labour officials were informed and arrived to arrestthe manager and free the men. The workers had been enslaved there for more thanone year.In February 2001, a newspaper called Dahe Daily reported that officials inZhengzhou, Henan province, tried to free 30 slaves from an illegal coal pit.They were turned away by 20 armed guards and had to return the next day witharmed police. Another coal pit was closed in the same area which enslaved sixlabourers, whose ages ranged between 14 and 73.In May 2001, five women, who were being forced to work without pay at anindustrial materials polishing factory, escaped during an electricity blackout,according to a report in the Yanshan Metropolis News.China has a household registration system called ‘hokou’ which gives workersvery few rights or protection when they leave their designated place ofresidence. This encourages others to view migrants as second class citizens. Theattitude taken by local authorities is that ‘it's not our people so we're notresponsible for them’. In one reported case, 100 people from Henan were rescuedfrom a kelp factory in Shandong's Rongcheng city, only after one of them managedto contact family in Henan, after which they contacted the local newspaper, theHenan Daily. A manager of a brick factory in Dingzhou, admitted to keeping“several” workers against their will. While laws exist to prohibit forcedlabour, government officials and labour officials often do not seem to enforcethem.As much as economic necessity plays a role in making migrants vulnerable tobeing trapped as forced labourers, it is mainly the corruption and greed ofhumans which allows slavery to flourish. The greed gene and the violent gene areas strong as ever in our genome. Why is it that some have developed mechanismsto suppress these characteristics, while others thrive on the effects of thesegenes? By the end of 1994, there were a total of 260,000 officially-registeredFIE (Foreign Invested Entities) enterprises in China, employing around 1.95million workers, with total investment amounting to US $491 billion. Becausethey are afforded preferential treatment by the government, FIEs in China areimmune to any monitoring. The trend is that government officials and departmentsturn a blind eye to law-defying FIEs for fear of losing investment. In return,the FIEs have identified this loophole as a psychological advantage and use itas a threat against law-enforcement departments. FIEs comprised at least 40% ofall labour dispute cases in 1994. Some other tricks used by FIEs are: 1. Workers are required to pay a deposit upon recruitment, which usually adds up to two to three months' salary. They cannot claim back the deposit if they quit or get fired. 2. Workers' identity cards and temporary residence permits are confiscated upon entry. Workers are virtually held in custody, since they cannot go anywhere without their identity cards. 3. Workers get paid on average 18% less than the minimum wage. The lowest wage level was found in Dongguan City, which paid 32.2% less than the minimum wage. 4. Wage arrears and underpayment enslaves workers by not allowing them to take any action on their own. Some receive their wages once every few months and some enterprises only pay basic living allowances. Invariably, when the enterprises wind up, the workers cannot claim back their unpaid wages. In an official investigation conducted in September 1994 in Guangdong Province, which was the main area for foreign investment in China, 25,000 workers were found to be underpaid or unpaid to the tune of Rmb 6.52 million (one of the two official Chinese currencies).Harsh management resembles slave treatment even in accredited factories in thespecial economic zones. Many of the labourers come from poverty-strickenvillages. Physical and verbal abuse and arbitrary dismissals are the rule of theday.In March 1995, workers in a Korean electronics factory in Zhuhai City wereforced to work non-stop for four days with only five hours sleep. The exhaustedworkers took a nap during the ten-minute afternoon rest period. Angered by their‘laziness’, the factory boss ordered the whole staff to kneel down. When somerefused to obey they were sacked immediately. As China is being rapidlyintegrated into the world trade system, workers in China are no longer slaves ofthe state, they are becoming slaves of the state and of internationalcapitalism.The slave-labour-like factories, many of which produce big international brands,have taken many lives due to fires in the past decade. This kind of safetystatistic would be completely unacceptable in the UK or USA.• May 1991Hong Kong-owned Xingye Raincoat Factory, producing Ninja Turtle children'sraincoats in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province; 72 killed, 47 injured. •November 1993Hong Kong-owned Zhili Toy Factory, producing Chicco Toys in Shenzen SEZ; 87killed, 51 injured. • December 1993Taiwanese Gaofu Textile Co. Ltd. in Fuzhou City, Fujian Province; 61 killed, allwomen. • June 1994Hong Kong-owned Yuexin Textile Factory in Zhuhai SEZ; 93 killed, 160 injured.The workers were asked to go back to the burnt factory building to take out thefabric just before the building collapsed. • September 1995Electric wire factory in Dongguan City; 7 killed, 4 injured. • New Year's Day1996Workers' dormitory of a Taiwanese Christmas decoration factory in Shenzen SEZ;22 killed, 33 injured. The warehouse-turned-dormitory was built with corrugatediron. It housed more than 800 workers and masses of plastic materials. The onlyexits were the two main doors.All these preventable ‘accidents’ follow the same pattern. There are no fireprevention facilities and emergency exits are normally blocked or sealed toprevent the ‘slave’ labourers from getting out. In the first eleven months of1995, there were 1,184 fires recorded in Guangdong Province, claiming 193 livesand injuring 268. Most of the casualties involved young women workers, whoconstitute the main workforce in foreign-invested enterprises. Can you imaginethis kind of news making the headlines in Los Angeles? At first you may say“this kind of thing would never happen in the USA”. But the truth is, that itprobably happens all the time, but it simply never makes the news. Why? Becausethe cheap labour in LA consists of Mexican ‘illegal aliens’, which means it isnot juicy enough for the bloodthirsty media, who probably won’t pay anyattention to it. Mexican lives just seem to be worth a little less thanblonde-blue-eyed beach bunnies.So here we are some 200,000 years after our entry into the universal communityof primitive species. Although we arrived as a slave species, we have maderemarkable progress against our hostile and vengeful makers, who would stop atnothing to manipulate, control and punish us at every conceivable opportunity.And only some 11,000 years since we adopted civilisation, courtesy of some ofthe more benevolent gods, we are about to colonise Mars. Now that we have themoral high ground on our creator gods, with regard to our view on human rightsand equality, we still carry the violent hangover of our slave speciescharacter. Although almost invisible, slavery is alive and well on Earth, as ithas been for thousands of years. Will we learn from our own experiences when wesettle on Mars, or will we do what comes so naturally to us - clone a new slavespecies and control them with an iron fist. If our slowly evolving DNA has anyrole in this, we will probably engage in the latter.Code of Hammurabi Priest King who established Babylonia:There is some disagreement about the date of Hammurabi's rule. Some scholars puthim at circa 2300 BC, others as late as 1700 BC. Zecharia Sitchin places him ataround 1900 BC, which would make Hammurabi one of the first kings after thedestruction of Sodom, Gomorrah and other cities by the Anunnaki gods, in pursuitof Marduk the rebellious god and son of Enki, circa 2024 BC. But as we willshow, Marduk survived and Babylon became a powerful city under his ‘godship’. Inthis translation by L. W. King we read what King Hammurabi had to say about hisnew kingdom as bestowed upon him by Marduk:“When Anu the Sublime, King of the Anunnaki, and Bel, the lord of Heaven andearth, who decreed the fate of the land, assigned to Marduk, the over ruling sonof Ea, God of righteousness, dominion over earthly man, and made him great amongthe Igigi, they called Babylon by his illustrious name, made it great on earth,and founded an everlasting kingdom in it, whose foundations are laid so solidlyas those of heaven and earth; then Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, theexalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule of righteousness in theland, to destroy the wicked and the evil-doers; so that the strong should notharm the weak; so that I should rule over the black-headed people like Shamash,and enlighten the land, to further the well-being of mankind.”These words are wonderful evidence of how the Anunnaki gods controlled the fatesof men and bestowed kingship on their chosen few. We also find corroboration ofthe close relationship between Marduk and the Igigi, who were his followers, whoarrived on Earth from Mars when it lost its atmosphere. They are the most likelycandidates, who were the progenitors of the Aryans when they married earthlingfemales in years to come. We also read about the “blackheaded people” who werethe ‘primitive workers’ and descendents of ‘Adamu’ who were brought up to Sumerto work for the upper-class Sumerians and gods. We also read about the plight ofthe ‘blackheaded’ people in other tablets and we find references to them mostlywith regard to performing the hard labour for which they were created. Thisproves irrefutably that black people have had the raw end of the deal on thisplanet since the very first moment of creation. It is now clear that Adam wasblack. Some of his descendents were taken north and mixed with the Igigi andother lesser gods of Sumer, creating the white Aryan upper class of the Sumeriancivilisation. Those relatives of Adam who remained in Africa, remained ‘behind’in many other ways. While the technology of the Anunnaki gods was being widelyapplied in the daily lives of the Sumerians, the African descendents of Adamwere living in basic and primitive conditions for thousands of years,worshipping their ‘mythological’ gods. But not all the ‘blackheaded’ people whowere taken to Sumer had it easy, because most of them remained slaves to theAnunnaki and experienced hardship. Some 2,000 years BC, an unknown scribe wrotea poem describing the sad events which surrounded the fall of the city of Ur. Inthis lamentation we read about the plight of the ‘blackheaded’ people. This poemis an excellent corroboration of the aftermath during which Sodom and Gomorrahwere destroyed by some kind of nuclear disaster, unleashed by the biblical‘angels’ who visited Abraham and Lot. The time was around 2024 BC. The dots inthe following translation of the tablet indicate the damaged parts of the tabletwhich are illegible.“That law and order cease to exist…That cities be destroyed, that houses be destroyed…That Sumer's rivers flow with bitter water…That the mother care not for her children…That kingship be carried off from the land…That on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates … there grow sticky plants…That no one tread the highways, that no one seek out the roads,That its well-founded cities and hamlets be counted as ruins,That its teeming blackheaded people be put to the mace…The fate decreed by the gods cannot be changed, who can overturn it!”Codes 15 -20 of ‘The Code of Hammurabi’ dealing with references to slaves.15 If any one take a male or female slave of the court, or a male or femaleslave of a freed man, outside the city gates, he shall be put to death. 16 Ifany one receive into his house a runaway male or female slave of the court, orof a freed man, and does not bring it out at the public proclamation of themajor domus, the master of the house shall be put to death. 17 If any one findrunaway male or female slaves in the open country and bring them to theirmasters, the master of the slaves shall pay him two shekels of silver. 18 If theslave will not give the name of the master, the finder shall bring him to thepalace; a further investigation must follow, and the slave shall be returned tohis master. 19 If he hold the slaves in his house, and they are caught there, heshall be put to death. 20 If the slave that he caught run away from him, thenshall he swear to the owners of the slave, and he is free of all blame.The Code of the Nesilim (Hittites), circa 1650-1500 BC -Random excerpts.• If anyone smite a free man or woman and this one die, he shall bring this oneand give two persons, he shall let them go to his home.·If anyone smite a maleor female slave, he shall bring this one also and give one person, he shall lethim or her go to his home. • If anyone blind a free man or knock out his teeth,formerly they would give one pound of silver, now he shall give twentyhalf-shekels of silver. • If anyone blind a male or female slave or knock outtheir teeth, he shall give ten half- shekels of silver, he shall let it go tohis home. If anyone cause a free woman to miscarry, if it be the tenth month, heshall give ten half-shekels of silver, if it be the fifth month, he shall givefive half-shekels of silver. If anyone cause a fe fmale slave to miscarry, if itbe the tenth month, he shall giveive half-shekels of silver.• If any man of Hatti steal a Nesian slave and lead him here to the land ofHatti, and his master discover him, he shall give him twelve half-shekels ofsilver, he shall let it go to his home. • If anyone steal a slave of a Luwianfrom the land of Luwia, and lead him here to the land of Hatti, and his masterdiscover him, he shall take his slave only. • If a male or female slave runaway, he at whose hearth his master finds him or her, shall give fiftyhalf-shekels of silver a year. • If a free man and a female slave be fond ofeach other and come together and he take her for his wife and they set up houseand get children, and afterward they either become hostile or come to closequarters, and they divide the house between them, the man shall take thechildren, only one child shall the woman take. • If a slave take a woman as hiswife, their case is the same. The majority of the children to the wife and onechild to the slave. If a slave take a female slave their case is the same. Themajority of children to the female slave and one child to the slave. If a slaveconvey the bride price to a free son and take him as husband for his daughter,nobody dare surrender him to slavery. • If a free man set a house ablaze, heshall build the house, again. And whatever is inside the house, be it a man, anox, or a sheep that perishes, nothing of these he need compensate. • If a slaveset a house ablaze, his master shall compensate for him. The nose of the slaveand his ears they shall cut off, and give him back to his master. But if he donot compensate, then he shall give up this one. • If a free man kill a serpentand speak the name of another, he shall give one pound of silver; if a slave,this one shall die. • If a free man pick up female slaves, now one, now another,there is no punishment for intercourse. If brothers sleep with a free woman,together, or one after the other, there is no punishment. If father and sonsleep with a female slave or harlot, together, or one after the other, there isno punishment. • If a slave say to his master: “You are not my master,” if theyconvict him his master shall cut off his ear.No matter how much evidence is presented, many readers will find the truth tooterrible to digest. Our human nature has evolved in a way that we simply rejectgloomy hypotheses of such magnitude in favour of rosier tales told byhistorians. In this quest for enlightenment, our biggest enemy is our arrogance.In our inability to face the ‘terrible truth’ about our slave-species ancestry,lies the ironic paradox which may ultimately contribute to our demise. Ourmisplaced pride may eventually destroy us. Knowledge is power, no matter how oldit may be. I suggest that we begin to embrace the knowledge of our distantancestors, as difficult as it may be, and find a way to understanding the realfacts about our origins as the human race and our place on this planet.Unfortunately, every ounce of our human essence screams with the characteristicsof a slave species trapped in a cycle of incomprehensible rituals. Enslaved byeverything around us, but stubbornly rejecting such suggestions to our graves.We were created as a slave species, we have lived and behaved like a slavespecies and we are still behaving as such, uncertain of our origins and purpose."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13 [../Text/toc.html#chapter13]WORLD RELIGIONS: THE GREAT SLAVE MAKER [../Text/toc.html#chapter13a]When you visit someone at their home for the first time, it is alwaysfascinating to scan the photographs scattered on the walls and furniture,showing off their close family and friends. Within minutes, one gets a sense ofthe person’s background, where they were born, where they grew up, how well-offthey are and how many brothers and sisters they have. Are the parents stilltogether or divorced? Where do they live now? Baby pictures, school pictures,graduation pictures, pictures of their animals and even pictures of their carsin some instances. It presents a reasonably complete collage of your host’sfamily and history as well as their social standing. It fills you with a senseof comfort, knowing a little more about your host. Suddenly the expression, ‘theapple never falls far from the tree’ becomes relevant again when trying toanalyse your host’s character and personality. Subconsciously you start tocalculate whether the first impressions you formulated of the host, before youwere exposed to his photographic display, match the evidence presented. We areoften surprised to discover something new from the photo gallery, somethingwhich takes us by complete surprise. Especially if the host is of anotherculture or lives in a foreign country. And so we are filled with a sense ofcomfort as we settle down to a cup of tea or a braai (barbecue) in theback-yard.Let us imagine for a minute that we as the human family receive a visitor fordinner from another planet. We manage to overcome any fear of conflict becauseit just so happens that the guest speaks a distant dialect of our own language.As they arrive we display pictures of our human family, our brothers, sisters,cousins and nephews, but for some reason we have no pictures of our parents. Thevisitor is immediately very intrigued. Are we a bunch of orphans? Do we not knowwho our parents are? With all this time on Earth, have we not had enough time tofind out? We then explain that we have many fathers upon which the visitorbursts out laughing. He realises that we obviously do not know anything aboutbiology and he explains to us that it is impossible to have more than onefather. We then present our guest with the evidence of our many fathers, bywhich time he realises that we are seriously disturbed and uninformed, and we ashumans need some serious guidance and a refresher course on the origins ofhumanity. The visitor asks us if we are not aware of the universal community ofbeings and whether we know that we all come from one original source. He tellsus of the common practice of colonising new planets by the infinite number ofevolved intelligent species of beings; the extended practice and the right topopulate new planets with our own species if we are the first ones to get there;the practice of creating genetically less advanced beings to perform the toughtask of manual labour on newly colonised planets, allowing them to evolve to thehighest level; at the same time continuing the cycle of universal evolution andenlightenment of species; and when we reach the highest level of evolution andenlightenment we rejoin the universal community of beings from which we alloriginate; at which stage we are reunited with our Creator the Universal Being,Creator of all things in the universe.This story really confuses us and makes us feel a little uneasy because we areall very sure of who our father is, and we make an excuse for our human brothersand sisters who claim that our father may be someone else according to them. Wetry to convince our visitor that our father is whom we believe he is. Althoughwe have no evidence of it, it has been passed down to us through manygenerations, so it must be true. Our guest then asks to see a list of our humanbrothers and their supposed fathers, and this is what we show him.Religions by country:(To avoid boredom, please use this list as a reference only.)Country Religions indicated in percentage of adherents.(%) Afghanistan SunniMuslim 80%, Shi'a Muslim 19%, other 1% Albania Muslim 70%, Albanian Orthodox20%, Roman Catholic 10% Algeria Sunni Muslim (state religion) 99%, Christian andJewish 1% American Samoa Christian Congregationalist 50%, Roman Catholic 20%,Protestant and other 30% Andorra Roman Catholic (predominant) Angola Indigenousbeliefs 47%, Roman Catholic 38%, Protestant 15% (1998 est.)

This is indirect violation of the communal spirit of universal beings. He explains thatthere are a number of rogue beings who were included in the community of beingsa little prematurely, who have been known to colonise planets but do not followthe common protocol of educating and informing the newly created species abouttheir origins and their destiny. Such rogue beings are like pirates of theuniverse, raping and pillaging planets for their wealth while creating a lesserevolved being which cannot possibly understand its place in the universe. Thepirates often present themselves as gods of sorts, dealing brutally with theirnewly created species. They use them for labour, for experiments and forpleasure. These cosmic pirates leave behind an uninformed and confused planet ofbeings, who may take forever to figure out the truth about themselves. Thecommon pattern on such planets is that the lesser evolved beings start to createtheir own gods, mimicking the ones that were introduced to them by the cosmicpirates. This leads to more confusion and constant conflict as the new beingstry to impose the supremacy of their particular god over the rest of the newbeings on such a planet.Apparently this is a growing concern among the community of universal beings andall attempts are being made to prevent this from happening in the future. It wasa blatant mistake on the part of the universal community to allow a group of‘almost evolved’ beings to join the highest community of beings. It seems thattheir 'almost' complete genome was not quite sufficient to make them completelyat one with the Supreme Being in the universe. They will have to be restrictedto a planet and allowed more time to complete their evolution towards a completegenome. Only then, will the genome be able to open all the ports in their minds,which will allow them to plug into the universal spirit and join the fullcommunity of universal spiritual beings without any complications.At this point we feel very uncomfortable and scared, because we have been warnedabout false prophets on many occasions by our respective gods. This must surelybe such a false prophet who will cause the ‘wrath of god’ to be unleashed on us,which we do not deserve. So we kill our visitor in the name of god, knowing thatwhat we did was the right thing. After all, the Bible and the Koran allow us todo this. We are permitted to kill false prophets, for they are surely thedisciples of Satan.Boy oh boy… what a pathetically confused species we are. Lost in the vastness ofthe universe, searching for our roots, confused by so much false knowledgepassed down to us through the ages. All this disinformation has to stopsomewhere. But what will it take for us to realise that we cannot have more thanone father? We cannot all be right… we cannot all claim to have the correctanswer. Somewhere out there is the truth, and as it usually happens, it isprobably too close for us to see. But it should be easy to spot the indigenoustree in a forest of invasive alien species. Let’s get one thing straight. Thereis not a single religion on Earth that was created by God. But there are severalwhich were imposed on us by the ancient gods. There is not one single book onEarth that was written by God. But there are many that were inspired by theactivity of the ancient gods. Take a look at the number of man-made religionsaround us. It is clear that a situation like this could only have emerged out ofuncertainty. If we knew who our creator was, we should have all received thesame instructions, surely? The fact that we have so many conflicting ideas,leads me to believe that we have been the victims of continued disinformationover long periods of time as well as the victims of a meticulously executedmanipulation of the facts to keep us ignorant and in a continuous state ofconflict. It’s as if the captain has abandoned ship and left it floating in themiddle of the Pacific ocean filled with five-year-olds. What chance do they haveto steer the ship to the nearest port and to safety? Virtually zero. But if theship is lucky enough not to encounter any storms for a long, long time, whilethe currents take them along, they may be lucky enough to work out how to steerthis ship for themselves. But there is a very good chance they will all perishin an inevitable storm.The list of religions we looked at serves as concrete evidence that we have beendeserted on this planet without an instruction manual. To prove their supremacy,most religions have brought out their own manuals, claiming that theirs is theoriginal manual to guide humanity into their future and the kingdom of God. Buthow can they be such conflicting manuals? Surely the real builders or creatorsof this ship must have had only one set of plans to build it? Maybe not, maybethey were not qualified builders to begin with and therefore the ship is in suchdisarray. Some manuals seem to put us in reverse gear whereas others are rammedinto the first gear, not quite sure where the second is.Okay, enough metaphors and parables, I am sure that by now you get my drift. Tomake my argument even more compelling, let us take a look at the world's majorreligions and the numbers of followers. It has ‘recipe for disaster’ written allover it, pitting one group against another. The largest and strongest will wantto defend its position and grow, while the others will want to spread theirdoctrine in an attempt to become the dominant religion. There are more religionstoday than countries in the world. This creates an additional dilemma and sendsa stern warning to politicians, that religion may yet again become the drivingforce of politics in the future. Something that modern democracies have beenworking very hard to overcome. The principle of ‘divide and conquer’ has beenmeticulously applied in all the instances of these religions, showing that theancients gods of Sumer were cunning strategists and extremely shrewd militarycommanders. The religious statistics point unavoidably to a conflict situationin our present state of mind. Tolerance has not won the day as yet. It’s as ifit was purposely so devised, to steer humanity into a perpetual situation ofwar.Religions by size:Religions Adherents (2004) % of total 1.

You will note that the total of the adherents is larger than the globalpopulation. This could be because of the duplication of followers of differentreligions. A rather strange phenomenon which has puzzled me while compilingthis. According to these stats there are about 8.5 billion people in the worldmaking up 133% of the population. How do they calculate these figures?For us humans on planet Earth, there are many seemingly insurmountable obstaclesin our path to evolution and peace. As we evolve, more people embrace thepossibility of the newfound truths about our past. The most important questionswe need to answer are, who we are, and where we come from. But these answerswill not be presented to us on a platter with a treasure-hunter's kit and a mapto get to the prize. Fortunately we have now started to uncover some veryuncomfortable evidence, which does not seem to tell the same story that we havebeen told about our history. The biggest obstacles to our growth as a species,to find peace and harmony, are the many man-made religions. It will not be easyto convince devout Christians and Muslims to start considering newpossibilities. It instantly turns the messenger into a false prophet who hasbeen sent by the devil. The creators of humanity were the finest strategistsever. They managed to create the perfect environment for continued doubt andconflict. They created the most perfect propaganda tools ever: fear, punishmentand reward. It is all so simple, isn't it? Hopefully this will not be themessage that we teach the citizens of the new planets we are soon to startpopulating. But since we ourselves have no clear answers for our origins, whatwill we teach the newly cloned colonies of humans on other planets in the nearfuture?While religion plays a crucial role in shaping our communities, we live ourlives reasonably sheltered from the diversity of other religions. We may drivepast a mosque on our way to work every day, but how often do we actually takethe trouble to find out more about the people who worship there? When Jehovah'sWitnesses knock on our door to spread their message, how many of us actuallytake the time to listen to what they have to say? It is this kind of detachmentthat keeps us divided and wrapped up in feelings of superiority over otherreligions, because our god is always bigger and better than the other's. Thestudy of religion is truly fascinating and it helps us understand the murkyorigins which they all share. Only once we have looked at the very sketchy rootsof the most popular religions of the world, can we begin to understand that theyare all built on the same shaky ground. We also begin to realise that allreligions are man-made and therefore cannot be deemed to be divine, because manis fallible. It would be very laborious to try to educate the readers of thisbook about all global religion, and also unfair to reduce them to a page ofeditorial. But I have chosen to give you a quick overview of the twelve mostpopular religions on Earth, just to help you understand some of the similaritiesand shortcomings. It will help you formulate your own opinions about thereligious dogma which has evolved over thousands of years to keep us seeminglyhappy, but totally enslaved and divided as a species. They are listed in orderof size and historical influence on the global populace.Christianity. Origin circa 30 AD.This is by far the largest of the world religions with almost twice as manyfollowers as its closest rival, Islam. From the digging that I undertook duringthe writing of this book, I was amazed to discover that Christianity somehowmade it against all odds. It was a struggling young philosophy in the days afterthe crucifixion of Jesus, with the disciples devoting their lives to thespreading of the word; but it certainly was not easy. They were oftenthreatened, chased away or made to feel very unwelcome. You have to rememberthat the pretty clean image we have developed of Jesus and the disciples is veryfar from the truth. Those were difficult times for him and his relatively smallgroup of followers. As Barbara Thiering puts it in Jesus of the Apocalypse, “Hewas a central figure in a major political movement which was working atoverthrowing the pagan Roman empire.” She goes on to reveal a staggering bit ofinformation that becomes another perfectly fitting piece in our Great HumanPuzzle. Even at this point in time, the gods were as active as ever andChristianity was flying right in the face of the huge support for the manyHellenic gods from days gone by. She continues, “The enormous number offollowers of the new, still underground religion, introduced from Judea longbefore the time of Jesus, were ready to believe in divine figures who were thesubjects of visions and miracles. It was the world of Hellenism, where paganreligions had encouraged the idea of human beings as incarnations of gods.”So while there is reference that the people of the day were still beingmanipulated by their Sumerian gods, Christianity was hanging on. They werepersecuted, tortured, fed to lions in the Colosseum and generally abused invarious ways. This was not a good time to be a Christian. This situationcontinued for nearly 300 years, when suddenly Flavius Valerius Constantinus -272 - 337 AD - came to the rescue. Commonly known as Constantine the Great, hebecame known as the first ‘Christian Emperor’ of the Roman empire and began theEmpire's unofficial sponsoring of Christianity, which was a major factor in thesurvival and spread of the religion. His reputation as the first ‘ChristianEmperor’ was promulgated by Lactantius and Eusebius and gained ground in thesucceeding generations. He founded the city of Constantinople as the new capitalof the Eastern Empire which became the home of Christianity, filled with largenumbers of churches and temples. He also proclaimed that Sunday would be the dayof worship.The First Council of Nicaea, which took place during the reign of the emperorConstantine in 325 AD, was the first ecumenical (worldwide) conference ofbishops of the Christian Church. The participating bishops were given freetravel and lodging. The council, which was also called a synod, dealt with theproblems created by the Aryan controversy, concerning the nature and status ofJesus. The Aryans had their own views of who Jesus really was. We must rememberthat Jesus spent most of his growing life, since the age of 12 or 13 in theEast, under the influence of several eastern religious philosophies and Aryanismwas just one of them. Finally the Synod decided against the Aryans and voted infavour of Trinitarianism, which suddenly made Jesus part of the Father and theHoly Spirit. This was a whole new twist to the New Testament and the HolyTrinity was born. Another outcome of the council was an agreement by the bishopsof all the Churches, to celebrate Easter on the same day. This was by far themost important celebration on the Church calendar, it was therefore importantfor all to celebrate the resurrection together. Constantine became such a strongvoice of Christianity that on his deathbed he was ordained as the 13th Apostle.These were the wild and wonderful early days of Christianity, when most of itsfoundations were laid. The editing of the Bible’s New Testament began to takeshape, but it would take another 800 years before the final version was decidedupon. This long process is filled with controversy because many books wereomitted while others were amended before they were included. A large number ofbooks known as the Apocrypha (hidden writings) have been the subject of muchcontroversy ever since they were deliberately excluded from the New Testament.It was during this period that one of the first recorded references to theCatholic Church emerged. This Catholic denomination of Christianity continued toexpand into what it has become today. The largest and most powerful wing of theChristian Church. This is what St. Cyril of Jerusalem (315 -386 AD) had to say:Why is the Church called Catholic?“The Church is called Catholic or universal because it has spread throughout theentire world, from one end of the Earth to the other. Again, it is calledCatholic because it teaches fully and unfailingly all the doctrines which oughtto be brought to men's knowledge, whether concerned with visible or invisiblethings, with the realities of heaven or the things of Earth. Another reason forthe name Catholic is that the Church brings under religious obedience allclasses of men, rulers and subjects, learned and unlettered. Finally, itdeserves the title Catholic because it heals and cures unrestrictedly every typeof sin that can be committed in soul or in body, and because it possesses withinitself every kind of virtue that can be named, whether exercised in actions orin words or in some kind of spiritual charism.”The Bible:The Bible is a very complex and controversial book, but it remains the mostsacred book of the Christian faith. It is regarded to be the ‘Word of God’,inspired by the Holy Spirit. It has been translated into 275 languages andpossibly more, but the origins of the Bible remain very unsettling, with toomany people having had too much influence over the final version. But as youwill see, there really is no ‘one’ final version of the Bible as various groupshave made their own changes and presented their copy as the ultimate word ofGod. The Old and New Testaments feel as if they should not be part of the samereligious philosophy. The one preaches “an eye for an eye” and exalts the ‘godof vengeance’ while the New Testament speaks of the ‘prince of peace’ and ‘godof Love’ and teaches us to love our enemy, instead of destroying them. It isgreat fodder for many sub-cults and sects within the Christian faith.The original documents of the New Testament: all the books are written in Greek,with the quotations from the Old Testament taken from the Septuagint. There are4,500 manuscripts in Greek, 67 papyrus, 2,578 parchment and 1,600 lectionariesmainly in the Codex of the Vatican, London, Paris, Cambridge and Washington.The Old Testament: These books were written mostly in Hebrew and Aramaic, somein Greek. None of the ‘original documents’ are in existence, but what we havetoday are mainly the Greek Bible and the Hebrew Bible. But then there are theDead Sea Scrolls, which are still a point of great controversy and concern forsome, because they once again raise the question, which of the books should beincluded in the Old Testament?The Greek Bible: the Septuagint originates from the 3rd century before Christ.It is the Greek translation done in Alexandria by a group of 72 rabbis, 6 fromeach one of the 12 tribes, and hence the name, Septuagint, was given to thetranslation. It has 46 books just like the actual Catholic Bible, and it was thecommon version of the Bible among the Jews during days of Christ and even afterChrist. It was the version used and quoted by the Evangelists and Apostles whenthey wrote the New Testament. It was translated to Syriac, Coptic, and Latin(The Vulgate of St. Jerome) in the 4th century AD.The ‘Hebrew Bible’ or Masoretic Text: Written in the 6th to 10th centuries afterChrist, by a group of scholars from Babylon and Palestine, introducing vowelsand accent signs to the Hebrew scripts. And of course, they also used theSeptuagint to produce it. It has 39 books, like the Protestant Bibles.The Dead Sea Scrolls are very important, because they are written in Hebrew,dating from the 3rd century BC, while the oldest Hebrew Bible, the Masoretic,dates from 700 years after Christ. With the discovery of the ‘Scrolls’ itsuddenly pushed back the curtain some 1,000 years on the earliest Hebrewdocuments. In the Scrolls, every book of the Bible is represented with aremarkable similarity to the later scriptures in Greek and Hebrew. This was avery important, yet controversial discovery surrounding the Old Testament.The Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant Bibles:There are a total of 73 books in the Catholic and Orthodox Bibles, but only 66books in the Protestant Bibles. The Old Testament is the same as the JewishTanakh. The Catholic Bibles have 46 books, as the Bible of the Jewish ofAlexandria, who wrote the Septuagint, the version quoted by the Apostles in theGospels and Epistles. The Protestant Bibles have 39 books, as does the Bible ofthe Jews from Palestine.They do not have the following:4 Historic Books: Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees. (and additions toEsther)2 Wisdom Books: Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus of Ben Sirach. 1 PropheticBook: Baruch, and parts of Daniel - The Prayer of Azariah, the Song of the ThreeYoung Men, Bel and the Dragon, and Susana.The New Testament has 27 books in all the Bibles. The ‘Four Gospels’ areessentially the heart of the Bible. Some religious authors see the name ofChrist on every page of the Old Testament and claim that it “prefigures andcharacterises” the Christ of the Gospels and His Church. But my research hasshown that the first time the word/name Christ ever appears in the Bible, is inMatthew 1:1 of the New Testament. There is however a constant reminder of the‘Saviour’ which is mentioned the first time in Deuteronomy 32:15, the fifth bookof the Bible; Messiah is mentioned in Matthew 1:1 for the first time; and Jesusalso in Matthew 1:1. Jesus was, and still is, a man’s name. ‘Christ’ means the“chosen one”, which became associated with the name ‘Jesus’ after his ‘supposed’resurrection. But the inexplicable absence of the name of Christ in the earlybooks of the Bible, is filled with suspicious undertones. Because the OldTestament talks generically about a number of prophets or saviours, but only onesuddenly emerged, which happened to have been Jesus Christ. I find this highlysuspicious. Could not even one of the prophets of the Old Testament have namedJesus? I suggest that the ‘gods’ were preparing mankind for a saviour but theywere not quite sure which ‘one’ of the prophets they had lined up, was going tostrike a chord with the people of the time.One of the most fascinating and yet disturbing things about the books of theBible and their many relatives who did not make it into the Bible, is that abunch of men sitting around a boardroom table, some 350 years after the death ofChrist, decided on the fate of all the writings. The books that made it arecalled Canonical, which could be translated to mean ‘according to the Christianset of laws’ or possibly even ‘inspired by God’. They sat with a pile of bookswhich mostly had the same authors, and yet some were deemed to be canonical andothers not. This is very puzzling to me, but it obviously made a great deal ofsense to the decision makers way back then, because some of those writingscontained things which did not really fit their structured image of what theChristian Church should represent.Some facts about the Deutero-canonical and Apocryphal Books:Deutero-canonical (second canon), was the term used in 1566 by the RomanCatholic Church, meaning that their canonicity was recognised only after aperiod of time. They are included in the Greek Septuagint scriptures of thethird century BC, but they are not included in the Hebrew Masoretic scripturesfrom the 7th century AD. Some fragments of these books have also been discoveredamong the Dead Sea Scrolls. Strangely enough, they are included in the Catholicand Orthodox Bibles, but they are usually not included in the Protestant Bibles.The Deutero-canon include the following books and parts of books:- Historical: Tobit, Judith, First and Second Maccabees, Additions to Esther -Wisdom: Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach (also called Ecclesiasticus). - Prophets:Baruch, the Letter of Jeremiah (in Baruch), and parts of Daniel: The Prayer ofAzariah, the Song of the Three Young Men, Bel and the Dragon, and Susana.The Apocrypha (hidden things/writings):This is a collection of books written mostly by authors of other books of theBible, but the Apocrypha were not included in any of the Bibles. They deal withChristian and Biblical themes, some from the times of the Old Testament, othersfrom the times of the New Testament.Apocrypha of the Old Testament times:There are over 25 books; this is a list of some: Acts of Adam, Apocalypse ofAdam, Abraham, Testament of Adam, Book of Enoch, Enoch II (Book of the Secretsof Enoch), Book of Noah, Apocalypse of Barach (I), Apocalypse of Barach (II),Apocalypse of Daniel, Apocalypse of Elijah, Apocalypse of Enoch, Apocalypse ofEzra (Esdras), Apocalypse of Solomon, Odes of Solomon, Testament of Isaac,Martyrdom of Isaiah, Apocalypse of Zephaniah, Paralipomena of Jeremiah,Apocryphon of Ezekiel, Ascension of Isaiah, Assumption of Moses, Baruch III,Baruch IV, Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, Acts of Solomon, Chronicles of theKings of Judah, Maccabee III, Maccabee IV.Apocrypha of the New Testament -Christian Apocrypha:There are over 40 books this is a list of some: 14 Gospels, by Thomas, James,Peter, Bartholomew... 15 Acts, by Andrew, Peter, Matthew, John, Thomas, Paul...6 Revelations, by Paul, Thomas, John, Virgin Mary, Stephen, Peter... Acts ofJohn, Acts of Paul, Acts of Paul and Thecla, Acts of Peter, Apocalypse of James(I), Apocalypse of James (II), Apocalypse of Peter, Apocalypse of Philip,Apocalypse of Stephan, Apocalypse of Thomas, Apocryphon of John, Epistle ofPontius Pilate, Gospel of Nicodemus, Gospel of Perfection, Gospel of Philip,Gospel of Peter, Revelation of Peter, Protevangelium of James, Gospel of theBirth of Mary, Gospel of the Hebrews, Gospel of the Infancy of Jesus Christ,Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Truth, History of Joseph, Letter of Paul to theAlexandrians, Testament of the Lord, Wisdom of Jesus.So how do we know which books belong to the Bible? Or as the Church would callit, the ‘canon’of the Bible?Answer? “Because the Church tells us so!”. St. Augustine goes on convincingly tosay that “if the Church won't tell me these Books are the Bible, I won't believeit”.This is a perfect example of the ‘master-slave’ relationship between the ancientgods and the primitive slave species, which I postulate in this book. Humankindis told ‘do not question, do not doubt, stay fearful, your reward will begreat’. None of the books of the New Testament were even written by the timeJesus was crucified, and yet he was the prophet who made his mark on humanity.All the other prophets suddenly became irrelevant as Jesus rose to take thecentre stage. There is so much preparation and expectation for over a thousandyears of the coming of the saviour, and yet we only find out his name after hisbirth. Does that not strike you as very suspicious? There are another 35 books,dealing with themes of the Old and New Testaments. They are attributed to Enoch,Moses, Solomon, St. Paul, St. Thomas, St. James, St. Peter, Virgin Mary; andthey are also not in the Bible, because the Church says so!But in 1517, the Christian Church, which was completely controlled by theCatholics, was shocked when Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door ofthe Church of All Saints in Wittenberg, which was used as a customary noticeboard, inviting the priests to a debate. The letter challenged the teachings ofthe Roman Catholic Church on the nature of penance, the authority of the popeand the usefulness of indulgences. They sparked a theological debate that wouldresult in the birth of the Protestant, Lutheran, Reformed, and Anabaptisttraditions within Christianity. This was the real beginning of the ProtestantReformation and the split from the Catholics by many who felt uncomfortable withthe violent stranglehold of the Catholic Church. The letter contained 95 pointsoutlining what was essentially wrong with the teachings of the Church.After disregarding Luther as “a drunken German who wrote the Theses; when soberhe will change his mind,” Pope Leo X ordered the Dominican professor oftheology, Silvester Mazzolini, to inquire into the matter. Prierias recognisedLuther's dangerous potential, declared him a heretic and wrote a scholasticrefutation of the Theses. It asserted papal authority over the Catholic church,and denounced every departure from it as a heresy. You have to remember thatLuther was playing with his life. He could have been charged with variousoffences for doing this, but his dislike for the Catholics was so intense thatit became his passion. Even so, the following excerpt from a letter shows hissubservience to the Catholics. The tone in which it is written may have been thestyle of the day, but one can almost smell the anxious fear between the lines,knowing his days may be numbered. He even uses the word 'fear' in the openinglines of the letter below. Is it not ironic that we are talking about therepresentatives of the ‘House of God’ who were supposed to be the disciples oflove and peace? But as we discover in this book, our creator and god, did nothave those benevolent characteristics in his personal arsenal.Letter to the Archbishop Albrecht of Mainz – 31 October 1517.“ To the Most Reverend Father in Christ and Most Illustrious Lord, Albrecht ofMagdeburg and Mainz, Archbishop and Primate of the Church, Margrave ofBrandenburg, etc., his own lord and pastor in Christ, worthy of reverence andfear, and most gracious. The grace of God be with you in all its fullness andpower!Spare me, Most Reverend Father in Christ and Most Illustrious Prince, that I,the dregs of humanity, have so much boldness that I have dared to think of aletter to the height of your Sublimity. The Lord Jesus is my witness that,conscious of my smallness and baseness, I have long deferred what I am nowshameless enough to do, moved thereto most of all by the duty of fidelity whichI acknowledge that I owe to your most Reverend Fatherhood in Christ. Meanwhile,therefore, may your Highness deign to cast an eye upon one speck of dust, andfor the sake of your pontifical clemency to heed my prayer.”Luther had a very clear opinion on the Church of the time, believing that theCatholics were only interested in lining their pockets and controlling peoplewith fear. “Many of the fanatics of our day pronounce words of faith, but theybear no good fruit, because their purpose is to turn men to their perverseopinions.” He also had his views on the Aryans who were so prominent in theshaping of Christ's philosophies.“The Aryans were sharp fellows. Admitting that Christ had two natures, and thatHe is called “very God of very God” they were yet able to deny His divinity. TheAryans took Christ for a noble and perfect creature, superior even to theangels, because by Him God created heaven and Earth. Mohammed also speaks highlyof Christ. But all their praise is mere palaver to deceive men.”I do admit that I share Luther's concern about the ‘brutality’ of god, as taughtby the Church in 1517 and as it still continues to do today.“I hated the just God who punishes sinners. In silence, if I did not blaspheme,then certainly I grumbled vehemently and got angry at God. I said, ‘Isn't itenough that we miserable sinners, lost for all eternity because of original sin,are oppressed by every kind of calamity through the Ten Commandments? Why doesGod heap sorrow upon sorrow through the Gospel and through the Gospel threatenus with his justice and his wrath?’ This was how I was raging with wild anddisturbed conscience.”Luther initially preached tolerance towards the Jewish people, convinced thatthe reason they had never converted to Christianity was that they werediscriminated against, or that they had never heard the Gospel of Christ.However, after his overtures failed to convince Jewish people to adoptChristianity, he began preaching that the Jews were set in evil, anti-Christianways, and needed to be expelled from the German body politic. He repeatedlyquoted the words of Jesus, in Matthew 12:34, where Jesus called the Jewishreligious leaders (Pharisees and Sadducees) of his day “a brood of vipers andchildren of the devil”. In the book written three years before his death, Lutherlisted seven recommendations how to deal with the Jews:“I shall give you my sincere advice: First, to set fire to their synagogues orschools and to bury and cover with dirt whatever will not burn, so that no manwill ever again see a stone or cinder of them.... Second, I advise that theirhouses also be razed and destroyed. For they pursue in them the same aims as intheir synagogues. Instead they might be lodged under a roof or in a barn, likethe gypsies.... Third, I advise that all their prayer books and Talmudicwritings, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are taught, betaken from them.Fourth, I advise that their rabbis be forbidden to teach henceforth on pain ofloss of life and limb... Fifth, I advise that safe-conduct on the highways beabolished completely for the Jews... Sixth, I advise that usury be prohibited tothem, and that all cash and treasure of silver and gold be taken from them andput aside for safekeeping...Seventh, I recommend putting a flail, an axe, a hoe, a spade, a distaff, or aspindle into the hands of young, strong Jews and Jewesses and letting them earntheir bread in the sweat of their brow, as was imposed on the children of Adam(Gen. 3:19)...”In spite of these seven recommendations, he added:“... But if we are afraid that they might harm us or our wives, children,servants, cattle, etc., if they had to serve and work for us for it isreasonable to assume that such noble lords of the world and venomous, bitterworms are not accustomed to working and would be very reluctant to humblethemselves so deeply before the accursed Goyim then let us emulate the commonsense of other nations such as France, Spain, Bohemia, etc., compute with themhow much their usury has extorted from us, divide this amicably, but then ejectthem forever from the country. For, as we have heard, God's anger with them isso intense that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse and worse, whilesharp mercy will reform them but little. Therefore, in any case, away withthem!”Luther's harsh comments about the Jews are seen by many as a continuation ofmedieval Christian anti-Semitism, and as the above quote shows, reflects earlieranti-Semitic expulsions in the 14th century, when Jews from other countries likeFrance and Spain were invited into Germany. Since Luther's statements werewidely read at the time, it is possible that this doctrine fed anti-Semitism,leading to the Nazi era about four centuries later. Early Nazi leaders loved toquote these particular statements of Luther.Does this rosy picture of our Christian history not disturb you yet? Itcertainly disturbs me greatly to see the shallow moral values, lack of respectfor humanity, hatred of others, infinite conceit and everything that flies inthe face of the ‘Love of God’. These are the foundations upon which ourunshakable faith is standing today. Are you not concerned? Are you happy toaccept it? Or can you see that something has gone wrong somewhere in the distantpast, to have caused this unacceptable situation?But the angry Martin Luther went a lot further in criticising the Church and theJews. In accord with his posture as restorer of Christianity, he took it uponhimself to judge various books of the Bible as ‘God's holy Word’. This was not ahealthy situation for him. This is what he had to say about some of the books ofthe Old Testament:“We have no wish either to see or hear Moses... Job is merely the argument of afable... Ecclesiastes ought to have been more complete. There is too muchincoherent matter in it, Solomon did not, therefore, write this book... The bookof Esther I toss into the Elbe. I am such an enemy to the book of Esther that Iwish it did not exist, for it Judaises too much and has in it a great deal ofheathenish naughtiness ... The history of Jonah is so monstrous that it isabsolutely incredible. . .”The books of the New Testament fared no better. He rejected the following fromthe canon – Hebrews, James, Jude and the Apocalypse. Instead, he placed them atthe end of his translation, after the others, which he called “the true andcertain capital books of the New Testament” – “St. John is the only sympathetic,the only true Gospel and should undoubtedly be preferred to the others. In likemanner the Epistles of St. Peter and St. Paul are superior to the first threeGospels.” The Epistle to the Hebrews did not suit him either: “It need notsurprise one to find here bits of wood, hay, and straw.” Luther denounced TheEpistle of St. James as “an epistle of straw.” – “I do not hold it to be hiswriting, and I cannot place it among the capital books.” He held this viewbecause it proclaimed the necessity of good works, contrary to his heresy.“There are many things objectionable in this book”, is what he said aboutApocalypse. “I feel an aversion to it, and to me this is a sufficient reason forrejecting it.”Now that we have dealt with the largest and possibly the most confusing of theworld’s religions, let us have a quick look at the rest of the major worldreligions, demonstrating the chaos that exists amongst humanity in a desperateattempt to find their roots. The information given is intended to provide ashort introduction to the major religions as defined classically. Eachdescription has been kept short and as uncomplicated as possible.Hinduism. Origin circa 4000 BC.Hinduism is the most complex religious system that has evolved on Earth. It isalmost impossible to define it. But the origins of Hinduism can be traced to theIndus Valley civilisation sometime between 4000 and 2500 BC. The origins arevery murky and the influence of the early settlers in this part of the world,called the Vedas, must have played a crucial role in the origins of Hinduism,because the Vedic scriptures form pretty much the largest part of the Hindusacred texts. There was however another group of people who had a huge impact onHindu evolution, they were called the Aryans. This group of highly skilled,highly educated, industrialised and technologically advanced people had aprofound influence on all the Near Eastern and Indus religions. The Aryanhistory is equally murky and their true origin and source of knowledge is verymysterious. But, they were there in large numbers to influence the Hindus, Jews,Christ and Christians and all the other global cultures for over 2,000 years.But as much as some historians claim that the Aryans began to write the Vedaswhen they arrived in the Indus Valley, this is argued against very strongly byother scholars who have shown a Vedic presence and culture in the region as farback as 8000 BC. The Vedas were in possession of their Vedic poems in oral formfor thousands of years before they were finally written down. There are howeverothers who have presented astounding evidence that the Vedas may have been ableto write as far back as 8000 BC. This is at least 3,000 years before the nextknown script emerged.So let's take a quick look at these Aryans who also populated and conqueredEurope. They inspired a very early class structure based on skin colour, theywere the earliest colonialists and even inspired modern-day warriors likeHitler. Scholars believe that these Aryans originated from somewhere in NorthernMesopotamia, south west of the Black Sea in eastern Anatolia (Turkey). They aredescribed as light-skinned or ‘whites’ who spoke a very early proto-Europeanlanguage from which all the latter European languages evolved. This is fantasticnews to feed my theory because according to the Sumerian tablets the Igigi, (whowere the astronauts who looked after the base on Mars, while the Anunnaki werethose on Earth) came to Earth after the year of the Flood and took Earthlingfemales for their wives. They were treated almost as outcasts by the Anunnaki inSumer and therefore they moved away establishing their own community in a landof their own. And guess where they moved to? They went north towards themountainous areas of Anatolia, south east of the Black Sea, and to the Cedarmountains where Enlil had spent much of his time as well. They were very whiteskinned and their community grew rapidly as they shared their knowledge andtechnology with their new human offspring. The new race of humans that emergedout of this cohabitation was also white, and confident, because of their ‘godly’ancestry. From there they infiltrated most of Asia and Europe spreading theircivilisation and language. As a result the languages spoken in India actuallyfall into the various Indo-European languages. Latin, Greek, Hittite, Sanskrit,French, German, Latvian, English, Spanish, Russian and others, are allIndo-European (IE) languages; or more properly Proto-Indo-European (PIE), whichis the lost ancestral language from which those languages originated. TheIndo-European language used the term ‘Aryan’ to classify a group of people notonly racially, but also ethnically based on the type of accent or ‘Aryan speech’the people spoke. This should have been expected however. It is fascinating tosee how the gods who created Humankind as a lower slave species, immediatelyclassified them in a lower ethnic class, giving birth to slavery and racismright at the beginning of humanity. Arya, meaning ‘noble’, appears in variousIndo-European languages. Once again this should be expected from the Igigi godswho regarded themselves as way superior to lesser mortal humans. They probablyused the plural of the word ‘Aryas nobles’ to describe themselves prior to theirdispersal. It may even have survived in Eire (Ireland), but it certainlysurvives in Iran where they are referred to as “Airyanam vaejo” – ‘realm of theAryans’. The discovery of thousands of such cognate words in widely separatedlanguages, along with similar grammatical structures, led philologists toconclude, early in the nineteenth century, that most European languages hadevolved from a common proto-language spoken millennia ago.Greek, Latin and Sanskrit were considered the closest languages to PIE, and muchof the reconstructed Aryan proto-language is based on them. Modern Lithuanian isthought to be the most archaic living language, closer to the original Aryanspeech than any other. Tocharian is an Indo-European language which had beenspoken in Chinese Turkestan, indicating that the Aryans reached as far as Chinain the Far East. The only possible explanation of how they could have had suchan impact on the entire European and Asian ancient history, is because they weremore advanced, or possibly even related to the ancient ‘gods’ of Sumer. And thatis exactly who they were. A ‘white’ blend between Igigi gods and mortal humanswho suddenly saw themselves in a higher bracket than the rest of the mortalbeings on Earth. A recent discovery of the remains of blond-haired people inChina is a large missing piece of the Great Human Puzzle, which is beginning totake shape very quickly under the watchful eye of science as it shows how farthe Aryans explored.Perhaps the most famous proof for the prehistoric existence of PIE is the wordfor king: ‘rex’ in Latin, ‘raja’ in Sanskrit, ‘ri’ in Old Irish, along with ahost of others, all are obviously variants of a common word for king. And sincenone of the peoples speaking these various languages were in physical contactwith one another during the historical period, for which written records doexist, comparative philologists claim that their respective languages must haveevolved from a single proto-language. The Aryans worshipped a sky-god, theytraced descent through the male line, they raised cattle, they drank mead, theyused horse-drawn chariots which they probably invented as weapons of war, whichincluded bronze and iron. The civilisations of Asia were completely outclassedand outsmarted by the Aryans when they arrived.Aryans, or more specifically Indo-Aryans, make their first notable appearance inhistory around 2000 BC as invaders of Northern India. This event holds firm withthe behaviour of Anunnaki god Marduk, who was proclaiming himself as 'god aboveall' at that time. The result of the conflict between the Anunnaki in thebiblical lands is well documented and outlined in the last chapter. It washowever around 2000 BC when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by the Anunnaki'snuclear and biological weapons, which forced many inhabitants of the surroundinglands to flee and evacuate. Remember that the white Aryans (Igigi) were Marduk'sfollowers, so when they suddenly made their appearance in the Indus Valley, theancient Vedic tales begin to carry much of the content dealing with theseinvasions and subjugation of the dark-skinned inhabitants.The Sanskrit Rig Veda, a collection of religious texts still revered by modernHindus, carry enigmatic records of such events. This is another perfect exampleof how historians have scrambled our brains over time, because suddenly we havemythological gods clashing with actual historic people. Hindus see this ashistory, while others have described it as mythology. So if the invading ‘Aryangods’ were mythological, who are the Vedic poems referring to? Who was actuallyinvading the Indian lands? Or were they just imagining that too? How can youhave a situation where half of the historic records is deemed to be acceptable,but the other half is ‘just a figment of their imagination, because they hadnothing better to do’? These events surrounding the Aryan invasion of Indus areof paramount importance to the credibility of the ancient ‘gods’. Because thereis no other time and place in history where we have such detailed description ofhistoric interaction between gods and men, outlining the superiority of the godsand the subservience which was forced upon the humans. In the following extractfrom a Vedic poem (Rig Veda 1.53) the local people were referred to as theDasyus.ARYAN INVASION[../Images/284-1.jpg]“Indra (Norse-Thor, Celtic-Taranis) has torn open the fortresses of the Dasyus,which in their wombs hid the black people. He created land and water for Manu(Aryan man); Lower than all besides, hast thou, O Indra, cast down the Dasyus,abject tribes of Dasas; After slaying the Dasyus, let Indra with his whitefriends win land, let him win the sun and water; Indra subdued the Dasyus colourand drove it into hiding.\" With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, Thou,far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten kings ...Thou goest from fight tofight, intrepidly destroying castle after castle here with strength.” (RV 1.53)The Aryans were remarkably expansionist and almost everywhere they went theyconquered and subjugated the indigenous peoples, imposing their languages andtheir religious beliefs on the natives. In turn, they received contributionsfrom the people whom they conquered. The Aryans had very strong links to theEssenes sect of Hebrews, to which Joseph and Jesus belonged. There is someevidence that it was the Aryans who sponsored Jesus to travel the East and learnthe cultures. Aryan invasions had been going on for millennia, as far back as4000 BC and probably even further back, when they first began to conquer Europe.Most of the contemporary inhabitants of Europe, along with their respectiveearly national cultures, are the result of interaction between successive wavesof white Aryan invaders and their culture. Therefore almost all modern Europeanlanguages are members of the Western branch of the Indo-European family tree.The birth of a European culture predates the arrival of the Indo-Europeans. Thedescendants of the biblical ‘Nefilim’ and their earthling children moved awayfrom Sumer according to the clay tablets. They settled in distant lands whichcan only be identified as prehistoric Europe. They were also white and moretechnologically advanced because they possessed some of the Anunnaki’s geneticpool and influence. This means that the coming together of the Old Europeans andthe Aryans, actually brought together two opposite sides of the advanced whiteAnunnaki children who had interbred with Earthling females, as is so eloquentlyoutlined in Genesis. The cave art of Lascaux, which some have identified as thefirst flowering of Western man's creative genius, was the work of Old Europeans.Stonehenge in the North and the Minoan Palace culture of Crete in the South areother examples. A pan-European religious symbolism had already evolved but onceagain much of it was later incorporated into IE mythologies, including variousregional adaptations of European reverence for the Mother Goddess. Many of theprincipal figures in Greek mythology predate the arrival of the Aryans, whichmeans they must have arrived with the Nefilim from Sumer. This would have beenthe other group of Anunnaki offspring, who married earthling females and starteda whole new race of humans; a white and domineering race. During the course ofancient history, Old European religious beliefs and practices continuallyreasserted themselves, such as the image of the Minoan snake goddess, from thePalace of Minos, circa 1600 BC, but it probably has much older origins.Europe is European because the conquerors and the conquered were members of thesame white race, different branches on the same family tree. One came in fromthe South-West while the others, mainly Aryans, arrived from the North East.India is a morass of poverty because the bulk of the conquered, with whom theIndo-Aryans eventually intermarried, were non-white Veddoids. The lesson isobvious. Even today high-caste Hindus can still be identified by their Caucasianfeatures and light skin, and the poorest and most ‘backward’ parts of India aregenerally the darkest. Were the Aryans the original promoters of ‘apartheid’? Itcertainly looks like it. Where else would modern Europeans have got it from?Everything we have and we know was handed down to us by our ancient ancestors,the Sumerians, who were taught everything they knew by the Anunnaki gods. If weextrapolate this timeline a little further back in time to the point of thecreation of ‘Adamu’ and we analyse how the whole human race issue was handled bythe gods for thousands of years right up to the rapid expansion andglobalisation by the Anunnaki under the leadership of Marduk, which included theIgigi, who were actually the Aryans, we arrive at the conclusion that ‘god’ ourmaker, was the first racist. It is very disturbing to discover that the wiseAnunnaki gods who settled on this planet with all their knowledge could allowsuch disorganised chaos to evolve. But maybe that is exactly what they had inmind – divide and rule. Keep the slave species subjugated at all cost. Recentgenetic studies have indicated that the Basques of Aquitaine and the Pyreneesare probably the purest form of Old European as they existed prior to thearrival of Indo-European invaders. They evidently emerged from the invasions ofEurope unconquered, and they remained sufficiently isolated to retain their ownunique, non-IE language.Now that we have dealt with the very important issue of the Aryans, we canreturn to the Hindus and their religious and cultural development before andafter the influence of the Aryans. While many believe that Hinduism is apolytheistic religion which worships many gods, the basis of Hinduism is thebelief in the unity of everything. This totality is called Brahman. The purposeof life is to realise that we are part of God, and that by doing so, we canleave this plane of existence and rejoin with God. This enlightenment can onlybe achieved by going through cycles of rebirth, life and death known as‘samsara’. And yet the major part of this religious practice is to worship thegod Vishnu, who seems to be the prominent god; or Shiva or the goddess Shakti;or their many other incarnations, aspects, spouses or progeny.In Hinduism, one’s progress towards enlightenment is measured by one’s karma,which is the accumulation of all one’s good and bad deeds, and which determinesthe person’s next reincarnation. Selfless acts and thoughts as well as devotionto God, will help one to be reborn at a higher level in the caste system. Badacts and thoughts will cause one to be born at a lower level, as a person orpossibly even as an animal. Hindus follow a strict system called ‘caste’, whichdetermines the social importance or standing of each person. The caste which oneis born into is the result of the karma from their previous life. Only membersof the highest caste, the Brahmins, may perform the Hindu religious rituals andhold positions of authority within the temples. The earliest cultures inMesopotamia were building many temples to the different gods presiding overindividual villages. It is curious that historians refer to those as ‘mythology’and yet, the Hindu sects are still practising this form of religious worshiptoday. But in India it is called a religion and nobody will dare to call theirgods mythological figures. Just as the gods in the Sumerian tablets had varioustowns or villages to look after, and were worshipped as such, so are Hindu godsstill worshipped today – different gods in different villages. Hindus join asect by undergoing initiation and learning the sacred ‘mantra’ of that sect,which is presented to them by the ‘guru’. The mantra is in the form of an ‘Om’homage to the god which the sect belongs to and is normally the god of thatvillage.But the entire vast Hindu family of sects and offshoots emerged from theproto-Hindu culture known as the Veda, which originated in the Indus Valley. TheRig Veda is the oldest of the collection of Vedic hymns and is the oldest livingreligious literature in the world, predating the Bible by thousands of years.The total collection of Vedic poems or hymns consists of 1,028 hymns to theVedic deities. The origin of these can be traced back to around 8000 BCaccording to some scholars. Incredibly they survived for thousands of years bybeing handed down in the oral tradition until they were finally written down.The Vedas are the most sacred scriptures of Hinduism. According to tradition,“when God creates the worlds, He reveals the Vedas for the welfare of the worldsand when He ends the creation, He takes them back again”. Some people say thatall human knowledge is available in the Vedas in symbolic form and that theknowledge of all our discoveries and inventions is already contained in theVedas. It is true that the Vedas are not mere books of some magical chants butthey are loaded with ancient historical knowledge from a time before time, whichreveals itself step by step. They are Rig Veda; Sama Veda; Yajur Veda andAtharva Veda.The Atharva Veda is different from the other three Veda collections, in that itcontains spells and incantations for medicinal purposes, magical aids to victoryin battle and so on. The Vedic collections are complemented by a series of workscalled the Brahmanas, which are devoted to the explanation of the hymns, theirritual applications and their mythology. It is the Vedic books called theAranyakas and Upanishads which push the religion towards a monistic philosophy.It is only in the pages of the Upanishads that we first find references to deathand rebirth of the soul, and not in the much older Vedas. It seems as if theAryans had a lot to do with the writing of these scriptures, most likely for thepurpose of enslaving the locals with religious dogma. The rather strange and‘non-Hindu’ contents of the Upanishads resembles the assertions of the followersof Marduk, promising humans an eternal afterlife, but only if they behavedthemselves, and followed god's commands. They did this very successfully inEgypt with the Pharaohs, but in the Indus Valley they added a very juicytwist... if you do not obey god's commands, you will be reborn as a dirtyanimal. This was actually a brilliant form of mental torture. The people werealready experiencing hardship on Earth, waiting to escape it. There could benothing more horrific than the thought of having to return to this realm to livein harsher conditions than before. And so these descendants of the Sumerian godswere on the move, conquering and subjugating humans in their path.There are so many rituals and different cultural applications by the varioussects of Hinduism, that it would take up the rest of this book and much more tobegin to capture it all. The fascinating thing about Hinduism, is its murkyorigin in distant prehistory, where the Vedic poems originated. Every singlepoem deals with one or more ancient gods in various ways. Either praising him orher, exalting them, worshipping, asking for favour, wisdom, wealth, courage andthousands of other human needs. It seems as if the people of those early dayshad a very different relationship with their gods when compared to the modernHindus. What is even more interesting, is that those early Vedic gods resembledthe ancient Sumerian gods to perfection. They had similar functions,denominations, characters and personalities and all other aspects of theirbeing. They liked their material offerings of gold and food, just like theirSumerian counterpart gods, and they could be equally brutal in dispensingpunishment to unlucky followers. And yet on different occasions they wouldreward their obedient followers with material wealth. According to the Sumerianclay tablets it was the talented goddess of love, Inanna, who was given thisAsian domain to look after. Is it not strange that her high sexual appetite andlove for poetry and music, turned out to be the cultural centrepiece of theIndian people? But it goes even further. There is a plethora of references tothe gods of Sumer, mirrored in the Vedic poems. We see them riding in skychariots, displaying all kinds of fierce weapons, slaying their foes with easeby using weapons that closely resemble both the biblical descriptions, and thoseof the Sumerian tablets. During excavation in Harappa, one of the largestancient Indus cities, the predominant effigies, statues and references foundwere to the “Great Mother Goddess”. The same Mother Goddess who was very activein Old European civilisations. Little statues and figurines of this celestialdeity were scattered all over the Indus Valley, Western Asia and even theAegean. I am of the firm belief that these statues represented the goddess oflove and war, Inanna or Ishtar as she was known to her Anunnaki godly family.A most fascinating link to the creation of Humankind comes to us in the Laws ofManu. This ‘revealed scripture’ comprises 2,684 verses, divided into 12 chapterspresenting the norms of domestic, social, and religious life in India. There issome disagreement among scholars about the exact date when these scriptures werefirst penned. Some scholars date it back as far as 1500 BC, others place it at500 BC and some say that it is a copy of much earlier writings only capturedaround 200 AD. Regardless of the date, the Laws of Manu or ‘Manava DharmaShastra’ is one of the standard books in the Hindu canon, and a basic text forall gurus to base their teachings on. It is fundamental to the understanding ofancient Indian society and traditionally accepted as one of the supplementaryarms of the Vedas. But what interests me most are verses 16 - 29 of Chapter 1.As you will see below, the description of the ‘creation of mankind’ is uncannilyclose to the descriptions in the Sumerian tablets. How is that possible, unlessthere was a very close link to the Sumerian gods by one of their representativesin the Indus Valley. There were many gods in the valley organising the rise ofthat civilisation from thousands of years BC. So it should not surprise us tosee this kind of sharing of knowledge. Manu's text clearly suggests some kind ofgenetic engineering, DNA splicing and other biological manipulation by the godswhen they were creating mankind. This is an extract from Chapter 1 - The Laws ofManu translated by G. Buhler:“16. But, joining minute particles even of those six, which possess measurelesspower, with particles of himself, he created all beings. 17. Because those six(kinds of) minute particles, which form the (creator's) frame, enter (a-sri)these (creatures), therefore the wise call his frame sarira, (the body). 18.That the great elements enter, together with their functions and the mind,through its minute parts the framer of all beings, the imperishable one. 19. Butfrom minute body (framing) particles of these seven very powerful Purushassprings this (world), the perishable from the imperishable. 20. Among them eachsucceeding (element) acquires the quality of the preceding one, and whateverplace (in the sequence) each of them occupies, even so many qualities it isdeclared to possess. 21. But in the beginning he assigned their several names,actions, and conditions to all (created beings) even according to the words ofthe Veda. 22. He, the Lord, also created the class of the gods, who are endowedwith life, and whose nature is action; and the subtile class of the Sadhyas, andthe eternal sacrifice. 29. Whatever he assigned to each at the (first) creation,noxiousness or harmlessness, gentleness or ferocity, virtue or sin, truth orfalsehood, that clung (afterwards) spontaneously to it.” (Were the sevenPurushas the same seven Sumerian birth-mothers that gave birth to the first Homosapiens?)Much has been written about the origins of writing in the world. One of thestrongly argued topics is the origin of the Vedic scripts. While most willcontest with all their might that they cannot have existed in written form allthose thousands of years ago, long before writing was invented, there are somestrong arguments in favour of such a possibility. Is it at all possible thatover 1,000 Vedic poems could have survived thousands of years without havingbeen written down? It seems highly unlikely. But Humankind only started to writearound 4000 BC in the Near East, and 3400 BC in the Indus Valley. How could theVedic poems have been written down if human kind could not write yet? Justbecause no writing material had been excavated in India does not mean that theycould not write.Ellie Crystal from the remarkable www.crystalinks.com website has presented avery strong argument showing that it may actually be possible for the Vedicliterature to have been written down long before the time of the acceptedemergence of writing in the world. Rig Veda is accepted as the oldest existingliterature available to humans. It seems to be older than the Ramayan of atleast 5500 BC and some internal proto-Hindu evidence takes it as far back as23,000 BC. Other scholars place it at around 8000 BC. The point is that theymust have written all that literature down in some way, because it is highlyimprobable that they could have memorised such a vast amount of work. There area number of references which allude to the art of writing in the Rig Veda. Someof the references state that the seers “inscribed or engraved” words on certainmaterials, suggesting that they knew how to write. The Rig Veda 1-164-39 statesthat “In the letters (akshara) of the verses of the Veda...”.The Rig Vedic texts consists of a large number of compositional ‘chandas’, whichare very specific spatial arrangements of the lines in a metre, and tocomplicate it even more, a specific number of words per line. It would take atremendous amount of mental effort to compose and memorise so much material withall the specific intricacies involved. So unless these were reduced to writingand given a specific concrete shape, it would not have been possible to transferit orally.Yet another verse of Rig Veda 10-62-7 mentions how cows were marked “by an8-eight” which clearly shows that the ancients possessed the knowledge ofwriting.Rig Veda 10-71-4 refers to a language which can be “seen”, meaning that it musthave been in written script. If there was no written script at the time, surelythey would have used the verb ‘to pronounce or say’ rather than ‘toinscribe/write’? The only plausible reason for choosing to use these words, wasbecause a written form of language existed during that time.The art of writing was prevalent even during the Mahabharat era as the verb'lekhi' or ‘writing’ in all its forms like ‘lekhako, lekhani’ and others,appears numerous times in the Mahabharat text (Aadi 1.77/78). Their arrows wereinscribed with the names of specific persons to whom they belonged. Distinctionwas made between “to write” and “to read” in Harivansha texts, indicating to usthat ‘what was written, was also being read’.How could a text with over 100,000 verses be composed, preserved and transmittedthrough memory alone? I say it's impossible. You may believe otherwise. Butwhile such an incredible feat may have been performed by a few, it does notsuggest that the art of writing was not developed.The Atharvasheersha from the Upanishads scriptures symbolises Shree Ganesh as an‘omkar’which is a combination of ‘g-aakar, m-aakar’. How could a syllable whichwas transmitted ‘ONLY ORALLY’ have an ‘aakar’or ‘shape’?In the Mahabharat text from circa 3100 BC there are quotes from Rishi Vasisthaof the Ramayanic Era (at least 5500 BC) which include the expressions 'granth'or ‘manuscript’. If writing skills were not acquired at the time, how is itpossible that they would discuss the issues surrounding various manuscripts?The Yujurvedic Taittiriya Samhita and also the Atharvaveda utilize the word“likha” to ‘write’. Although these scriptures are not as ancient as the RigVeda, it shows that the art of writing was known by ancient Vedic peoples sinceremote times. R.N. Dandekar remarks, “There is, indeed, considerablecircumstantial and inferential character which enables us to perceive theexistence of writing even in the very early periods of Indian cultural history.It is true that the Veda has been handed down from generation to generationthrough oral tradition. It must not, however, be supposed that on that account,as is often erroneously done, that the art of writing was unknown in the earlyVedic age. The practice of oral transmission of Veda was adopted, not becausewritten copies of these texts were not available, but presumably because it wasbelieved that oral transmission alone was more conducive to the preservation ofthe magic-religious potency and the formal protection of those arts.”Let's take a look at some examples of the Vedic Hymns/Poems to see what possibleconnections there may have been between the ancient Indus civilisation and theAnunnaki gods of Sumer. In this first example, which is the Samaveda Decade 1Agni, we deal with so many of the same issues that the Sumerian tablets havecaptured, it is truly uncanny. We read about visible deities among men, dwellingplaces in the sky, gods of violence and gods of material reward. This could havebeen a poem recited by a Sumerian faithful:Samaveda - DECADE I Agni:“Come, Agni, praised with song, to feast and sacrificial offering: sitAs Hotar on the holy grass!O Agni, thou hast been ordained Hotar of every sacrifice,By Gods, among the race of men.Agni we choose as envoy, skilled performer of this holy rite,Hotar, possessor of all wealth.Served with oblation, kindled, bright, through love of song may Agni, bentOn riches, smite the Vritras dead!I laud your most beloved guest like a dear friend, O Agni, himWho, like a chariot, wins us wealth.Do thou, O Agni, with great might guard us from all malignity,Yea, from the hate of mortal man!O Agni, come; far other songs of praise will I sing forth to thee.Wax mighty with these Soma-drops!May Vatsa draw thy mind away even from thy loftiest dwelling place!Agni, I yearn for thee with song.Agni, Atharvan brought thee forth by rubbing from the sky, the head Of all whooffer sacrifice.O Agni, bring us radiant light to be our mighty succour, for Thou art ourvisible deity!”Because there are 1,028 of these poems and every single one carries some sort oflink to our Sumerian ancestry and the gods who flew around in their chariots,brandishing their weapons, I will only quote the appropriate few lines from asmall number of Vedic poems to demonstrate my point.Samaveda - DECADE VAgni:(Weapons with flames, travel to the sky, material wealth, blessing from thesky.)“Hence have these men gone up on high and mounted to the heights of heaven:On! conquer on the path by which Angirasas travelled to the skies!That thou mayst send us ample wealth,Shoot forth, O Agni, with thy flame: demolish them on every side!Break down the Yatudhana's strength, the vigour of the Rakshasa!Worship the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras and Adityas, allWho know fair sacrifices, sprung from Man, scattering blessings down!”Samaveda - DECADE IV Indra:(Black drop in the heart resembles the story of Mohammed at birth. This hadsomething to do with immortality or reviving someone from the dead. Sumeriantablets are also filled with similar content of resurrection by the flyinggods.)“The black drop sank in Ansumati's bosom, advancing with ten thousand roundabout it.Indra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted King laid down hisweapons.Flying in terror from the snort of Vritra all deities who were thy friendsforsook thee.So, Indra, with the Maruts be thy friendship: in all these battles thou shalt bethe victor.The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber who runs his circling coursewith many round him.Behold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died yesterday to-day isliving…”III Indra - Brihaspati:(The following Samavedas are filled with references to war, flames, heavenlyhosts, violence, anger and more.)“Indra, pitiless hero with unbounded anger,Victor in fight, unshaken and resistless-may he protect our armies in ourbattles!And let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly hosts that conquer anddemolish!Ours be the potent host of mighty Indra, King Varuna the Maruts, and Adityas!Uplifted is the shout of Gods who conquer, heightened Gods who cause the worldsto tremble.”IV Indra - Maruts:“Bristle thou up, O Maghavan, our weapons: excite the spirits, of my warringheroes!Urge on the strong steed's might, O Vyitra-slayer, and let the din of conqueringcars go Upward…”VIII Soma - Varuna:(This sounds similar to the ‘angels’ who came to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.They struck the aggressors down with blindness first.)“With immortality King Soma clothe thee!Blind, O my foemen, shall ye be, even as headless serpents areMay Indra slay each best of you when Agni's flame hath struck you down!”Hymn LXXXV - Maruts:(Gods delight in offerings of food; fly to the heavens; Tvastar makes a weaponfor Indra)“The Maruts have made heaven and Earth increase and grow: in sacrifices theydelight, the strong and wild.The Rudras have established their abode in heaven… they shine in bright attire,and on their fair limbs lay their golden ornaments,They drive away each adversary from their path,When ye have harnessed to your cars the spotted deer, urging the thunderbolt,Let your swift-gliding coursers bear you hitherward with their fleet pinions.Come ye forward with your arms.Sit on the grass; a wide seat hath been made for you: delight yourselves,O Maruts, in the pleasant food.Before the Maruts every creature is afraid: the men are like to Kings, terribleto behold.When Tvastar deft of hand had turned the thunderbolt, golden, with thousandedges, fashioned more skilfully, Indra received it to perform heroic deeds.”Hymn XIV - Visvedevas:(Rocket ships with flaming red rockets of fire?)“Let the swift steeds who carry thee, thought-yoked and dropping holy oil,Bring the Gods to the Soma draught.With all the Gods, with Indra, with Vayu, and Mitra's splendours, drink,Agni, the pleasant Soma juice.Harness the Red Mares to thy car, the Bays, O God, the flaming ones: With thosebring hitherward the Gods.”Hymn XXI - Indra-Agni:(Could ‘spacious view’ be referring to the heaven in the sky above?)“Watch ye, through this your truthfulness, there in the place of spacious viewIndra and Agni, send us bliss.”Hymn LXXXVIII - Maruts:“COME hither, Maruts, on your lightning laden cars, sounding with sweet songs,armed with lances, winged with steeds.Fly unto us with noblest food, like birds, O ye of mighty power.With their red-hued or, haply, tawny coursers which speed their chariots on,they come for glory.Brilliant like gold is he who holds the thunder. Earth have they smitten withthe chariot's felly.”This next poem is an astounding piece, which virtually paraphrases the claytablets of Sumer, outlining the marriage between gods and mortal humans,creating more civilised humans, who were taught all the skills they needed bythe gods to provide the global population with the food they so badly needed.This new breed of humans were also the future kings, priests and pharaohs ofEgypt with more power than mere mortals. They were the mouthpieces of the gods,delivering messages to the people. They often thought of themselves as gods.Hymn CLIX - Heaven and Earth:“I PRAISE with sacrifices mighty Heaven and Earth at festivals, the wise, theStrengtheners of Law.Who, having Gods for progeny, conjoined with Gods, through wonder­working wisdombring forth choicest boons.With invocations, on the gracious Father's mind, and on the Mother's greatinherent power I muse.Prolific Parents, they have made the world of life, and for their brood allround wide immortality.These Sons of yours well skilled in work, of wondrous power, brought forth tolife the two great Mothers first of all.To keep the truth of all that stands and all that moves, ye guard the station ofyour Son who knows no guile.They with surpassing skill, most wise, have measured out the Twins united intheir birth and in their home.They, the refulgent (brilliant) Sages, weave within the sky, yea, in the depthsof sea, a web for ever new.This is to-day the goodliest gift of Savitar: this thought we have when now theGod is furthering us.On us with loving-kindness Heaven and Earth bestow riches and various wealth andtreasure hundredfold!”Hymn XC - Visvedevas:(Benevolent gods who reward their faithful; immortal gods.)“For they are dealers forth of wealth, and, not deluded, with their might Guardevermore the holy laws.Shelter may they vouchsafe to us, Immortal Gods to mortal men, Chasing ourenemies away.May they mark out our paths to bliss, Indra, the Maruts, Pusan, and Bhaga, theGods to be adored.Sweet be our Father Heaven to us.”Hymn LXXXI - Indra:(This poem is very reminiscent of the rewards which god promised his chosenpeople, or individuals like Abraham and Moses, if they went to war and did whatwas commanded. God would promise great riches and rewards to those who obeyed,but punished those who did not. This was not only restricted as punishment for‘sin’ but also rewards for actually performing required tasks for god.)“THE men have lifted Indra up, the Vrtra slayer, to joy and strength:Him, verily, we invocate in battles whether great or small: be he our aid indeeds of might.Thou, Hero, art a warrior, thou art giver of abundant spoil.Strengthening e'en the feeble, thou aidest the sacrificer, thou givest theofferer ample wealth.When war and battles are on foot, booty is laid before the boldWhom wilt thou slay and whom enrich? Do thou, O Indra, make us rich.Mighty through wisdom, as he lists, terrible, he hath waxed in strength.Lord of Bay Steeds, strong-jawed, sublime, he in joined hands for glory's sakehath grasped his iron thunderbolt.He filled the Earthly atmosphere and pressed against the lights in heaven.None like thee ever hath been born, none, Indra, will be born like thee.Thou hast waxed mighty over all.”Hymn LXXXIX - Visvedevas:(There is no doubt that the gods of the Indus Valley were as unpredictable asthe gods of Sumer. The people never knew what kind of mood they were in, or whatexactly they should do to please them, not invoking their wrath. They even triedto befriend the gods.)“MAY powers auspicious come to us from every side, never deceived,unhindered, and victorious,That the Gods ever may be with us for our gain, our guardians day by dayunceasing in their care.May the auspicious favour of the Gods be ours, on us descend the bounty of therighteous Gods.The friendship of the Gods have we devoutly sought: so may the Gods extend ourlife that we may live.”Hymn XXII - Asvins and Others:(A clear reference to a chariot which reaches the heaven and we also read thatthe gods travelled far and wide over the world. There must have been times whenthe ‘gods’ were not present in India, but rather in the distant ‘seven regions’of the world as they say. But the ‘gods’ mostly stayed up in the heavens.)“We call the Asvins Twain, the Gods borne in a noble car, the best Ofcharioteers, who reach the heavens.The Gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence Visnu strodeThrough the seven regions of the Earth!Through all this world strode Visnu; thrice his foot he planted, and the wholeWas gathered in his footstep's dust.The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Visnu is,Laid as it were an eye in heaven.”Hymn CLXXXVI - Visvedevas:(God's chariots with missiles and mighty weapons; humans wanted to stay amongthe gods, in their areas; but humans were still slaves of the gods and toilingfor them in many ways.)“As on a fair bright day the arrow flieth o'er all the barren soil theirmissiles sparkle.…For power and might have they, their own possession. This is my reverentthought of you, ye Holy; may it inspire you, make you dwell among us,…Toiling for the Gods and seeking treasure. May we find strengthening food infull abundance.”Hymn XXIII - Brahmanaspati:(No harm will come to those who bring gifts to the gods and worship them.)“The awful car, Brhaspati, that quells the foe, slays demons, cleaves the stallof kine, and finds the light.Thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress o'ertakes not himwho offers gifts to thee.Him who hates prayer thou punishest, Brhaspati, quelling his wrath: herein isthy great mightiness.Brhaspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who fain wouldinjure us.Burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand, those who have scorned theein thy manifested might.Show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise: destroy the evilspeakers, O Brhaspati.”Hymn LXXV - Dawn:(Just as in the Sumerian tablets, here we discover that there were mortals whodid have sex with goddesses, or the other way around. ‘When the sons of the godssaw the daughters of man and had sex and children with them.’ But the Indianculture was driven by Inanna/Ishtar, goddess of love and war. It is evident fromthe poems that she was highly sexed and ready to fight at the drop of a hat. Shewanted things to be done her way in the lands that were given to her by godEnlil.)“BORN in the heavens the Dawn hath flushed, and showing her majesty is come asLaw ordaineth.She hath uncovered fiends and hateful darkness; best of Angirases, hath wakedthe pathways.Rouse us this day to high and happy fortune: to great felicity…Vouchsafe us manifold and splendid riches, famed among mortals, man-befriendingGoddess!She yokes her chariot far away, and swiftly visits the lands where the FiveTribes are settled,Looking upon the works and ways of mortals, Daughter of Heaven, the world'sImperial Lady.On her all-lovely car she comes, the Fair One, and brings rich treasure for herfaithful servant.True with the True and Mighty with the Mighty, with Gods a Goddess, Holy withthe Holy,”Rig Vedas - Vayu & Others:(We often hear of thunder when the gods come down from the skies. That would notbe surprising since their ‘rocket ships’ would make a lot of noise. It is alsodescribed when they go to battle and the gods are with them, slaying their foeswith their mighty space ships.)“Fierce comes the Maruts' thundering voice, like that of conquerors, when ye goforward to victory, O Men.Born of the laughing lightning… may the Maruts guard us everywhere May they begracious unto Us.”Hymn C - Visnu:(Immortality among the gods was greatly admired by humans, who all desired it.In the Sumerian tablets we also read about the large homes or dwellings inplaces which were out of bounds to humans, which the gods built for themselves,often admired by humans. Sometimes the gods would go away into the sky, othertimes to their splendid dwellings on Earth.)“Foremost be Visnu, stronger than the strongest: for glorious is his name wholives for ever.Over this Earth with mighty step strode Visnu, ready to give it for a home toManu.In him the humble people trust for safety: he, nobly born, hath made themspacious dwellings.Yea, I the poor and weak praise thee the Mighty who dwellest in the realm beyondthis region. May these my songs of eulogy exalt thee. Preserve us evermore, yeGods, with blessings.”Hymn CLXXXV - Heaven and Earth:(Humans were generally impressed by the ancient gods. They were beautiful, theylived forever, they could fly away in their thundering ships of the sky and theyhad mighty weapons. They could appear any place, any time, without warning.)“How were they born? Who knoweth it, ye sages?These of themselves support all things existing:The Twain uphold, though motionless and footless, a widespread offspring havingfeet and moving.… protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.May we be close to both the Worlds who suffer no pain, Parents of Gods, who aidwith favour,Both mid the Gods, with Day and Night alternate.Protect us, Heaven and Earth, from fearful danger.Faring together, young, with meeting limits, Twin Sisters lying in theirParents' bosom,Kissing the centre of the world together.Who, beautiful to look on, make the nectar.Wide, vast, and manifold, whose bounds are distant, these, reverent, I addressat this our worship,May both these Friends of man, who bless, preserve me, may they attend me withtheir help and favour.Enrich the man more liberal than the godless. May we, ye Gods, be strong withfood rejoicing.I have uttered this truth, for all to hear, to Earth and Heaven.Be near us, keep us from reproach and trouble.Nearest of Gods be ye with your protection.”Judaism. Origin circa 2,000 BC.Judaism is the religion of the Jewish people and can be traced back to theExodus of the Hebrews from Egypt. But Judaism, Christianity, Islam and theBaha'i faith all share Abraham as their founding father sometime around 2050 BC.This original development is marked by the divine covenant that was made betweengod and the ancient Israelites. Moses was the next leader of the Israelites, andprobably the first ‘real’ Jewish leader, who led his people out of captivity inEgypt and received the ‘Law from God’. Then Joshua led them into the promisedland where Samuel established the Israelite kingdom with Saul as its first king.King David established Jerusalem and King Solomon built the first temple there.But the history of the Jews is a tragic one. These chosen people of god havebeen in a perpetual state of conflict since the very first book of the Bible. In70 AD the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed and the Jews were scatteredthroughout the world until 1948 when the state of Israel was formed. Jewsbelieve in one creator who alone is to be worshipped as absolute ruler of theuniverse. He monitors people's activities and rewards good deeds and punishesthe evil ones. This is the ‘god of vengeance’ of the Old Testament. The Jewishholy book is the Hebrew Bible, which is a collection of books which were writtenover a period of about 1,000 years and established in its full canonical form bythe end of the first century AD. It is divided into three sections. The Torah,The Prophets and the Writings. The Torah, which consists of the first five booksof the Bible, was apparently written by Moses, by divine instruction from Godhimself and cannot be changed. How convenient. A perfect example of themanipulative nature of the ‘god of vengeance’. Just command the people not toquestion and not to touch, otherwise they will be punished. The same old storythat has plagued Humankind from the very beginning. Throughout their history,God would communicate with the Jewish people through prophets, high priests andsometimes even through oracles and oracle stones. The actual origin of theprophetic experience is not clear, but a prophet was simply anyone who believedhimself to be summoned by God to preach his message. Some of these prophetsbecame very powerful people, who held the attention of their fellow Jews withoutquestion. We can assume that there were many other prophets besides the morepopular ones, who were less admired. The prophetic experience could range fromthe obscure mystical visions of an Ezekiel, to the clear ethical convictions ofAmos. The word ‘Jehovah’ is a medieval misreading and does not appear in theHebrew Bible.Jews believe in the inherent goodness of the world and its inhabitants ascreations of God and do not require a saviour to save them from original sin.They believe that they are God's chosen people and that their Messiah willarrive in the future, gather them into Israel, where there will be a generalresurrection of the dead, and the Jerusalem Temple will be rebuilt. This is abeautiful fairytale which belongs squarely in the realms of mythology. Butsomehow this naïve version of the evolution of Humankind escaped the historians'wrath, and remained a divine religion, never to be associated with the heathenbehaviour of those who worshipped the Sumerian gods just a short time before.You may be surprised to find that the Jews may be a little unsure of the wholetruth. Because even the Hebrews had different names for different gods, whichonce again resemble the ‘heavenly gods’ of the Sumerians who came before them.The scriptures mention only a few, like Shad-dai, which seemed to represent thestorm god; also Elo'ah; Yah; Adonai and Elohim. But if they had these few godspretty clearly identified, there must have been others. The most important onewas ‘YHWH’ (pronounced as YAHWEH), generally taking on the meaning of ‘Lord’ andeventually became Jehovah. This word was apparently not pronounced by the earlyHebrew priests because it was deemed to be the unpronounceable name of god. Ifyou spend a while contemplating all the strange coincidences, you will begin tosee the underlying common thread of the prehistoric Sumerian gods and theAnunnaki deities, who settled on Earth long before all this confusion among thehumans began. As much as the Jews like to present a strong unified front, theirreligion has had many sects and cults over a 3,000 year period. From the Essenesof Jesus' days, who had very strong ties with the Aryans of Persia, to theCabalists and the Karaites of the 8thcentury AD, who regarded themselves as‘Children of the Scripture’, and only adhered to the five books of Moses and inaddition they practised much stricter rules in their lives. The transformationfrom Hebraism to Judaism happened during the periods some time before the birthof Christ, to around 200 AD, by which time the writings of the Mishnah (set ofsix orders outlining the basis of Jewish law) were completed. It was a long andslow process from which Biblical Hebraism emerged as rabbinic Judaism.Zoroastrianism. Origin circa 1000 BC.From the north eastern parts of Iran, what was then known as Persia, emerged aprophet called by the Greek name of Zoroaster. His real name was Zarathushtra,and the religious faith that emerged from his teachings became known asZoroastrianism. He preached what may have been the first monotheistic belief ina single supreme god, Lord Ahura Mazda, who was completely removed from evil.Ahura Mazda can be translated to mean ‘god of Light’, which would be in linewith Sumerian descriptions of their gods, describing them as “radiant” and“shining like the light of the sun” and it instantly makes me think thatZoroaster must have encountered this ‘bright’ god who appeared from the west.The Sumerian gods were jostling for position, Marduk was forcing his will on theEgyptians and according to the tablets, also on the rest of Humankindeverywhere, propagating the message that ‘he’ was the ‘god above all’. Untilthis point the gods of prehistory were ruling their lands collectively and werebeing worshipped fanatically by mortal humans. The people were protected bythese localised gods who in turn had a closely developed relationship with theirmaster-gods.We should not be surprised to learn that Zoroaster's teachings were socontroversial and caused so much resistance, that Zoroaster had to flee for hislife. A ‘single supreme god’ philosophy did not go down well in those days whenthe gods of ancient times were in control of the world. Zoroastrians believe inthe dualism of good and evil as either a cosmic one between Ahura Mazda and anevil spirit of violence and death, Angra Mainyu, or as an ethical dualism withinthe human consciousness. The Holy Spirit establishes life and creates men andwomen. The Zoroastrian holy book is called the Avesta which includes theteachings of Zarathushtra written in a series of seventeen hymns called theGathas. Although they were difficult to translate, his love for god wasstriking. It is a collection of abstract, sacred poetry, directed towards theworship of the one god; understanding of righteousness and cosmic order;promotion of social justice; harmony and individual choice between good andevil. Zoroastrians worship through prayers and symbolic ceremonies that areconducted before a sacred fire which symbolises their god. They dedicate theirlives to a three-fold path represented by their motto: “Good thoughts, goodwords, good deeds.” They also teach that the ‘System, Order, Principle and Rule’which is to be seen in heaven, must be implemented on Earth. But he was alsoprepared to use the imagery of judgement at the point of death. LaterZoroastrians in the 9th century AD disagreed with the propaganda of theChristians and Muslims, so they wrote a set of books to defend their “GoodReligion”. While the holy book of Zoroastrians was probably only written down inthe 5thcentury AD, its roots go back a long way, many years before Zoroasterhimself. But just like the other religions, and even though Zoroaster preachedthe supremacy of one god, there was an additional group of gods which surroundedthe supreme one. And suddenly the whole Zoroastrian belief system joins all theothers that actually submitted to a ‘leading’ god, who was master of severallesser gods. Zoroastrians had six ‘Bounteous Immortals’ who sat before thethrone of god possessing special powers. They could be compared to what theBible calls ‘angels’. Furthermore they believe that the world and all materialthings belong to God, while the devil and evil can only exist in an immaterialworld, like a parasite, constantly trying to destroy God's world.The basic elements of original Iranian religion, are the traditional Aryan faithand the teachings of Zoroaster. So much so, that during the reign of Darius andXerxes, Zoroastrianism was a strong influence in the courts. He was alsorespected in Greece at the time of Plato. And just like all the other religions,it has its own set of sects, cults and off-shoots which have evolved with time.We must remember that the Three Wise Men who visited Jesus at birth came fromthe east, and were called Magi. Zoroastrian priests were known as Magi, whosejob it was to look after their religion.Buddhism. Origin circa 560 to 490 BC.After digesting thousands of pages in an effort to get a broader understandingof global religions, their origins and how they all fit into the Great HumanPuzzle, I reached the conclusion that Siddhartha Gautama Buddha (Sanskritversion) was the first real rebel in the world of religion. The founder of whatis today called Buddhism, began to question the meaning of life, the futility oflife, why men are born only to suffer sickness and hardship and eventuallydeath.With his new philosophies he basically flew in the face of what the otherreligions of his time were teaching. Most of what we know about the Buddha isderived mainly from canonical texts written mainly in Pali, an ancient languageof India. Those who practise this faith in its native home call itBuddha-sasana, which could be best translated as ‘the way of life’ or‘discipline of the Awakened one’. It is also known as the ‘Buddha-Dhamma’meaning ‘the eternal truth of the Awakened one’. The young Gautama grew up in ahill town called Kapilavastu, which is in Nepal of today, being highly inspiredby bald, wandering, ‘holy men’ known as ‘shramanas’, who devoted themselves tothe pursuit of an ascetic life. That meant no sex, no personal pleasure of amaterial kind, and a total devotion to spiritualism. These bald wanderers werein search of answers to the futility of life and in a sense were theproto-Buddhists who showed Gautama the way. He was determined to find a solutionto the problems of human existence.The difference between the Buddhists and Brahmins who lived in India duringthose days was mainly in their sacrificial rituals, which were rather elitistand excluded most of the common people. He joined a group of shramanas, masteredthe art of meditation while in search of spiritual truth but in the course ofhis pursuit he was reduced to skin and bone, and almost died. He realised thatthis was not the way forward. Some time later he found himself in the provinceof Ganges where he was engaged by Mara, the ‘Evil One’ and his three daughters,who tried everything in their power to deflect the Buddha-to-be from hispurpose.After a night of spiritual struggle in about 535 BC, he became “The Awakened”and entered a supposed state of transcendental being. Buddhists disregarded theIndian caste system of segregating classes, they accepted all humans as equal.And so the enlightened and Awakened Gautama Buddha began to preach the Dharma.The Buddhists call it “The Discourse of the Setting in Motion the Wheels ofDharma.” He travelled and preached for 40 years, during which he established theOrder of the Buddhist Brethren and Order of Sisters. It is also written that hewas confronted several times by ‘Mara the Evil One’, but Gautama defeated himeach time. When he died in 490 BC, his body was cremated seven days after hisdeath. Buddhists believe in reincarnation and that one must go through severalcycles of birth, life and death. After a number of such cycles, if a personreleases their attachment to desire and the self, they can attain Nirvana. Ingeneral, Buddhists do not believe in any type of god, the need for a saviour,prayer, or eternal life after death.From the Gospel of Buddha as written by Paul Carus we learn that one of themajor philosophies the Buddha taught was, “Truth knows neither birth nor death;it has no beginning and no end… Truth gives unto mortals the boon ofimmortality.”So it seems that just like all the other religions, the pages of the Buddhistscriptures are filled by the obsession with immortality. In some religions itwould be described as life after death. By now we have established that thisidea originated from the Sumerian gods dating back to the flood some 11,000 BCand their interaction with the humans who survived. But as time passed theirfascination with eternal life evolved into a variety of obsessions, many ofwhich manifested themselves in the number of religious denominations whichemerged. We learn further that “karma is undeniable… Like everything in nature,the life of man is subject to the laws of cause and effect.” Buddha feltstrongly about the vanity of religious ritual. He had a whole new approach tolife, clearly very influenced by the interactions between the many gods ofprehistory and the control they exerted on Humankind, while demanding to beworshipped. He resisted it strongly and desperately wanted to free Humankindfrom the stranglehold of the Sumerian gods. “Rituals have no efficacy; prayersare vain repetitions and incantations have no saving power.”The teachings of Christ resemble the words of the Buddha in so many ways, thatit seems impossible that the two are coincidental. “What love can a man possesswho believes that the destruction of life will atone for evil deeds? Can a newwrong expiate old wrongs? And can the slaughter of an innocent victim blot outthe evil deeds of mankind? Purify your hearts and cease to kill, that is truereligion.” (Gospel of Buddha.)I found this gospel quite uplifting in the early days of 2005. It is filled withconstant repetition regarding “brotherly love towards your enemies”; the greatcircle of fate which may turn the victor into the victim; reconciliation; truthand so on. It is the kind of wisdom we hear from peacemakers like Nelson Mandelaon a regular basis, but I cannot recall Mandela ever proclaiming to be aBuddhist. “Come now and make peace, let us be brothers; he will gain a victorythat is not a transient success, for its fruits will remain forever.” The Buddhabelieved that humans will not be reborn into suffering or lower forms of life orcontinue a karma of evil deeds, if they followed the appropriate steps towardenlightenment. We are assured of “final salvation”. It is not quite clear whatthat ‘final salvation’ might be, as we read on: “When they die, nothing willremain of them but their good thoughts, their righteous acts, and the bliss thatproceeds from truth and righteousness.”But as with all the other religions, even Buddhism refers to the influence andinvolvement of the ancient gods. In this case however, it seems that the Buddhaactually stood up to the violent gods of Sumer and the Old Testament, in anattempt to show them the way of peace and enlightenment. In the book of TheMirror of Truth (from the Gospel of Buddha) it refers very clearly to suchinteraction between the Buddha and the gods; and men. “The Fully enlightenedone; the wise; upright…The Bridler of men's wayward hearts; the teacher of Godsand men; the blessed Buddha.” Those gods of ancient times just happened to popup everywhere. Are we still so sure that they were mythological figures? If weaccept the Buddha as a real historic figure, should we not also accept the‘gods’ of Sumer and all the latter cultures as real historical deities, althoughit goes against what we think we know? As vague as the so-called ‘salvation’which the Buddha refers to may be, his teachings overflow with the unbridledembrace of truth and love. It is staggering to see how completely opposed bynature it is, to the brutal tales of violence which we read in the Bible andother religious scriptures like the Koran.But guess what? That mysterious shiny metal called gold, pops its head out evenon the pages of the Gospel of Buddha. Where there was gold, there were the signsof the Anunnaki gods who controlled all of it. We read that even the Buddha waspleased to receive a robe of golden thread from a man of a lower caste. The mostfascinating link to our gods of Sumer is beautifully revealed in the story ofBuddha's birth. His mother was referred to as the “Queen of Heaven… beautiful asa water lily and pure in mind as the lotus”. She had a complexion bright andlight, like many of the Sumerian goddesses as described in the clay tablets.Those were the days when humans were intermarrying with ‘Nefilim gods’ as we aretold in the Bible and the Sumerian tablets. We were also shown that the Egyptiankings were required to be half human, half god. The Gospel of Buddha states thather husband the King “honoured her in her holiness”. Was the Buddha another oneof the chosen prophets of the Anunnaki gods in an attempt to keep Humankind inline? And was he the son of a mortal king and a beautiful Anunnaki ‘goddess’?Would this heritage have given the Buddha superior knowledge to perform his roleas a leader among men? There is ample written evidence that seems to suggestthis very convincingly.Once again we have the involvement of ‘angels’ at the point of conception orbirth, as it seems to have happened with all the ancient prophets. When theBuddha's mother was about to give birth, she went for a walk in the garden. Four“pure-minded angels” appeared out of the blue and helped her bring the childinto the world. The angels took the child, placed it in front of the mother andsaid: “Rejoice O queen, a mighty son has been born unto thee.” This was followedby a very similar event surrounding the birth of Christ. In that story, whenJoseph returned to the cave with a midwife, the cave was ‘filled with lightbrighter than the sun’. The place surrounding the newly born Buddha experienceda similar event. “All the worlds were flooded with light.”It certainly seems that the Anunnaki gods were there in greater numbers,observing the event and ‘shining some light on the subject’. Even the Buddhareferred to ‘Heaven’ as being up in the sky. Why is that? Is it because that iswhere the gods would descend from and return to every now and then? “… One wholooks up and spits at heaven; the spittle soils not the Heaven, but comes backand defiles his own person.”But, just like all the other religions, there are many sects and cults inBuddhism. The two main ones are Theravada Buddhism which is practised in SriLanka, Thailand, Kampuchea and Laos, while the other is Mahayana Buddhismpractised mainly in China, Korea and Japan. In China we encounter Ch'an Buddhismand in Japan, Zen Buddhism, which are derivatives of the original Buddhistteachings introduced into China by an Indian monk called Bodhidharm around 500AD. But Zen Buddhism in Japan only really took root in 1191 AD when a monkcalled Eisai established the first Rinzai school of Zen. Anew form of Buddhismcalled Shingon, began to emerge in Japan under the influence of Kukai who wasborn in 774 AD and is now regarded as the person responsible for the merging ofBuddhism and Shinto, which became the feature of Japanese religion. But theconcepts of compassion and salvation were much greater features of this new formof Buddhism, from which compassion and faith began to emerge as the mostimportant tenets of the faith. Shinran was born in 1173, and later establishedJodo Shinshu ‘The Pure Land Sect’. He became consumed with the struggle betweenthe ‘good man’ and the ‘evil man’ in many ways absorbing much of Christianity.The subtle undertones of a place like ‘heaven’ is referred to in his teachings.“Even a bad man will be received in Buddha's land.”There is one other fascinating aspect of the Buddhists that may have linked themto the Anunnaki for hundreds of thousands of years. Buddhists believe that a newBuddha comes along about every 5,000 years and the Buddhist tradition has a listof at least 24 Buddhas who preceded Buddha Gautama. This would give us a path ofsome 120,000 years back in time, approaching the origins of Humankind about200,000 years ago. Is it possible that the human resistance to the Anunnakimasters' oppressive control over them could have begun so very long ago? This isobviously too much for any modern historian to digest, but the legends carrysome overwhelming traditions and facts that will be very difficult to disproveor to come to terms with.Shinto. Origin circa 500+ BC.Ancient Japanese civilisation and their earliest semblances of religion, aretruly fascinating, bearing instantly visible links to the prehistoric Anunnakiof the Sumerian tablets. The Japanese tradition talks about the age of ‘Kami’which began with the emergence of the cosmos out of chaos, giving rise to thehistory of Humankind. The story continues with Ningi, the grandchild of the SunKami, who descended to the lower realms. It was his great grandson who laterbecame the first emperor of Japan. The Sumerian tablets talk about a verysimilar set of events surrounding the creation of the heavens in the book ofEnuma Elish (Epic of Creation), the great celestial battle in the sky duringwhich Earth was created. After some time the Igigi, who were referred to as the“children of the stars”, descended from heaven to “marry the daughters of man”(Genesis) and in so-doing sped up the growth of the human population. Marduk wasthe son of Enki, who was the first settler on Earth, and destined to be thefirst commander of Earth. A further interesting thing is that from about 660 BCto around 600 AD, the authority lay with women rulers who acted as shamans ormediums. Could that be because the lands which included Japan were bestowed uponInanna, Sumerian goddess of love and war, who was renowned for her enjoyment ofwine, song and poetry? She was a strong, determined ‘goddess’ who ruled over theIndus Valley and spread her wings even further east as time went by. Japaneseprehistoric mythology seems to gently transform into history without causing anyripples, claiming that Japan has a divine mission upon Earth. Fortunately, fromaround the 6th century AD, with the introduction of Buddhism into Japan, thereare written documents to draw upon. Although Shinto was around before thearrival of Buddhism, they developed side by side in Japan but Shinto inheritedmany diverse influences from Mahayana Buddhists and other Indo-Chinese religionsseeping into the region. In 1549 the Christians arrived to teach the heathens ofJapan the story of their saviour. They were eventually banned from doing so bythe first Japanese anti-Christian legislation in 1587. This caused the Europeanpowers to isolate Japan until Christian missions resumed in 1859.The exact origins of Shinto are very blurry. The word Shinto is not a Japaneseterm, it was only coined in the 6thcentury AD to describe the older religioustradition “The way of the Kami”. It is described as Japan’s indigenous faith,similar to the many African indigenous faiths. Shinto is a religion closely tiedto nature, which recognises the existence of various Kami, who are deities ofnature. And once again we find immediate parallels to the gods of Sumer; takingcontrol of different aspects of life and controlling Humankind in various ways.Their names may be different, but their functions and influence certainly werenot. Kami is often translated as god, which is not really correct. Some Japanesescholars go as far as saying it is impossible to define the word Kami. EvenJapanese people themselves do not have a clear idea regarding Kami. They aresimply aware of it intuitively. If we accept this kind of logic, believing insomething intuitively, should we not rethink our arrogant approach towards thepossible existence of the ancient Sumerian gods, who were certainly not‘intuitive’ but well documented in hundreds of thousands clay tablets? OneJapanese scholar describes Kami as such. “All things whatsoever which deserve tobe dreaded and revered for the extraordinary and pre-eminent powers which theypossess, are called Kami.” Shinto shrines are frequented by ‘miko’ who arefemale shrine attendants, performing a ritual dance which symbolises theworshippers of that specific shrine. Is it coincidence that the goddess Inannawas the proponent of dance and music and such activities were also encouraged ather temples in Mesopotamia thousands of years earlier?Shinto has many deity gods. Two of the leading deities are Izanagi and Izanami,who gave birth to the Japanese islands and whose children became the deities ofthe various Japanese clans. One of their daughters, Amaterasu (Sun Goddess), isthe ancestress of the Imperial Family and is regarded as the chief deity. Allthe Kami sustain and protect. They are not seen as separate from humanity due tosin because humanity is “Kami's Child”. Followers of Shinto desire peace andbelieve that all human life is sacred. They revere ‘musuhi’, the Kami's creativeand harmonising powers, and aspire to have ‘makoto’ – sincerity or true heart.Morality is based upon that which benefits the group. Shinto has fouraffirmations:Tradition and family: The family is the main mechanism by which traditions arepreserved. Love of nature: Nature is sacred and natural objects are to beworshipped as sacred spirits. Physical cleanliness: They must take baths, washtheir hands and rinse their mouth regularly. ‘Matsuri’: A festival which honoursthe spirits.The behaviour of Shinto people when entering a shrine is fascinating and raisesmany questions about the origins of such unusual rituals. Once again thesimilarity between Sumerian temple offerings and Shinto are remarkable. We readin Sumerian tablets how particular those gods were about their choice of foodand drink, which they wanted to be offered in their temples. They also wanted acomfortable bed, a garden with trees for shade; a spring or rock pool with freshwater; a bath or cleansing area, and all had to be kept clean, neat and tidy.The Shinto gods in their shrines have obviously demanded a similar kind ofservice, which is evident in the customs surrounding the entering of, andworshipping in the shrines. You must wash your hands and mouth at a naturalspring in the shrine or a rock pool. You can make a petition, request or ask aquestion, but it is preferred if you submit it in writing. Could this be so thatthe ‘god’ did not actually have to be present while you lament about your ownhardship? You should present your offering, which in ancient times waspreferably food. Today it is more symbolic, often giving money. Is it notamazing that the gods of Japan had the same materialistic needs as the gods ofSumer?Confucianism. Origin circa 500 BC.China stands alone among the world's great civilisations, developing almost intotal isolation from the rest. It adds a deep mystery to the Great Human Puzzleand is a real marvel to behold. The Chinese people speak a language that has noaffinities with any other language group. It is written in a script invented bythe Chinese themselves, and is unlike any other. The script can be read all overChina, irrespective of the dialect of the speaker, because the script isideographic and therefore ancient scripts can be read with ease today. There arethree major religions in China. Confucianism and Taoism, which had been inexistence for at least 500 years before Buddhism arrived from India. Theinfluence of Western and Indian cultures and religions caused new forms ofneo-Confucianism and neo-Taoism to emerge while many other cults and sectsflourished. It is important to remind Western readers that Confucianism andTaoism are actually ‘chiao’, Chinese teachings, which are not specificallyreligious doctrines as we would like to classify them in the West. The writersand creators of these two philosophies have been regarded as the collectivecultural heritage of the Chinese.Confucius or K'ung Fu Tzu was born in 551 BC in the state of Lu in China. Hetravelled throughout China giving advice to its rulers. His teachings andwritings dealt with individual morality, ethics, and the proper exercise ofpolitical power. His sacred canonical works also contain secular documentspre-dating Confucianism and have been the mainstream of the Chinese educationalcurriculum for over 2000 years. But it was only after the introduction ofBuddhism into China that Taoism followed the path of instituting a priestlyorder and hierarchy, temples and monasteries and a sacred canon, attracting itsown converts to a new faith. Chinese recorded history only really began with theShang dynasty around 1600 BC. The discovery of a large number of ‘oracle bones’exposed us to much of the Shang dynasty's religious beliefs of ancient times.Some 100,000 fragments of bone and shell are covered with requests of all sorts,addressed to the spirits of their dead kings. So now we know that the people ofthe pre-Confucian era, dating back many thousands of years, believed in spiritswho could intervene in their trials and tribulations. But more importantly, the‘deities of the hills and streams, and other gods were worshipped’. Here we havea clear link to the same ancient rituals of Sumer and Egypt, where kings wereseen as half-human, half-god, and therefore they were often worshippedthemselves as gods by the common people. Many of these rites passed on to themodern forms of Chinese religion, maintaining an air of mysticism, and possiblyeven divinity, around the Chinese royalty. Just as in Sumer, early Chinesemonarchs were often priests and kings simultaneously, who would wage war. TheChou dynasty rulers believed that they received a “mandate from heaven” to rule.The kings had to perform sacrificial rituals to please the gods and report tothe gods on progress. They would also receive communication from the gods todeliver to the people. The Chinese had a complete hierarchical structure whichwent “Heaven to king; king to feudal lords; feudal lords to sub-feudal lords;sub-feudal lords to the rest of the community”. The king had full control of hislands but the ultimate control lay in the “will of heaven”. Such was the feudalpyramid of the Chou dynasty, not far removed from the structures set up by theSumerian gods, attesting to the ongoing violent character of the growing humanrace. A characteristic which was very cunningly controlled by the Anunnaki gods.Prehistoric Chinese records are very cloudy but it is evident from these ancientrituals that the gods of Sumer were just as active in China thousands of yearsago, as they were all over the world's emerging civilisations. Teaching humansthe art of cohabitation, agriculture, writing and through the differentcharacters of the ‘god in charge’, injected very specific cultural diversity,like music, dance, poetry, architecture, and more. Poetry, song and dance playeda major part in religious rituals in China, clearly inspired by the neighbouringIndian culture, which was undoubtedly driven by the talented Inanna/Ishtar,goddess of love. Just like in Sumer, the priests were also warriors, who wouldprotect their sacred shrines and temples. The great temple courts were used tosacrifice war captives in front of the home crowd. In the following extract froma temple liturgy we can compare the Chinese subservience to the ‘gods of heaven’as they were worshipped in Sumer:“Majestic never endingis the Charge of HeavenYour virtue descendingOh illustrious King WenOverwhelms with blessingYour servants on Earth….May we alwaysFear the wrath of heavenSo to keep his favourAnd our ways even.”Is it not fascinating that, as distant and diverse as the Chinese culture may beto the Western culture, the image of a vengeful god who is feared by hisfollowers and who will unleash his ‘wrath’ upon man, seems to follow everysingle group of early humans to the farthest corners of the world, even today.Confucius stressed a number of fundamental values:Li - ritual, propriety, etiquette, etc. Hsiao - love among family members Yi -righteousness Xin - honesty and trustworthiness Jen - benevolence towardsothers; the highest Confucian virtue Chung - loyalty to the state, etc.Unlike most religions, Confucianism is primarily an ethical system with ritualsat important times during one's lifetime. The most important periods recognisedin the Confucian tradition are birth, reaching maturity, marriage, and death.Taoism. Origin circa 440 BC.While the ‘activist’ philosophers in China were advocating their theories in thecourts of the cities, a whole new ‘Quietist’ philosophy was developing in thecountryside. Their concerns were ‘other-worldly’, seeking self-awareness andself-cultivation through yogic practice. They saw the unchanging 'oneness'underlying a world of change. They called it ‘Tao’. While all ancient Chinesephilosophers spoke of their Tao, the Quietists spoke of ‘Tao-ness’ itself. Itwas these Taoists who eventually inspired the birth of Taoism, a mysticalreligion.There are two collections of Taoist works that survive from the age of thephilosophers. They are Chuang Tzu and the Lieh Tzu. Towards the end of thisperiod another Taoist work appeared called the Tao Te Ching. These three worksare the earliest writings in a vast collection which forms the Taoist canon.While there is some doubt about the true identity of Lao Tzu, a contemporary ofConfucius, he is seen as the patriarch and the original founder of Taoism. Inhis writings the Tao Te Ching (The Way and its Power), he describes the natureof life, the way to peace and how a ruler should lead his life. Lao Tzu hoped itwould help end the constant feudal warfare and other conflicts of his time.Taoism became a religion in 440 BC when it was adopted as a state religion. Taocan roughly be translated as ‘path’, which is a force flowing through all lifeand is the first cause of everything. The goal of Taoists is for everyone tobecome ‘one’ with the Tao. Tai Chi, a technique of exercise using slowdeliberate movements, is used to balance the flow of energy or ‘chi’ within thebody. One of the beliefs arising from the Chuang Tzu, is that a man of ‘lesserknowledge’ or mundane thought, cannot conceptualise ‘greater knowledge’ or thevision of the mystic. This knowledge can only be attained in a state of trance,referred to as a state of “I lose me”. People should develop virtue and seekcompassion, moderation and humility. One should plan any action in advance andachieve it through minimal action. Yin (the dark side) and Yang (the light side)symbolise pairs of opposites that are seen through the universe, such as goodand evil, light and dark, male and female. Does this remind you a bit of StarWars? The impact of human civilisation upsets the balance of Yin and Yang.Taoists believe that people are by nature, good, and that one should be kind toothers simply because such treatment will most likely be reciprocated.Our link to the gods of Sumer comes in the Taoist description of what shouldhappen in a state of trance. The person should take off “on a journey, ridingupon the wind” borne by “cloud chariots”. There were several people who weretaken up into the realms of ‘heaven’ by the Anunnaki. An experience of thatnature would have changed their lives. On their return they marvelled at thebeauty, the sights from up high, the feeling of flying through the sky ‘onclouds of heaven like an eagle’ and other poetic descriptions of theiradventure. When stories like this get handed down orally over millennia, theywould have had different effects on different people. There must have been acontact between the protagonists of Taoism and their Sumerian Earthlingbrethren, who had had such cosmic experiences under the rule of the Anunnakigods, a long time ago. It is also interesting that the Taoists believe that thecycle of life is made up of five recurring cycles that are represented by thefive elements. Earth, wood, metal, fire and water. Each element conquers itspredecessor in recurring cycles. There is a very strong parallel to the Incabelief in their five Cycles of Life. Is it possible that the ancient gods mayhave had something to do with this? China to Bolivia is a long way away, so howdid these philosophies cross paths between South America and China thousands ofyears ago?So the Age of Philosophers in China produced Confucianism and Taoism. Onemaverick Taoist called Mo Tzu, who was also one of the greatest philosophers ofancient China, was apparently promoting a concept of ‘heaven’ and a personal‘god’ to his followers. This was a fascinating development in a culture whichwas obsessed with meditation, Yin Yang and ‘chi’. But this cultural explosion toseek a closer relationship with one's personal god infiltrated the new society.Could this have had anything to do with the events described in the Sumeriantablets? When Marduk, the god of Egypt, travelled the world, telling humans thathe was the ‘only and supreme god above all’, terrorising humans into absoluteobedience, and demanding their trust, faith and fear in him? The Taoist Churcheven went as far as developing rites and services for the atonement of sin. Alittle too close for comfort when compared to what kind of relationships theSumerian gods had with their followers. Declaring your community's sins to thegods was necessary to receive rewards and mercy from the gods. Taoists had topay five pecks of rice for redemption and all their sins were recorded inwriting and a copy was made available to ‘heaven’. What a perfect system to keeptabs on your human slaves. This is breathtaking stuff. It seems that this wasthe time when the more brutal gods of Sumer arrived in the East to reap some ofthe rewards of Inanna's creative civilisation of Humankind. They brought withthem the more barbaric customs which they had imposed on the humans of the NearEast. The days of the philosophers were gone, just as they were kept in theirplace in Greece by brutal gods, the new gods of China and the Far East hadarrived with a vengeance.It seems that the promises of immortality which Marduk made to the Egyptianpharaohs had spread all over the world, even the Taoists became obsessed withimmortality. Obviously the ever-present gods of Sumer were there to ensure thatthe humans were fully informed about their passage into the afterlife, if theyobeyed. Some Taoists even believed that they could avoid death altogether, andsimply pass into the ‘land of immortals’ by following specific regimens andrules.Jainism. Origin circa 420 BC.Jainism has many similarities to Hinduism and Buddhism and it also developed inthe same part of the world. Jains believe in karma and reincarnation, as doHindus, but they believe that enlightenment and liberation from this cycle canonly be achieved through asceticism. The virtue of a great ascetic could protecta city from an enemy, so it was fruitless to attack such a city until theascetic had been corrupted or destroyed. There is a story of an ascetic whogenerated such powers through his penance, that it caused the gods to send downa ‘celestial damsel’ of great beauty to seduce him and expend his accumulatedpotency. There we go again! The gods of heaven who keep interfering withHumankind. We know from the Sumerian tablets that the Anunnaki females or‘goddesses’ as they were seen by humans, were ‘breathtakingly beautiful’. Theiroffspring which they conceived with mortal men, were equally beautiful. Here wehave another perfect example of where mythology crosses paths with popularreligion, and yet we hold onto what we call religion, and we discard theunexplainable as ‘myth’. How very convenient. Jainism follows similar beliefs asother religions: that time is cyclical; that the universe undergoes growth,decline, destruction, and re-creation perpetually. The Laws of Manu speak aboutthe Four Ages that follow each other, dating the ages back to the last rebirthof Humankind some 12,000 years ago. What a coincidence! Is that not what theSumerian tablets say as well? When the Great Flood destroyed the world and Noah(Ziusudra) survived in his ark to start repopulating the world again? Anotherone of those coincidences that historians simply push aside!The Kalpa Sutra Of Bhadrabahu - Lives Of The Ginas - Life Of Mahavira deals withthe birth of their new prophet. We read some remarkable things about the gods ofthe time and their influence on the people, and even interaction between godsand the people. The desire for ascending to heaven is very strong and just likeSumerians, these people worshipped the gods in their ‘celestial abodes’. Thegods must have convinced the earthlings in this part of the world that they weresinful, just as the Sumerian humans were informed:“Obeisance to all Saints in the World!This fivefold obeisance, destroying all sins, is of all benedictions theprincipal benediction.In that period, in that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahavira… where he had livedfor twenty Sagaropamas till the termination of his allotted length of life, ofhis (divine nature, and of his existence (among gods)…”“O beloved of the gods, what, to be sure, will be the happy result portended bythese fourteen illustrious, great dreams?”But they wanted real quality education and nurturing for the new prophet to beborn:“And this boy, after having passed his childhood, and, with just ripenedintellect, having reached the state of youth … he will be versed in thephilosophy of the sixty categories, and well grounded in arithmetic, inphonetics, ceremonial, grammar, metre, etymology, and astronomy, and in manyother brahmanical [and monastic] sciences besides...O beloved of the gods; thatmatter is really such as you have pronounced it….”“In that period, in that age, Sakra, the chief and king of the gods, the wielderof the thunderbolt, the destroyer of towns, the performer of a hundredsacrifices, the thousand-eyed one, Maghavan, the punisher of the Daitya Paka,the lord of the southern half of the Earth, the lord of the thirty-two thousandcelestial abodes… who wears spotless clothes and robes… whose cheeks werestroked by fine, bright, and trembling earrings of fresh gold [the mostprosperous, the most brilliant, the most mighty, the most glorious, the mostpowerful, and the most happy one]…in the celestial abode… he who exercises andmaintains the supreme command, government, management, guidance, direction, andsovereign power and generalship over the thirty-two thousand gods of thecelestial abodes, the eighty-four thousand gods of a rank equal with that ofhimself, the thirty-two chief gods, the four guardians of the world, the eightprincipal queens with their trains, the three courts, the seven armies, and theseven commanders of these armies…”It strikes me that those were very specific kinds of utterances, with littledoubt in the mind of the writer, as to who was in charge and of what; andexactly how the power structures on Earth were organised. While these writingsare sacred to millions, some arrogant historians discard them very quickly, andrelegate the content to realms of mythology. How could this be possible? It iseither a living religion, passed down over thousands of years, or all of theother religions should also be classified as myth.The concept of ‘ahimsa’ or non-violence is a fundamental principle of Jainism,because any act of violence against a living thing creates negative karma whichwill adversely affect one's next life. It was also one of the principlespreached by Jesus, when he suddenly emerged in Canaan at the age of 29. Manyscholars have however denied that Jesus ever preached the concept of rebirth andany references to it have been removed from the New Testament. The founder ofthe Jain community was Vardhamana, the last Jina in a series of 24 who lived inEast India. He attained enlightenment after 13 years of deprivation andcommitted the act of ‘salekhana’, fasting to death, in 420 BC. You may rememberthat Mahatma Gandhi started a fast of this kind to get the warring Muslims andHindus to stop fighting. Jains follow fruitarianism. This is the practice ofonly eating that which will not kill the plant or animal from which the food istaken.Islam. Origin circa 622 AD.Islam was founded around 622 AD by the Prophet Mohammed in the city of Medina.Islam is an Arabic word which means ‘acceptance; surrender; submission; orcommitment’. I found these descriptions fascinating, mainly because it echoesthe words of the ‘god of Vengeance’ in the Old Testament. We should not besurprised by this because the patriarch of the Muslim faith is also Abraham.Although Islam is the youngest of the world's great religions, Muslims do notview it as a new religion. They believe that it is the same faith taught by theprophets Abraham, David, Moses and even Jesus, but somehow the Jews andChristians got it wrong. The exact date of Mohammed's birth is not known, butscholars generally accept that he was born in Mecca circa 570 AD. Islam seesMohammed as the last prophet whose role it was to formalise and clarify thefaith and purify it by removing ideas that were added in error. He married arich widow 15 years his senior and came under the influence of Jewish andChristian teachings. He developed a reputation for honesty and wisdom. Like allArabs, Mohammed was a member of a tribe. The tribe he belonged to was called theQuraysh and his tribal upbringing played an important part in his role ofuniting Islam behind a brand new philosophy.In pre-Islamic Arabia the Bedouins were not notably pious, but they had certainreligious practices. There were a number of spirits and demons whom theypropitiated (whose favour they had to win on a constant basis). What isimportant to note is that they were highly influenced by the ‘astral religion’of the ancient Semitic people who led them to recognise deities associated withheavenly bodies. Most of these were goddesses with names like al-Lat; al-Uzzah;and al-Manat. Mohammed's tribe was no exception, and they also worshipped anumber of different deities or gods. One of the gods which the Bedouinsworshipped was Allah, but he was by no means their main god and at that pointdid not feature strongly and his function was rather vague. It becomes evidentthat during Mohammed's structuring of Islam, he did not introduce a new name ora new ‘god’, it was a god who was already reasonably well established among theArabs and Bedouins. What astounds me is the way in which humans, andspecifically historians, can discriminate between these Arabic gods. While oneof the ancient mythological gods by the name of Allah was elevated to the‘supreme’ god status, the others were summarily demoted and remained in thelesser ranks of mythological deities. How is that possible? Do our historiansknow something we don't? Or is it just their ignorance shining through again?The Quraysh was a powerful tribe which rose to take control of Mecca. They builtsacred shrines and erected their own deities in many places throughout the city.But the Arabs also made pilgrimages to other shrines erected around thepeninsula. A popular spot was a shrine to god al-Manat at Ukas, not far north ofMecca. But the most important centre of pilgrimage was a rectangular stonebuilding known as the Kaaba, in the valley of Mecca. The principal god of theKaaba was Hubal, but there were other gods associated with the shrine as well.This pre-Islamic pilgrimage to Kaaba, with its specific performance of rites,makes up most of what is practised by Muslims today. They would visit theirshrines during certain months of the lunar calendar which were consideredsacred. During this time, all fighting was forbidden and renunciation ofhostilities allowed trade to flourish and festivities to take place. Mohammedclaimed that he was a Hanif, a group who believed that they were of spiritualdescent from Abraham and were highly inspired by monotheism.So those were just some of the events which led up to Mohammed's encounter withthe angel Gabriel and some of the thinking that went into the philosophy ofIslam. Before Mohammed received his calling, Arabian paganism was showing greatsigns of decay. The Meccans were worshipping not only Allah, but a host of otherdeities, whom they referred to as “daughters of Allah”. This should not besurprising as the rest of Humankind were doing the same in distant parts of theworld. Although Mohammed disagreed with the teachings of the Jews and Christianshe was impressed with the concept of ‘one god’ or monotheism. He liked to retireto a certain cave on Mount Hira to meditate and pray. Mohammed disclaimed thathe could perform miracles but he did claim to be the messenger of God himself.What is most fascinating about how Islam received its holy scriptures in theform of the Koran, are the circumstances surrounding the event. It is commonlyaccepted among Muslims that Mohammed was illiterate, which is one of the‘miracles’ associated with the delivery of a complete book by him. On one ofthose days in the cave or outside the cave under a tree, the exact place is notcertain, the angel Gabriel appeared to Mohammed and instructed him to “Recite”.The following lines are fascinating because they are almost identical to whatsome of the ancient Sumerian clay tablets tell us about the creation of the‘Adamu’.“Recite in the name of your Lord who created, created man from clots of blood…Who by pen taught man what he did not know.”The book of Genesis tells a very similar story about the creation of Adam, butthe most graphic description we have of this first creation of man comes fromthe clay tablets that predate the Bible and the Koran by as much as 4,000 years.It describes how the Anunnaki gods “created the Adamu from the African clay… andAdamu's skin was the same colour as the dark hue of the clay.” But what isextremely disturbing is the way in which the ‘angel’ approached Mohammed. It isrecorded that after the first time the angel commanded him to “recite in thename of God”, Mohammed did not respond, probably out of fear or confusion? Youcan be the judge of that. The angel grabbed him by the throat and shook himviolently while repeating the command again. After the second command, Mohammedstill did not respond, so the angel proceeded to choke him until Mohammed wascompelled to do what he was told. It now makes complete sense why Mohammed was‘so disturbed by his experience’ and why at first he was filled with doubt, evenwondering if he had lost his sanity or whether he may have been possessed by amalignant spirit. The outcome of this experience and an extended period of‘Koranic’ revelations to Mohammed, was the complete works known to Muslims asthe “unquestionable words of God himself” – the Koran. I was always told adifferent story, one where Mohammed went into the cave for 40 days and duringthat time he wrote down the words as dictated to him by the ‘angel’. That seemsto be the popularised ‘fairytale’ version, not what probably happened. Theknowledge that was bestowed on Mohammed in the cave, came to him in the form ofrevelations over an extended period, it did not all happen at once. It is saidthat the words of the angel “were inscribed upon his heart” and he couldsuddenly remember them and recite them in moments of inspiration. DuringMohammed's life these verses would come to him from time to time and beinscribed upon palm leaves, stones or any material that came to hand. In hisEnglish translation of the Koran, N.J. Dawood describes it as “the earliest andby far the finest work of classical Arabic prose”. The final collection ofMohammed's revelations in the Koran was completed during the caliphate of Umarthe second Caliph, but the authorised version was only established during thecaliphate of Uthman, his successor between 644 and 656 AD.The two sacred texts of Islam are the Koran, which are the words of Allah, “theOne True God”, as given to Mohammed; and the Hadith, which is a collection ofMohammed's sayings. Although the Muslims accepted Jesus as a prophet, theyaccused the Christians of blasphemy for worshipping him as the son of God, whenthey were strictly commanded to “worship none but Him”. But Mohammed did nothave it easy at the beginning of his preaching career. At first the Meccansignored him; but as his following grew they feared him. Eventually they began tooppose him and Mohammed became somewhat of a hated individual in Mecca. Thelevels of intolerance grew so high that in 622 AD Mohammed and his followerswere forced to leave Mecca. Fortunately, he managed to negotiate a favourabledeal with the leaders of a city called Yathrib, in order to be accepted andgiven protection. Soon after this, Yathrib became known as Medina, the city ofthe prophet. Since this was a decisive turning point in the life and fortunes ofMohammed and his followers, it was adopted as the starting point of the Islamiccalendar and his emigration from Mecca is known as the ‘Hegira’.From this point Mohammed proclaimed the one unique God who created the universe,established its order, controlling its fate by his hand. Allah demands solesovereignty and submission to his ordinance. There was a lot of emphasis placedon the horrors awaiting the disobedient ones who were ungrateful to their lordand refused submission. The Koran speaks vividly of the torments of hell andpaints a gruesome picture of what will happen to those who do not obey theexplicit word of Allah. Does this sound familiar? I, for one, do not see anyreal difference between what the god of the Old Testament was saying to humans,and what the words of Allah are saying in the Koran. I mentioned before that Ifind the Old Testament to be a very scary book. But, only when I read the Koran,did I realise that there is a scarier book. Let me not beat about the bush here,for those who have not read the Koran, I urge you to do so, and then askyourself if you were not scared out of your wits. It surpasses the Bible by along way. The ‘God of vengeance and retribution’ rises to greater heights in theKoran. It is truly remarkable how similar the rewards, which are promised to therighteous, are to the biblical rewards of heaven and paradise. In the book ofThe Winds of the Koran it states that “when the day of judgement comes… Therighteous will dwell amidst gardens and fountains, for they have done goodwork.” The day of reckoning in the Bible is perfectly echoed in the book of TheResurrection of the Koran, which tells us that on the day of resurrection,“There shall be no refuge. For to your Lord, on that day, all shall return. Manshall on that day be told of all his deeds, from first to last. Indeed, manshall bear witness against himself, plead as he may with his excuses… On thatday there shall be joyous faces looking towards their Lord. On that day thereshall be mournful faces, dreading some great affliction.”It is clear that the god of the Bible and the god of the Koran must have beenrelated. And so they are, for if Abraham is the patriarch of Islam, as he is ofChristians and Jews, their god must surely be one and the same! They certainlyseem to preach the same death and destruction to Humankind every step of theway. Every statement and every innuendo is filled with the kind of premeditatedcontrol factor that only humans are capable of. The constant threats againstHumankind smell of an anxious individual who is desperately trying to impose hisauthority on the lesser species which he created for his own device. The way inwhich Abraham interacted with his god in the Bible, is echoed strongly some2,600 years later in the relationship between Humankind and the ‘god’ of theKoran. While Jesus had turned the ‘god of vengeance’ of the Old Testament intothe ‘god of love and forgiveness’, the poor Muslims were dragged all the wayback to the mentality of Abraham and their new ‘god’ became even moreschizophrenic. The ‘god of mercy; the gracious one; the compassionate’ but alsothe ‘god of punishment’. Suddenly the issues of equality among all humans, whichthe prophet Jesus had preached, were overridden by the new ‘word of god’ whichtold us that women are not quite as equal as men. There are very cleardirections on how to deal with a wife who commits some arbitrary oversight, andthat a woman's testimony is not quite as valuable as a man's. In the book of TheCow 2.98, it reminds us that “God is the enemy of the unbelievers.” I find itimmensely unpleasant and horrifying to constantly get bombarded by ‘threat afterthreat’on every page of the Koran of how ‘god’ will punish the non-believers,and yet in the same paragraph we are told that “if you fear God, he will grantyou salvation and cleanse you of your sins and forgive you.”It seems as if nothing had changed and the manipulative Anunnaki gods were stilltrying to hold onto what they had established on Earth. But their grip wasslowly slipping as people became enlightened and more evolved and more educated.Humankind was suddenly looking into the greater spiritual realms, realising thatthe vengeful gods of the past who demanded to be worshipped, who claimed to haveabsolute power, may have been the ‘god’ of the primitive man, but not the trueGod of the universe. The only way in which the remaining gods could impose theirauthority on Humankind, was the only way they knew from their past activities –brutal force, violence, the promise of reward for those who followed orders andpunishment to those who disobeyed.The inexplicable behaviour of ‘angels’ in the Bible, when they destroy cities,punish sinners, smite the unrighteous and more, seems to continue in the waythat the ‘angel Gabriel’ attacked Mohammed and basically forced him intosubmission. Let's face it, the angels in those days were very scary characters,appearing to be physical and humanlike. Where have they all gone? They arealmost always described as having some kind of fearsome weapon with which theycould do any kind of damage or control any kind of unruly situation among thehumans, like the one in Sodom. The Koran speaks of humans as ‘mortals’ as ifthere was another group of immortal humanoids on Earth. “When the sight ofmortals is confounded and the moon eclipsed…”No matter how hard we try to turn a blind eye to the ongoing activities by theSumerian gods, they creep into every crevice of our global religions. We simplycannot escape them. But the worst part of their interaction with humans and thecontrol they have been exercising for so many thousand years, has totallycorrupted our ability to distinguish between ‘god’ and ‘God’. In the past 2,000years the remaining Anunnaki gods on Earth have had to resort to extremes in afinal attempt to control humans with fear. They certainly did a great job, asone by one, the religions fell prey to the brutal victimisation of Humankind bythe Sumerian gods. In the book of YA SIN in the Koran, we read a very similardescription to what the Sumerian tablets tell us, about how the ‘Adamu’ wascreated by molecular splicing of the DNA and artificial insemination. The Koransays, “Is man not aware that We created him from a little germ?” But the storygoes into greater detail in the book of The Believers when ‘god’ says almostverbatim what the Sumerian tablets tell us. “We first created man from anessence of clay; then placed him, a living germ, in a secure enclosure. The germwe made a clot of blood, and the clot a lump of flesh. This we fashioned intobones, then clothed the bones with flesh…” Those words are absolutelyastounding, when compared to the biblical account of the birth of Adam, but evenmore inexplicable when compared to the Sumerian tablets, which were written some3,000 years before Mohammed. But it is the last part of this Koranic phrasewhich sends a sense of utter disbelief through one's body. As the Sumeriantablets talk about the creation of another species or a new creature which theyreferred to as the ‘primitive worker’, so the Koran says: “… thus bringing forthanother creation.”I trust that all Imams and preachers will argue the use of the term “We” as theway in which God would refer to himself. I find it a little strange that thisterm is not consistent and is rather prevalent in the part where the ‘creationof man’ is outlined. The Sumerian tablets clearly describe that the creation wasperformed by three Anunnaki gods, and therefore the collective “We” is used. Ifthe angel Gabriel was a messenger for Marduk, the son of Enki who proclaimedhimself as ‘god above all others’ he would have most certainly delivered themessage in those terms to Mohammed. No matter how we look at the globalreligions, the ancient Sumerian gods are ever-present, doing the same kind ofrecognisable things, which become very familiar the more we read the ancientclay tablets and compare them to all the so-called ‘sacred’ books of the latterreligions.Sikhism. Origin circa 1500 AD.Sikhism is the ninth largest religion in the world today with over 23 millionfollowers. This relatively new faith was founded by Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji inthe Punjab area, which today crosses from India to Pakistan. He was born in1469, probably in the village of Talvandi, which is about 40 miles south-west ofLahore. At some stage during the year 1500 he began the life of a wanderingascetic, travelling all over India and possibly even beyond to distant placesfor many years. His travels are well documented in a collection of writingscalled the Janam-sakhis. The teachings of Guru Nanak can loosely be described asa blend of Hindu tradition and Muslim belief, but this kind of representationcould easily be misinterpreted so we need to be careful not to simplify it insuch a way. He was fortunate enough to be granted a piece of land on the banksof the river Ravi and there he established the village of Kartarpur. The GuruNanak spent most of his life in this village until he died in 1539 AD, a datewhich most scholars seem to agree on.The Guru received a vision after which he began preaching the ‘way toenlightenment and God through inward meditation’. Sikhs believe in a singleformless God which they refer to by many names, one of which is ‘nirankar’, “theFormless One”, who can be known through meditation which also includes tantricyoga. Sikhs pray many times each day and are prohibited from worshipping idols.Guru Nanak tackled the age-old question of ‘how can one know God’ which heanswered this way: “One cannot know God, for God in his fullness is far beyondthe understanding of mortal beings.” But he also described God as “sarab viapak”meaning ‘everywhere present’ and ‘visible to the eye of the spiritually awakenedperson’. This becomes a pivotal point in our unravelling of world religions,because the Guru claimed that such ‘spiritually awakened’ people couldcommunicate with God, but only if they applied the specific principlesrigorously. He taught that the chief obstacle that impeded salvation was thehuman condition. He further said that people are imprisoned by the endlesscycles of life and death because of their attachment to worldly things. Suchpeople are known as victims of ‘maya’. Guru Nanak explained that people mustcomprehend the divine order of the universe in both physical and spiritualterms, and they should strive to bring themselves into harmony with it. The Sikhdiscipline breaks away from the common practices of most religions like templerites; mosque worshipping; pilgrimages and so on. “The only acceptable house ofworship is the human heart.” If you apply the principles of ‘nam siram’ astaught by the Guru, you will experience ‘growing towards God’ and ‘growing intoGod.’ They believe in karma and samsara (reincarnation of the soul or beingreborn as a new organism) as Hindus do, but Sikhs reject the caste system. Theybelieve that everyone has equal status in the eyes of god.The Sikhs have two collections of sacred scriptures. The first one, called AdiGranth, seems to carry more weight and is the undisputed canonical work. Whilethe second and later compilation, called the Dasam Granth, carries its owndistinctive importance. After the death of Guru Nanak, a series of nine Guruswho are regarded as reincarnations of Guru Nanak, led the Sikh movement until1708, each writing a contribution toward the sacred scriptures. The final text,the Shri Guru Granth Sahib, was compiled by the tenth Guru, Gobind Singh. Itconsists of the hymns and writings of the first ten Gurus, along with texts fromdifferent Muslim and Hindu saints. The holy text is considered the 11th andfinal Guru’s work. In 1931 Sikh scholars started to prepare the Reht Maryadawhich is the Sikh code of conduct and conventions which contains 27 articles:Article 1 defines who is a Sikh:“Any human being who faithfully believes in:One Immortal Being,Ten Gurus, from Guru Nanak Dev to Guru Gobind Singh,The Guru Granth Sahib,The utterances and teachings of the ten Gurus and the baptism bequeathed by thetenth Guru, and who does not owe allegiance to any other religion, is a Sikh.”The following extracts are taken from the translation of the Sri Guru GranthSahib by Dr. Sant Singh Khalsa. The words once again display our confusedobsession with a schizophrenic god, with many influences from the Koran and someother evident feeders from Hinduism. But in the end, where does this chantingand meditating get us? I get a distinct feeling that it is a continuation of thefear of the ‘god of vengeance’ as he was known in biblical times and before. Thesame god who made the Egyptians so fearful and obedient. Although this religionis well-wrapped up in non-violence, their god certainly reserves the right todish out punishment whenever he deems fit. The verses seem to be wrapped in acoat of self preservation in the face of possible punishment, so let's chant thephrases just in case we need to appear to be pious:“The Lord Master, the Lord of the Universe, is infinite and unapproachable; Godis the all-pervading Lord of all. The angels, the Siddhas, the beings ofspiritual perfection, the heavenly heralds and celestial singers meditate onYou. The Yakhsha demons, the guards of the divine treasures, and the Kinnars,the dancers of the god of wealth chant Your Glorious Praises. Millions of Indrasand countless gods and super-human beings meditate on the Lord Master andcelebrate His Praises. The Merciful Lord is the Master of the masterless, ONanak; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one is saved.”“Millions of gods and goddesses of wealth serve Him in so many ways. Theinvisible and visible beings worship Him in adoration… All the sources ofcreation, and all languages meditate on Him, forever and ever… He is thePurifier of sinners, the Lover of His Saints; As much as God has revealed to us,that much we can speak with our tongues…We are all beggars, He is the One andonly Giver; He is not far away, but is with us, ever-present. Chant the Naam,the Name of the Lord of the Universe; don't be lazy… you shall not have to go tothe City of Death. Pain, trouble and fear will not afflict you; meditating onthe Naam, a lasting peace is found. With each and every breath, worship the Lordin adoration; meditate on the Lord God in your mind and with your mouth. O kindand compassionate Lord, O treasure of sublime essence, treasure of excellence,please link me to Your service…The Purifier of sinners is the Naam, the PureName of the Immaculate Lord. The darkness of doubt is removed by the healingointment of the Guru's spiritual wisdom. By the healing ointment of the Guru'sspiritual wisdom, one meets the Immaculate Lord God, who is totally pervadingthe water, the land and the sky. If He dwells within the heart, for even aninstant, sorrows are forgotten. The wisdom of the all-powerful Lord and Masteris incomprehensible; He is the Destroyer of the fears of all… The Lord Mastersaves even the sinners. So many are saved; they cross over the terrifyingworld-ocean, contemplating the Naam, the Name of the Lord. In the beginning andin the end, countless are those who seek the Lord… and grasp the protection ofthe Lord of the Universe, the merciful… The Lord is the Lover of His devotees;this is His natural way. Wherever the Saints worship the Lord in adoration,there He is revealed. God blends Himself with His devotees in His natural way,and resolves their affairs.”Bahá'í . Origin circa 1863 AD.The Baha'i Faith arose from Islam in the 1800s based on the teachings ofBaha'u'llah and has become a distinct worldwide faith with over six millionfollowers. It did not take too much reading of the Baha'i scriptures to realisethat the oppressive human obsession to please its violent and vengeful god is asevident here as it is in most other religions of the world. Here is a shortexample of what I mean. Please see the underlying subservient fear whichhighlights the ‘master-slave’ relationship established by the Anunnaki gods ofancient times. This is an extract from the Epistle of the Son of the Wolfclearly highlighting the sinfulness of Humankind, very quickly reminding themthat if they ‘fear and obey’ they will be spared some horrific retribution:“Alas, alas, for my waywardness, and my shame, and my sinfulness, and mywrong-doing that have withheld me from the depths of the ocean of Thy unity andfrom fathoming the sea of Thy mercy. Wherefore, alas, alas! and again alas,alas! for my wretchedness and the grievousness of my transgressions! Thou didstcall me into being, O my God, to exalt Thy Word, and to manifest Thy Cause.”Baha'i followers believe that God has sent nine great prophets to mankindthrough whom the Holy Spirit has revealed the ‘Word of God’. They gave rise toall the major world religions. But the differences in the teachings of eachprophet are due to the needs of the society at the time, and they were adaptedto the level of revelation mankind was ready to digest at the time. This isfascinating, especially if you look at the apparent reversal of ‘digestible’revelations which followed Christianity. It seems to have gone downhill fromthere, through the conflicts between the Muslims and Christians, to thedestruction of the knowledge in the Dark Ages. Baha'i followers promote genderand race equality, freedom of expression and assembly, world peace and a worldgovernment. They believe that a single world government led by Baha'i's will beestablished at some point in the future. The faith does not attempt to preservethe past but does embrace the findings of science. Baha'i's believe that everyperson has an immortal soul which cannot die, but is freed to travel through thespirit world after death. This philosophy seems to clash with the fearfulrelationship with god which some of their writings portray. I must add that thisreligion looks very interesting as it seems to push the boundaries ofprogressive thought, including new-found knowledge in science and astronomy, andyet at the same time there are weird undertones which desperately hold onto someof the old dogmas from other religions. The Baha'i seem to pride themselves asbeing the new progressive faith for all, ready to take humanity into the newera. The following extract from the introduction to their most sacred book,Kitab-i-Aqdas, creates a conflict between old and new philosophies mainlybecause it desperately wants to move away from the ‘old’ and embrace the ‘newage’. Yet it advocates that its entire doctrine is squarely based on thefoundations of the ‘old dogmatic’ religions. How does one reconcile the two? Icannot help but wonder if the legacy of the manipulative, conniving Anunnaki isnot really behind this very cleverly disguised and attractive religiousmovement. This is a slice from the Sacred Texts website :“Of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred Writings ofBaha'u'llah, the Kitab-i-Aqdas is of unique importance. ‘To build anew the wholeworld’ is the claim and challenge of His Message, and the Kitab-i-Aqdas is theCharter of the future world civilisation that Baha'u'llah has come to raise up.Its provisions rest squarely on the foundation established by past religions,for, in the words of Baha'u'llah, ‘This is the changeless Faith of God, eternalin the past, eternal in the future.’ In this Revelation the concepts of the pastare brought to a new level of understanding, and the social laws, changed tosuit the age now dawning, are designed to carry humanity forward into a worldcivilisation the splendours of which can as yet be scarcely imagined. In itsaffirmation of the validity of the great religions of the past, theKitab-i-Aqdas reiterates those eternal truths enunciated by all the DivineMessengers: the unity of God, love of one's neighbour, and the moral purpose ofEarthly life. At the same time it removes those elements of past religious codesthat now constitute obstacles to the emerging unification of the world and thereconstruction of human society.”This chapter on religion was extremely difficult to compile and it took a greatdeal of energy not to produce a glossary of religions that reduces them to a fewpages of pulp fiction. But in the end, I have to be brutally honest and say thatI believe they do not deserve to be much more than pulp fiction. The amount ofhistory and culture surrounding each and everyone of the religions isastounding. After all, they are the cornerstones of their own communities. Isthat not ironic? The active ingredient for conflict and war is the cornerstoneof every society! Pretty messed up is it not? As hard as I tried to extract thenecessary essence to stimulate the reader's mind and show a clear thread ofconfusion that binds them all together, there is much more that could be saidand explored. But it is very apparent that they all share a few commonunderlying symptoms. The relentless search for something, which is reminiscentof the ancient mariners who went in search of the edge of the world; theconstant referral to fantastical beings with amazing powers; each one believingthat they have the answer; not one of them looking at our past with clarity ofmind to see where we may be heading. Those religions that do engage the humanpast, only do so with ulterior motives, which are mostly to disprove the otherswhile entrenching themselves as ‘the only one’. The result of all this manicactivity has dumped me squarely in a giant void of uncertainty greater than whenI started investigating our fabulous religions. We are constantly faced by a godwho is brutal and selfish, imposes all kinds of hardships on humans; changes hisname and then does the same thing elsewhere. Or he enslaves humans on thisplanet in never-ending cycles of karmic madness, in the weird hope that theignorant humans will learn from their mistakes. How could they possibly learnfrom their mistakes if they keep returning to the same place, more stupid thanbefore?The true face of God has not been revealed; our origins have not been explained;we still don't know who we are, where we come from and why we are here. I amtalking about the real facts and not the fairytale and horror stories which havekept us humans enslaved for too long. You be the judge. Does the outline of ourso-called holy religions give you a feeling of confidence, and that we have itall under control? I am afraid it does the opposite. It graphically exposes theinsecurity of Humankind and our constant struggle to find out the real truthabout ourselves. But it is so tightly wrapped up in syrups of differentflavours, that it has most probably caused a global diabetes syndrome and wemust be losing our sight and other senses. Surely the answers to our problemsare not to be found in the dogma of these man-made religions?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14 [../Text/toc.html#chapter14]MYTHS & LIES THE LIVING GODS [../Text/toc.html#chapter14a]I recall vividly the first day I discovered a story about prehistoricmythological gods and their adventures. It sounded like the world's greatestfairytale and yet it possessed some kind of mystery that made it feel more realthat any other story I had ever heard. The characters were so well-defined thatI could not help but imagine they were real. Flying through the skies, crossingthe world in a flash, causing the thunder and rain and bringing love andfertility to people while somehow being engaged in a perpetual battle for somerighteous cause. It was mainly the Greek gods, Roman gods and the Egyptian godsthat I was so taken by. Although I was told on many occasions that they were notreal, and they were merely imaginary deities who arose out of people'soveractive minds over thousands of years, I refused to believe that. I reallywanted to believe that these ancient gods were real. They were so majestic,all-knowing, all-powerful with extravagant palaces all over the world in secretplaces, where man could never set foot. The more I heard of these stories, themore I wanted them to be real. What my motivation was I will never know, but Isuspect that it was really just the thought of touching the untouchable. Thegoddesses always looked so sexy and even as a young boy they had alreadyappealed to me.As far as I was concerned, these magnificent gods and goddesses lived in asecret place in the world which was well hidden from humans, and that they wouldkeep it a great secret from us forever. I was so taken by these gods that theyconsumed my teenage years and I wrote numerous songs about them from Zeus, theall powerful; Venus, the sexy goddess of love and every man's ultimate fantasy;Bacchus, Mercury, Thor, Apollo and even the terrible Beelzebub. I wanted toimmortalise these exciting characters in my own way. In hindsight I find thisrather strange behaviour and it intrigues me why they made such an impression onme and why I behaved in such a manner. As the years wore down my impressionablequalities, I began to wonder what the possibilities were, that maybe somewherein the distant past such deities may have actually existed on Earth, and thatthey may be more than just fantasy characters. I'm sure that I am just one ofmany millions of screwed-up individuals who have had such thoughts at somestage. But my history teachers were steadfast in their pronouncement that theywere most definitely just imaginary characters of simple people who neededsomething to believe in. Those simple, primitive people, folk from the distantpast must have had great imagination, I thought, saddened by the reality thatmodern man no longer has such a vivid imagination… such detailed imagination…such convincing imagination which can last for thousands of years. But in theeducation system of the western world, which is driven relentlessly byJudeo-Christian monotheistic beliefs, any teachers who would carelessly admit tothe possible existence of ancient gods would be rapidly dismissed. That littlepart I did not know for some time. The part that has firmly held our culturesand customs in a stranglehold for 2,000 years. It started to dawn on me thatpeople today are as fearful of their god, as the ancient people were fearful ofthe multitude of gods they prayed to. The only real difference was that theprimitive people could see their gods, while we modern humans with fantastictechnology cannot see our god. But this has not always been the case however,because the forefathers of our great modern religions saw ‘god’ all the time.That was such an exciting discovery for me – it had actually been staring me inthe face all the time. Of course… Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Ezekiel, Isaiah,David, and many other heroes of the Bible had regular contact with ‘our’ god ashe came down from the heavens to converse with our forefathers and give them hiscommands. The only god, the real god, the god of love, the most vengeful god,but also the righteous god. So there it was, our god was also sexy, spectacular,flew across the skies on clouds and chariots and lived in a magnificent palacein the sky. We did not have to feel ashamed of our god in front of the ancientGreeks, Romans and Egyptians.Then one day, a small technicality dawned on me. The fact that all the greatcivilisations of the world have their own mythology filled with magnificentgods. It made me wonder how they all seem to have heard about these gods allover the world. A well informed 13-year-old friend of mine promptly provided theanswer. “People passed the stories down from one generation to another forthousands of years and that is how they spread all over the world,” he saidconvincingly. How stupid could I be… of course! That is what people did, theytold stories to their children and the stories travelled around the world beingtold by mothers to their children everywhere. That seemed like a very plausiblesolution to me and I was happy for a while. But as the years went by and Istarted to delve into more juicy literature, I suddenly wasn't so sure anymore.How is it possible that every civilisation around the world had a similar set ofgods they prayed to? And the gods did not take thousands of years to reach them,they suddenly appeared out of the blue, taking control of the local humans'lives and destinies? Let me explain the logistical problem to you. Even today,with international flight possible, with media covering every corner of theworld, people who travel to all parts of the world carrying news and messagesand cultural influences with them, it is still extremely difficult to get amessage across, which people will accept, swallow and buy into. Even RichardBranson with his global brands and global influence finds it difficult to launcha new idea like Virgin Cola everywhere. People must be really impressed bysomething to embrace it or they must be enticed to embrace it by the promise ofreward, or forced to embrace it by the threat of violence. It is therefore verydifficult to swallow modern-day explanations of how the primitive people of theworld all got to hear the stories about these fantastical gods.What makes these assumptions even more silly is the problem of antiquity, whenthe people of ancient times had no idea who lived 200 miles away from them, letalone 10,000 miles away, which included 7,000 miles of treacherous ocean. Itrust you are starting to grasp the problem. How could those amazing stories ofmajestic gods have travelled such distances? And who was telling those storiesto the people 11,000 years ago? And who actually created those stories? Did theyoriginate in the Near East, in Mesopotamia, in the Far Eastern lands of Chinaand Japan, or in the Americas where the Mayan and Inca civilisations wereblooming way back then. The stories could also have originated in many otherparts of the world, even among more remote cultures like the Inuits, Khoi-San,Aboriginals, Maori… you see the problem? Suddenly our spectacular mythologicalstories pose a real challenge to us in tracing them back to their mythicalorigin. It just does not seem to make any sense. The flood story is a greatexample of similar tales which were told by many cultures scattered over theworld. We have explored some of those examples of similarity in a previouschapter. And it gets even more confusing when we realise that all the ancientcultures had very much the same group of gods they prayed to, they feared, theymade offerings to, they were protected by, they were punished by, and gods whomthey seemed to have regular contact with. If this sounds a little strange, letme quickly remind you of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses and other biblical legendswho had exactly those kind of experiences with their god constantly, throughouttheir lives. It was as if the gods were controlling the people's lives on adaily basis in ancient history. By this I mean all the people, including ourbiblical heroes. Is it possible that the gods of the ancient Mesopotamians andGreeks were the same gods of Noah and Abraham? The many descriptions in theSumerian tablets by kings and priests of their gods are very similar to thedescriptions by the biblical characters of god. Let me also ask my question fromthe first chapter. Why has it been 2000 years since god has actually physicallyappeared before someone of international stature, or anyone else for that matterand had a conversation with them? Why is it that the many appearances by angelsand god himself, have come to a stop? Is it because of our growing awareness andintelligence as a species? And the development of audiovisual technology, whichcould very easily expose the so-called angels as something very different?The puzzle of the ancient gods is a crucial element in the quest for our originswhich needs to be answered, before we find more clarity on who we are and wherewe come from. Let's face it, all the insipid explanations of how the primitivepeople created these gods from their imagination when they were bored thousandsof years ago is simply not plausible and it stinks of our modern-day arrogance.There are simply too many holes and too many incredible coincidences. The mostvisible coincidence in the mythological god question, is the simple fact thatall the ancient cultures had virtually exactly the same gods with the samehierarchy. There is always the supreme god who in most cases is responsible forcreating the world; his sons and daughters; their offspring and their offspringand so on. The amazing thing is, that in each case the god was incrediblywell-profiled. The people knew which aspects of their world each god wasresponsible for, how the gods looked, what they wore, how they travelled, inwhat kind of machine, whom they were married to, or had kids with, what theyliked and disliked, what offerings people should make to them if the gods wereangry, and when the people had sinned. In most cases people even knew where thegod actually lived. The one overwhelming characteristic that all the gods seemedto share was their potential for violence, strong-handedness, vengeance andpunishment of the humans. But the gods also rewarded their loyal servants forperforming good deeds, just like in the Bible. Those deeds were however normallycommands or very strongly worded ‘requests’ by the gods.Genesis 13:14 -17.“The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, ‘Lift up your eyes fromwhere you are and look north and south, east and west. All the land that you seeI will give to you and your offspring forever. Go, walk through the length andbreadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.’”There are many cases in the Bible where god rewards his servants, and theso-called mythical gods were equally generous when they wanted to be… only whenthey wanted something. There was always a hidden agenda behind god's requests.People first had to do something, go somewhere, perform some arduous task,before they received some form of reward. The reward was more often than not,grandiose. There is just too much detailed information in the relationshipbetween the mythical gods and the people of ancient times, to have been afigment of people’s imagination. Much of the detail includes physical andmaterial interaction between man and god which in today's world would becompletely fantastical. The Greeks described their gods as anthropomorphic,which means that they looked like humans in most respects. They also displayedall the same human characteristics. They were happy, angry, jealous, argued andfought, had likes and dislikes, they loved sex and procreated like humans bycreating offspring through sexual intercourse. They were untouchable andunreachable and yet they were constantly mixed up in human affairs. Theytravelled at high speeds around the world, disappeared in a flash and arrived inan instant. They each had specific functions and weapons of great destructionand unusual power. People made ritual offerings to win their favour but theywere extremely unpredictable and could change their minds quickly, depending ontheir mood.The most compelling argument against the mythological god theory, is that around9,000 years BC shortly after the emergence of civilisation in Sumer, the earlyforefathers of the great Mayan civilisation had also popped up. What is totallymind-boggling is that they also knew all about agriculture, planting andharvesting crops, domesticating animals, had communal settlements like villagesand cities where they displayed a remarkable grasp for trade and commerce. Theyhad their own currency, they had seemingly endless supplies of gold, they alsoknew the process of gold ore mining. The Mayan civilisation has baffledarchaeologists for the past 200 years, when the rape of the continent firstsubsided and historical interest was raised, but even today there seems to be noclarity regarding its actual origins, true age and relevance to the Sumeriancivilisation. Or is there? Ancient China had a god who actually lived among thepeople and performed wondrous deeds for them. Does that sound familiar? Theparallels with Jesus are astounding. Kuan Ti was a god of war. The ‘Great Judge’who protected the people from injustice and evil spirits. A red-faced god alwaysdressed in green, he was also an oracle. Kuan Ti was an actual historicalfigure, a general of the Han dynasty, renowned for his skills as a warrior andhis justness as a ruler. There were more than 1,600 temples dedicated to KuanTi. This sounds a lot more like the messiah for whom the Jews were waiting. Awarrior king to lead them out of slavery and defeat all their enemies.The other fascinating coincidence is that most of the mythologies, althoughthousands of miles and years apart, seemed to have a pantheon of 12 main godswho commanded a whole host of other lesser gods, who were mostly siblings orother relatives. This was one big family affair. Why would it be kept in thefamily in such a fashion? Cast your mind back to biblical events. There too, theheir to a father’s riches would be the son of his half-sister and not the son ofhis wife. Abraham had an episode like that and the Sumerian gods kept this purebloodline ritual going most of the time, except when it all got out of hand andthe “Sons of the gods saw the daughters of man and had children with them” as isoutlined in Genesis 6.Genesis 6:1 - 8.“When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born tothem, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and theymarried any of them they chose. Then the LORD said, ‘My Spirit will not contendwith man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twentyyears.’ The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward when thesons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were theheroes of old, men of renown. The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on theearth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart wasonly evil all the time. The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth,and his heart was filled with pain. So the LORD said, ‘I will wipe mankind, whomI have created, from the face of the earth men and animals, and creatures thatmove along the ground, and birds of the air for I am grieved that I have madethem.’ But Noah found favour in the eyes of the LORD.”This passage is another perfect example of how the ruling gods did not wanttheir blood contaminated with the slave species. They needed to stay pure tostay more powerful and in control, which was showing signs of slipping. Theslave species had found new wisdom and were no longer prepared to be treated sobadly. And now that the sons of the gods were marrying mortal ‘slave women’, theoffspring would have an advanced genome, be more intelligent and live muchlonger. Already then, the gods had decided that they would not “contend with manforever, and his days on earth are numbered”, as is outlined in verse 3 above.They knew very well of the impending cosmic gravitational effect which was goingto cause the Great Flood, when Nibiru came closer to the Sun. This would takecare of the human problem forever.Let's take a look at the major ancient civilisations and their prominent gods,to see how closely they resemble each other in description, responsibility,behaviour and many other characteristics. Let us start with the Sumerian gods,since they seem to be the oldest of the lot and probably are the ‘originals’upon which all the rest were modelled. We can say this with confidence becausethe Sumerians actually recorded their god's names in tablets called The SumerianKing Lists, with genealogies and tales in great detail. This ancient tabletcontains some 149 names of kings and gods dating back to before the flood and sofar there have not been any older discoveries made. Sumerian gods were thepredecessors for later Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian civilisations; the samegods with different names. Sometimes the names differed very slightly, as in ANand ANU. At first sight, the list of names looks like a mish-mash of confusion,but on closer inspection we realise that they were all related and that thenieces and nephews and grandsons were allocated less important positions mostlyin the smaller towns and villages. They were probably no more than foot soldiersposted out in the country to maintain a presence. Zecharia Sitchin points outthat one such example of a lesser god with no awesome weapons or powers orheroic tales was NIN.KASHI. This goddess supervised the beverages and her nameliterally meant ‘lady beer’. These lesser gods were referred to as ‘gods ofEarth’.Each of the important deities was the patron of one or more Sumerian city andlarge temples were erected in the name of such deities, who were worshipped asthe divine ruler and protector of the city. Temple rites were conducted by manypriests, priestesses, singers, musicians, sacred prostitutes, and eunuchs. Thegods required that sacrifices were offered to them daily, which was a clever wayof staying in close contact with their slave species and maintaining asubservient mentality among them. The Sumerians believed that human beings were‘fashioned out of clay’ just like in many later cultures and religions, and werecreated for the purpose of supplying the gods with food, drink, and shelter, sothat the gods might have full leisure for their divine activities.Once you unravel the long list of names you end up with a pantheon of powerfuldeities who ruled Earth with an iron fist. The Sumerians called them ‘gods ofHeaven and Earth’. These were the gods who struck fear into mortals with theirawesome weapons as they regularly moved between heaven and Earth in their ‘boatsof heaven’. They were ‘international’ gods who were active in various parts ofthe world where they had established mining activities. It is therefore logicalto assume that because of their constant movement from place to place, the local‘slave species’created their own localised stories about the ‘gods of heaven’.They were powerful with abilities way beyond human comprehension and yet theylooked like humans, ate like humans, they displayed the same emotions like love,hate, loyalty, anger and infidelity. This amazing similarity has baffledhistorians and anthropologists for years, mainly because they have constantlyrelegated Sumerian gods into the category of mythology. The moment we venturebeyond this small-minded outlook, we can clearly recognise the genetic linkbetween humans and their gods. The pantheon of ‘gods of Heaven and Earth’ werethe original settlers on planet Earth who established a powerful dynasty longbefore humanity entered the picture. This is what the Sumerians believed andwhat they wrote about. It is also important to come to terms with the realitythat it was not about the humans, but our ancient past was all about the gods.Humankind was a mere accidental ‘bystander’ who was created to ease the dailygrind of the gods. That is why the ancient humans were so absorbed by them. Afamily of advanced proto-humans who settled on Earth, our creators, theso-called gods who have ruled this planet for over 400,000 years. They wereclosely related and yet at times, they were bitterly divided.Sumerian gods.AN or ANU in Babylonian, Akkadian, Assyrian. Great father of the gods. The godof the sky, creator of heaven and Earth – God above all. His pictographic symbolwas a star which also stood for An, Heaven, divine being or god. Anu dwellsvirtually exclusively in the celestial heaven, from where he controls allworldly activities. Only seldom does he venture down to Earth and when he doesit is for a special occasion. He meets the assembly of other gods in hisheavenly abode to settle disputes; he gives advice or reaches major decisions.The other gods have to ask permission to enter Anu's abode, but there arestories of mortal humans being taken up to Anu, almost always in search ofimmortality. The Tree of Life and Tree of Truth were in Anu's heavenly palacebeing guarded by vigilant gods named after each tree.ENLIL: First son of Anu. The second most powerful deity. His name meant ‘Lord ofthe airspace’. He is the god who controls all of the Earth. The god of Earth,wind and storms. The principal ‘god of Heaven and Earth’ because he descended toEarth from the heavenly abode. The master of men's fates. Enlil sent the floodwhich destroyed all mankind except Ziusudra and his family. Sumerians said that“in heaven he is the prince, on Earth he is the chief”. He made Earth quake. Hewas on Earth long before it was settled by man. He first raped his young virginconcubine by the name of SUD, before tracking her down later and marrying her.He bestowed the new name on her: NINLIL, which meant ‘lady of the airspace’. Hehad a son, who became his heir, with his half-sister NINHURSAG. Their sonNINURTA was portrayed as a “heroic son of Enlil who went forth with net and raysof light”.ENKI: Second son of Anu, also known as EA, which meant ‘house-water’. Also a‘god of Heaven and Earth’. Master engineer, god of water and lord of the saltwater who loved sailing. He built ships that sailed far and wide, and he alsobrought back riches like gold to Sumer. Supreme god of magic and wisdom andmining. Patron of the arts who was also an oracle. Prince of the Earth. He builthis house at ERIDU. He mated with Ninhursag (Lady of the mountainhead) who washis half-sister but could not produce a male heir. He created the plants andgave men agriculture. He constantly struggled against his brother Enlil. He wasthe architect of Adam and the one who warned Ziusudra or ‘Noah’ about theimpending calamity.ERESHKIGAL: Goddess of the underworld or ‘lower world’, and consort of Nergal.Some consider her a dark side or aspect of Ishtar. When Ishtar descended intothe underworld to save Tammuz, Ereshkigal tricked her into leaving some part ofher clothing or insignias at each of the underworld's seven gates as she passedthrough them. Standing naked at the seventh gate, Ishtar threw herself onEreshkigal; but she was powerless like Samson without his hair. Ereshkigalconfined Ishtar in the underworld until the wily Ea contrived her release with atrick.ISHTAR: Sumerian – INANNA; Egyptian – ASTARTE; Roman – VENUS; Greek – APHRODITE.She was the greatest of all the mother goddesses of the Mesopotamians. Goddessof love and fertility, goddess of sex, goddess of the moon, goddess of war. Ladyof heaven, lady of sorrow and battles. The great lover, the great mother. Thehuman-hero-god Gilgamesh spurned her which ensured his death. Her star is Venusand the lion is her cult animal. Ishtar's love is all-consuming and even deadly.Ishtar's worship involved phallic symbols, sacred whores and painted priests inwomen's clothing. Many temples were built in her honour, which were minded bypriestesses who performed sexual rites in her honour. Such as the one at Uruk.MARDUK: Also known as RA and AMUN. The great god of Babylon, King of Kings,Guardian of the Law, the Great Sorcerer, the Great Healer, slayer of Tiamat.Marduk represents ‘order fighting against chaos’ which is the conflict fromwhich all Creation emerges. Defeating Tiamat, Marduk brought order and life tothe world. When the tablets of destiny were seized from Kingu, Marduk fastenedthem to his own breast, and so brought control of the Earth under the divineauthority of the gods. The stela of Hammurabi shows Marduk on his throne with ahorned headdress, giving Hammurabi his ring and sceptre. The Amorites saw Mardukas a god of spring and sunlight, of herbs and trees.NEBO: Also NABU, the son of Marduk. God of writing and speech, speaker for thegods. Nebo maintains records of men's deeds and produces them for judgment afterdeath. His symbol is the stylus.NERGAL: God of the underworld, mass destruction and plague, consort ofEreshkigal. Thrown out of heaven, he stormed the underworld with fourteen demonsuntil Ereshkigal consented to marry him.NINHURSAG: Also MAAT ‘lady mountain.’ An Earth mother. She moulded the first manout of clay and brought him to life with the blood of Kingu.SHAMASH: Also UTU, son of the moon god Sin, brother and husband to Ishtar. Thegreat god of justice. In Sumer, a god of divination. The enemy of darkness andall the evil darkness brings.SIN: Also NANNAR, the moon god. Wise and secretive, the enemy of all evilspirits. An old man with a long beard who flies through the sky in his sailboatevery night.TAMMUZ: Also DUMUZI, God of the harvest. The god who dies and rises again. Thelove of Ishtar killed him, and Ishtar fought Ereshkigal in the underworld tobring him back.Mayan gods and goddesses.The ancient Mayans had a complex pantheon of deities whom they worshipped andduring the later periods of their civilisation they even offered humansacrifices to their gods. The Mayan rulers were believed to be descendants ofthe gods and their blood was the ideal sacrifice, either through personalbloodletting or the sacrifice of captives. Their religious rituals wereelaborate and imposing, and they hosted frequent festivals to honour their gods,with special honours to the deified national heroes Itzamna and Kukulcan. Thewhole country was dotted with temples, usually great stepped pyramids. Every godhad a special feast day set aside especially for them. The mild approach towardssacred rituals of the Mayas was in strong contrast to the bloody ritual of theAztecs who succeeded them into a new, more brutal epoch of Humankind. Humansacrifice was forbidden by Kukulcan (their primary deity) and crept in only inlater years. It was never a prominent feature, except at Chichen-Itza where itat least became customary, on occasion of some great national crisis, tosacrifice hundreds of voluntary victims of their own race, frequently virgins,by drowning them in one of the subterranean rock wells after which the bodieswere drawn out and buried.Mayan creational mythology refers to deities from other realms who came to Earthto seed the planet. The Popol Vuh is the most sacred book of the Mayas and manypeople see the story of the Popol Vuh as the story of extraterrestrial gods whocame down to Earth and made man in his own image. When they first made man hewas too perfect, with a lifespan as long as theirs, he could see far and wideand was as perceptive as they were. They realised that they had made a mistake,and created a competitor who was as wise as the gods themselves. They proceededto destroy man and started over again, creating present-day man who livesshorter lifetimes, is not as smart, and is here to act as a slave-servant to thegods.One part of this story tells us of the gods' first attempt to create humans,only succeeding after several attempts, ‘he’ created the “True People” byconstructing them with maize.“They came together in darkness to think and reflect. This is how they came todecide on the right material for the creation of man. ... Then our Makers Tepewand Q'uk'umatz began discussing the creation of our first mother and father.”This story is identical to that in the Sumerian tablets 10,000 miles across theAtlantic. How is that possible? Unless the same gods had a hand in all thisactivity? In another part of the Popol Vuh, it talks about how mankind had beencreated as a servant of the gods.“Let us make him who shall nourish and sustain us…We have already tried with ourfirst creations, our first creatures; but we could not make them praise andvenerate us. So then, let us try to make obedient, respectful beings who willnourish and sustain us.”These various references took me by complete surprise when I first stumbled uponthem. It is virtually identical to the theory which I had formulated beforesetting out to write this book. But I had not laid eyes on the Popol Vuh or itsmeaning until I began researching this chapter. It was a great personaldiscovery to see that others long before me had already had such outlandishideas.The Mayan culture is filled with legends of visiting gods from outer space.Kukulcan, who was also later known as Quetzalcoatl, ‘the Great FeatheredSerpent’, was a god who brought the teaching of peace to this part of the worldand appeared as a white god with a beard. The drawings of him look almostidentical to the drawings of the deity known as Ea or Enki in the ancientSumerian teachings. It is therefore very interesting to compare Quetzalcoatl tothe Sumerian god Enki. The behaviour and resemblance is uncanny. Sumerian Enkitried to show Adam and Eve the secrets of life in the garden of Eden, and wasbanished after which he was referred to as the 'Devil’s snake', serpent, Satan,and every other vile name in an attempt to discredit him and make it extremelyundesirable for human slaves to associate with him. But scholars have pointedout that his ‘serpent’ name may have been confused in a translation from theoriginal Hebrew word Nanash, meaning ‘snake’, but its root is NHSH, which means‘to find out or to decipher’. These comparisons between the Mayan and Sumercultures are incredible. Is it possible that they are merely coincidences acrossthe Atlantic some 11,000 years ago? It seems that after Ea or Enki was demotedby his father Anu as a result of his benevolent actions towards humans, hetravelled the world and started his own settlements of human civilisations.After all, it was Ea who crafted the creation of the ‘Adamu’ according to theSumerians.The Mayan god Quetzalcoatl is depicted as a flying serpent, which makes perfectsense to those who can put the two together. He would fly in from afar to helpelevate his newly-chosen society, but he was soon followed by other relatives,gods with ulterior motives. They would not allow him to share their knowledgewith the primitive slave species. Clashes between gods is the stuff of which theMayan mythology was made of, just like in all the other parts of the world. Theywere a dynasty with infinite personal disagreements and humans wereunfortunately just the accidental bystanders who were dispensable. TheGuatemalans differ in their opinions and their acceptance of the Popol Vuh asthe true story of creation. Their affinity for the document varies depending ontheir religious upbringing and beliefs. Although the tale has parallels withmany other creation stories, including Genesis, some Guatemalan Catholicsclassify the Popol Vuh as an ‘artefact of history’, but not theology. This isfascinating! If they regard it as an historic event, it must have actually takenplace! It can therefore not be regarded as mythology. And yet most historiansclassify it as such.This interaction with gods around the world leads us right back to the notionthat as advanced as the Nefilim or Anunnaki may have been in space travel andgenetics, they were certainly not the complete ‘genetic beings’. Their violentbehaviour is a clear indication of an imperfect genome which we undoubtedlyinherited from them. Here are the events in the Garden of Eden, when ‘Nahash’the snake, tries to educate Adam and Eve but is caught in the act by god… inthis case his brother Enlil, who was of higher rank. Note the physicalinteraction and the fact that ‘god’ did not know about the eating of the apple.He was just walking through the garden when he overheard Adam's interaction withthe ‘snake’. Is that possible? That god would not know all things, taking astroll in the shade of the trees on a hot day? Having to call Adam's name to askwhere they were hiding and to drag a confession out of Adam? Here is the extractfrom Genesis for your own consideration. Also remember that the word ‘tree’ is asymbolic metaphor and not necessarily an actual tree.Genesis 3:1 -13. The Fall of Man.“Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God hadmade. He said to the woman, ‘Did God really say, you must not eat from any treein the garden?’ The woman said to the serpent, ‘We may eat fruit from the treesin the garden, but God did say, You must not eat fruit from the tree that is inthe middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’. ‘Youwill not surely die,’ the serpent said to the woman. ‘For God knows that whenyou eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing goodand evil.’ When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food andpleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some andate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Thenthe eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so theysewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. Then the man andhis wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in thecool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.But the LORD God called to the man, ‘Where are you?’ He answered, ‘I heard youin the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.’And he said, ‘Whotold you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded younot to eat from?’ The man said, ‘The woman you put here with me - she gave mesome fruit from the tree, and I ate it.’ Then the LORD God said to the woman,‘What is this you have done?’ The woman said, ‘The serpent deceived me, and Iate.’”So now that we have a slightly broader view of the activities in the Garden ofEden, a look at the Mayan gods will help us recognize the behaviour of the ‘goodgod’ Quetzalcoatl, who was possibly also the human-loving Enki, the Sumerian godwho created Humankind as the slave species. I'd like to remind you at this pointthat the term ‘Underworld’ was most likely derived from the original Sumerianname given to the southern hemisphere where Enki discovered all the gold. It wascalled the ‘Lower World’ as opposed to ‘Upper World’ where the other gods lived,in Sumer. With time, the subtle change to ‘Underworld’ became associated with a‘dark and horrid’ world deep in the caverns of Earth, where the devil dwelled.Also known as Hell. So when mythological stories talk about the ‘Underworld’, itshould be seen as Southern Africa, or Abzu, as the Sumerians called it. And notnecessarily Hell!List of Mayan gods.Kukulcan or Quetzalcoatl - Winged God -Feather Serpent:The Mayans called him Kukulcan - The wind god, was also known as the ‘FeatheredSerpent’. The latter cultures called him Quetzalcoatl. His pyramid was thePyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacán, the most spectacular of all the centralAmerican pyramids. Quetzalcoatl was tracked to Egypt, Sumer, then later toMesoamerica and Peru. Quetzalcoatl is also the Aztec name for theFeathered-Serpent deity of ancient Mesoamerica, one of the main gods of manyMexican and Central American civilisations. The name ‘Quetzalcoatl’ literallymeans divine-bird snake or serpent with feathers of the Quetzal, which impliessomething divine or precious in the Nahuatl language. The Feathered Serpentdeity was a central figure in art and religion in most of Mesoamerica until theSpanish invasion. All the other Mesoamerican civilisations have worshipped theFeathered Serpent - the Olmec, the Mixtec, the Toltec, and the Aztec. In somelatter cultures the worship of Quetzalcoatl sometimes included human sacrifices,although in some traditions Quetzalcoatl was said to oppose human sacrifice. Hissignificance and attributes varied somewhat between civilisations and throughhistory. Quetzalcoatl was often considered the god of the morning star under thetitle Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, which means literally ‘the lord of the star of thedawn’. He was known as the giver of maize corn to mankind and the inventor ofbooks and the calendar. Sometime as a symbol of death and resurrection.Quetzalcoatl was also the patron of the priests. All the characteristics fit theprofile of the god Enki in Sumer.Most Mesoamerican civilisations believe that the world exists in cycles. Ourcurrent time is considered the fifth world, the previous four having beendestroyed by flood, fire and other disasters. Quetzalcoatl went to theunderworld, Mictlan, and created the fifth-world mankind from the bones of theprevious races, using his own blood to imbue the bones with new life. You willsee in the last chapter when we look at Sumerian tablets, how incredibly similarthis story is to that of Enki, while creating the first human ‘Adamu’. It issimply too close to be coincidental. Quetzalcoatl was a god of such importanceand power that nearly every aspect of everyday life seemed to be touched by him.As a legend, he would signal the end of mortal kingship.Chac: The god of rain. Benevolent god for the Mayans, who often sought his helpfor their crops. Chac was associated with creation and life. Chac was alsoconsidered to be divided into four equal entities. North, south, east, and west.Chac was also apparently associated with the wind god, Kukulcan. There is somedebate whether or not Kukulcan was just a variation of Chac. Or could he havebeen the son of Enki, known as Ningishzidda?Kinich Ahau: The Sun god. He was the patron god of the city Itzamal. He visitedthe city at noon every day. He would descend as a macaw and consume preparedofferings. Kinich Ahau is usually shown with jaguar-like features. Kinich Ahaualso wears the symbol of Kin, a Mayan day. He was also known by the name Ah XocKin, who was associated with poetry and music.Yumil Kaxob: The maize god, representing ripe grain which was the base of theMayan agriculture. In some parts of Mesoamerica, like Yucatan, the maize god iscombined with the god of flora. He is shown with a headdress of maize and acurved streak on his cheek. He is distinguishable from other gods by his youth.The maize god was powerless by himself. His fortunes and misfortunes weredecided by the control of rain and drought. The Rain god would protect him buthe suffered when the Death god exercised drought and famine.Yum Cimil: The god of death. Also could be called Ah Puch, the god of theUnderworld with a predominantly skeletal body. His adornments are also made ofbones. Yum Cimil has also been represented with a body covered with black spotsdepicting decomposition. He also wears a collar with eyeless sockets. Thisadornment was the typical symbol for the Underworld. Could this have hadsomething to do with the tradition of mining, the symbolisms surrounding it, theclothing and protective gear the miners might have worn?Ixtab: Goddess of the dead – the suicide goddess. She receives their souls intoparadise and is always represented with a rope around her neck. The Mayansbelieved that suicides would lead you to heaven. It was common for suicides tohappen because of depression or for even more trivial reasons.Ix Chel:The ‘Lady Rainbow’ was the old moon goddess. She was depicted as an oldwoman wearing a skirt with crossed bones holding a serpent in her hand. She hadan assistant sky serpent, which they believed carried all of the waters of theheavens in its belly. She is often shown carrying a great jug filled with water,which she overturns to send floods and powerful rainstorms to Earth. Itzamna,her husband was the benevolent moon god. But Ix Chel had a kinder side and wasworshipped as the protector of weavers and women in childbirth.Other Mayan gods are:Ah Kinchil: Another name for the Sun god. Ah Puch: Another name for the god ofdeath. Ahau Chamahez: One of two gods of medicine. Ahmakiq: God of agriculture.He locks up the wind so it does not destroy the crops. Akhushtal: The goddess ofchildbirth. Bacabs: The bacabs are the canopy gods, thought to be brothers, who,with upraised arms, supported the multilayered sky from their assigned positionsat the four cardinal points of the compass. The Bacabs may also have been fourmanifestations of the same deity. The four brothers were possibly the offspringof Itzamna, the supreme deity, and Ixchel, the goddess of weaving, medicine, andchildbirth. Cit Bolon Tum: God of medicine. Cizin (Kisin): ‘Stinking One’; MayanEarthquake god and god of death, ruler of the subterranean land of the dead. Helives beneath the Earth in a purgatory where all souls except those of soldierskilled in battle and women who died in childbirth spend some time. Suicides aredoomed to his realm for eternity. Ekahau: God of travellers and merchants.Kan-u-Uayeyab: The god who guarded cities. Nacon: The god of war. Tzultacaj(Tzuultaq'ah): The god of the mountains and valleys. Yaxche: Is the Tree ofHeaven under which good souls rejoice.Egyptian gods.RE or RA:Egyptian sun god and creator god. He was usually depicted in human form with afalcon head, crowned with the sun disc encircled by the uraeus which was astylised representation of the sacred cobra. The sun itself was taken to beeither his body or his eye. He was said to traverse the sky each day in a ‘boatof heaven’ and pass through the underworld each night on another ‘boat ofheaven’ to reappear in the east each morning. His principal cult centre was atHeliopolis also known as ‘sun city’, near modern Cairo. Re was also consideredto be an underworld god, closely associated in this respect with Osiris. In thiscapacity he was depicted as a ram-headed figure. By the third millennium BC,Re's prominence had already become such that the pharaohs took to stylingthemselves as the ‘sons of Re’. After death, all the Egyptian monarchs wouldascend into the sky to join the entourage of the sun god. According to theHeliopolitan cosmology, Re was said to have created himself, either out of aprimordial lotus blossom, or on the mound that emerged from the primeval waters.He then created Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture), who in turn engendered theEarth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. Re was said to have created Humankindfrom his own tears and the gods Hu (authority) and Sia (mind) from blood drawnfrom his own penis. Re was often combined with other deities to enhance theprestige of such deities, as in Re-Atum and Amun-Re. We can see the amazingsimilarity to Marduk and his activity according to the Sumerian tablets. It iswritten that he dictated the writing of the Book of the Dead which gave thepharaohs clear instructions on how to reach the afterlife.OSIRIS or USIRE:Egyptian god of the underworld and of vegetation. Son of Nut and Geb. Hisbirthplace was said to be Rosetau in the necropolis west of Memphis. Brother ofNephthys and Seth, and the brother and husband of Isis. Isis gave birth to Horusafter his death, having impregnated herself with semen from his corpse. Osiriswas depicted in human form wrapped up as a mummy, holding the crook and flail.He was often depicted with green skin, alluding to his role as a god ofvegetation. He wore a crown known as the ‘atef’, composed of the tall conicalwhite crown of Upper Egypt with red plumes on each side. Osiris had many cultcentres, but the most important were at Abydos (Ibdju) in Upper Egypt, where thegod's legend was reenacted in an annual festival, and at Busiris (Djedu) in theNile delta. One of the so-called “dying gods”, he was the focus of a famouslegend in which he was killed by the rival god Seth. At a banquet of the gods,Seth fooled Osiris into stepping into a coffin, which he promptly slammed shutand cast into the Nile. The coffin was born by the Nile to the delta town ofByblos, where it became enclosed in a tamarisk tree. Isis, the wife of Osiris,discovered the coffin and brought it back. The story to this point is attestedto only by the Greek writer Plutarch, although Seth was identified as hismurderer as early as the Pyramid era of the Old Kingdom.Seth took advantage of Isis's temporary absence on one occasion, cut the body topieces, and cast it into the Nile. (In the Egyptian texts this incident accountsfor the murder of Osiris.) Isis searched the land for the body parts of Osiris,and was eventually able to piece together his body, whole save for the penis,which had been swallowed by a crocodile (according to Plutarch) or a fish(according to Egyptian texts). In some Egyptian texts, the penis is buried atMemphis. Isis replaced the penis with a reasonable facsimile, and she was oftenportrayed in the form of a kite being impregnated by the ithyphallic corpse ofOsiris. In some Egyptian texts, the scattering of the body parts is likened tothe scattering of grain in the fields, a reference to Osiris's role as avegetation god. ‘Osiris gardens’ – wood-framed barley seedbeds in the shape ofthe god, were sometimes placed in tombs – and the plants which sprouted fromthese beds symbolised the resurrection of life after death.It was this legend that accounted for Osiris' role as a god of the dead andruler of the Egyptian underworld. He was associated with funerary rituals, atfirst only with those of the Egyptian monarch, later with those of the populacein general. The pharaoh was believed to become Osiris after his death. Althoughhe was regarded as a guarantor of continued existence in the afterlife, Osirisalso had a darker, demonic aspect associated with the physiological processes ofdeath and decay, and reflecting the fear Egyptians had of death in spite oftheir belief in an afterlife. Osiris was also a judge of the dead, referred toas the ‘lord of Maat’ (i.e. of divine law).Legendary ruler of pre-dynastic Egypt and god of the underworld, Osiris,symbolised the creative forces of nature and the imperishability of life. Calledthe great benefactor of humanity, he brought to the people knowledge ofagriculture and civilisation. The worship of Osiris, one of the great cults ofancient Egypt, gradually spread throughout the Mediterranean world and, withthat of Isis and Horus, was especially vital during the Roman Empire.ISIS:Egyptian mother goddess, one of the great members of the pantheon. Greeks andRomans called her ‘star of the sea’ represented by the north star. Mother of theGod kings, offspring of Geb and Nut. Older sister and consort of Osiris. We seehow the half-sibling procreation continues among the gods to keep the bloodlinepure. Her other siblings are Seth and Nephthys. Depicted with a crown in theshape of a throne or cow's horns. She revived Osiris to life. Once after Seththrew his body into the Nile; and secondly, after Seth had dismembered the body.She impregnated herself from his corpse and gave birth to Horus, who struggledto lay claim to the throne against Seth. She is identical in action anddescription to the Sumerian goddess Inanna.GEB:Egyptian Earth god. Son of Shu and Tefnut. Brother and consort of the sky godNut. Father of Osiris, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys. Geb was generally depictedlying on his back, often wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, with the naked bodyof Nut arched above him. In this context, he was often shown with an erect penispointing upward toward Nut. Sometimes, the air god Shu was shown standing on thebody of Geb, supporting Nut and perhaps separating her from Geb. His skin wasoften green, indicative of his role as a god of fertility and vegetation. Thegoose was his sacred animal and his symbol in Egyptian hieroglyphics. Geb wasalso said to imprison the souls of the dead, preventing them from passing on tothe afterlife. The laughter of Geb was said to cause Earthquakes.SETH:God of chaos and adversity. Son of Geb and Nut and the sibling of Isis, Osirisand Nephthys. He tore himself violently from his mother's womb and is depictedwith a head of an animal resembling an aardvark, with erect ears and long snout.He is also linked to the Semitic goddess of war Anat and Astarte. In about 2500BC the kings of Egypt suddenly deserted Seth and sided with Horus, the ‘Falcongod’. Tuthmosis III called himself ‘The beloved of Seth’. Seth was jealous ofhis brother Osiris and fought an 80-year-war against him. He defended Ra againstthe hostile serpent god of the ‘Underworld’. We should remember that the god ofthe underworld or ‘Lower World’ was Enki, who was depicted as a serpent oftenwith wings, and Ra or Marduk, who was proclaiming himself as ‘god above all’ inEgypt.HORUS:Sky god. Also known as: Har, Har-pa-khered, Harpokrates, Harsiese, Harendotes,Harsomtus, Har-em-akhet, Harmachis and more. Horus is one of the most importantgods of the Egyptian pantheon, attested from the earliest recorded period. He isa universally worshipped god of Egypt and latter civilisations. Represented by afull hawk or human body with a falcon's head. Also recognised by the ‘eye’symbol. Son of Osiris and Isis. The first ruler of Egypt after an 80­-yearstruggle against his brother and rival Seth. His mother hid him in the papyrusbushes of the Nile to prevent him from being found by his enemies. This led tomany stories like the one of Moses in latter times. Sometimes depicted as a sundisk with wings. ‘Horus of the horizon.’MIN or MENU:Egyptian god of fertility but also ‘virility’. One of the important members ofthe pantheon of gods. Sometimes shown as the son of Isis or consort of Isis, andsometimes with Horus as his offspring from Isis. He is generally depicted asholding a flail in his raised right hand and wearing a crown with two tallplumes. Min was mainly a god of male sexuality, and in the New Kingdom(1567-1085 BC) he was honoured in the coronation rites of the pharaohs to ensuretheir sexual vigour and the production of a male heir. He was also depicted inhuman form with an erect penis. The \"White Bull\" appears to have been sacred tohim, as was a type of lettuce which bore a resemblance to an erect penis and hada white sap that resembled semen. He was also the guardian deity of mines. Hismost important sanctuaries were at Koptos (Qift) and Akhmim (Panoplis) whichwere gold mining locations. He was also worshipped as a god of desert roads andof travellers. In addition to his role in coronation rites, Min was honoured inharvest festivals during which offerings of lettuce and sheaves of wheat weremade.AMUN:The sun god, lord of the sky, the primeval deity present in creation and chaos.Probably the same god as RA. In latter times he became known as Amun-Ra.Probably the same god as Marduk, who proclaimed himself as ‘god above all’according to Sumerian texts. Sometimes portrayed as a pharaoh with blue skin anda turban (modius). He is surmounted by two tall feathered plumes, showing hisdominance over both upper and lower Egypt. His main place of worship is thetemple of Amun at Karnak and Luxor. Other deities described him as “hidden ofaspect, mysterious of form”. He earned the title ‘King of the gods’ and wasregarded as the father of all pharaohs. At Thebes he was revered as a snakedeity with connotations to immortality and renewal. This would fit the Sumeriandescription of the entwined serpent being the symbol of creation and knowledgeof science, used in the creation of ‘Adamu’. The temple of queen Hatsepsut atDeir el-Bahari bears a relief of her mother impregnated by Amun. Once again thisfits the link to Marduk, Ra and Amun, all being the same god, and insisting thatall kings and queens were descendants of the gods. This mean that sometimes Amunwould do the procreating himself. It also supports the belief among the pharaohsthat they were descendants of the gods.African gods.Of all the global cultures and civilisations, African mythology is the mostcolourful and diverse. And yet there is an underlying common thread of creation,descending supreme deities who were in charge, followed by other gods of lesserimportance who ruled the world and controlled all aspects of early human life onEarth. One often forgets that Egyptian mythology is part of African myth too.There are literally thousands of gods that have been woven into the tales ofAfrican mythology. They range from the very simple to the practical, from theignorant to the wise and prophetic. Many of the northern Mediterranean myths areclosely linked to the Egyptian gods, while the southern tales talk about godswho descend to Earth from their heavenly abode to make man, to teach them allthey need, like agriculture and intelligence. Tales about supreme gods who madeall the other gods and created the Earth from water and chaos. Gods who createdthe first man are a common ingredient in African myth. There are many referencesto a ‘flying serpent’ which seems a bit too coincidental once again to be afigment of their imagination. Lots of tales of two gods, one benevolent and oneviolent, who lived in the underworld and rose to the sky. Gods of thunder, godsof the sun, hunters, giants, bulls, and a variety of animals. A supreme god whocommands two lesser gods, who ruled after the creation was completed, who isidentical to the Sumerian stories. It points to the simple fact, that no matterhow far apart the global civilisations may have been in the distant past, theirtales of flying, powerful, benevolent and violent gods are all the same. But thediversity of African mythology also fits the historic accounts of the Sumeriantablets, that it was in southern Africa where the slave species was first put towork in the mines. It is truly incredible that many of the tales from theseparts echo such sentiment. And just like the gods from other parts of theprehistoric world, the gods are related, with a hierarchy of responsibility. Itmakes perfect sense that the simplest stories with very basic imagery shouldcome from Africa, since it was here that the original humans existed, who werefor all intents and purposes the ‘infants’ of Humankind. As they left the securemining compounds and established their own settlements and cultures, they wouldhave regular contact from the many gods involved in the mining operations andthe control thereof. And yet as we discovered in the chapter on gold, there werevery few if any temples and shrines built in Africa by those very early humans.They had no need to do so, and their relationship with the gods was not at aworship stage yet. The worshipping of gods was only imposed on humanity by thegods many years later when the slave species made its appearance in the NearEast. But the true enforcement of worship only really occurred after the GreatFlood, some 13,000 years ago. There are so many wonderful examples that it isdifficult to choose only a few for these pages. But even through the diversityof African mythology, there is an uncanny underlying similarity which points tothe character and activity of the Sumerian gods. The titles which Africans havegiven god are wondrous in their variety. A few of these are: Creator; Moulder;Giver of Rain and Sunshine; He Who Brings the Seasons; He Who Thunders; Ancientof Days; the First; the Limitless; the One Who Bends Even Kings; the One YouMeet Everywhere; the Firelighter; Great Mother; Greatest of Friends; the KindlyOne; the Providence Who Watches All Like the Sun; the Great Pool Contemporary ofEverything; the Great Spider; the One Beyond All Thanks; the Bow in the Sky; theAngry One; the Inexplicable.The following list is a brief and random example of African gods from a fewstories of ancient times:AGIPIE (Tanzania): A benevolent god who lives in the sky. He fights with theevil god who has lightning and destroys people.BUKU (Various West African peoples): A sky god sometimes worshipped as agoddess. Buku created everything, even the other gods.AKONGO (DRC): Supreme everlasting being, has good relations with humans.

A trickster. A creator god. Something of ascoundrel, but quite well-liked. Many amusing and fanciful stories are told ofhim.ANYIEWO: The Great Serpent who comes out to graze after the rain. The rainbow ishis reflection.BUNZI (DRC): She was born as a snake to a ‘god’ father and her great mother. Theserpent grew up and assumed the role of her mother which was rainmaking. Peoplewould see the serpent in the sky in the shape of the rainbow.DANH also DAN AYIDO HWEDO(Dahomey): Snake god. The Haitians know him as DanPetro, the Rainbow Snake who encircles the world, Danh is often portrayed withhis tail in his mouth as a symbol of unity and wholeness.DXUI (Bushmen; Hottentots, TSUI; to the Xhosa and Ponda, THIXO): A creator god.In the beginning, Dxui took the form of a different flower or plant every day,becoming himself at night, until he had created all the plants and flowers thatexist.ESHU (Yoruba): A trickster. A shape-shifter, Eshu can change his form at will,and can even seem to be both huge and small at the same time. Eshu confuses menand drives them to madness. But Eshu also knows all human tongues and acts as ago-between for mortals and the gods.DOONDARI (Mali, Senegal): The creator who descended to the Earth and created astone, which created iron, fire, water and air. Then he returned and shapedthose elements into man. But man became too proud, so he created blindness andalso death.DZEMAWON (Ghana): A powerful and intelligent god who comes and goes as hepleases. He comes like the wind, he walks all over the world. He is omnipotentand can take on any shape. On days of worship he can appear in human form.GUNAB (Hottentot): The enemy of Tsui-Goab, Gunab lived under a pile of stones.Gunab kept overpowering Tsui-Goab, but the god grew stronger after each battle.Because he killed so many, Gunab is sometimes identified with death. Creator ofthe rainbow.GUA (Ga tribe of West Africa): God of thunder, blacksmiths and farmers. Gua'stemples are often found at blacksmith's forges.KIBUKA(Baganda): Awar god, sent to save the Baganda people. The king of theBaganda asked heaven for assistance in war, and Kibuka was sent to aid them.Warned not to have anything to do with the enemy's women, Kibuka neverthelessmade love to a woman prisoner. Unwisely, Kibuka confided in her, and afterescaping she told the enemy how Kibuka could be killed, by firing arrows intothe cloud where he was hiding. Kibuka flew off to a tall tree to die, and atemple was built at the place where his body was found.LEZA (Central Africa): ‘The One Who Besets’, Leza is the Supreme God who rulesthe sky and sends wind and rain. Leza sits on the backs of all people, and noone can ever break free of him. Leza is said to be growing old and so does nothear prayers as well as he once did.MAWU-LISA (Ewe): The great god and goddess of the sun and moon. Lisa is the sunand Mawu is the moon.MODIMO (Lesotho): Creator god, supreme being, also called Ralapeba. Father ofall might and power, feared for his vengefulness and power of fire. He is one of12 gods with various functions and awesomeness. A comet called Modudusta ishonoured in the name of these gods.MUJAJI (Lovedu-South Africa): Rain goddess, queen of the Lovedu people. Fourrain goddesses have ruled over the Lovedu people, all descendants of theoriginal Mujaji. They are all related to the great and mighty Monomotapa of theKaranga empire in Zimbabwe, giving us a direct link to the mystery surroundingthe Zimbabwe ruins and the lands of Ophir filled with gold. Mujaji hasmysterious powers and is immortal. She has saved many people by bringing rain.MULUNGU (East Africa): God and the ‘Supreme Being’. The concept of a supremebeing and creator is nearly universal in Africa. Although there are few templesto this god, they must have been built sometime after 3,000 BC in the Mozambiqueand Zimbabwe areas. These temples resemble those of Canaanite origins in theNear East. Mulungu lived on Earth at first, but moved back to the sky becausemen were killing his children. He told man that they would come up to the skywhen they die. So it is believed that when humans die they go up to heaven to bethe slaves of god.NANAN-BOUCLOU (Ewe): The original god of the Ewe tribe, both male and female,Nanan-Bouclou is much too remote for worship. In Haiti, Nanan-Bouclou isremembered as the god of herbs and medicines.NGAI (Masai): Creator god. At birth, Ngai gives each man a guardian spirit toward off danger and carry him away at the moment of death. The evil are carriedoff to a desert, while the good go to a land of rich pastures and many cattle.NYAME (Ashanti): Supreme god of Heaven, both the sun god and the moon goddess.Nyame created the three realms: the sky, the Earth and the underworld. Beforebeing born, souls are taken to Nyame and washed in a golden bath. Nyame givesthe souls their destinies. The soul is then fit to be born.NYASAYE (Maragoli, Kenya): Chief god of the Maragoli. Spirits are said to aidMaragoli's work, and they are represented by round stones circling a pole whichrepresents the god.NZAME (Fan people, Congo): He is a vague and shadowy god whose likeness cannotbe captured in wood, stone or metal. Nzame lived on Earth with his three sons,Whiteman, Blackman and Gorilla. At some stage Blackman and Gorilla with alltheir kinfolk sinned against Nzame. As a result Nzame took all his wealth andwent to live with his other son Whiteman, in the west, while Gorilla and his kinwent to live in the jungle. Without the knowledge, wealth and power of Nzame,Blackman and his family live a hard life of poverty and ignorance, constantlyyearning for the land where Nzame lives with his favoured son, Whiteman.OBATALA (Nigeria): Was the creator of land. He was summoned by the supremebeing, to create land where there was only water. Then he made man out of clay.This is virtually identical to the activity of Enki upon arriving on Earth, asdescribed in Sumerian tablets.RUHANGA (Uganda): Creator of all things and living conditions on Earth. Heretired to the sky but could not prevent the rise of evil and death. Heestablished the unequal roles of society: the king, the herdsmen, the farmers.SAGBATA (Dahomey; the Yoruba, Shagpona): God of smallpox. Sagbata's shrines werepainted with a design of small spots. In Mayan culture such small spotsrepresented the decomposing bodies of those struck down by the god of death.Sagbata's priests fought small pox with both prayers and medical knowledge, andwielded great power over the people.TANO (Ashanti): The second oldest son of god, and god of the river, who had thesame name. The gods of the other rivers and families in the same region are allhis family. Long ago Tano lost a singing match with Death. Tano and Death sangdefiance to each other for over a month, but neither could win so they had tocompromise. When someone is injured or falls ill, whichever god arrives firstwill claim him. If Tano arrives first, the person will live, but if Deatharrives first the patient is lost.TSUI' GOAB (Hottentots): ‘Wounded Knee’and ‘Father of Our Fathers’. Arain godwho lives in the clouds who is a great chief and magician. Tsui' Goab made thefirst man and woman from rocks. Several times Tsui' Goab died and rose again, togreat joy and celebration. Men invoke Tsui' Goab with the first rays of dawn andrecite oaths in his name.UNKULUNKULU (Zulu): ‘Old, Old One’– Unkulunkulu was both the first man and thecreator, a god of the Earth who did not travel between Earth and the heavens.Unkulunkulu showed men how to live together and gave them knowledge of the worldin which they lived.WELE XAKABA(Luyia-Kenya): Supreme being who created the world and is the giverof all things. First created his own home in heaven, which was a place “everbright” supported with pillars. The first human couple lived in a place calledEmbayi, a house in the air supported by poles. Mainly because there weremonsters called Amanani on Earth. The first humans did not know how to haveintercourse and lived many years without children. Later Mwambu and Sela didhave intercourse and had a son called Lilambo, and so humans multiplied onEarth. This god was also known as the Sun god who takes an Earthling girl intoheaven and makes her his wife.YO (The creative spirit, Bambara/Mali): This creative spirit used three beingsto create all things. This included seven heavens corresponding to the sevenparts of the Earth. First they created men, and after some time the woman fromdust and saliva. Men are immortal, becoming 7-year old children each time theyreach the age of 59. They live unclothed, have no needs, they don't speak orwork.ZIMU (Ndebele, South Africa): Is the supreme being. He sent a chameleon with amessage to tell the people that they will “die and rise again”. But the lizardgot to the people first and told them that they would “die and not rise again”.By the time the chameleon delivered his message of hope the people did notbelieve him and chose to believe the lizard.African mythology is so rich and colourful that one could go on forever. Thelink that we have created in this book to our original ancestors in Africa,draws much support from these tales. As one reads them they seem to be morenaïve and more ancient than all the other civilisations. The relationshipbetween gods and humans was more simple, more defined and unquestionablyobedient. There was also mysteriously no real need for worship and hardly everany mention of sacrifices to the gods. These characteristics separate Africanmythology greatly from all the others, where sacrifice and temple worship form amajor part of the rituals. In prehistoric Africa, gods and men seem to havelived side by side with very little friction. There are many tales which includea supreme deity with two sons or a daughter, who go down to Earth to make ithabitable and to create man. They inevitably begin a feud which results in manyclashes between the gods, and divides their human followers. Controversial SouthAfrican mystic and Sangoma (medicine man), Credo Mutwa, talks about the Zululegends of the most ancient gold mines of Monomotapa in Zimbabwe. In his bookIndaba My Children, he points out the legends that speak about “artificiallyproduced flesh and blood slaves, created by the First People”. The legendsrecount how the slaves “went into battle with the Ape-Man” when “the great warstar appeared in the sky”. As we delve deeper into these stories it becomes veryclear that the continent of Africa was a hive of activity in the early days ofpre-history, long before the civilisations of the Near East and the Americasblossomed. Man was an infant finding his way in the world and the gods had theirhands full, trying to control these human slaves.Chinese mythological gods.Chinese history and religion are inextricably linked to their mythology.According to ancient tradition, the Chinese were savages until a sage came alongand taught them how to construct shelters. Some time later wise men taught theoriginal Chinese the use of fire, music and the cultivation of crops, insuccession. The last of these sages was the Yellow Emperor Huangdi, the fatherof Chinese civilisation. Where Huangdi suddenly appeared from is not known, buthe bestowed all knowledge on the Chinese people. Could he have been one of theAnunnaki gods on their expansion road to the East? If we accept that the gods ofSumer, or Anunnaki gods, were actually the progenitors of civilisation in otherparts of the world, then the same should apply in China. Huangdi carries all themystical attributes which place him squarely in the realm of Anunnaki gods. Thediscovery of Homo erectus fossils called ‘Peking Man’ in 1921 near Beijing ledto claims that the earliest humans evolved in China, and that the Chinese werethe earliest modern humans who evolved into a unique indigenous race. This hassubsequently been proven not to be true and the accepted place for the cradle ofHumankind has been established in southern Africa. The Chinese Human GenomeDiversity Project, a collaboration among 12 researchers from seven institutions,scrutinised DNAsamples from 28 of China's 56 ethnic groups and then compared thesamples with genetic material from other Asian and non-Asian groups. The outcomewas that, just like the rest of humanity, the Chinese evolved in Africa. Thismay have been the case, but the huge influence the Aryans had on the developmentof the entire Asian civilisation has somehow been overlooked. It is said thatthe early humans migrated eastward along the Indian Ocean and made their way toChina via Southeast Asia. The report linked to the Genome Project furthermentions “It is now safe to conclude that modern humans originating in Africaconstitute the majority of the current gene pool in Asian populations”. I findit interesting that the report says “majority” of the current gene pool. If allhumans originated in Africa, was there another genetic pool source? If so, wheredid this ‘other’ gene pool originate from? Did the elusive and influentialAryans who were responsible for populating Europe, and whose influence spreadacross Asia, have something to do with it? Or was the Yellow Emperor Huangdipossibly the other gene pool contributor? The gods whom the Chinese peopleworshipped at the dawn of their civilisation may have had different names, buttheir functions and their powers were identical to the deities from othercivilisations. Chinese religious practice calls on great and powerful divineancestors. Could those ancestors who are deified in Chinese mythology have beenthe early Aryans who had special powers and technology way beyond the primitivelocal earthlings of the time? Or were these ancestors even more powerful thanthe Aryans… could they have been the omnipresent Anunnaki gods who were takingcontrol of the rapidly expanding world towards the East? The Sumerian tabletscertainly seem to suggest such expansion by the Anunnaki gods, mainly driven byInanna. But her relatives and siblings were all in on the act, trying to snatcha piece of the world for themselves and establish their own group of loyal,obedient human slaves.Dragons play a central role in all of Eastern mythology, sometimes crossing overinto popular religion. Their origins and backgrounds are amazingly close tostories of biblical and Sumerian origins. There are a number of dragons thatdiffer slightly as you move further east. The one thing that strikes me, is thatthe image of the Chinese dragon is very close to the flying serpent of theMayas, and other cultures. In many depictions, the dragon is long and thin, moreclosely resembling a ‘serpent with wings’ rather than a flame-spitting monstrousdragon. Could this be another influence of Enki, the serpent of the Garden ofEden fame, and the ‘flying serpent’ of the Mayas? Because kings in China wereappointed by sanction of the supreme being, they also became deified and oftenworshipped. Is it possible that just like in Egypt, the Chinese emperors werealso half-god, half-man, and therefore often worshipped, becoming ‘gods’ untothe people like the Pharaohs? The subtle differences between the Chinese, Koreanand Japanese dragons raise a curious link to the possible expansion towards theEast, by the supporters of Enki and Inanna, and the lower ranks assigned to thelesser gods who were placed in charge of those new lands. Chinese dragons have 5toes, Korean have 4 toes and Japanese dragons have 3 toes. Could this representthe diminishing ranks of the Anunnaki gods far away from Sumer and theircommander Enlil? But the stories surrounding the origins of some of the dragonsare remarkably similar to many Sumerian and biblical tales.Kinabalu: The Eastern Dragon, lived at the top of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo andwas in possession of a splendid pearl which was desired by the Chinese emperor.Many men tried to capture the pearl from the dragon but they were all killed inthe process. Then the emperor sent out brothers Wee Ping and Wee San to get thepearl from the dragon. They waited until the dragon went to find food, then theyflew onto the mountaintop with a kite and replaced the pearl with a fake pearl.But the dragon was not fooled and gave chase to the thieves as they wereescaping in a ‘boat’. As the dragon approached, Wee San launched a cannon ballat him. The dragon thought the cannonball to be his pearl and swallowed it anddied. Wee Ping wanted to take the pearl and the glory and lied by saying he wasthe one who managed to steal it from the dragon. Wee San wanted no more troubleover the pearl and left China. He later became the happy leader of Brunei. WeePing on the other hand, was not so lucky, for his lying brought him nothing butsadness.The symbolism of this story is clearly linked to ‘pearls of wisdom’ tales. Onesuch story which carries many similarities, is the Sumerian tale of Inannastealing the tablets of wisdom or ME from her uncle Enki. She flew to hismountain retreat and seduced him. She also escaped in her boat, but this was a‘boat of heaven’ which could fly. Is it coincidence that Enki was the ‘flyingserpent’ of the Sumerian culture and probably other cultures too? So the ‘flyingserpent’ or dragon gave chase to retrieve his ME tablets of wisdom from Inanna,but was unable to do so. The similarities in the storyline are remarkable. Wemust remind ourselves that the Chinese stories were written many thousands ofyears later than the Sumerian tablets, but it is quite possible that they mayhave existed in oral form for millennia. The symbolisms surrounding the dragonsare very intriguing. Enki was the serpent who could fly and therefore could beseen as the ‘winged serpent’. His flying machines created a noise and so did thefire dragons while flying and spitting fire. Is it not possible that thedifferent eastern dragons were just representations of the different Anunnakigods in their flying machines during the early days when they were colonisingAsia and keeping their human ‘slaves’ obedient and fearful? There are severalstories about dragons, their sudden appearance and lessons they brought to thepeople, the fear they spread, and control they had over many aspects of Chineselife. Most, if not all of the stories, resemble Sumerian stories regarding theactivities of the Anunnaki gods, long before China became civilised.Another dragon story reminds me in its symbolism of the story around the birthof Christ, where a young virgin falls pregnant to a stranger, or angel, whodisappears. During the birth of Jesus the cave was filled with magnificentlight, brighter than the sun. The child grows up as an outcast, but heeventually becomes the ‘white prince of peace’ slaying evil everywhere,eventually rising into the ‘sky’. The young girl Mary, became revered bymillions and worshipped in prayer. Now see the remarkable resemblance:It is interesting that this particular dragon was called ‘The White Dragon’ orPai Lung. The legend of Pai Lung begins on a stormy night, when a young girlanswered the door to a stranger who came calling looking for shelter from thestorm. He was an elderly man, while she was a virgin. The next morning thestranger was gone, but the young girl was pregnant. Her parents were enraged bythis and threw her out of the house. When the child was born, it appeared to bea small white ball. They discarded the white ball into the ocean. To everyone'ssurprise, this ball grew into a magnificent white dragon. The young girl,terrified and shocked, fainted and never again woke. Another variation of thisstory says that she was killed in a great storm, after which the ‘white dragonrose into the sky’. She was revered for being the mother of this magnificentdragon, the only White Dragon King. She was buried at the foot of a hill, wherepeople ask for favours, pardons, and other blessings. A temple was erected onthe summit of this hill, and a tablet is there which records this legend. It isalso important to note that the White Dragon was a five-toed dragon; brilliantlywhite, the same way the appearance of ‘angels’ or the many ‘gods’ is describedin the Bible and Sumerian tablets. Could the 5 toes represent the highest orderof the divine Anunnaki hierarchy?The following story is basically a repeat of the Great Flood tale, which wasallowed to wipe out mankind, according to the Sumerian tablets. It was a planoriginally devised by Enlil, after he realised that Humankind had become a hugeburden on the Anunnaki and the flood would remove the problem very quickly andeffectively. The same story is told in virtually every civilisation of theworld.The Yellow Emperor was the supreme god of China, who looked down upon Earth andsaw that people were evil and filled with wickedness. So, the Yellow Emperorordered the ‘rain god’ to make endless rain. A great flood followed causingeverything to die. One of the gods named Kun, looked down and was saddened bythis devastation. Kun was the grandson of the Yellow Emperor who pleaded withhis grandfather to make the rains stop, but the Yellow Emperor did not stop theflood. An old tortoise told Kun that in order to stop the rain he needed magicmud. The tortoise also explained that the Yellow Emperor had a jar of this mudinside his treasury. Kun stole the jar of magic mud and went down to Earth.Wherever he sprinkled the mud, islands grew and the water was sucked up. Kuntravelled over the Earth spreading this magical mud and making new land as fastas he could. But the Yellow Emperor saw what Kun was doing and sent the ‘firegod’ down to kill him. Kun saw the fire god coming, so he transformed himselfinto a white horse and tried to hide. Still, the fire god send down lightning,which struck Kun and killed him on top of a mountain. Out of Kun's body grew asplendid son called Yu, who was a beautiful golden dragon. Yu flew up to theheavens to see his great grandfather, the Yellow Emperor, begging him to end theflood. The Yellow Emperor made Yu the ‘rain god’ with all the powers needed toperform his task, and allowed him all the amount of magic mud that could bepiled upon the old tortoise's back. Yu made the rains stop, but much of the landremained under the water. So, he and the old tortoise went down to Earth,sprinkling the magic mud as they went. Then, after this was done, Yu used histail to plough the mighty rivers of China. While carving the Yellow River, theycame upon an obstacle of rocky cliffs. As Yu carved a chasm into the cliffs, hedeclared it to be the Dragon's Gate, which would always be sacred to dragons. Yubecame a hero to the people, they begged him to be their emperor. So Yutransformed into a human and lived on Earth among the people as the ChineseEmperor.There are so many symbolic similarities to other ancient scriptures it trulyboggles the mind. But the one that really tickles me is the close link to theAnunnaki story of the Great Flood. Enlil was the supreme commander of Earth whodecided to allow the impending flood to wipe out humanity because of their “evilways”. People believed that it was Enlil who brought the rain and the flood. Buthis brother Enki, one of the ‘other gods’was saddened by the devastation andsaved Humankind from extinction. He was also known as being the god of water andmarshes, with the ability to reclaim land from water, which is what he did soonafter arriving on Earth. Enlil outranked Enki and in that way ‘killed’ hischallenge to save humans. And just like Kun's son Yu, became the god of theChinese people, Marduk, the son of Enki, became the ‘god above all’ who livedamong the people on Earth by marrying a mortal female and leading the semi-godmovement in many civilisations where kings were half-god, half-human. Here aresome more Chinese gods to digest:SHANG-TI (Yu):The highest deity and supreme ancestor of the Shang and Chou dynasty. The Shangworshipped ‘Shang Ti’, a supreme god who ruled over lesser gods, the sun, themoon, the wind, the rain, and other natural forces and places. Highly ritualisedancestor worship became a part of the Shang religion. Sacrifice to the gods andthe ancestors was also a major part of the Shang religion. When a king died,hundreds of slaves and prisoners were often sacrificed and buried with him.People were also sacrificed in smaller numbers during important events, such asthe founding of a palace or temple.CH'ENG-HUANG:God of walls and moats. Every village and town had its own version ofCh'eng-Huang. This was often a local dignitary or person of importance who haddied and been promoted to divine status or ‘godhood’. Such a divine status wasrevealed in dreams, but ultimately the gods made the final decision.Ch'eng-Huang not only protects the community from attack, but also sees to itthat the ‘King of the Dead’ does not take any soul from his jurisdiction withoutproper authority. Ch'eng-Huang exposes evil-doers in the community itself,usually through dreams. He has two assistants – Mr. Ba Lao-ye and Mr. HeiLao-ye, who are Mr. Daywatchman and Mr. Nightwatchman.CHU JUNG:God of fire. Chu Jung punishes those who break the laws of heaven.KUAN TI:God of war. The ‘Great Judge’ who protects the people from injustice and evilspirits. A red-faced god dressed always in green who is also an oracle. Kuan Tiwas an actual historical figure, a general of the Han dynasty renowned for hisskill as a warrior and his justness as a ruler. There were more than 1600temples dedicated to Kuan Ti.KWAN YIN:A popular goddess of mercy and compassion. A lady dressed in white, she isdepicted seated on a lotus, holding an infant. After being murdered by herfather, she recited the holy books when she arrived in Hell. The disgruntled godsent her back to the world of the living, where Kwan Yin attained greatspiritual insight and was rewarded with immortality by the Buddha. Her temple atthe Mount of the Wondrous Peak was always filled with lots of pilgrims shakingrattles and setting off firecrackers to get her attention.LEI KUNG:God of thunder. Lei Kung chases away evil spirits and punishes criminals whosecrimes have gone undetected. He has the head of a bird, wings, claws and blueskin, and his chariot is drawn by six boys. Lei Kung makes thunder with hishammer, and his wife makes lightning with her mirrors.PAHSIEN:These are the 'Eight Immortals' of the Taoist tradition. They were ordinarymortals, who were rewarded with immortality for their good works and good lives,by the Queen Mother Wang, by giving them the peaches of everlasting life to eat.They are:• LU TUNG-PIN – A hero of early Chinese literature. Renouncing riches and theworld, he punished the wicked and rewarded the good, and slew dragons with amagic sword. • TIEH-KUAI Li – He of the Iron Crutch, who was a healer. Li sitsas a beggar in the market place selling ‘wondrous’ drugs. Some of these canrevive the dead. • CHUNG-LI CH'UAN – A smiling old man always beaming with joy,who was rewarded with immortality for his ascetic life in the mountains. • TS'AOKUO-CHIU – Ts'ao Kuo-Chiu tried to reform his brother who was a corrupt emperor,by reminding him that the laws of heaven are inescapable. • LAN TS'AI-HO – Ayoung flute-player and wandering minstrel who carries a basket filled withfruit. His soul-searching songs caused a stork to snatch him away to theheavens. • CHANG-KUO LAO – An aged hermit with miraculous abilities. Chang owneda donkey that could travel at incredible speed. He was the personification ofthe primordial vapour that is the source of all life. • HAN HSIANG-TZU – Ascholar who chose to study magic rather than prepare for the civil service. Whenhis uncle reprimanded him for studying magic, Han Hsiang-Tzu materialized twoflowers with poems written on the leaves. • HO HSIEN-KU – Immortal Maiden, is aCantonese girl who dreamt that she could become immortal by eating a powder madeof ‘mother-of­-pearl’. She appears only to men of great virtue.P'AN-CHIN-LIEN:Goddess of prostitutes. As a mortal she was a widow who was much too liberal andcreative with her favours. Eventually her father-in-law killed her. She wasrevered in death by her professional associates who honoured her. She eventuallybecame the goddess of whores.SHI-TIEN YEN-WANG:Ten rulers of the underworld who were known as ‘The Lords of Death’. They dressalike in royal robes and only the wisest can tell them apart. Each rulerpresides over one court of law. In the first court a soul is judged according tohis sins in life and sentenced to one of the eight courts of punishment.Punishment is dispensed to fit the offence. Misers are made to drink molten goldand liars have their tongues cut out. In the second court are incompetentdoctors and dishonest agents; the third court has forgers, liars, gossips, andcorrupt government officials. In the fifth court there are murderers, sexoffenders and atheists; in the sixth, the sacrilegious and blasphemers; in theeighth, those guilty of filial disrespect; in the ninth, arsonists and accidentvictims. In the tenth court is the Wheel of Transmigration. This is where soulsare released to be reincarnated after their punishment has been completed.Before souls are released, they are given a brew of oblivion, which makes themforget their former lives.TI-TSANG WANG:God of mercy. Wandering in the caverns of Hell, a lost soul might encounter asmiling monk whose path is illuminated by a shining pearl and whose staff isdecorated with metal rings that chime like bells. This is Ti-Tsang Wang, whowill do all he can to help the soul escape hell and even put an end to hiseternal round of death and rebirth.Just like in the Sumerian, Greek, Egyptian, Mayan and African myths, there werea number of humans who were given immortality by the gods of China for variousreasons. We also see the importance of prostitution and sex, representedadequately by gods and goddesses in Eastern mythology. They support the Sumerianand biblical writing that the male gods had a ferocious sex-drive and lovedhuman females, which is evident in the many temples related to sexual acts andprostitution. While the same can be said about the goddesses, there is generallymore reference to the sexual needs of male gods which is supported by thetemples of virgins and prostitutes. It does not take a trained eye to see thesimilarities to Sumerian gods and an underlying common thread binding themythologies together.Greek gods.The Greek gods were probably the most anthropomorphic gods of any civilisation.This means that while they were gods, they possessed human attributes. They didhowever have some important differences to human beings. They were ageless andimmortal, unlimited by physical restrictions, could take any shape they pleased,could go anywhere quickly, without much effort and often doing so invisibly.They were allowed to also perform a host of immoral acts, which were reservedfor them only. Their sexual appetite was insatiable. Each god had his or her ownspecial function. Just like in Sumer, the gods formed a distinctly untouchableand divine society living around the supreme deity Zeus, on Mount Olympus.Theirs was the highest level of society, which was a reflection of theorganisation of societies in the ‘heroic’ age. Just like the Sumerians, theGreeks also had deities who lived on Earth or in the ‘Underworld’. Those werecalled ‘Chthonian’ or ‘gods on Earth’. The others were the ‘Olympians’ or ‘godsof heaven’. In 1 Corinthians 8:5 there is an intriguing reference to the ‘godsof heaven’ and the ‘gods on Earth’ once again showing that the people ofbiblical times were not hallucinating, and that there were other deities or godswhom we know nothing about today, mainly through the long and perpetualeradication process carried out by religious authorities.1 Corinthians 8:4-6“We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no Godbut one. For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on Earth (asindeed there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords’), yet for us there is but one God,the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live…”In a similar fashion to the Sumerian gods, the Greeks had two groups of gods.The Titans were the first to rule the world, they were the elder group, who wereoverthrown by the Olympians who were led by Zeus. Although Greek deities wereomnipresent and universal, their activities were attached to definite places.Temples in their honour were set within ‘temenos’, which were sacred precinctsset aside for gods and deities. They would contain a spring for purification anda grove of trees. There was always an altar, placed in front of the temple,which was the one indispensable item at a shrine, because it was necessary forsacrifice during the main act of worship. Greek temples would house the deity'simage and possessions and it was not a place of assembly for worshippers but itwas actually seen as the home of the deity. People went to the temple to makeofferings, rather than for private prayer. This indicates that the gods actuallyused to frequent these temples. They expected to be treated well, to be caredfor by their human slaves and be provided with all the luxuries they required.The Titans – First group of Greek gods.Gaea or Gaiais the Earth goddess. She mated with her son Uranus to produce theremaining Titans.Uranus is the sky god and first ruler. He is the son of Gaea, who created himwithout help. Together with Gaea they had many offspring, including the Titans.His rule ended when Cronus castrated him. It is not clear whether he died fromthe wound or withdrew from Earth. Uranus was jealous of the future power of hischildren and feared he would lose his rule to them. To prevent this he threw hischildren into the underworld. At the instigation of Gaea, her son Cronuscastrated his father and dethroned him. When Uranus' blood fell upon the Earth(Gaea), the Erinyes or ‘goddesses of vengeance’ and the Gigantes (giants) sprangforth, among many other divinities. You will find out more about Erinyes andtheir Roman counterparts, the Furies later.Cronus is the ruling Titan who came to power by castrating his father Uranus.His wife was Rhea and their offspring were the first of the Olympians. To insurehis safety Cronus ate each of their children as they were born. Rhea was unhappyat the loss of her children, and tricked Cronus into swallowing a rock, insteadof Zeus, who would revolt against Cronus and the other Titans, defeat them, andbanish them to Tartarus in the underworld. It is said that Cronus was killed bya ‘thunderbolt’ unleashed by Zeus. But other stories say that he escaped toItaly, where he ruled as Saturn. The period of Zeus' rule was said to be the‘golden age on Earth’, honoured by the Saturnalia feast.Rhea is the wife of Cronus who made it a practice to swallow their children.Rhea saved her son Zeus by tricking Cronus into swallowing a rock. Zeus grew upand deposed his father Cronus. Rhea is seen as the mother of the gods, daughterof Uranus and Gaea. She is also the mother of Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hestia,Poseidon and Zeus. Rhea is identified with mother goddess Cybele from Asia Minorand is also known as Rhea Cybele and Magna Mater or 'great mother'. She wasworshipped with orgiastic rites. Rhea is depicted between two lions or on achariot pulled by lions.Oceanus is the unending stream of water encircling the world. Together with hiswife Tethys, they produced the rivers and the 3,000 ocean nymphs. He is thepersonification of the vast ocean, especially the waters outside of the Pillarsof Heracles, or the Atlantic Ocean. He was the son of Uranus and Gaia and theeldest of the Titans. He was the father of all rivers by his sister Tethys. Thecouple also had the Oceanids which personified springs and smaller bodies ofwater, like lakes and ponds.Tethys is the wife of her brother Oceanus and the god-mother of Rhea, who wasraised during the war between the Titans and the Olympians. Tethys was thepersonification of the fertile ocean and with Oceanus had 3,000 children whichwere the springs, lakes and rivers of the world, also referred to as the “threethousand ocean nymphs”. Who were these Nymphs?In Greek mythology Nymphs were divine females associated with various naturalobjects. There is debate whether they were immortal or merely long-lived, inwhich case they would have been half-human, half-goddesses, akin to Sumerianmythology. There was an infinite variety of nymphs representing variouslocalities, rivers, lakes, mountains and more. Nymphs were depicted as young,beautiful, musical, amorous, and gentle, although some were associated with thewilder aspects of nature, while others were vengeful and capable of destruction.Whichever way one looks at it, the Nymph cult was huge in Greece and theypossessed all the characteristics displayed by lower ranked Anunnaki deities,who were in charge of the lesser fortified towns as part of the divine controlover Humankind.Hyperion is the Titan of light and an early sun god. He is the son of Gaea andUranus who married his sister Theia. His name means ‘he who goes before thesun’. Their children were Helius - the sun, Selene - the moon, and Eos - thedawn.Mnemosyne was the Titan of memory and the mother of the nine Muses by her nephewZeus.Themis was the Titan of justice and order, one of the daughters of Uranus andGaea. She is the personification of the ‘divine right order of things’ assanctioned by custom and law. She has oracular powers and it is said that shebuilt the oracle at Delphi. She is the mother of the Horae and the Moirae.Themis is depicted as a stern looking woman who is blindfolded and holding apair of scales and a cornucopia. The Romans called her Justitia because her namemeans law. Themis introduced the ordinances which concern the gods andinstructed men in the ways of obedience to laws and peace. Themis deliveredoracles at Delphi until Apollo, the lovely son of Leto, came to the city, killedthe serpent Python that guarded the oracle, and usurped power. Leto did not giveApollo her breast when he was born, but Themis, who was there, fed him withnectar and ambrosia. Themis told the Titan Prometheus not to join the Titans intheir war against the Olympians, because as she prophesied, in that war, theclever, not the brutal, would prevail. Themis was deemed guardian of men's oathsand for that reason also called the ‘goddess of oaths’. She lives on MountOlympus close to Zeus, who is described as the real all-seeing god as hewhispers words of wisdom to Themis.Iapetus was the father of Prometheus, Epimetheus, Menoetius, and Atlas, byClymene.Coeus is the Titan of Intelligence.Phoebe is the Titan of the Moon.Prometheus was the son of Iapetus and the wisest of all Titans. His name means‘forethought’ and he was able to foretell the future. When Zeus revolted againstCronus, Prometheus deserted the other Titans and fought on Zeus’ side. By someaccounts he and his brother Epimetheus were instructed by Zeus to create man. Inall accounts, Prometheus is known as the protector and benefactor of man. Hegave mankind a number of gifts including fire. He also tricked Zeus intoallowing man to keep the best part of the animals identified for sacrifice tothe gods while giving the gods the worst parts. Zeus punished Prometheus byhaving him chained to a rock with an eagle tearing at his liver. He was to beleft there for all eternity, or until he agreed to disclose to Zeus which ofZeus' children would try to replace him. He was rescued by Heracles without evergiving in to Zeus.Epimetheus was a stupid Titan, whose name means ‘afterthought’. He was the sonof Iapetus and brother of Prometheus. In some accounts he is delegated by Zeusto create mankind along with his brother. He also accepted the gift of Pandorafrom Zeus, which lead to the introduction of evil into the world.Atlas was also the son of Iapetus. But unlike his brothers Prometheus andEpimetheus, Atlas fought on the side of the Titans supporting Cronus againstZeus. Due to Cronus' advanced age, Atlas lead the Titan's in battle. And so hewas singled out by Zeus for special punishment and made to hold up the world onhis back.Phoebe is the goddess of the Moon and the daughter of Uranus and Gaia. Shemarried her brother Coeus and with him she became the mother of Leto andAsteria. It is said that she owned the oracle of Delphi before Apollo took itover.Metis was the goddess of the forth day and the planet Mercury. She presided overall wisdom and knowledge. She was seduced by Zeus and became pregnant withAthena. He killed or swallowed her in fear that his heir would be more powerfulthan him.Dione means ‘divine queen’. According to Homer in the Iliad, she is the motherof Aphrodite by Zeus.There were a host of other gods and semi-gods but for the purpose of keepingthis to the point, which is very difficult at this stage, let's jump to the nextgeneration of Greek gods who ruled the world.The Olympians – Second group of Greek gods.The Olympians are a pantheon of 12 gods who ruled the world after they defeatedthe Titans. All the Olympians are related in some way. They are named aftertheir dwelling place, Mount Olympus.Zeus is the supreme ruler of the gods who overthrew his Father Cronus. He had todraw lots with his brothers Poseidon and Hades to determine his leadership. Zeuswon the draw and hence became the supreme ruler. This story is identical to thatof Enlil and Enki of the Anunnaki gods, who also had to draw lots when they weredividing the Earth. Zeus is lord of the sky, and Earth. Just like Enlil, he hasfearsome weapons but his favourite weapon is the thunderbolt which he usesagainst those who displease him. He is married to Hera, but is famous for hismany affairs. He is also known to punish those who lie or break oaths.Poseidon is the brother of Zeus. After the overthrow of their father Cronus, hedrew lots with Zeus and Hades for a share of the world. He became lord of thesea and therefore he was widely worshipped by seamen. He married Amphitrite, agranddaughter of the Titan Oceanus, but he desired Demeter. She asked him tomake the most beautiful animal that the world had ever seen to distract him. Soto impress her Poseidon created the first horse. In some accounts his firstattempts were unsuccessful and he created a variety of other animals in theprocess. Very similar to the story of Enki and Ningishzidda in the Sumeriantales. By the time he created the horse, his passion for Demeter had waned. Hisweapon is the trident, which can shake the Earth and shatter any object. He wassecond in command to Zeus amongst the gods. He had a difficult, quarrelsomepersonality. He was greedy. He had a series of disputes with other gods when hetried to take over their cities. This is like a blend of Enki and Marduk ofSumerian and Babylonian stories.Hades is the other brother of Zeus who partook in the drawing of lots after theoverthrow of their father Cronus. He had the worst draw and was given theunderworld, to rule over the dead. He is a greedy god who is constantlyconcerned with increasing the subjects of his domain. He is also the god ofwealth, overseeing the precious metals mined from the Earth. He is exceedinglydisinclined to allow any of his subjects to leave. He has a helmet that makeshim invisible. He rarely leaves the underworld. He is unpitying and terrible,but not capricious. His wife is Persephone whom Hades abducted. He is the god ofthe dead but death itself is another god, Thanatos. The Erinyes are alwayswelcomed guests in the underworld.Erinyes – But who were the mysterious Erinyes? The one account says that theErinyes (Roman – Furies) were birthed out of anger from the blood of Cronus, asit landed on Earth. They were three sisters Tisiphone, Megaera and Alecto. Theywere the punishers of sinners, also called ‘those who walk in darkness’,persecutors of humans who broke natural laws. They would hiss like vipers andthey would descend like a storm, sometimes overcoming their victims with deadlysmoke. They were often depicted with dog-like faces and were fierce. When notstalking victims on Earth the Furies were thought to dwell in the Tartarusmountains where they applied their tortures to the damned souls. They were alsoreferred to as the Eumenides – the Kindly Ones, the Potniae – the Awful Ones,the Maniae – the Madnesses, and the Praxidikae – the Vengeful Ones. Theiractivities very closely resemble the ‘bloodless and lifeless’ robot-like clonescreated by Enki to avenge the death of his niece Inanna. “From clay of the Abzu,Enki two emissaries fashioned, being without blood by death rays unharmed.” Theywere created to track down and destroy the guilty ones. They were fierce,indestructible and relentless, closely resembling what we would call‘terminators’ today. Were these ‘Anunnaki emissaries’ the original Erinyes andFuries? “Not even the sun will transgress his orbit but the Erinyes, theministers of justice, overtake him.” Or were they biblical angels, interferingand vengeful, delivering god’s message and retribution?Hestia is Zeus' sister, the virgin goddess. She does not have a distinctpersonality and plays no part in myths. She is the ‘Goddess of the Hearth’, thesymbol of the house around which a new-born child is carried before it isreceived into the family. Each city had a public hearth dedicated and sacred toHestia, where the fire was never allowed to go out.Hera is Zeus' wife and sister. She was raised by the Titan gods Oceanus andTethys. She is the protector of marriage and married women. Hera's marriagebegan under difficult circumstances and continued in strife with Zeus. At firstZeus made advances towards her unsuccessfully. To trick her, he changed himselfinto a dishevelled cuckoo. Hera felt sorry for the bird and held it to herbreast to warm it. Zeus resumed his normal form and took advantage of her andraped her. The young Hera married him to cover her shame. At one point when hewas overbearing to the other gods, Hera convinced them to stage a revolt. Heradrugged him while the gods bound the sleeping Zeus to a couch with many knots.This done, they began to quarrel over the next step. Briareus slipped in and wasable to quickly untie the many knots. Zeus sprang from the couch and grabbed histhunderbolt and hung Hera from the sky with gold chains. She wept in pain allnight but no one dared to interfere. Her weeping kept Zeus up, so the nextmorning he agreed to release her if she swore never to rebel again. While shenever again rebelled, she often questioned Zeus' plans and she was often able tooutwit him. Most stories concerning Hera have to do with her jealous revenge forZeus' infidelities. Her sacred animals are the cow and the peacock.Ares is the god of war and son of Zeus and Hera. He was disliked by bothparents. While he was considered murderous and bloodthirsty, he was also acoward. Although he was immortal, he was very sensitive to pain and went runningto his father Zeus, whenever he got wounded. He is identified with Mars in Romanmythology. When Halirrhotius raped Alcippe, Ares' daughter by Aglaulus, Aresmurdered him, for which he was tried in a court. Some say that this was thefirst murder trial in history, but he was acquitted. His companions included hissister Eris, as well as his sons Phobos and Deimos, and Enyo. Otus and Ephialteswere two giants who put Ares in an urn. To rescue Ares, Hermes changed himselfinto a deer and caused the giants to throw their spears at each other.One night, while seducing Aphrodite, Ares put a youth named Alectryon by hisdoor to guard them. The youth fell asleep and Helios the sun, walked in on thecouple. Ares turned Alectryon into a rooster, a bird that never forgets toannounce the arrival of the sun in the morning. During the Trojan War, Ares wasseen fighting on the Trojans' side. Hera, Ares' mother, asked Zeus forpermission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes toattack Ares, after which he threw his spear at the god. But it was Athena whodrove the spear into Ares' body. He bellowed in pain and fled to Mt. Olympus,forcing the Trojans to fall back. Ares was only rarely the recipient of cultworship. He was venerated most often in conjunction with other gods. Forexample, he shared a temple with Aphrodite at Thebes.Athena is the daughter of Zeus. She came forth from his forehead, full-grown anddressed in armour. And so she has no mother. She is a virgin goddess, but she isfierce and brave in battle. She only fights to protect the state and home fromoutside enemies. Athena is the goddess of the city, handicrafts and agriculture.She invented the bridle, which permitted man to tame horses; the trumpet, theflute; the pot; the rake; the plough; the yoke; the ship; and even the chariot.She is the embodiment of wisdom, reason, and purity. She was Zeus' favouritechild and was allowed to use his fearsome weapons including his thunderbolt.Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto and a twin brother to his sister Artemis. Heis the god of music, often depicted playing a golden lyre. He is also thearcher, shooting far with a silver bow; the god of healing who taught manmedicine; the god of light, and even the god of truth, who can speak no lie. Oneof Apollo's more important daily tasks is to harness his chariot with fourhorses and drive the Sun across the sky. He is famous for his oracle at Delphi.People travelled to it from all over the Greek world to consult the oracle ontheir future.Aphrodite is the goddess of love, desire and beauty, the wife of Hephaestus. Inaddition to her natural gifts she has a magical girdle that compels anyone shewishes to desire her. In truth, she is a seductress. There are two accounts ofher birth. One says she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. The other story isderived from when Cronus castrated Uranus and tossed his severed genitals intothe sea, Aphrodite arose from the sea foam on a giant scallop and walked toshore in Cyprus.Hermes is the son of Zeus and Maia, and the messenger of the gods. He is thefastest of the gods and known to wear winged sandals, a winged hat, and hecarries a magic wand. He is the god of thieves and god of commerce, and also theguide for the dead who journey to the underworld. He invented the lyre, thepipes, the musical scale, astronomy, weights and measures, boxing, gymnastics,and even how to care for olive trees.Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of her botherApollo. She is a virgin goddess, and the goddess of chastity. And yet she is thelady of the wild things and the ‘huntsman’ of the gods. She is the protector ofthe young and just like Apollo she hunts with silver arrows. She becameassociated with the moon and also presides over childbirth, which may seem oddfor a virgin. It is said that it was she who caused Leto to have no pain at herown birth. All wild animals are sacred to her, especially the deer.Hephaestus is the son of Zeus and Hera. It is also said that Hera alone producedhim and that he has no father. He is the only god to be physically ugly and alsolame. The stories of how he became lame vary. Some say that Hera, upset byhaving an ugly child, flung him from Mount Olympus into the sea, breaking hislegs. Others say that he took Hera's side in an argument with Zeus and Zeusflung him off Mount Olympus. He is the patron god of both smiths and weavers. Heis kind and peace-loving and yet Hephaestus is the god of fire and the forge,using a volcano as his forge. He is the smith and armourer of the gods. His wifeis Aphrodite but sometimes his wife is identified as Aglaia.Roman gods.The Roman gods are as popular today as they were 2,000 years ago. Their nameshave been used in countless movies, fictional stories, science fiction tales,and a multitude of global brands have borrowed their names from Roman gods. Butbecause they were mostly derivatives of the earlier Greek gods, we willintroduce them briefly, to show their obvious Greek heritage. There were manydozens of gods worshipped by the Romans, but they specifically honoured apantheon of 12 gods called Dii Consentes. They were Iuppiter, Iuno, Minerva,Vesta, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius, Neptunus, Volcanus, and Apollo.These are the gods listed by the Poet Ennius around the 3rd Century BC. Thesesix male and six female gods were probably worshipped at the Lectisternium of217 BC. This was a banquet of the gods, where the statues of the gods wereraised on cushions and offered meals. This is a clear hangover from the ancientGreek and even the earlier Sumerian tradition. Exceptthe food offered to theancient Sumerian and possibly Greek gods was done in the gods' own temples witha very strict set of rules. Those old temples were actually the resting placesof the Anunnaki gods, while travelling from place to place. The number 12clearly runs throughout all these ancient mythologies, with only a few culturesthat may differ from that – like the African mythologies. But we have alreadyestablished that the African myths are much older in their style and approach,pointing to a very early relationship between the gods and Humankind. Atimebefore worshipping was enforced on the human slaves, even long before the GreatFlood. What is also evident is that the Roman gods arose from a void with nomythological tradition associated with them. It is as if the Romans simplyinherited the Greek pantheon of 12 Olympians and changed their names. It is saidthat Julius Caesar had the ‘Alexander’ disease, trying everything in his powerto match the conqueror’s accomplishments. It is clear that the gods infected therest of the Romans with their own brand of mania. But the pantheon wasintroduced in stages to the Romans. They were led by the first three, whichformed the Capitoline Triad. These became the three cornerstones of Romanreligion, whose rites were conducted in the Capitoleum Vetus on the CapitolineHill. This tradition was probably the driving force behind the introduction ofthe ‘Holy Trinity’, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, which was introduced intothe Roman Catholic faith by the first ever ‘global’ council of Church leaders,during the ‘Council of Nicaea’ in 325 AD. A wonderful example of how even in theCatholic faith, the line between history and myth is extremely fragile. It isevident that Roman mythology greatly influenced the thinking of the leaders ofthe early Catholic Church. But there were many other gods who played a majorrole in Roman culture and tradition. Just like they did in all the earliercivilisations. It was not only the gods, but the cults that surrounded them,that best characterise the origin of the Roman Religion. The family cult of theDii Familiaris!We find the following gods, spirits and deities in this cult:The Lar Familiaris – the guardian spirit or Genius of the family;The Lares Loci – the guardian spirits of the place where the house is built andthe Genius of the paterfamilias or House-Father;The Dii Penates – patron gods of the storeroom;The Dii Manes – the spirits of the deceased.There was a multitude of other domestic deities who were worshipped daily by themembers of the family. The household cult was so important that it even servedas the model for several practices of the state cult. Not surprising, since wehave learnt from the Sumerians how the lesser gods looked after the smallertowns and villages in the outlying areas, while the more senior gods would havethe privilege of looting the more attractive spoils of the larger, wealthiercities. So the well-entrenched customs of the smaller towns became attractive tothe gods of the larger cities, where their control over the humans may notalways have been as smooth as expected. This resulted in the state cult usingthe models of the peasant family cults as an example for expansion. For example,even during the Empire, the Imperial cult came to be based on the householdcult, which was then interpreted as the cult of the ‘Genius of the Emperor’ orthe ‘paterfamilias’– ‘House-Father’ of the family of all the Romans.Other important Roman gods were Ianus, Saturnus, Quirinus, Volturnus, Pales,Furrina, Flora, Carmenta, Pomona, Portunus, Fontanus. But there was also a groupof mysterious deities consisting of native guardian deities; river gods ordeified heroes from the Latium region, which are collectively called DiiIndigites. A multitude of other deities were also traditionally worshipped,which included other guardian deities of native Latin origin, like Roma,Tiberinus, Bellus, Bellona, Liber, Libera, abstract deities such as Fortuna(Fate), Concordia (Concord), Pax (Peace), Iustitia (Justice), and more. It mustalso be added that the very mysterious group of people called the Sabines, wholived north east of Rome, played a major part in the development of Romanculture. Contributing many gods, like Pluto, to the heavenly family, theyinfluenced Roman mythology and religious practice in many ways. They seem toresemble the mysterious Igigi, as mentioned in Sumerian tablets, who also livedin isolated communities, yet contributed greatly to the Sumerian culture, mainlyby marrying mortal women, creating a whole new breed of semi-gods. Like theIgigi, and their descendants the Aryans, these gods from the Sabines symbolisedthe innovative and creative power on Earth, which provided humans withtechnology and the means for subsistence.Romans were always willing to pay homage and sacrifice to foreign deities,especially when travelling in their land. They would go as far as making greatersacrifices to the gods of their enemies, than what was offered by their ownpeople, before going to war, in order to win favour from the enemy’s gods tosecure victory. And so the foreign gods infiltrated Rome, resulting in thebuilding of temples and shrines to the new gods called Dii Novensiles. Amongthose were Apollo, Ceres, Bacchus, Isis and more. This all goes to show that theRomans were innocent bystanders during a ‘changing of the guard’ by the gods asa new wave of Anunnaki gods infiltrated Rome and its culture, bringing a wholenew order to the newly established global power, which was operational only bythe grace of the gods who allowed this new global power to triumph over theirenemies. Here is a list comparing Roman and Greek gods:Roman - Greek Roman - Greek Apollo - Apollo Mars - Ares Bacchus - DionysusMercury - Hermes Ceres - Demeter Minerva - Athena Coelus - Uranus Neptune -Poseidon Cupid - Eros Pluto - Hades Cybele - Rhea Proserpina - Persephone Diana- Artemis Saturn - Cronus Hercules - Heracles Ulysses - Odysseus Juno - HeraVenus - Aphrodite Jupiter - Zeus Vesta - Hestia Latona - Leto Vulcan -HephaestusLet us now move further east, to demonstrate how incredibly well thesefairytales of the gods travelled around the world in antiquity, when humanscould hardly travel to the next city.Japanese gods.Japan presents us with a similar melting pot of religious traditions to those inChina, but the blend is somewhat different and quite unique. What is mostfascinating, is the smooth crossover from myth to history. All the ancientJapanese writings seem to have no visible borders between what is today acceptedas myth and what is actual history. This is truly remarkable, since many Westernhistorians are very happy to make those distinctions for them. We know that theislands which are today known as Japan were only created some 13,000 years ago,coinciding with the great flood. Before that, the Japanese Islands wereconnected to the Asian continent by land. This was during the Ice Age and humansfrom the Eurasian continent were migrating east. The reasons for the migrationmay have been to follow the food supply by following animal herds, or it couldsimply have been to get away from the vengeful gods of the lands in which theylived. Remember that the people left behind on Earth during the flood, believedthat the gods had deserted them and tried to destroy them all. When theysurvived the flood, god came down from the heavens, and his instructions were to“be fruitful and multiply”. The subtext to this instruction was actually to‘disperse across the world and do not attempt to challenge the gods’… ‘or youwill be punished again’. This was some time before the Anunnaki gods bestowedagriculture on humanity, while man was still hunting animals and gathering food.The ancient Ainu (i´nj) people of Japan are a real mystery to anthropologists.Some say that these hairy and heavily bearded people who lived in the northernpart of Japan, had been in those parts ten thousand years ago, while othersestimate that the Ainu first inhabited parts of Japan around 3,000 to 4,000years ago, during the last half of the Jomon period. This would fall perfectlyinto our time-frame as the Aryans moved east colonising new territories andenforcing not only their influence but spreading some of their gene pool aswell. This eastward expansion was either followed or preceded by the Anunnakigods who were granted the domains of the East by Enlil, to rule and develop. Soevery part of the world would have had a different group of gods, each withtheir own unique way of handling the human situation. Ainu means ‘human’. Theybelieved that nature gods, house gods, mountain gods, lake gods, all existedtogether in symbiotic relationships which included man. There is nothing new inthat line of thinking since we know from the Sumerians and the Greeks that theyalso had different gods looking after different villages and aspects of theirlives. The Ainu believed that the gods helped Humankind and must be appreciatedby them. The Ainu’s daily life was a continuous ritual to the gods and theirmutual assistance to man, which tells us that this was before the gods decidedto impose the concept of sacrifice and worship on humans, during the time of theAnunnaki expansion shortly after the flood. All the reports available make itpretty clear that the Ainu did not have it very easy. Unless they had a realinteraction with the gods, and unless they were directly engaged in some kind ofrelationship with the deities of their lands, why would they waste their time onissues which did not contribute towards their survival and wellbeing? The godsor deities who resided in the lands of the Ainu must have been very real and asdemanding as the other gods of the later humans. The Ainu's mixture of Europeanand Asian physical traits contrast so sharply from other indigenous peoples ofAsia, that no one is really sure of their origin. Some theories hold they are ofCaucasian descent, others say that their distinct features are a result ofisolation that allowed them to remain racially unchanged as the rest of themongoloid races mixed and evolved through a series of migrations. Could they beanother link to the influence of the Aryans as they explored the East and leftbehind their mark on human population everywhere?The literature of Shinto or ‘Way of the Gods’ employs much of the Japanesemythology to describe the supposed historical origins of Japan. We can seeclearly that religion and mythology are in fact inseparable. The earliestJapanese records we possess are the Kojiki – Record of Ancient Things andNihongi – Japanese Chronicles written in 712 AD and 720 AD respectively. In theKojiki Part 1, we are introduced to the Japanese divine ‘trilogy’ which wasalive and well even in Japan, while creating Heaven and Earth. The influence ofthe gods of Rome seems to have spread much further than just the RomanCatholics. In the Kojiki, as translated by B.H. Chamberlain in 1882, we are toldabout this Japanese trilogy of supreme deities.PART I:The Birth Of The Deities & The Beginning Of Heaven And Earth.“The names of the deities that were born in the Plain of High Heaven when theHeaven and Earth began were the deity Master-of-the-August-Centre-of-Heaven;next, the High-August-Producing-Wondrous deity; next, theDivine­Producing-Wondrous deity. These three deities were all deities bornalone, and hid their persons. The names of the deities that were born next froma thing that sprouted up like unto a reed-shoot when the Earth, young and likeunto floating oil, drifted about medusa-like…”According to the creation story found in the Kojiki, the Japanese islands werecreated by the gods, two of whom descended from heaven to carry out the task.These gods; male god Izanagi and the female goddess Izanami, also brought intobeing other kami (deities or supernatural forces), such as those influencing thesea, rivers, wind, woods, and mountains. Two of these deities, the Sun Goddess,Amaterasu Omikami, and her brother, the Storm God, Susanowo, warred against eachother, with Amaterasu emerging victorious. This again, is identical to theSumerian and Greek myths where heavenly siblings fight each other.IZANAGI and IZANAMI:The creator god and goddess sent down from heaven to buildthe Earth. The other gods and goddesses followed them and were theirdescendants. Descending to the underworld, Izanami became old and ugly. Izanagifollowed her to bring her back, but she forbade him to look at her. When Izanagilooked at her, she tried to imprison him in the underworld. Pursued by Izanami'sfuries, (see Roman Furies) Izanagi escaped and sealed up the entrance to theunderworld with a boulder. It is fascinating to see that the Greeks had Erinyes,the Romans had Furies, and that the Japanese also had Furies, to do the dirtywork. Izanami was enraged and vowed to kill a thousand of Izanagi's subjects aday, while Izanagi vowed to create fifteen hundred a day. So it was that Izanamibecame the goddess of death and Izanagi became the lord of life.While the above is a mythical story, the pages of the Kojiki tell us theso-called historical tale of how Izanagi ventured into the lands of theunderworld in search of his beloved Izanami. Once again our mythologies gettangled up as we meet the Greek god Hades, god of the underworld, brother ofZeus, who had imposed his influence on Izanami. Suddenly the Japanese mythologyblends with Greek mythology, using a Greek god's name as if it was quiteacceptable to do so some 6,000 miles away, sometime between 13,000 and 4000years ago. Where did Hades make his name first then? Greece or Japan?The story is told very beautifully in the Kojiki. Unable any longer to bear hisgrief, Izanagi resolved to go down to the Nether Regions in search of hisbeloved Izanami and bring her back at all costs, to the world. There werecountless dangers to negotiate on his way, but Izanagi's determination conqueredthem all. He finally reached a large castle which must have been where she wasbeing kept. But the gate was guarded by a number of gigantic demons, some red,some black, guarding the gates with watchful eyes. He went around the back andto his surprise, the rear gate was left unguarded. He cautiously crept throughthe gate and after some searching and calling he found his beloved wife:“My darling, I have come to take thee back to the world. Come back, I pray thee,and let us complete our work of creation in accordance with the will of theHeavenly Gods, our work which was left only half accomplished by thy departure.How can I do this work without thee? Thy loss means to me the loss of all.”Imagine his surprise when she responded with the following:“ Alas! Thou hast come too late. I have already eaten of the furnace of Hades.Having once eaten the things of this land, it is impossible for me to come backto the world… I wish, with all my heart, to go back with thee, but before I cando so, I must first obtain the permission of the deities of Hades.”Just as the Sumerian gods divided the lands and appointed different gods to rulethem, the Japanese gods did the same. In this excerpt from the Yengishiki orShinto Rituals, we get a glimpse of such an event.“I declare with the great ritual, the Heavenly ritual, which was bestowed on himat the time when, by the Word of the Sovereign's dear progenitor andprogenitrix, who divinely remain in the plain of high Heaven, they bestowed onhim the region under Heaven, saying - Let the Sovereign Grandchild's augustnesstranquilly rule over the country of fresh spikes which flourishes in the midstof the reed-moor, as a peaceful region.”Battle of the Japanese gods.In the chapter of ‘The Door of the Heavenly Rock-Dwelling’ of the Kojiki, weread of a peculiar set of events which may have many different interpretationsby historians. But if you remove the emotion, it sounds pretty close to some ofthe descriptions in Sumerian tablets of when conflict erupted among the Anunnakigods. Even the Japanese gods were emulating their Sumerian ancestors as theyclashed and fought each other from time to time in their quest for supremacy.And as in any conflict situation, there were usually victors and those who werebanished. Any kind of violent eruptions among the gods would have lookedmiraculous to the early humans. The following texts seem to be very poeticdescriptions of the prelude to conflict, and the resulting outburst which causedone of the rebellious deities to be expelled from the “heavenly abode”. Thiskind of thing had been happening on Earth for several hundred thousand yearsamong the Anunnaki as they grew in numbers and their desires for earthly thingsincreased.“So thereupon the Heaven-Shining-Great-August deity, terrified at the sight,closed behind her the door of the Heavenly Rock-Dwelling, made it fast andretired. Then the whole Plain of High Heaven was obscured and all the CentralLand of Reed-Plains darkened. Owing to this, eternal night prevailed. Hereuponthe voices of the myriad deities were like unto the flies in the fifth moon asthey swarmed, and a myriad portents of woe all arose. Therefore did the eighthundred myriad deities assemble in a divine assembly in the bed of the TranquilRiver of Heaven, and bid the deity Thought-Includer, child of theHigh-August-Producing-Wondrous deity, think of a plan, assembling thelong-singing birds of eternal night and making them sing, taking the hard rocksof Heaven from the river-bed of the Tranquil River of Heaven, and taking theiron from the Heavenly Metal-Mountains… His AugustnessHeavenly-Beckoning-Ancestor-Lord prayerfully reciting grand liturgies, and theHeavenly Hand-Strength-Male deity standing hidden beside the door, and HerAugustness Heavenly-Alarming-Female banging round her the heavenly clubmoss theHeavenly-Mount Kagu… laying a sounding-board before the door of the HeavenlyRock-Dwelling and stamping, till she made it resound and doing as if possessedby a deity, and pulling out the nipples of her breasts, pushing down herskirt-string ‘usque ad privates partes’. Then the Plain of High Heaven shook,and the eight hundred myriad deities laughed together…. Thereupon the eighthundred myriad deities took counsel together, and imposed onHigh-Swift-Impetuous-Male-Augustness a fine of a thousand tables, and likewisecut his beard, and even caused the nails of his fingers and toes to be pulledout, and expelled him with a divine expulsion.”AJI-SUKI-TAKA-HI-KONE: One of several thunder gods. Born noisy, he grew up evennoisier, and so they carry him up and down a ladder to quieten him. That is whyyou can hear him receding and approaching. The ‘ladder to the sky’ is animportant bit of imagery in this myth. Why would all the myths always refer togods going up into the sky and reappearing from there every so often?AMA-NO-UZUME: The Fertility goddess. A companion of Ninigi, she performed abawdy dance hoping to entice the sun out of hiding. This dance symbolises theplanting of seed which waits for the sun to come after winter. Is there apossible link here to the Igigi, who were the possible progenitors of theAryans, also teaching them about agriculture and technology?AMATERASU: The Sun goddess, ruler of the heavens. When her great enemy, thestorm god Susa-No-Wo, destroyed her palace, Amaterasu went to hide in a cave.The other gods used all their magical tricks to get her to come out, but to noavail. In her absence, darkness and demons ruled the Earth until Ama-No-Usumelured Amaterasu out of the cave with a trick. With a comical and obscene dance,he made the gods who were gathered at the mouth of the cave laugh. WhenAmaterasu asked what was going on, Ama-No-Uzume replied that they had foundanother and better sun goddess. Amaterasu peeped out of her cave and saw her ownreflection in a mirror which Ama-No-Uzume had hung on a nearby tree. Fascinated,Ameratasu drew a little closer for a better look, and the gods grabbed her andhauled her out.BENZAITEN: Goddess of love, one of the gods of happiness. Benzaiten rides adragon while playing a stringed instrument. There is very little differencebetween her and Venus, and Inanna and Ishtar and other love goddesses. They allseem to be attracted to music, dance and culture.BISHAMON: God of happiness and war, which is a rather strange combination.Bishamon protects men from disease and demons. Bishamon was often portrayedwearing a wheel of fire like a halo, which some see as the 'Wheel of Fate'.AMATSU MIKABOSHI : “August Star of Heaven”. God of evil.CHIMATA-NO-KAMI: God of crossroads, highways and footpaths. Originally a phallicgod, his phallic symbol was placed at crossroads.HO-MASUBI: The Fire god. His birth killed the creator goddess Izanami, and hisfather, the creator god Izanagi, was so enraged with grief that he killed thebaby. From his blood came eight gods, and from the body came eight mountaingods. Compare this to the Greek story of Cronus and Zeus and the other gods whowere created from spilt blood.KAWA-NO-KAMI: The god of rivers. While larger rivers have their own gods, allwaterways are under Kawa-No-Kami's authority. When rivers flooded the gods weresometimes appeased with human sacrifices.NAI-NO-KAMI: God of Earthquakes, was a late addition to the Japanese pantheon.Nai-No-Kami was inducted in the seventh century AD. This supports the storiesabout the so-called ‘angels’.NINIGI :Grandson of Amaterasu, the ‘divine grandchild’ sent to rule theEarth.The ancestor of all the Japanese emperors. The name and description ofthis god is reminiscent of the Sumerian Igigi who were the supporters of Marduk,who was also a divine grandchild. He married earthling females and contributedto the creation of the white Aryan tribe. But the interesting thing is thattheir semi-divine descendants were the kings of Egypt, according to Sumeriantablets, as Ninigi was to the Japanese emperors.O-KUNI-NUSHI: God of sorcery and medicine. He was originally the ruler of theprovince of Izumo, but he was replaced by Ninigi. In compensation he was maderuler of the unseen world of spirits and magic. Once again the Ninigi connectionis fascinating, since the Igigi were the advanced proto-Aryans with knowledge ofmedicine and technology.SENGEN-SAMA: Goddess of the sacred mountain of Fujiyama. Worshippers greet therising sun at her shrine on top of the mountain. The Sumerian goddess Ninhursagalso known as Ninmah, ‘Exalted Lady’ – had her own mountain retreat. She wasreally the ‘mother goddess’ of humanity and one of the original creators of‘Adamu’. Could it be seen that in the east she was worshipped as such,represented by the rising sun over Humankind?SHINE-TSU-HIKO: God of the wind. Shine-Tsu-Hiko fills up the empty space betweenEarth and heaven, and together with his wife Shina-To-Be, they hold up theEarth. Greeks and Romans have identical gods performing these tasks.SUSA-NO-WO: God of storms, snakes and farming. He was Amaterasu's brother andgreatest enemy. From the moment he was born, he was a troublemaker. AfterAmaterasu was finally taken out of her cave, Susa-No-Wo was punished. The othergods shaved his beard and moustache, pulled out his fingernails, and banishedhim to live as a mortal on the Earth.The above extracts represent only a few of the gods of ancient worlds. Thecultures and civilisations run into thousands of pages, for which I suggest youturn to specialised literature, which will certainly keep you gasping withamazement. Once you begin to identify the similarities and relationships betweenthe gods, the entire mythology subject takes on a whole new perspective. Theincredible wealth in diversity of all these ancient gods, and the interactionbetween gods and humans is almost impossible to imagine in today's society. Thatkind of ongoing activity, which at times turned into mayhem, could only havebeen possible if it was enforced on humans. I cannot imagine that the closesimilarities in all of these cultures are mere coincidences. The basicstorylines of the gods of Sumer are echoed throughout all of the world'smythologies. There is a constant presence of higher gods and lesser gods;benevolent gods and violent gods; supreme gods and sons of gods; houses of thegods and their sexual playgrounds. Goddesses and their offspring, outlining thegenealogy of the gods which points to the same hierarchical structure of anextended family of gods around the world. Closely related but highly divided intheir hunger for control. The genetic makeup behind this kind of behaviourpoints directly to our own programmed DNA passed down from the gods. In the lastchapter we will explore the great epic of humanity from birth until today,outlining the moment when man was created and inherited this highly disturbinggenetic feature from his makers, the “gods of Heaven and Earth” as outlined inthe Sumerian scripts.In The Lost Book of Enki, Zecharia Sitchin tells the chilling tale of Lord Enki,the master-mind behind the creation of humans. A story of humanity from thebeginning to the tragic events surrounding Sodom and Gomorrah which according toEnki was preventable and unnecessary. Enki was Anu's first son, one of the threesupreme leaders on Earth after their arrival some 445,000 years ago. He was thetrue humanitarian among the Nefilim gods “those who to Earth from heaven came”which eventually led him to dictate these pages to his scribe Endubsar, whostates: “These were the words of the lord Enki. Written from the mouth of thegreat lord Enki, not one word missed, not one word added by the master scribeEndubsar, a man of Eridu, son of Udbar.” Although these tablets were referred toin other finds, it took a determined effort to uncover them in the ruins ofmuseums and archaeological sites. These ancient events which were captured bySumerian scribes have now been translated and presented to humanity in the year2002 AD by Zecharia Sitchin. Mr. Sitchin has dated the events at Sodom to 2024BC. It therefore stands to reason that these tablets, as dictated by Enki, musthave been written shortly after those events, after 2024 BC. Sitchin is thelargest private owner of Sumerian tablets in the world, which allowed him topresent these translations to an unaware civilisation in 2005 AD. This body ofwork which comprises 308 written pages, is now the most complete source ofinformation about the obscure events in our past. It shines a spotlight on theconcept of mythology and the popular modern explanations of these myths. Itmakes it painfully clear that there were things going on in the biblical pastthat have been purposefully concealed from humanity. It also raises very seriousquestions about utterances in the Bible and their credibility, when compared tothe older Sumerian scriptures. These translations remove much doubt about theexistence of the “gods of Heaven and Earth” who controlled the world with aniron fist. It proves our genetic ancestry belongs both on Earth and in deepspace, on a planet called Nibiru. It explains the previous speculation of who weare and where we come from, with all the necessary supporting evidence thathumans have been searching for. The most disturbing facts that emerge from thisfind, are that there must have been an extremely sinister but well-executed plotof manipulation against humanity, by Enki's brother Enlil. This supremecommander on Earth was never in favour of the creation of humans and certainlydid not want to go out of his way to ensure the survival of humans on Earth. Itis turning out to be a distinct possibility that the entire Bible was amasterstroke of pandemic proportion. A continued and carefully controlled sagaof propaganda and indoctrination of humanity by Enlil himself. This control musthave started after the flood, when Enlil realised that humans had been savedagainst his wishes, he also realised that the only way he would be able tocontrol humanity was with absolute power, control and fear, using strong-handed,dictatorial tactics. From that moment on, Enlil would be their god, ruling themthrough intimidation, fear, bloodthirsty violence; but he also rewarded them forloyalty and obedience for complying with his commands. But his nephew Mardukwanted to seize the power on Earth, which was promised to him by his fatherEnki, right at the beginning, shortly after they arrived on Earth. He wouldchoose his favourite people and help them above others, using them for hisdevious plans. From about 3200 BC at the rise of the Egyptian empire, Marduk andEnlil became engaged in a long struggle for control of Earth. While Enlilenforced clear principles of ‘divide and conquer’ among humans, Marduk becamethe ‘god above all’ taking control of Egypt, promising his kings eternal life inthe world beyond, if they followed him. Slowly but surely Marduk also absorbedand enforced the principles of ‘divide and conquer’ as he took control of theplanet. As fate would have it, the slave species became not only the accidentalvictims in the ‘war of the gods’, jostling for control of the planet, but thehumans became the ignorant ‘foot soldiers’ of the Anunnaki in their struggle forpower. These were the early biblical days, which are well corroborated in bothHebrew and Sumerian scriptures. Gods chosen people conquering the others.Throughout human history, Enlil did everything in his power to suppress humanevolution and emancipation. He did this constantly and relentlessly as we haveclearly shown, fearing that humans would grow wiser and stronger if theyevolved, which would pose a great threat to his global empire. It is not clearif it was Enlil or Marduk, but their ultimate masterstroke was that they had allthese ancient events written and captured by men, loyal and fearful of the great‘god of vengeance’. These written works were treated as holy by man, and overthe years they were compiled into a collection of books which today is calledthe Bible, besides other holy scriptures. Ask any war or propaganda strategisttoday and they will tell you one thing. If you repeat a lie enough times, itwill become the truth. Especially if you enforce it with the threat of violence.Stalin was a master of propaganda and indoctrination. So much so that even afterthe fall of the Soviet Union and the exposure of the Kremlin vaults, there aremillions of supporters who remain loyal to Stalin, refusing to believe that anyof those horror stories about him are true. The people who have been reading andmisinterpreting the Bible, constantly ascribing some inexplicable tales tosituations that make absolutely no sense, have fallen victim to such tactics.They are so filled with fear that it consumes their minds, rendering themincapable of clear independent thought. Saying that “it is the way of the lord,and god planned it, because he did not want us to know everything”. Well, theyare correct. The gods did not want us to know the terrible truth behind themanipulation of humanity, and how we were controlled with fear, violence,retribution and reward. This is the story of the entire Old Testament.Now that we are confident of our place at the pinnacle of human evolution andknowledge, comes the time when we have to ask ourselves the life-alteringquestion. Do we believe that the ancient clay tablets are a message from ourconcerned ancestors, or do we discard it as insignificant mumbo-jumbo written bysome wild mad-man to confuse us? The decision is yours to make. I trust that youwill weigh up the evidence and realise that the universal community of beings isa distant cry from the barbaric acts of bloodthirsty settlers on Earth. Theso-called god with a small ‘g’ never to be confused with God with a big ‘G’.Many people will feel greatly disturbed by this information and will fear ‘god'svengeance against their evil thoughts’. Stop the fear, see the light of the realGod, the God of love, the God of mercy, the Prince of Peace. Not a gluttonousdeity who wants gold and goats and people offered to him as a gesture ofloyalty. While this knowledge may be too horrific to contemplate, I see it asthe most liberating experience, which has exposed the real God to me, answeringmany of the questions that have haunted humanity. Knowledge is power and thisknowledge will help me to understand whose name I call when I say my prayers.The God of the universe, the universal spirit, the Supreme Being. Armed withthis knowledge, I can look forward to the continued journey of humanity as weevolve towards a complete genome which will open the portals of our mind andallow us to rejoin the universal community of beings."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15 [../Text/toc.html#chapter15]THE MYSTERY OF JESUS AND OTHER PROPHETS [../Text/toc.html#chapter15a]No matter how you look at the figure of Jesus Christ, whether he was the son ofGod or just an inspired prophet who took the troubles of the world upon hisshoulders, he left behind a legacy that has inspired billions of people. Thedebate about the 'prince of peace' is almost always filled with deep emotion,which more often than not leads to heated exchange by people who speak of him asif they knew him personally. They make bold statements about what Jesus wouldhave done, how he would have reacted and what he would have said, if he was inpresent company. And since the writings of alternative historians, which tell usdifferent stories about ‘Jesus the Man’, are mostly treated with suspicion, themost that religious scholars could possibly tell us about the man, is what theyhave read in the New Testament. I must hasten to add that much of what waswritten in the New Testament is probably quite different from his originalteachings. If we take into account all the new evidence presented in this andother books about our ancestry; and although reluctantly we accept that we arethe descendants of a more advanced race who created us as a slave species, onequestion remains to be answered: Who was Jesus Christ?After doing an extensive search on a Bible website consisting of a multitude ofdifferent Bible versions, I got a very surprising result. The very first timethat the words ‘Jesus’; ‘Christ’; ‘messiah’ and ‘son of God’ appear in theBible, is in the book of Matthew. And if my maths serves me right, that is the40th book of the Bible, which also happens to be the first book of the NewTestament. Is it not a little odd that there is no reference by name to the‘messiah’ who is supposedly the main attraction in the Bible? If Jesus was themain actor; the prophesied saviour; and the ultimate reason for the wholecollection of books in the Bible, is it not strange that we only come across hisname at such a late stage?Most of my life I have held a maverick admiration for Jesus Christ, inspired bythe message, but confused by its origins. I must admit that my naïve admirationwas repeatedly derailed by preachers of different shades of grey. My personalbelief is that popular religion has taken a very simplistic message of love andgoodwill among humanity, and hijacked it for their own devious abuse. And as Idug deeper, I unearthed information which forced me to rethink my naïve outlookon the whole debate around Jesus. One by one my suspicions were confirmed, thatthere must have been an ageless devious plot behind the carefully craftedministry of Christ. Just like Abraham, Jesus became an unwitting ‘mouthpiece’for his bloodthirsty Nefilim god, preparing the ground for the continuedenslavement of humanity. Doing great deeds among men, rounding up the flock forsalvation, showing them the way to reach the gates of god, unconsciously weavingthe propaganda of a power-hungry Anunnaki god. The fact that Jesus was a man, wecannot deny. The fact that he lived and travelled preaching his gospel is anhistoric fact. But who his real parents were, what his bloodline was, whoorchestrated his appearance on Earth and who actually plotted all the propheciesabout Jesus for thousands of years, have taken on a whole new slant. There isemerging evidence that the prophesied appearance of Christ is much more sinisterthan we could ever have imagined. The uncanny parallels between the murkyorigins of humanity, compared to the origins of Christ, point to the realpossibility that whoever crafted humanity, followed it up with a second wave ofpremeditated, calculated propaganda and ultimate control. A control mechanismthat was planned and executed with pinpoint precision like a military manoeuvre.As I pointed out, the one truly puzzling feature is the lack of reference to themessiah in the Old Testament. The word ‘messiah’ first appears in John 1:41; and‘Saviour’ first appears in Deuteronomy 32:15. It leads me to believe that theidea of sending a ‘saviour’ to Earth as ‘the son of god’ was an idea that wasonly devised much later, towards the end of the Old Testament, by Enlil orMarduk and their ‘angels’, when they realised that the violent, oppressiveapproach towards humans needed a facelift. They became aware that afterthousands of years of evolution, humans had evolved substantially and had grownwiser, not always prepared to submit to the brutality of their Anunnaki gods. Itmeant that the gods needed to revise their plan and devise a new twist. And sothey did. It was crafted like a movie script, and a very good one I may add. Sogood in fact, that after 2,000 years, billions of loyal faithfuls are stillreading the script with absolute devotion, ready to strike down anyone who daresattack their holy dinosaur. We must examine some of the strange behaviour andrelationships between Jesus and his god, to highlight these peculiar underlyingsigns of tension between the two entities. We mentioned earlier that historybooks are written by the victors, and in the struggle between Enlil, Enki andMarduk, it was also the case. Unfortunately for humanity, the struggle betweenthe sibling Nefilim gods was won by the nasty one, Enlil. The one who did notlike humanity. Did he masterfully craft his dominion as ‘god’ of humanity? Thevictorious Enlil took control of such matters as recording human activities andcontrolling man's destiny in writing. His mission was simple. Keep humanityuneducated, ignorant and stupid. Take control of their fears, keep them loyaland obedient. Demonstrate your power and superiority over them every so often,to keep them fearful. The vengeful yet loving god, who will reward those whoobey quietly and don't ask too many questions. In the early days of the Bible,when Abraham was weaned by Enlil to be his favourite among the leaders, Mardukwas given the land of Egypt to control. Marduk was know as Ra, Re and Amun amongthe Egyptians. To create a large following of his own, Enlil ‘chose’ theIsraelites as his “chosen” people and rescued them from slavery, under Marduk'scontrol. This was a huge victory for Enlil with which he earned eternal loyaltyamong the Hebrews and established himself as the god of Israel. Enlil promisedhis followers the “land of milk and honey”, but in the process they would haveto vanquish a number of other peoples, who undoubtedly were supporters ofMarduk, and were not among god's favourites.Enlil also held rank over Enki, which meant he could basically do what he wantedwith Enki's human creation. The disagreement between Enki and Enlil, which hadstarted way back in the Garden of Eden, played a cardinal part in all of thescriptures of the Bible, including the prophesies which were made. We explorethis in greater detail in other chapters, exposing how Enki was labelled the‘serpent and devil’ and man was forbidden to consort with him. The plan was sosuperbly imposed on humanity, that it will forever hold the top spot in theannals of human manipulation and propaganda. It may take centuries more ofreligious bloodshed for humans to come to terms with reality. Enki was the ‘goodguy’. But history is written by the victors and the real story was masterfullycovered up by history books of which the Bible is the main culprit, because itwas controlled by the victorious Enlil, who proclaimed himself god. But as timemarches on and we discover new truths about our ancient prehistory and ourpossible origins, we learn that Enki was the architect of Adam and he loved hiscreation. He tried on many occasions to elevate humanity, to teach them, toinform them, but Enlil would not allow the slave species to become a threat tohim and their settlement here on Earth. This is the strong underlying messageseeping out between the pages of the Bible today. After the longest period ofhuman enslavement, the real truth is starting to shine through. The incrediblerevelations in the recently released Lost Book of Enki by Zecharia Sitchinprovide us with much supportive evidence for the everlasting plot, and itpresents some answers to the chasms in our very one-sided history books.When I first started to read this incredible book, I felt as if I had stumbledupon the holy grail itself. Words cannot describe the feelings of conflictplaying with your mind when you start to absorb the content of those ancientclay tablets and compare them to what we have been told for so many years. Theinspiring thing is that the tablets that have been unearthed, translated andwhich you can now read, are the result of decades of work by people like Sitchinand many others. It is truly a surreal experience to read 4,000 and5,000-year-old scriptures in clay. The beauty about these is that you cannoterase words with whitener; you cannot go back and change the odd word; it's veryhard to fake it. These tablets reveal things about our human origins and supportall the theories that I have postulated in this book about our human ancestry.By bringing these facts to life in an uncomplicated fashion, it also supportsthe horrible theory that we have been manipulated into submission from the veryfirst day of our existence. Ask yourself this question. How many people whostudy and preach the Bible have ever seen the original biblical documents, asthey were written in ancient times? The percentage will be minuscule. Here wehave a discovery from the days of Abraham, perfectly preserved in clay,delivering a serious message to humanity, while turning on its head everythingwe have ever been taught. Suddenly the ‘lord’ is the devil, and the devil is ourmaker. Are we going to believe it… Or discard it? Since we have dealt with muchof the finger-wagging of the Old Testament, let us look at a few very importanttechnicalities surrounding the scriptures of the New Testament.The recorded events surrounding the birth of Jesus are highly suspicious. Theextremely questionable historic entries have never been able to concur on thetime, place and town in which Jesus was born. Even the date of his birth differsfrom publication to publication. It has been penned from 1BC to 7BC and thepresentations by historians and theologians seem to constantly clash. Thefascinating thing about this subject is that when you speak about Jesus, son ofJoseph and Mary, you deal in historic realms, which have a host of vigilantcustodians. But the moment you say ‘Jesus the Son of God’ you enter the world ofreligious dogma, which has a host of rather militant custodians of its own. Butit seems that Jesus was not the only victim in this covert human mismanagement.Equally convincing evidence shows that the Prophet Muhammad and even the Buddhawere also misused by the devious Enlil to enslave humanity through religiousfear. I kid you not. This is too much to handle for the strongest of character,so I suggest you put aside every ounce of everything you ever believed in, andprepare to digest some liberating facts.Many people have this image of Jesus, strolling around the countryside,preaching to people, moving happy-go-luckily from town to town, being welcomedby happy smiling people cheering him on, all wanting to hear the amazing storieshe has been telling all over the place. Well, that was not the case. Jesus wasnot really well liked in his time. It took a lot of effort to get people to riskall kinds of possible danger to come and listen to his preaching. Strangelyenough, there is very little evidence that anything he said and did, wasactually ever captured during his short three-year span as a prophet. With thepossible exception of the ‘Sermon on the Mount’, it seems that most of thematerial written about Jesus was done so only after his death by his disciples,apostles and some other interesting characters. These were collected into a bodyof literary work known as the New Testament over a period of about 300 years.The 'editing' of the New Testament only began in the year 325 AD, whichconsisted of deletions and changes which were made and approved by specialchurch councils. This highly secretive manipulation continued until the 12thcentury. I find this a little suspicious, don't you? What could have taken themso long to edit and change if this was all the ‘Word of God’? Clearly they haddifferent ideas and they disagreed with much of what was written, those churchcouncils. Either they had their own ideas of what the New Testament shouldcontain or they were directed by someone! Surely there must have been somemastermind behind this whole process? It could not possibly have continued for800 odd years without an ever-present controlling force. And yes, you can saythat ‘it was the power of god’ because it seems that it was indeed the case.However, it was ‘god’ with a small ‘g’ not ‘God’ with a big ‘G’who directed theediting process, and therein lies the rub. The priests and high priests amonghumans were instated by the Anunnaki-Nefilim as far as 5000 years before Christand the fear of ‘god-Enlil’ was dispersed among humanity mainly by them. By the12th century AD they were so well established as the voice of the Nefilim, thevoice of Enlil, the voice of god, that nobody could out manoeuvre them. In oneapparent sitting of the Second Synod of Constantinople in 553 AD, the churcheditors deleted all of Jesus' references to ‘reincarnation’ from the Bible. Thiswas an important part of Jesus' ministry and adhered to by his early followers.It also points clearly to his youthful influences while growing up in the East,absorbing the many different cultures of the Hindus and Buddhists. What's more,in the 12th century, the Lateran Council added the concept of the ‘holy trinity’into the Bible, an idea which was apparently never promoted by Jesus. This ‘holytrinity’ idea was doing the rounds since the first Council of Nicaea in 325 AD,when the trouble with Aryans caused much heated argument about the validity ofChrist. Early in the 4th century, a dispute erupted among the Christian leadersregarding the exact relationship of the ‘Son to the Father’. A priest by thename of Arius of Alexandria, taught that there was a time when Christ did notexist because he was not co-eternal with the Father. He further said that theFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were three separate and distinct entitiesand that the ‘Son’ who was subordinate to the ‘Father’, was in fact a‘creature’. These teachings were condemned and Arius was excommunicated in 318AD.As early as the 2nd century, Irenaeus of Lyons described the Holy Spirit andJesus as “the two hands of God”. Irenaeus gave us a hint of what could be thefunctions of the other ‘parts of God’, when he intimated that “through the HolySpirit, God worked creation and through Jesus, He worked redemption”. The word‘Trinity’or Trinitas was most likely coined by Tertullian in the 3rd century, inhis extensive writing on the issue. Another Christian father called Origen,carried the doctrine further but neither assigned full consubstantiality of theHoly Spirit with God. At the gathering in Nicaea, the council formulated a creedwhich, although it was revised at the Council of Constantinople in 381-82 AD,has become known as the Nicene Creed. It affirmed the doctrineof‘consubstantiality’ of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.In his book On the Trinity St. Augustine concluded that the Holy Spirit is themutual love of the ‘Father for the Son’ and of the ‘Son for the Father’, whilethe Holy Spirit is derived from both the Father and the Son. He also wrote thatthe Holy Spirit is a gift to humanity from the Father and the Son. Thisexplanation still did not clarify the function of the Holy Spirit and how itcame about and its role remained a mystery.The other problem that remained was how to explain the nature of Jesus. Everyoneaccepted that Jesus was human, so how could he also be ‘God’? With hereticalviews spreading and the Aryans promoting a different doctrine, something had tobe done. This was one of the main reasons why the councils of Nicaea andConstantinople were set up. To stop the impending and massive division in theChurch and to ostracise perceived heresy. It was not surprising that themajority of the Bishops rallied behind Bishop Athanasius in affirming that Jesuswas consubstantial with the Father in contrast to the views of Arius and hisfollowers who maintained that Jesus could not be ‘one with God’and that he was a‘creature’. And so, Emperor Constantine put his foot down, Arius and hissupporters were expelled, and the Nicene Creed was passed which affirmed theconsubstantiality of Jesus with God. In 451 AD at the council of Chalcedon, PopeLeo I proposed a solution to the riddle of God and Jesus. He declared that theywere “one person in two natures”. As far as the fathers were concerned, hismiracles, his conduct and his words were evidence that he was Divine. This‘formula’was a great relief to the new young religion, and the bishops could goto their parishes, satisfied that they had solved a problem that had plaguedtheology for decades.What this all really means, is that the Christian Church had complete freedom tohack the original writings to pieces, formulating the New Testament as theyliked, adding whatever they believed to be necessary for human spiritualconsumption and deleting entire books which did not meet their image of theBible. Fortunately, many of the deleted books were saved and compiled into acollection of writings called The Apocrypha. In essence, those books which weredeemed to be of dubious content by the church. Once again this points to grossmanipulation by a higher authority with more sinister plans. According to theWikipedia, the definition of Apocrypha is something like this. “The wordapocrypha, from the Greek word meaning ‘hidden’, refers in general to religiousworks that are not considered canonical, or part of officially acceptedscripture, but are of very roughly similar style and age as the acceptedscriptures. Such works are often believed not to have been “inspired” or to bein some way “less inspired” by divine processes or entities, such as Holy Wisdomor the Holy Spirit. Most works that are considered apocryphal in the HebrewBible were written in languages other than Hebrew, such as Greek or Aramaic, orat least survive only as translations into non-Hebrew languages.”You must keep in mind that Jesus never wrote any of the books in the Bible. Theywere all written about him by various characters mostly after his death. Ihighly recommend you look into the Apocrypha on the internet; there are so manyfascinating pieces to read, it will make your mind boggle. One of the booksomitted from the Bible was the story of Jesus' birth and childhood years, up tothe point when he returned to his land of birth to start his ministry. Thisdiscarded book did not agree with the official version which the church wantedto present to the world. Once you read the ‘hidden’ story, the evidence of humanmanipulation by a higher power is difficult to refute. There are fascinatingbooks like Mary, Infancy and Protovangelion just to name a few.According to the Apocrypha, the birth of Christ goes something like this. Hisgrandfather Joachim was a priest in the Hebrew temple, who was highlyembarrassed because he and his wife Anna, could not produce any children. A manin his position was expected to have an heir, which left the couple slightlyembarrassed. While standing in the field one day an ‘angel’ appeared to him,glowing with bright white light. After calming the frightened Joachim, he saidthat his wife would bear a child aided by an ‘angel’. But they would have tosurrender the child to be raised by priests and ‘angels’ at a certain temple inJerusalem. Lo and behold, Anna gave birth to a daughter called Mary, who at theage of three was taken to the temple and left there. Mary was an exemplarychild, devoted to both priests and ‘angels’. By the age of around 14, the timecame for her to go back into the world and get married. She was not allowed tochoose a man, her mentors handpicked a much older man called Joseph to be herhusband. But Joseph was not as willing as the ‘angels’ would have had it and ittook some convincing to do it. After finally agreeing to the marriage, he wentback to his home in Bethlehem to prepare his home for his new wife, while Marywent to her parents in Galilee to get ready for her new life. One day an ‘angel’called Gabriel appeared to Mary and told her that she would give birth to thenew messiah. Mary was confused as she had never had a sexual experience before.There are many theories and explanations regarding the virgin birth. Regardlessof what your personal beliefs are, it was supposed to be the ‘Holy Ghost’ who‘came upon her’ therefore making the child holy, because the child was notconceived in lust. Whatever happened to Mary will forever remain a mystery, butthere were a lot of ‘angels’ milling around during those times and we have asneaky suspicion who those angels were; Enlil and his henchmen. If Enlil wasdelivering the final stroke to his masterful control over humanity, he wouldhave wanted to ensure some form of genetic supremacy for his fabricated messiah.This would have included artificial insemination of the young virgin, for thepurpose of giving young Jesus a distinct genetic advantage. Such a simpleprocedure would have undoubtedly given Jesus abilities which other humans didnot possess. His life of miracles and healing attests to that. We must also keepin mind that the whole idea of sex, whether for fun or for procreation, waspronounced to be a sinful act. That is why all humans are said to be born insin. This was another very good example of how ‘god’ wanted to control theprocreation of the slave species. Barbara Thiering writes extensively about thehabits of the Essenes and their rituals in the stronghold of Qumran. In her bookJesus The Man, she presents a slightly different explanation for the virginbirth, which revolves around culture and custom.According to Thiering, when Joseph returned from Bethlehem to collect his youngwife Mary, he found her pregnant. He was obviously confused and somewhatalarmed, believing that Mary had become a whore. Before he could desert her, anangel appeared to him explaining that Mary was still a virgin. It must have beena very convincing angel, because Joseph stayed with Mary in Galilee until her9th month of pregnancy, at which point they departed for Joseph's home inBethlehem, where Mary would have the child. But the couple did not make it allthe way home because Mary went into labour on the outskirts of the town. Theonly shelter they could find was a cave, in which Jesus was born. The Apocryphabook of Infancy describes it as such:Infancy 1:6-11“And when they came to the cave Mary confessed to Joseph that her time of givingbirth had come, and she could not go on to the city, and said, let us go intothe cave. At that time the sun was nearly down. But Joseph hurried away so thathe might fetch her a midwife; and when he saw an old Hebrew woman who was fromJerusalem, he said to her, please come here, good woman, and go into that cave,and you will see a woman just ready to give birth. It was after sunset when theold woman and Joseph reached the cave, and they both went into it. And look, itwas all filled with lights, greater than the light of lamps and candle, andgreater of than the light of the sun itself. The infant was then wrapped inswaddling clothes, and sucking on the breast of his mother, St. Mary.”The bright light in the cave suggests some sort of more advanced technology,which cannot be explained. It goes hand in hand with other advanced phenomenasurrounding the birth of Christ, like the star of Bethlehem. Over the yearsvarious explanations for the bright star have been proposed, which include theconvergence of a number of stars and planets at that time. There is no doubtthat such conjunctions did occur in the years of Christ's birth, but it ishighly unlikely that it was a mere conjunction which would have caused theeffect as described in the book of Protovangelion 15 : 7.“We saw an extraordinarily large star shining among the stars of heaven, and sooutshined all the other stars, that they became not visible…”There is no planet or star or comet or conjunction of the above, which couldpossibly be so bright. The star of Bethlehem was described in much greatersplendour. It not only shone so incredibly brightly that it made all the otherstars invisible, but it actually guided the Three Wise Men (Magi) for a long waytowards the infant, hovering some distance ahead of them. The story in theapocrypha continues as such.“So the wise men began their travel, and look, the star which they saw in theeast went before them, until it came and stood over the cave, where the youngchild was with Mary his mother.” (Protovangelion 15:9)But this uncanny story does not end here. After their exchange with Mary and theinfant Jesus, the star then guided the wise men all the way home, back to theEast. “… the light of which they followed until they returned in to their owncountry.” (Infancy 3:3)The Bible version is quite similar in this instance, but it does differ on thevenue. It clearly states that Jesus was born in a house. Is this evidence of theso-called editing which the various church councils conducted? They obviouslyfelt that a cave was no place for the future messiah to be born.Matthew 2:9-13“After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they hadseen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where thechild was. When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On coming to the house,they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him.Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and ofincense and of myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod,they returned to their country by another route.”The Escape to Egypt“When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. ‘Getup,’ he said, ‘take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay thereuntil I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.’”This is really fascinating stuff in light of our theory that Enlil and hiscronies were planning and manipulating all these events. Once again, when thereare eminent signs of trouble, we have the presence of angels – this time in adream warning both the wise men and Joseph. These subtle but important eventsshow how incredibly well-thought-out this manipulative propaganda was. How doyou create a hero very quickly even today? You stage an assassination attempt onhis life, but against all odds, he escapes to tell the tale. This time it wasthe Three Wise Men who were brought a long way to help spread the news acrossthe then ‘civilised’ world about the ‘true’ messiah who was born and whose lifewas already under threat by the nervous authorities. We should not be surprisedat the brilliant strategy behind all this. The CIA and other secretivegovernment departments are constantly engaged in similar manipulative actsinvolving their citizens. This just goes to show how much of that Nefilim DNA weinherited. And so, the word went out in an instant that the ‘messiah’ was born.After all, they had all the substantiation. The king had heard of him and wantedhim dead. So it had to be the messiah! The coincidence that the wise men werefrom the East and the fact that Jesus spent most of his life after birth in theEast learning the cultures and enlightenment is fascinating. The fact that Jesuswas of the Essene Hebrew clan, became clear after the discovery of the Dead SeaScrolls in a cave in 1947, by a young Bedouin tribesman. Joseph and Jesus wereboth Essenes, which was a unique Hebrew religious sect, with very differenttraditions. They also had very strong links to the Aryans of Persia, and that iswhy The Three Wise Men or Magi, came to see the newborn child from such a longdistance away. It appears that the Essenes had all the trimmings of a secretsociety. It took several years of initiation before one was admitted; as part ofthe official initiation you had to swear to protect all the secret teachings ofthe Essene Order; and most intriguingly you had to keep secretive the names of‘angels’ living among them and their communities.Barbara Thiering's version of the virgin birth of Jesus is a little different.From her extensive study of the ‘Scrolls’ she explains that Joseph, as anEssene, was practising his religious principles of celibacy in a templestronghold called Qumran. Celibacy was very important to the Essenes, it wasregarded as the holiest way of life. They saw marriage and sex as unholy and themore celibate you were the closer to god you got. The ‘highest’ order of Essenesmen lived in Qumran behind thick walls completely out of touch with the world.They shared everything and owned nothing while dedicating their lives to god.When they needed to procreate to keep the bloodline alive, they would ventureout for specific periods to find an appropriate female. The courting orbetrothal period could last as long as three years after which they would have afirst marriage. This was the period during which the woman would fall pregnant.After waiting for three months during which a miscarriage is more likely tohappen, there would be a 2nd wedding. But our Mary fell pregnant with the ‘holyghost’ which according to the tradition meant that she was effectively still a‘virgin’ because when she had the child she had not had both the weddings. Atfirst Joseph did not want to have anything to do with the child, but an ‘angel’advised him to go ahead with the wedding as if it was the second.The Essenes believed that priests and Levites were incarnations of heavenlybeings or ‘gods’ and ‘angels’. The fact that Joseph did not have sex with Maryafter their first wedding and yet she fell pregnant, made her a virgin. Josephfell into a lower rank of priests and kings which made him a ‘spirit’. And sothe mystery of the baby being conceived by the ‘holy spirit’ is answered byJoseph's lower rank. Although the latter version is interesting, I find italmost too complicated, while the story of the Apocrypha has simplicity in itsfavour. William Bramley exposes much evidence which outlines Jesus' Essenelineage while also linking it to the secret societies like the Brotherhood andFreemasons who also happen to use a symbolic ‘apron’.The lack of information about the young Jesus' life is disturbing. Shouldn't themessiah have been the idol of humanity as he was growing up, spreading truth andwisdom even at a young age? Surely, that would have been the obvious thing todo, if you really wanted to impress people everywhere? But that was not thecase. Instead, Jesus was whisked off to a faraway land, where he was preparedand most likely indoctrinated for the big role in the great human deception. Hebriefly appeared at the age of 12 before a group of Hebrew scholars but then hedisappeared for another 18 years. The Anunnaki gods were too well known aroundthe Near East, Israel and Egypt. Enlil had to find a more discrete location forthe grooming of his protégé. By the age of around 30, Jesus reappeared out ofthe blue to start his short life of ministry, lasting only an incredible threeyears before his crucifixion. Just think about this practically. In today'sworld of extreme wealth and mass media, it would be very difficult to create aglobal brand within three years. And yet, in only three short years 2,000 yearsago, one man became a global phenomenon? The PR around his activities and theway in which his awareness spread, lead me to believe that there were verypowerful forces like the Anunnaki gods behind such a masterstroke. But Jesus wasnot such a big hit in his time as we are led to believe. It actually took 2,000years to make Jesus the phenomenon he is today, because at the time of his lifehe had a small following and caused much upheaval with his preaching. If it wasnot for Emperor Constantine some 300 years after Christ's death, Christianitywould most likely have remained a small cultish religion.A substantial number of historians have unravelled a fascinating history of theyoung Jesus in Persia and Asia which is too detailed to be a fabrication orcoincidence. They are not like the predictable stories which state that heworked with his father in the carpentry workshop. If that was the case, who wasresponsible for his spiritual and philosophical education, and why did we nothear about him at all during those years? It is highly unlikely that he wouldhave gone unnoticed if he was around the Nazareth area all his life. The localcustom dictated that Essene boys entered a monastery at about the age of fivewhere they received the appropriate education. Some historians claim that thiswas exactly what happened to young Jesus, at a monastery on the Mediterraneansea near Haifa. The reason why Jesus seemed to have made a short appearance inthe New Testament at the age of 12, was for his bar mitzvah preparation, afterwhich he mysteriously vanished for another 18 years. Historians and documentarymakers have done extensive work on the hidden life of the young Christ. Many ofthem agree that Jesus spent the time travelling through Asia absorbing thereligious principles of their spiritual leaders. Those travels by Christ wereprobably sponsored by the Essenes as their religious culture was deeply rootedin the Aryan and Zoroaster religions which originated from the East. AncientBuddhist scrolls reveal that Jesus spent seventeen years in India and Tibet fromthe age of thirteen to age twenty nine. He was both a student and teacher ofBuddhist and Hindu holy men. The story of his journey from Jerusalem to Benareswas recorded by Brahman historians, who until today still know him and love himas St. Issa, their ‘Buddha’. This was revealed in 1894 when a Russian doctor andexplorer by the name of Nicolas Notovitch published a book called The UnknownLife of Christ. Notovitch journeyed extensively throughout Afghanistan, India,and further through the spectacular passes of Bolan, over the Punjab, down intothe arid rocky land of Ladakh, and into the majestic Vale of Kashmir of theHimalayas. During one of his journeys in 1890 he was visiting Leh, the capitalof Ladakh, near where the Buddhist monastery of Himis is located. Because of anaccident in which he broke his leg, he had the opportunity to stay for some timeat Himis. While he was there, he learnt that the Buddhists had ancient recordsof the life of Jesus Christ. Notovitch was stunned, and with some scratching helocated a Tibetan translation of the legend and carefully noted in his ‘carnetde voyage’ over two hundred verses from the curious document known as The Lifeof St. Issa. He learnt that ‘Issa’ is the direct translation of the name ‘Jesus’which is also used by many Muslims today. He was shown two large yellowedvolumes containing the biography of St. Issa. Notovitch enlisted a member of hisparty to translate the Tibetan volumes while he carefully noted each verse inthe back pages of his journal. When he returned to the Western world there wasmuch controversy as to the authenticity of the document. He was accused ofcreating a hoax and was ridiculed as an impostor. In his defence, he encourageda scientific expedition to prove that the original Tibetan documents reallyexisted. One of his sceptics was a Hindu monk and a disciple of Sri Ramakrishnacalled Swami Abhedananda. In 1922, Swami Abhedananda, journeyed to Ladakh inhopes of exposing Notovitch as a fraud. Upon questioning the head lama about St.Issa, he was shown a manuscript which he recorded in his travel notes. He wasastounded to find a manuscript of Bengali translation of two hundred twenty-fourverses virtually identical to what Notovitch had written. Abhedananda was thusconvinced of the authenticity of the Issa legend.While on a trek through central Asia during 1925, Nicholas Roerich, theartist-philosopher, also encountered the infamous manuscript. One of the manyreasons for Roerich's trek was to record customs and legends of the peoples ofcentral Asia. He published two of his diaries called Heart of Asia andAltai-Himalaya which both contain such tales of St. Issa. Roerich says that moreimportant than the find of the manuscripts itself is the cultural phenomenon ofthe spread of Jesus' legend to these ‘remote’ regions. He writes the followingin Altai-Himalaya concerning this:“Whoever doubts too completely that such legends about the Christ life exist inAsia, probably does not realize what an immense influence the Nestorians havehad in all parts of Asia and how many so-called Apocryphal legends they spreadin the most ancient times ... Many remember lines from the book of Notovitch,but it is still more wonderful to discover, on this site, in several variants,the same version of the legend of Issa. The local people knew nothing of anypublished book but they know the legend and with deep reverence they speak ofIssa. One might wonder what relation Moslems, Hindus, or Buddhists have withIssa. But it is still more significant to see how vital are great ideas and howthey penetrate even the most remote places. Never may one discover the source ofsuch legends. But even if they originated from ancient Nestorian Apocrypha, atpresent it is instructive to see the widespread and deep consideration paid tothe subject. It is significant to hear a local inhabitant, a Hindu, relate howIssa preached beside a small pool near the bazaar under a tree, which no longerexists. In such purely physical indications you may see how seriously thissubject is regarded.(Roerich: Altai-Himalaya, pp. 89-90)According to the Buddhist legends, Issa arrived in Asia at the age of about 13,studied under various masters, absorbing much knowledge while engaging in somepreaching of his own. The document further states that the ‘blessed one’ thenreturned to Palestine some 16 years later at the age of 29. This fits themysterious life of Jesus like a glove and since there aren't any other similarcoincidences that we know of, it certainly sounds like Jesus was awell-travelled and well-learned man by the time he began his world-changingministry in Palestine. The ‘Legend of Issa’ further strengthens the Essene andAryan link when it states that:“In his fourteenth year, young Issa, the Blessed One, came this side of theSindh and settled among the Aryas (Aryans)…”Sindh was a province of western Pakistan and Aryas was their term for Aryan. Thelegend goes that Jesus studied under the white Aryan Brahman Priests who wereoverjoyed by his arrival. “The white priest of Brahma welcomed him joyfully,”states the legend. He was taught to read and to understand the Vedas, and alsohow to teach and expound these Hindu scriptures. But Jesus started to show histrue colours very early in life when he disregarded culture and began toassociate with the lower castes. He protested against their discriminatorypractices and questioned why God would make any difference in his children. TheSudras (people of the lower castes) were not only forbidden to attend thereading of the Vedas, but they were even forbidden to look on them, for theywere condemned to perpetual servitude as slaves to the Brahmins, the Kshatriyasand even the Vaishyas who were of higher caste levels. Jesus strongly disagreedwith their philosophy and openly questioned their morality.“God has made no difference between his children, who are all alike dear tohim,” said Issa. Disregarding their words, Issa remained with the Sudras,preaching against the Brahmins and Kshatriyas. “Those who deprive their brethrenof divine happiness shall be deprived of it themselves. The Brahmans and theKshatriyas shall become the Sudras, and with the Sudras the Eternal shall dwelleverlastingly.” (Notovitch, 5:23) Please note that some historians spell theword Shudras as Sudras. There is also a different spelling for Vaishyas andVaishas.Issa's teachings in Asia are astounding as they mirror the words of Jesus someyears later. Take a look at some of the things he had to say, long before thepeople of the Holy Land got to hear his words of wisdom.“... He passed his time in several ancient cities of India such as Benares. Allloved him because Issa dwelt in peace with Vaishas and Shudras whom heinstructed and helped. But the Brahmins and Kshatriyas told him that Brahmaforbade those to approach who were created out of his womb and feet. The Vaishaswere allowed to listen to the Vedas only on holidays and the Shudras wereforbidden not only to be present at the reading of the Vedas, but could not evenlook at them.Issa said that man had filled the temples with his abominations. In order to payhomage to metals and stones, man sacrificed his fellows in whom dwells a sparkof the Supreme Spirit. Man demeans those who labour by the sweat of their brows,in order to gain the good will of the sluggard who sits at the lavishly setboard. But they who deprive their brothers of the common blessing shall bethemselves stripped of it.Vaishas and Shudras were struck with astonishment and asked what they couldperform. Issa bade them ‘Worship not the idols. Do not consider yourself first.Do not humiliate your neighbour. Help the poor. Sustain the feeble. Do evil tono one. Do not covet that which you do not possess and which is possessed byothers.’Many, learning of such words, decided to kill Issa. But Issa, forewarned,departed from this place by night.Afterward, Issa went into Nepal and into the Himalayan mountains ....‘Well, perform for us a miracle,’ demanded the servitors of the Temple. ThenIssa replied to them: ‘Miracles made their appearance from the very day when theworld was created. He who cannot behold them is deprived of the greatest gift oflife. But woe to you, enemies of men, woe unto you, if you await that He shouldattest his power by miracle.’Issa taught that men should not strive to behold the Eternal Spirit with one'sown eyes but to feel it with the heart, and to become a pure and worthy soul....Not only shall you not make human offerings, but you must not slaughter animals,because all is given for the use of man. Do not steal the goods of others,because that would be usurpation from your near one. Do not cheat, that you mayin turn not be cheated .... Beware, ye, who divert men from the true path andwho fill the people with superstitions and prejudices, who blind the vision ofthe seeing ones, and who preach subservience to material things.”“Then Pilate, ruler of Jerusalem, gave orders to lay hands upon the preacherIssa and to deliver him to the judges, without however, arousing the displeasureof the people.But Issa taught: ‘Do not seek straight paths in darkness, possessed by fear. Butgather force and support each other. He who supports his neighbour strengthenshimself. I tried to revive the laws of Moses in the hearts of the people. And Isay unto you that you do not understand their true meaning because they do notteach revenge but forgiveness. But the meaning of these laws is distorted.’Then the ruler sent to Issa his disguised servants that they should watch hisactions and report to him about his words to the people. ‘Thou just man,’ saidthe disguised servant of the ruler of Jerusalem approaching Issa, ‘Teach us,should we fulfil the will of Caesar or await the approaching deliverance?’But Issa, recognizing the disguised servants, said, ‘I did not foretell unto youthat you would be delivered from Caesar; but I said that the soul which wasimmersed in sin would be delivered from sin.’At this time, an old woman approached the crowd, but was pushed back. Then Issasaid, ‘Reverence Woman, mother of the universe,’ in her lies the truth ofcreation. She is the foundation of all that is good and beautiful. She is thesource of life and death. Upon her depends the existence of man, because she isthe sustenance of his labours. She gives birth to you in travail, she watchesover your growth. Bless her. Honour her. Defend her. Love your wives and honourthem, because tomorrow they shall be mothers, and later-progenitors of a wholerace. Their love ennobles man, soothes the embittered heart and tames the beast.Wife and mother-they are the adornments of the universe.’‘As light divides itself from darkness, so does woman possess the gift to dividein man good intent from the thought of evil. Your best thoughts must belong towoman. Gather from them your moral strength, which you must possess to sustainyour near ones. Do not humiliate her, for therein you will humiliate yourselves.And all which you will do to mother, to wife, to widow or to another woman insorrow - that shall you also do for the Spirit.’ So taught Issa; but the rulerPilate ordered one of his servants to make accusation against him.Said Issa: ‘Not far hence is the time when by the Highest Will the people willbecome purified and united into one family.’”(Roerich)It is fascinating to see that Jesus came face to face with some of the deitiesor angels who ruled the East. “Near Lhasa was a temple of teaching with a wealthof manuscripts. Jesus was to acquaint himself with them. Meng-ste, a great sageof all the East, was in this temple.”This behaviour caused so much friction, that a group of white priests sent someservants to kill Issa. He was however warned against the plot and escaped to theholy city of Djagguernat and further into Buddhist lands. Jesus stayed there forsix years learning the Pali language and the holy Buddhist writings called‘Sutras’. The legend goes that Jesus “could perfectly expound the sacredscrolls.”This kind of teaching flies right in the face of the ‘god of vengeance’in theOld Testament where god would choose his favourite group of people over another.It was the rebellious Jesus who began to preach in earnest that ‘all men areequal’. This was a brilliant piece of strategy by the god Enlil, who was settingup the young messiah for the biggest day in human religion, the crucifixion.But even before Jesus returned to Palestine he preached and performed miraclesamong the people of Asia, even raising some from the dead. This is anotherexcerpt from Roerich's translations of the Legend of St Issa.“Finally Jesus reached a mountain pass and in the chief city of Ladakh, Leh, hewas joyously accepted by monks and people of the lower class .... And Jesustaught in the monasteries and in the bazaars (the market places); wherever thesimple people gathered, there he taught. Not far from this place lived a womanwhose son had died and she brought him to Jesus. And in the presence of amultitude, Jesus laid his hand on the child, and the child rose healed. And manybrought their children and Jesus laid his hands upon them, healing them. Amongthe Ladakhis, Jesus passed many days, teaching them. And they loved him and whenthe time of his departure came they sorrowed as children.”By the time Jesus returned to Palestine he was 29-30 years old and immediatelystarted his public life of ministry. The relationship between him and hisEssenes sponsors was showing great signs of distress, mainly because of his lackof respect for their Aryan brethren in Asia. The Essenes had a lot of time andmoney invested in Jesus and they were keen to have him proclaimed the new‘messiah’, but Jesus wanted nothing to do with it. According to some historians,he denied his Davidic descent and even forbade his disciples to call him the‘messiah’, which is another perfect example of how the principle of 'divide andconquer' was being implemented by the cunning Enlil. While some writers of booksdealing with the Anunnaki influence on human history believe that Jesus became arebel within the environment which was prepared for him by his ‘heavenly gods’,I have a slightly more sinister hypothesis. The most important message weextract out of these activities is the masterful precision with which Enlil, thesupreme Anunnaki commander was orchestrating the ‘messiah prophesies’. Day byday, step by step, he manipulated events while setting Jesus up to be the martyrfor humanity, while he continually and unwittingly promoted the power of his‘good’ god, Enlil, the one and only god. Together with the books of the OldTestament they provide the irrefutable evidence of manipulation, control andoppression of humanity from the dawn of history. There is simply no other way todigest all the confusing and conflicting events of the distant past. The onlysensible answer lies in the well supported historic findings which outline thearrival of the Anunnaki or Nefilim on Earth, which led to a chain of eventsnobody could have ever predicted in their wildest dreams.Adding to the confusion about a messiah, which was being spread by the Anunnakigods and ‘angels’ was the constant need displayed by the people of the day tofind this elusive messiah. Their desperation for a saviour was so great thatthey willingly proclaimed Jesus to be the new messiah, adding fuel to the fire.But once again the fuel was actually being poured on by the Anunnaki ‘angels’who were the real agitators, spreading the word of the messiah to humans allover the place. Within three short years, Jesus had made such waves and createdso many enemies, that neither the Hebrew leaders nor the Romans were too fond ofhim. He was a real rebel, unconsciously creating a legacy which would bemasterfully crafted by a controlled group of priests between about 325 AD and1150 AD, into the New Testament. A stunning conclusion to the religiousentrapment of the Old Testament, which needed to evolve into a true human dramaof unconditional love, faith and sacrifice of the New Testament. By itsconclusion, the god Enlil had set the eternal trap of enslavement throughreligious dogma. A masterfully executed plot by the vengeful god, whom humanitystill fears today.Enlil was the father of manipulation and propaganda. Towards the end of the OldTestament he realised that humanity was growing increasingly informed andcivilised. The other lesser gods under the leadership of Marduk, were causingconfusion among people, causing them not to know whom they should obey andworship. Remember that Marduk had proclaimed himself ‘god above all’ and therivalry between him and Enlil was the main backdrop to the human drama ofbiblical times. But the humans had evolved, their brains were functioning moreintelligently and they had great philosophers, mathematicians and teachers whowere uplifting humanity at a rapid rate. Very quickly, Enlil's control overhumans was slipping. He had to come up with a cunning plan to reaffirm hissupremacy, so that humanity would become fearful and obedient once more. We mustremember that by this time there was a whole new sub-species of people calledHomo sapiens sapiens or ‘Wise Wise Man’. This newly evolved subspecies emergedvery early in human history when “the sons of God saw the daughters of man andhad children with them” and by doing so, immediately created a new hybrid humanwho was more intelligent and more evolved. All signs point to the Aryans as theearliest ‘Wise-Wise’ humans. These hybrid humans became a huge threat to Enlil,and remained a threat for long periods of time. We have already pointed out howgod and his bloodthirsty ‘angels’ tried to wipe out those who conspired againsthim in Sodom and Gomorrah. This kind of persecution carried on throughout theages with numerous examples in the Bible. At first Enlil tried to curtail suchrebellious activity in various oppressive ways but it failed. History has shownus that dictators do not last forever. Eventually the people will rise upagainst their oppressor. This is exactly what happened to Enlil. By the end ofthe Old Testament days, he realised that a new strategy was necessary tore-establish total control over humanity.The ‘divide and conquer’ principle was successfully introduced, but Enlil testedthe process of religious entrapment on a few other occasions, with otherso-called prophets. It seems that the Anunnaki had been planting seeds ofmessianic doctrine for quite some time, patiently waiting for one of or more ofthe messiahs to take root. And boy, did they! The Hebrew and Christian Biblesare filled with prophets but some delivered less success than others. One suchexample is outlined in the Book of Enoch one of the Apocryphal scriptures.Melchizedek was a Jewish high priest with great influence in his time, who wasalso reported to have been brought forth by a virgin birth by his old motherSoparim, without human intercourse.2 Enoch 71“Soparim, old and barren, conceived Melchizedek without having intercourse withher husband.”Enoch writes that Soparim was not only post-menstrual but she had been childlessall of her life, when suddenly she fell pregnant on her own. Although I have notread about the presence of any ‘angels’ in this instance, I suspect they musthave been present just like in all the other virgin birth cases, making surethat the intended recipient was receptive to the fertilisation process she wasabout to experience. Enoch must have had some form of contact with the gods whoused him as a mouthpiece to prophesy the coming of Melchizedek and anothermessiah, who would be the most powerful of them all. By using random prophets inthis fashion, the gods created an expectation among humans of great heavenlythings and salvation from the toil on Earth. They were promised eternal life inthe house of god and other fantastical experiences. But only IF they behaved andobeyed their god blindly at all times. It is mind-boggling that since thosedays, nothing has really changed in popular global religions, and the fear ofpunishment by god is possibly stronger now than ever.Enoch 71:34“And afterward, in the last generation, there will be another Melchizedek, thefirst of twelve priests. And this last will be head of all, a great archpriest,the Word and power of God, who will perform miracles greater and more gloriousthan all the previous ones.”What a wonderfully deceptive promise to make to a confused community of humanswithout any identity. The wonders do not end here though. The Hindu traditionhas many legends of wondrous human beings that are conceived and born in strangeand complex manners. Just take a look at the Vedic poems. The Buddha was bornfrom the womb unlike many of the other Hindu gods. Once again there was a brightconstellation that signalled the miraculous birth of a great prophet andteacher. The conception by his mother Maya was very peculiar during which shefell into a deep trance in which a white king elephant seemed to enter her bodywithout causing her pain or discomfort. During her pregnancy Maya did notexperience any fatigue or depression. The legend surrounding the conception andbirth of the Buddha goes something like this:“So he issued from the womb as befits a Buddha. He did not enter the world inthe usual manner, and he appeared like one descended from the sky.”Does this mean that the Buddha had Aryan features, like Enki and the otherAnunnaki gods? If so, who was his paternal father whose DNA he inherited.“And since he had for many eons been engaged in the practice of meditation, henow was born in full awareness, and not thoughtless and bewildered as otherpeople are. When born, he was so lustrous and steadfast that it appeared as ifthe young sun had come down to earth.”Once again we witness a bright light or some other form of brilliance as in thecave during the birth of Christ.“And yet, when people gazed at his dazzling brilliance, he held their eyes likethe moon. His limbs shone with the radiant hue of precious gold, and lit up thespace all around. Instantly he walked seven steps, firmly and with long strides.In that, he was like the constellation of the Seven Seers. With the bearing of alion he surveyed the four quarters, and spoke these words full of meaning forthe future: ‘For enlightenment I was born, for the good of all that lives. Thisis the last time that I have been born into this world of becoming.’”(Conze, 1959.)Based on various historic births of prophets, the people of Israel also expectthat the birth of the Messiah would be surrounded by miraculous celestial signs,which would herald the beginning of the apocalypse when god's chosen peoplewould be taken up to heaven. The Jews also expect the visitation of angels andwondrous occurrences to accompany the conception of the Messiah, as it seems tohave happened for hundreds of years before. By the time Christ was born the Jewswere desperate for a messiah but they had pretty set ideas of what the messiah'sjob would entail. It certainly did not fall in line with what Jesus started topreach on his return from Asia. For a long time the Jews wanted a warriormessiah to save them from their slavery and torment. They wanted to be told thatthey were god's chosen people and that he had come to save them, not to tellthem that all people are equal in god's eyes, or to turn the other cheek! Butsadly for them, the message from the Old Testament had suddenly changeddramatically and Jesus took upon himself the hopeless situation of the ‘slavespecies’. He believed that he could teach them and ‘really’ save them. Littledid he know that there was a much bigger, and more sinister plan by the Anunnakiwhich plotted his destiny. Once they realised that this Jesus character was wellestablished among a growing loyal group of followers, they would stop at nothingto help elevate Jesus to the highest level of divinity. A good example comes tous in Matthew three after Jesus was baptised, the gods had to add a little spiceto entrench the moment in human history. Another incredible example of how thegods interacted with Humankind. Wouldn't it be fascinating if this kind of thinghappened today? I wonder what CNN and BBC journalists would make of it.Matthew 3:16-17“As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that momentheaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove andlighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, ‘This is my Son, whom I love;with him I am well pleased.’”We begin to suspect that Jesus did not want to go through with his ordeal whenhe realised what was going on. In the garden of Gethsemane he asks the godstwice if he could ‘not drink from the cup’ basically meaning that he wanted thisordeal to pass him by.Matthew 26:38-42“‘My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death.’… he fell with hisface to the ground and prayed, ‘My Father, if it is possible, may this cup betaken from me…The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.’ … He went away asecond time and prayed, ‘My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to betaken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.’”It is clear from these words that Jesus had lost his lust for this messianicstuff. But a real moment of truth which reveals the terrible secret about Jesusbeing manipulated, came on the cross just before he died. If he really knew whatwas awaiting him, why would he say the following:Matthew 27:46“About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, ‘Eloi, Eloi, lamasabachthani?’ Which means, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’”Why would Jesus suddenly feel that he had been let down, or forgotten? Did heexpect to be helped by someone? Surely he must have been aware of his own fateand that he was going to stir the hatred of the authorities who would not lethim get away with such blatant anti-establishment behaviour! If he was fullyaware of the implications of his actions, why would he expect his god to rescuehim? After all Jesus was supposed to be god personified in human form. Surely heknew he had to die for humanity? Or maybe not! It is possible that the roadwhich was laid out for him by the higher powers, did not include the finalchapter that ended with a gruesome crucifixion?Another example of Anunnaki interference in human entrapment, was the birth andlife of the prophet Muhammad. Many extraordinary stories are told about thebirth of the great prophet. A brilliant light shone over the entire world fromEast to West in the hour of his delivery. “When Mohammed was born he was cleanand without physical blemish, already circumcised, and with the navel cordalready cut. At the age of four, Mohammed was visited by angels. They opened hisbody, taking a black drop from his heart while washing his inward parts withmelted snow from a golden chalice. Furthermore there are many elements withinIslamic folklore which imply and support a virgin birth.” (Andras, 1960).The paranoia of losing control of their ‘slave species’ is also clearly visiblein the events leading up to the reciting of the Koran. As N.J. Dawood states inhis introduction to the Koran, that long before Muhammad's call, the Arabicworld was worshipping many gods, whom they called the ‘daughters of Allah’. Someof those were female goddesses like Al-Lat, Al-Uzza and Manat. This was anotherarea where Enlil and his Anunnaki gods had to take action before they lost anymore control, allowing the humans to organise themselves against him. The powerof the church was growing but it had not reached the kind of horrifying musclewhich it would exercise during the Crusades some centuries later. Meanwhile,this was some 610 years after Christ, and still the slave species did not learnthe lessons from Jesus, that they should only worship one god, and the only wayinto ‘heaven’ was through him. So, the ‘god’ who had set up Jesus needed anothermessenger. The famous story of the angel Gabriel appearing before Muhammad,strongly resembles the process of setting up Mary and Joseph, pretty much totheir surprise and against their will. Muhammad would become a prophet who isfollowed by people who fear the violent retribution of their god. According toMuslim tradition, one night in Ramadan about 610 AD, the angel Gabriel came tohim while he was asleep or in a trance, and said: “Recite!” He replied: ‘Whatshall I recite?’ The order was repeated three times until the angel himselfsaid: ‘Recite the name of your Lord who created, created man from clots ofblood.’That statement is perfectly in synch with the Sumerian tablets outlining thecreation of Adam by the Anunnaki gods. What makes this event even moreinteresting, is that the original Koran translation into English carried theterm ‘Lord of Creation’, which has since been changed to ‘Lord of the Universe’in latter translations. It may be a subtle change to the normal reader, but ifyou view it from the understanding of the Anunnaki's activity on Earth, it makesa huge difference. Because we suspect that the Anunnaki created man, but theycertainly did not create the universe. The term ‘Lord of Creation’ was moreappropriate, but it was not grandiose enough for the followers of Mohammed. Onceagain we are faced with a tragic confusion between god and God, the former ofwhich has kept humanity imprisoned on Earth in a perpetual fear of God.The whole concept of angels has always troubled me. Honestly! Why in heavenwould the ‘all-powerful’, omnipotent GOD need a bunch of lower spiritual formsin a physical form, to run His errands? To convey messages, to deliver warningsand threats, and to actually do the destruction on his behalf? Why would GODneed this kind of menial support? Surely the all-powerful GOD can facilitate allthe interactions with humans in the blink of an eye, instead of long-windedtedious instructions, threats and the monitoring of humans who have apparentlybeen behaving sinfully while conspiring against him! It simply does not wash.There are further examples of possible Anunnaki or Nefilim interferences incontrolling humans. Many are kept under wraps for fear of ridicule. It seemsthat people in the 21st century are not as brave to come out with claims ofhaving been visited by angels, as their brethren of ancient times. There was onesuch occasion in 1820, when the young Joseph Smith had his first encounter withwhat was described as an ‘angel’ who returned on several occasions to repeat‘exactly’ the same message of doom and destruction among humans. The way inwhich the young Joseph relates his story points to a possibility that themessage was a recording which was re-played to him several times during the samenight. It was beamed into his bedroom leaving the angel ‘floating’ off theground. The message ended with the floating angel exiting the window in a pillarof light until it vanished in the sky. The next day he had the same messagebroadcast to him by the same angel while in the field. The ‘angel’ evenintroduced himself as Moroni, telling Joseph about some ancient metal platescontaining the history of North America. Joseph was to find them and have themtranslated. And so was born the Mormon Church which is many millions strongtoday.I find it incredibly disturbing to contemplate the possibility that GOD wouldspend virtually 13,000 years, from the emergence of civilisation, plotting asuccession of messiahs and prophets to warn people about their sinful behaviour.Then, going on to choose one group of favourites above another, while decimatingthose who had been ‘plotting and conspiring’ against him. How can peopleconspire against an all powerful GOD? I can understand how people can conspireagainst a physical entity or even deity, when they realize that the deities whoare causing them harm are vulnerable. But such has been the strategy of ‘divideand rule’ injected into human society by Enlil and the hordes of ‘angels’ whoseemed to have run all his errands for thousands of years.If there ever was a clear case of evidence of ancient people living in fear ofcelestial deities, it exists in abundance in the Hindu scriptures. The Vedas,sacred Hindu poems, which have apparently been passed on verbally for as long as10,000 years, and eventually written down in the Sanskrit language are filledwith references to a multitude of gods who display all the violent human traitswe have described before. The most striking characteristic once again is the‘violent gene’. If the Vedas are indeed as old as they seem, they are a vividtestimony of the constant interaction between gods and humanity in the distantpast while man was being nurtured into so-called civilisation by the Anunnakiand Nefilim gods. According to Richard Thompson in his book Alien Identities,there are many references to ‘non-human’ interventions in ancient Indianscriptures. I went in search of such references and was astounded at theconstant referral to things like sacrifice; fear of the gods; punishment;reward; wealth; goddesses who loved mortal men; immortality; being spared fromharm; partying with the gods; gold; riches; victory over the enemy; chariots inthe sky; god's bright beams of light; and literally thousands of strangereferences which cannot be explained in historic terms but rather by today'scommon sense. Evidence of human manipulation by heavenly deities fills hundredsof pages of the sacred Vedic poems. Such manipulation of humans continued overthe years with the Bible, Kabala, Koran, and thousands of other documents thathave never been brought into the mainframe, such as the apocryphal books of theBible and writings of other religious groups. In the end, we have to admit thatthe strategy used by the Anunnaki has worked very well. Although stretched overlong periods of Earth time, often appearing to be very disorganised, the gods ofour prehistory, the Anunnaki, have achieved their goal. They have dividedhumanity, turned them against each other and they have conquered them with fear.So, now that we have a clearer picture of the suspicious events surrounding thebirths and lives of some prophets of our human history, we can attempt to answerthe question of who Jesus Christ really was. To some readers, the inbred fear ofthe mere suggestion that Jesus was anything other than the son of GOD, willprevent them from crossing this bridge. I am of the firm opinion that Jesus wasjust one of many prophets or messiahs who were carefully planned by the Anunnakigods, in an attempt to keep humanity in line, fearful and obedient, to the greatgods who ruled the world, and possibly still rule it today.If you find this preposterous just ask yourself this question: The world'slargest organisations who control our day-to-day lives are controlled by a smallgroup of people who basically determine what brands we consume, how we dress,what TV shows we watch, what we drive, what beer we drink and where we go onholiday. How often do we see the small group of decision makers in theirboardrooms as they plan our next mode of transport? Never. We simply accept itas it emerges and get on with our lives. But we believe and we 'know' that thereis such a group of people making those decisions which will influence our livesdramatically. We know that there is a group of people who control the price ofoil, but we do not know what happens in their meetings while they plan ourfuture. We simply live with the consequences. Our lives are controlled by arelatively small number of major industries and a small number of people incharge of those industries, but we simply accept that this is the case and thatin truth there is not really much we can do about it. The absolute power whichthe giants of global industry wield is virtually unassailable. We shouldtherefore not be surprised to find out that there could be a small number ofancient Anunnaki ‘gods’ who still reside among us, controlling our affairs inways which we cannot comprehend and cannot see.As far as Jesus is concerned, it certainly seems that he was the most successfulof the planted messiahs. He was the one who took root and captured the heartsand imagination of the people of his time, while the other prophets onlyachieved moderate success. To the gods who planned him and placed him into theworld, Jesus was a great achievement and possibly even a great surprise forfinding success where many others before him had failed. He managed to plantseeds of obedience but also perpetuated the fear of god, while unconsciouslyspreading the principle of ‘divide and conquer’ among humanity. And so theAnunnaki gods reaped another major victory over their human slave species,keeping them enslaved and obedient for another 2,000 years. Who knows how muchlonger this grip of fear will control our world, before we will all be able tobreak free from the entrapment by our creators, our slave masters, our gods witha small ‘g’, so that we can reach out to the infinite community of universalbeings who live in unity with the real GOD. The universal one, who needs noofferings of gold, or offerings of flesh, or who harbours no need to punishhumanity for disobedience; the GOD who does not choose one favourite human overanother.But the most compelling argument which supports that Jesus was an innocentbystander and accidental Messiah comes from Barbara Thiering in her book Jesusof the Apocalypse – The life of Jesus after the crucifixion. Most people will beshocked to find out that the story of Jesus did not end on the cross or with hisresurrection. Ms. Thiering presents a volume of evidence, mostly originating inthe book of Revelations, that Jesus retreated into a secretive life ofanti-Roman activity with his two sons and daughter. We learn that by the timeJesus was crucified, he was already married to Mary Magdalene. Their firstwedding took place during September in 30 AD not long after Jesus began hisministry. We should also remember that there is now overwhelming evidence thatJesus was actually born in the year 7 BC, which would have made him seven yearsolder than history books lead us to believe. Their second wedding took placeduring March to May in 33 AD according to their custom, when they knew that MaryMagdalene was more than three months pregnant and a miscarriage was less likelyto occur. But it was a turbulent time for the Messiah as this was also the yearin which he was to be executed. Later that year in September, his wife MaryMagdalene gave birth to a daughter, their first child. Jesus rises from thedead, his body mysteriously disappears from the tomb and an ‘angel’ tells MaryMagdalene and friends that he had risen on the 3rd day as he promised he would.Those irrepressible angels seem to pop up every time there is possible troublefor the Anunnaki gods. Jesus begins his anti-Roman campaign with his disciplesand a growing number of revolutionaries. They struggle against Agrippa I;Caligula; Agrippa II and other Roman leaders. In June 37 AD his first son JesusJustus is born. In March 44 AD his second son is born and in September of thatyear his marriage to Mary ends. He travels extensively seeking support for hismovement, in Cyprus, Asia Minor, Rome, Ephesus, Philippi where he marries awoman called Lydia in 50 AD. He continues to travel until he dies in the year 70AD, at the age of 76, most likely in Rome. While this is a shocking glossary andrevelation for the most religious, Ms Thiering goes into great detail insupporting these facts. But let us go back to the resurrection, because it wasreally from this point onwards that things went a little pear-shaped in thescriptures and many questions arise as to what possibly happened to the son ofGod after he rose from the dead. Suspicious activity surrounds the cave and thereactions of those who came in search of Jesus. It seems that the ‘angel’ didsomething to the guards which incapacitated them as they “became like dead men”.The gods used Mary to help spread the propaganda that Jesus had arisen.Matthew 27:65 -66“‘Take a guard,’ Pilate answered. ‘Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.’So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and postingthe guard.”Matthew 28:1 -10. The Resurrection“After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and theother Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake, for anangel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back thestone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes werewhite as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became likedead men. The angel said to the women, ‘Do not be afraid, for I know that youare looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just ashe said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell hisdisciples: He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee.There you will see him. Now I have told you.’ So the women hurried away from thetomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesusmet them. ‘Greetings,’ he said. They came to him, clasped his feet andworshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, ‘Do not be afraid. Go and tell mybrothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.’”And so began the life of ‘Jesus the revolutionary’ after his resurrection. Therewas so much activity between Jesus and Simon, Mark, John, Peter, Matthew andothers that it baffles the mind and I highly recommend the reading of Jesus ofthe Apocalypse for the sceptics. What could have possibly happened to Jesusafter these events? How could the son of GOD; the messiah of the people, justsuddenly disappear from the face of the world? If he survived and lived on,would he not have continued a life of ministry of some sort? Why did he go intohiding? The biggest surprise comes when we learn of Jesus' personal views of theevents surrounding his life. He was so disillusioned by all the activity thatafter his resurrection he vanished from the scene and carried on living withwife and children until the age of about 76, leading the life of an activistagainst the Romans. But why the Romans? Jesus was not a stupid man, he wasextremely well-travelled, well-educated and broad-minded. He must have realisedthat he was set up by the gods to be their front and mouthpiece. The gods whopresented themselves as the GOD of the universe, the God with a big ‘G’. It musthave come as a great shock to him that this was not the case and that he wasgreatly manipulated, lied to and misguided by the deities of Rome. It becameclear to him that these were actually the gods of Rome; the conniving andmanipulative gods who have been controlling humanity from the very beginning.This made Jesus retreat and with his fellow supporters begin a campaign ofunderground resistance against those Roman gods. They realised that the ‘gods’were not infallible and that humans could stand up against them. Just like hispredecessors during the time of Abraham did, in the cities of Sodom andGomorrah, the earliest organised resistance against the gods, for which theywere severely punished. I cannot find another plausible explanation why the sonof GOD, who survived his execution would suddenly disappear from the mainstreamwhen he had had such a loyal following. In the years after his death theChristian movement grew steadily, but in truth it was a movement which was aimedat discrediting the Anunnaki gods of Rome, while offering the people a whole newspiritual reality which Jesus absorbed during his early years in Asia. It isironic that the Messiah who was planted and manipulated by the lesser deity godsto keep Humankind enslaved through fear, turned against his makers and began topreach the awareness of a greater spiritual power in the universe. But historygot it all mixed up, and the poor faithful masses today do not really know whothey are praying to. Because the message of Christ after his death is notclearly recorded or understood, but it somehow seeped into the greater pool ofreligious preaching and continues to be highly confusing in the 21st century.The number of divergent Christian movements are testimony to this curiousdevelopment in the Christian Church.The desperation of the Anunnaki gods becomes evident when they try to create newprophets and messiahs, like in the story of Mohammed who was throttled by an‘angel’ commanding Mohammed to recite the name of the Lord. As time went by andhumans emerged out of the Dark Ages and the Renaissance, the activity of thegods seemed to have diminished. They had greatly achieved what they had set outto do. To keep their human slave species ignorant, divided, faithful andfrightened of the wrath of god. So here we are, some 200,000 years after ourcreation, having gone through many stages of development, civilisation,mechanisation and now technology. And still we do not know who we are and wherewe come from. 70% of the world population holds onto some fanatical religiousbelief system which promises to give them salvation over the masses of sinnersin the world. Regardless of the technological achievements and our explorationof the planets, many still hold onto their ancient belief system, too scared tochallenge it with newfound knowledge. Jesus was just an innocent bystander whowas chosen and manipulated by the conniving Anunnaki gods. But when he realisedwhat had actually happened to him, he tried his best to undo the damage.Unfortunately it was a little too late. The Roman Empire used his example toperpetuate the lie under Constantine who was most likely guided by Enlil and hisgodly followers, while the Aryans and the supporters of Marduk opposed theiractivity, which is clearly outlined during the council of Nicaea of 325 AD.If you think that the mystery surrounding Jesus is pretty much exhausted, thinkagain. We have only scratched the surface. A real mind bender occurred in 1963with the discovery of the Talmud of Jmmanuel (TJ) scrolls. Eduard Albert Meier,a Swiss traveller and his friend, an ex-Greek-Orthodox priest, Isa Rashid, werewalking along a roadway just south of the Old City of Jerusalem, when Meierhappened to glance up and noticed a small opening in the ground amongst therocks and shrubs. Curiosity made him reach into his backpack for his flashlightand he peered into the hole to notice that it continued inwards. They proceededto dig away rocks and earth until the hole was large enough that they couldcrawl inside. It was an old tomb site, half filled in with soil. After furtherdigging and exploring they noticed a bundle buried underneath a flat rock. Itturned out to be the TJ in the form of rolls of written sheets, along with a fewsmall artefacts. They were wrapped up together in animal skin which was in turnencased in resin. There were four rolls, each of which contained many leaves orpages of Aramaic writing. They were old and fragile and each leaf was roughly30cm by 40cm in size.Rashid, who could read most of the old Aramaic due to his priestly education andPalestinian background, was concerned that the scripts were heretical. Forexample, its title involved Jmmanuel (i.e. Immanuel, spelled with a J-symbol;making use of the ‘i’ sound in place of the Aramaic/Hebrew letter ‘Ayin’) ratherthan Jesus or Y'shua. Furthermore, its writer was noted as Judas Iscariot, thesupposed betrayer of Christ. Thirdly, it mentioned that Adam's father had beenSemjasa, the leader of the “celestial sons”, who were El's or God's guardianangels, and who were “distant travellers”. It immediately became apparent thatif they ever wished this document to become public, its translation would haveto proceed in secret. The scrolls further indicated that the Old Testament godhad been an extraterrestrial leader, taking on the role of a ‘Father’ in heaven,rather than the omnipotent GOD. So let us refer to him as El, as in Immanu-el.Rashid spent a few months reading through the TJ rolls to extract thehighlights, which he reported to Meier. In August of 1963 they agreed thatRashid would translate the TJ into German and would retain custody of theAramaic document, while sending his translations to Meier for him todisseminate. So Rashid started the long task of rendering a translation whileMeier continued his travels.The first set of translations up to chapter 36 of the TJ reached Meier inSwitzerland some time around 1970, but Meier did not hear from Rashid himselfuntil in a letter in September of 1974. This letter briefly explained thedisturbing news that his translation project had become known to certainauthorities, forcing him to flee from Jerusalem, together with his family.Rashid found his way with the TJ rolls and further translations, to a refugeecamp in Lebanon. But his presence there became known to Israeli authoritiesforcing him to flee again, this time to Baghdad, where he posted the letter toMeier. He and his family, like the other refugees, had to flee so suddenly thatRashid had no time to retrieve the original Aramaic rolls or his furthertranslations of them, and they were destroyed in the chaos from which they fled.In 1976 Meier learned that Rashid and his family were assassinated in Baghdad.Fortunately the German translations were quite substantial and various versionshave been released from the original version of 1978. The latest edition was dueout in 2005.Meier insists that publications of non-German translations of the TJ include theside-by-side German edition, so that discrepancies or distortions in translationbe less likely to creep in. The translation of the original Aramaic pages of thefirst roll, reads as if it is the original writing of the ministry and teachingsof Jesus. However, the messiah is referred to as Immanuel and not Jesus. The TJresembles very closely the Gospel of Matthew in both wording, where the verseshave close parallels, and in its order, although each contains many passages notcontained by the other. James W. Deardorf is an esteemed author of a number ofdetailed books dealing with Jesus in India and other New Testament issues. Hestates that “Even a brief comparison of the TJ against the Gospel of Matthewdiscloses that one depends upon the other. The correspondence in order of eventsand sometimes in wording is too close to permit any other possibility”. Deardorfhas been analyzing the TJ since 1986 and has found several hundred reasons whythe verses in Matthew were derived from the Talmud, and that it is virtuallyimpossible for these writings to be the work of hoaxers. The Talmud speaks of asupreme deity called El who orchestrated all the activity surrounding humanityon Earth. Could this be the Enlil we read about in Sumerian texts, who was thesupreme Anunnaki commander of planet Earth? Here are some excerpts from theTalmud to illustrate its close but shocking relationship to the Gospel ofMatthew.TJ 1:1“This is the book and Arcanum of Jmmanuel, who is called ‘the one with godlyknowledge,’ who is a son of Joseph, grandson of Jacob, the distant descendant ofDavid. David was a descendant of Abram [Abraham], whose genealogy traces back toAdam, the father of a lineage of terrestrial humans. Adam was begotten bySemjasa, the leader of the celestial sons who were the guardian angels of El,the great ruler of the travellers from afar.”I would dare to say that this follows closely my postulated theory thatHumankind is a slave species created by ancient settlers on Earth, who seemed tobe highly advanced and regarded as ‘gods’ by us, up until recent times.TJ 1:80 -81“Jacob begot Joseph. Joseph was the husband of Mary, the mother of Jmmanuel, whowas impregnated by a distant descendant of the celestial son, Rasiel, who wasthe guardian angel of the secret.”Rasiel was the guardian angel who appears to have been associated with a masterplan to ensure that a highly evolved human like Jmmanuel was incarnated at theright time and right place. Rasiel is also mentioned in the Kabbalah and thebook of Zohar as the angel who was the master of mysteries.TJ: 1:82“When Joseph heard of Mary's secret impregnation by a descendant of thecelestial sons from the lineage of Rasiel, behold, he was filled with wrath andthought of leaving Mary before he would be married to her before the people.”TJ 1:83 -84“While Joseph was thinking in this manner, behold, a guardian angel, sent byGabriel, the celestial son who had impregnated Mary, appeared and said: ‘Joseph,Mary is betrothed to you and you are to become her spouse; do not leave her,because the fruit of her womb is chosen for a great purpose. Marry her in allopenness, so that you may be husband and wife before the people.’”TJ 1:85“Behold, the impregnation of Mary occurred eleven thousand years after theprocreation of Adam through the celestial son Semjasa, to fulfil the word of El,the ruler of those who travelled from afar, who conveyed these words through theprophet Isaiah:”Here is a comparison between Matthew and Talmud Jmmanuel. See the last partwhich refers to ‘one with godly knowledge’.Mt 1:23“Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be calledEmmanuel (which means, God with us).”TJ 1:86 -87“Behold, a virgin will be impregnated by a celestial son before she is marriedto a man before the people. They will name the fruit of her womb Jmmanuel, whichtranslated means ‘the one with godly knowledge’...”In the following verses the writer of Matthew omitted to mention the name of theprophet Micah, while the Talmud makes it clear who the actual prophet was, thatgave them the information.Mt 2:4 -6“… and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he [Herod]inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. They told him, ‘In Bethlehemof Judea; for so it is written by the prophet: And you, O Bethlehem, in the landof Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shallcome a ruler who will govern my people Israel.’”TJ 2:9 -11“Herod Antipas called together all the chief priests and scribes from among thepeople and inquired of them where Jmmanuel had been born. And they replied: ‘InBethlehem, in the Jewish land; for thus it was written by the prophet Micah: Andyou, Bethlehem, in the land of the Jews, are by no means the least among thecities in Judea, for from you shall come forth the king of wisdom, who willbring great knowledge to the people of Israel so that they may learn and serveCreation.’”The description of a sound emanating from the star which hovered ahead of TheThree Wise Men is a clear indication that there was some sinister activitysurrounding this event, which can be explained with the help of advancedtechnology and machinery. Once again, the Matthew version does not include thisparticular section.TJ 2:14“After they [the magi] had listened to Herod Antipas, they departed. And behold,the light with the long tail, which they had observed in the Orient, moved aheadof them with a high singing sound until it reached Bethlehem and stood directlyover the stable where the infant was born.”TJ 3:2 -4“John the Baptist preached of baptism in accordance with the old laws of El,according to which the way to knowledge was to be prepared. He preached thatEl's laws shall be followed because he is the sole ruler of this human lineage.He preached that above El, however, stands Creation, the source of the worlds,universes and all living creatures.”In the next comparison we have more evidence of some sort of intervention from ahigher technological intelligence. Matthew is however less open about the trueevents. Were these the kind of events which were edited out of the New Testamentby the Church councils?Mt 3:16 -17“And when Jesus was baptised, he went up immediately from the water, and behold,the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, anda lighting on him; and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, ‘This is my beloved Son,with whom I am well pleased.’”TJ 3:30 -32“When Jmmanuel had been baptized, he soon came out of the water of the Jordan,and behold, a metallic light came down from the sky and rushed over the Jordan.Consequently they all fell on their faces and pressed them into the sand while avoice from the metallic light spoke, ‘This is my beloved son with whom I am wellpleased. He will be the king of truth, through which terrestrial humans shallrise as wise ones.’”And so the comparisons continue for dozens and dozens of verses. The obviousdifference is that the Talmud refers to the constant intervention of angels andother celestial beings, while the Gospel has a cleaner, more acceptable versionof the events to suit the monotheistic community which was being nurtured by theearly Church. Is it possible that whoever wrote the Talmud did so in an attemptto cut through the stranglehold and disinformation which was being imposed bythe ‘gods of Enlil’ on humanity? Someone who was well aware of the activity ofthe ancient gods who ruled the world? After all, these were the times of Romanmythology and everyone was very aware of the many gods and angels who ruled theroost.While numerous scholars have found the book of Matthew to be full ofinconsistencies, ambiguities and interruptions in flow of thought, suchinconsistencies are not nearly as obvious in the Talmud. A growing number ofscholars agree that Jmmanuel's teachings had to be altered or omitted to conformwith the views of early Christianity. What this discovery does achieve is toconfirm that Jesus or Jmmanuel did travel to India and back during the ‘lost’years of his life.The gods who were orchestrating Jesus' life had much bigger plans for him. Theywanted to make sure that this newly established prophet of theirs was recognisedall over the populated world. In her book He Walked the Americas L. TaylorHansen reveals many breathtaking examples of how Jesus spread the gospel amongthe native north American tribes and the rest of the Americas, always symbolizedby a T-cross. There is endless mention of a “White Prophet” with a beard, or“Healer”, and many references of him arriving to teach them wisdom. Theselegends are still told by the fireside of a “saintly white teacher” whoperformed miracles with healing. They describe his eyes as grey-green like theocean and his symbol has been woven into blankets, carved on canyon walls, puton pottery and is even depicted in dances. His name has been given to mountainsand rivers; and just as I suggest in this book that the Anunnaki gods taughthumanity about civilisation, agriculture, planting and harvesting, so do thenative American tales speak of the Pale Prophet who came to teach them all thesethings. He gave them seeds to plant and taught them wisdom. And guess what hissymbol was? A winged serpent. Is it possible that the winged serpent, whom webelieve to be Ningishzidda or Enki, brought Jesus to the Americas on theinstructions of Enlil?He was called the ‘Feathered Serpent’ or ‘Eeseecotl’ among the Algonquins. Theysay that he always wore a long white toga and golden sandals. Every new town hearrived in would have a new garment waiting for him. They would keep the oldones, saying that to touch them would bring healing. During his stay he wouldtrain twelve disciples, with one appointed to be their leader, who would takehis place when he left. He would say he had to “go about My Father's Business”.This is a clear sign of extreme manipulation of Humankind by the Anunnaki gods.Enlil was going to do everything in his power to squeeze Marduk out, denying himthe pleasure of controlling the world. To do this, their manufactured messiahJesus, would have to be accepted by as many ‘slave species’ as possible. And sothey would ensure that this was going to happen even as far away as in theAmericas. The Shawnee tribe speak of a message that was given to them by theProphet. “Do not kill or injure your neighbour, for it is not he that youinjure; you injure yourself. Do good to him, thus adding to his days ofhappiness even as you then add to your own. Do not wrong or hate your neighbour;for it is not he that you wrong: you wrong yourself. Rather love him, for theGreat Spirit loves him, even as He loves you.” This was the kind of message thathumans were yearning for, for thousands of years under the oppressive regime ofthe Anunnaki gods. Enlil was providing them with a way out.Michigan was the centre of the Giant Cross of Waters and the Prophet was knownto travel this trail. No tribe was too far, too small, too poor or too violent.He would enter war situations, he would call all the chiefs together and dividethe lands. He gave them seeds which they did not know about and showed them howto farm. He would teach them ‘His’ principles and go to any length to ensurethey remembered him above all possible future prophets. These tales are mirroredfrom tribe to tribe. But Jesus did not only raise people from the dead, in theAmericas he revived even animals.L. Taylor Hanson tells us how the Healer knelt down beside a dead dear whosefaun was standing nearby and started stroking the body. As his hand passed overthe wounds, they healed up, leaving no marks. And soon the deer startedbreathing and rose. His disciples were upset saying that he was wasting hisenergy on animals. The Pale One said, “There cannot be too many good deeds. Suchis the manner of compassion. A lost lamb is my Father's business, as importantas saving a nation, if one need not choose between them. More precious in myFather's eyes is a good deed than the most exquisite jewel.” We can clearly seehow seriously Jesus took his mission here on Earth, before he realised that hewas being set up by the Anunnaki gods. He told the people he was born across theocean where all men had beards. Even in the American legends, he told them ofhis virgin birth and about the bright star that shone over the place of hisbirth. “The heavens opened up and winged beings sang chants of exquisitebeauty.”During a dig by the University of Oklahoma at the Spiro Mound, they unearthedpottery showing winged beings singing and also a hand with the cross through thepalm. The locals refer to him as ‘Chee-Zoos’, the Dawn God. “The love they bearHim is beyond measurement, for well they know He watches over them, and thatwhen their journey here is over, He will meet them in the Land of Shadows, forsuch was His sacred promise.” Once again we hear about the promise of a lifeafter death which was commonly promoted by the gods among humans, to keep themfaithful and loyal.There are further tales of the ‘Great Mound Builders’ by Decoodah, the last highpriest of extinct Elks, which was translated and recorded by Walter Pidgeonaround 1850. The legends described them as tribes that spoke the Algonquinlanguage and they were the ‘Ancients’ of the country. These legendary moundsmarked the sites of ancient cities and are closely related to the mounds of theMayans of Mexico, drawing a distinct connection with the 'winged serpent' whichis referred to by both cultures. They also possessed a unique ancient type ofwriting that recorded history. The mounds were apparently covered by wood andpainted as the Mayans had done. The 'Great White Robed Master' with hisgrey-green eyes and golden sandals also stayed among the mound builders. Stonepictographs of the prophet have been found causing much debate about his closeresemblance to Jesus.The Pawnee tribe talk of a prophet who visited them twice and taught them about‘His Father’, “The Mighty Holy of the Heavens”.The wrath of god was well experienced by the native American tribes as well asthose who lived in biblical lands. The Pawnee tribe angered god by being violentso he appeared from the sky to intervene and cast his judgment on them. Thisextract sounds just like many passages from the Bible. “The eastern sky lit upwith fire, growing ever brighter; everyone turned toward the brightened sky andstopped in their tracks…and suddenly there 'He' was among them!” He asked themif this was how they kept His commandments, insulting the Father. “I came toshield you from His anger, or lo, great wind would ignite the forest! And toashes would be consigned the Pawnee Nation!” We know from the events at Sodom,that these were not idle threats. God certainly had it in him to decimate apeople out of anger. Humans were taught it was the ‘wrath of god’.The “Algonquin of the Eastern Seaboard” say that they received their name forthe Dawn Light from the Pale One. The Algonquin remember him well and the timeof his arrival. The fleets coming down the river delivered him ceremoniously andhe was always greeted with flowers. The Chippewa also remember him very well“the pale Great Master”. He gave them medicine lodges with sacred symbols whichwere the signs and emblems from across the ocean. The Sioux tribe, say that hegave them their rite of baptism and purification. The following excerpt isvirtually identical to the way Jesus behaved in Palestine:“First to climb the mound was the Prophet. As over the horizon arose the firstgolden shafts of the Dawn Star, the Pale God spoke to the assembled nations. Itis said that He always charmed His listeners, but now there was almost abreathless silence. Indeed it seemed the very trees were listening and also theassembled animals of the forest, so softly He spoke and so well did they hearHim, because of the silence that had settled.”The legends about the Pale Prophet go on and on among the North Americannatives, but they continue further south into the land of the Toltecs. He wentto the Empire of Tula, the capital of the peaceful Toltecs. He also went to theWallapai tribe where he gathered the chiefs in a great counsel and redistributedtheir grain fields. He taught them advanced farming techniques with melons,squashes, pumpkins, mescal, and beans; he gave them many other plants which havebeen lost through the ages. This is an excerpt which was spoken by Marksman, anold Chippewa warrior at a council of native American tribes.“‘It is well tonight that we speak of the Pale God, and fitting as well that wecouncil with others, greeting our enemies as brothers, for such would have beenthe wish of the Prophet.’The last to speak at the council was a man from the Cheyenne and this is what hesaid: “Like our brothers we remember the Fair God who foretold the coming of theWhite Man. Yet so long ago was He living that like the Dacotah, our memories aregarbled.”Is it possible that Jesus travelled the world with his message? Is it possiblethat he was aided in doing so by the ‘Winged Feathered Serpent’ who appears inmost global mythologies? The evidence is there for all to see. After all, evenJesus himself spoke of his ‘sheep’ in distant lands.John 10:16“I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. Theytoo will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16 [../Text/toc.html#chapter16]STORY OF HUMANKIND [../Text/toc.html#chapter16a]Historians and archaeologists play a pivotal role in the way we perceive ourworld. They present us with a host of facts that shape our current beliefstructures, the way we imagine the World Wars, the Roman emperors, or thelanding on the moon; historians become the custodians and the story tellers ofwhat happened in the past. They wallow in the events surrounding the building ofthe pyramids and even describe the way the dinosaurs looked and behaved. Inessence, anything that happened before our own time of reference is described tous by experts who study those past events. Their versions of those ancient andprehistoric images flood our minds and in most cases, they are chiselled intoour sub-conscience as a direct consequence of how the past has been presented tous by the experts. If they get it wrong, we all get it wrong, and we neverreally know about it or question it. We expect the experts to tell us the wholetruth and nothing but the truth. It is unfortunate that very few people are evertold about the amount of speculation that goes on in these revered professions.All you have to do is take a history book from 50 years ago and compare it tothe way in which those historic events are presented in our present time. Youwill be fascinated to see how much they differ. The point is that history, asmuch as archaeology, is a living science and as we discover more, our objectiveviews of specific events change according to the importance of our discoveries.Scientists and leaders are equally guilty of shaping people’s ideas of thingsaround them. In most cases scientific discoveries are based on interim resultsbased on hypotheses, theories, speculation and faith in the eventual outcome, asmuch as theologians carry their blind faith towards their god. In the Dark Agespeople really believed that the world was flat. They feared for the lives of thebrave explorers as they set off into the great unknown, across the ocean, surelyto be devoured by the monsters which dwelled at the bottom of the edge of theworld. There are publications from our human past which speak of such things andyet today it would be laughable to reintroduce such theories. One hundred yearsago, people were told by leading scientists that man would never be able to fly.In 1903, when the Wright brothers were flying their first plane at Kitty Hawk,the leading physicist of the time refused to attend a demonstration as heproclaimed that “Man will never fly a heavier than air machine”. Such utteranceshad a great impact on the point of view of many ordinary people who took theirlead from the so-called experts of their times. In this instance it prompted thenews editor of the local paper to write an article which outlined the scientificfacts as presented by the eminent authority, which instantly turned theadventurers' attempts into a questionable pastime. It must have affected theWright brothers' development and possibly retarded their progress for all thatwe know. Even today, in times when anything should be deemed possible, somescientists are still guilty of killing new ideas based on their personalperspectives. Historians have been known to hide facts or new discoveries, andso have archaeologists, for all kinds of personal reasons. Governments have keptsecrets from their people for as long as Humankind has been on Earth, citing allkinds of silly reasons, of which the issue of national security is used as acommon excuse. Churches and other religious organisations have kept secrets fromtheir followers for reasons only they seem to be able to justify. Even sportsteams and their managers keep secrets from their fans in today's highlycompetitive sports industries. There is much to be said for the existence of amyriad of secret societies and yet with all their supposed power and influence,the world is perched on the verge of self-destruction. When we look at some ofthe great achievements of the past few thousand years, since we emerged as acivilised species from the caves and embarked on a path of rapid evolution, weconstantly stumble over the Dark Ages when all human knowledge seems to havedisappeared. We slowly re-emerged from those times like a new species,rediscovering knowledge, but somehow this knowledge has been around with ourancestors for thousands of years. But once again, historians and archaeologistsfall prey to their own insecurity. If they don't understand something, or if itdoes not fit into their frame of reference, it seems to get classified asfiction, esoteric, New-Age or mythological. These kind of actions have doneHumankind a great deal of damage when it comes to solving the problems of ourorigins. There are extremely smart people who have devoted large parts of theirlives to unravelling the murky waters of our ancient past, but their credibilityis continuously eroded by short-sighted ‘experts’ with a different personalagenda. These agendas can be so incredibly subtle that we don't even realise weare being manipulated into believing something which is not really so.I have two personal favourites which have tickled my fancy for many years. UFOsand the Pyramids. I have never seen a UFO or been abducted, or‘astral­-travelled’ or had weird extrasensory interactions with ‘aliens’, but Itry to keep a rational perspective on the whole matter. Let's put all thesightings and so-called abductions into one giant pot for one minute and imaginethat all of them are wrong. They all saw something else, they all experiencedsomething impossible, or they all just had a really vivid dream; all the hordesof people who have made these claims over centuries were all wrong… all exceptone. The one UFO which was not imaginary, but was real, puts a whole newperspective on the matter and suddenly makes it all very real. In the field ofstatistics, it is virtually impossible for every single person to have beenwrong or have simply imagined things. The statistical probability of such acoincidence is many millions to ‘one’. Even then, there is still the ‘one’. Andthat ‘one’can change our world dramatically if we just embrace this new realityand learn more about it. A close friend of mine made an interesting remarksaying that having an open mind is like being pregnant. Either you are, or youare not.My other favourite is the story of the Pyramids. I remember how impressed I wasas a child when I saw the detailed pictures of slaves dragging giant monoliths,one by one, to build the three greatest structures in the world, even by today'sstandards. The descriptions of exactly how they went about getting the rock,shaping it, building the ramps, putting them on sleighs and dragging them intoposition. All those slaves or families who made a living out of buildingpyramids were responsible for dragging 1,6 million giant rocks, up steep ramps,each weighing between 1,5 and 3,5 metric tons, carefully creating the passagesand inner chambers, all fitting so tightly that you cannot squeeze a blade ofgrass between them. To top it all, they covered these incredible structures withperfectly smoothed white limestone averaging 15 tons each, which had evengreater levels of accuracy in the joints. This would have taken thousands ofworkers at least 50 years to complete if they managed to fit 100 stones per day.And all of this, so that one Pharaoh could be buried in it? This impressed meimmensely when I was ten years old, but when I started to read a bit more aboutthese mystical structures, I realised there was much more to them than meets theeye, and that we were not so sure about who actually built the Great Pyramid,but we think it was King Khufu. From that day on I decided never to believeanything written by historians again, but rather inform myself about thesituation and formulate my own informed opinion. I would much rather have ourchildren at school be taught that we do not know who built the pyramids,allowing their minds to absorb the reality and formulate their own theories asthey grow and search for clues on their own. We have to stop making absolutestatements about the past which are built on fragments of speculative knowledgeby ‘experts’ with personal issues. The damage that has been caused overmillennia will take much undoing, to allow humans to free their minds and allowthemselves to think for themselves with the real knowledge that has been keptfrom them by authorities and especially the religious leaders, most of whom havebeen brainwashed to a large extent by their own lack of knowledge. Or could itbe that they have knowledge which they do not want to share with us? Thereligious and political fear in which most humans live is immense and will takecenturies to reverse. But we have to start somewhere. The many writers who havechallenged the conventional popular belief systems are growing in numbers andtheir readers are discovering new horizons of human knowledge in greater numbersevery day. As in all of history, only time will help shine the light on the realfacts surrounding our human origins.I embark on this somewhat ‘righteous’ bashing of the sciences for reasons of myown personal agenda. I developed an urge to share the information which I haveabsorbed over a 20-year period, with those in search of something light andjuicy to read. Not too scientific but meaty enough to stir the pot. I hope itwill motivate others to do their own scratching and discover new evidence thathas been buried beneath millennia of disinformation. It seems that now is thetime when more and more people are looking for new answers to the mystery of ourorigins. They are not satisfied with the diluted answers and the reasons and thereligious rhetoric they've been fed. They want to know what else is out there ofwhich they have been deprived. So when we talk about events which trulychallenge our personal beliefs, and when we propose new theories which shake thefoundation of popular establishments, we must rise above those insecurities andremind ourselves that things are not always what they seem. The popular exampleof two people looking at an object from two opposite sides comes to mind. Whatthe one sees, is totally different to what the other one sees. I need you tokeep this in mind as we embark on the last stretch of the road to discoveringour human origins.This chapter will take us on an epic journey of new discovery so fantastic thatour natural instinct would be to block it out. Since the 1970s when morescholars became attracted to the Sumerian translations of clay tablets pollutingthe basements of many museums of the world, a whole new wave of informationstarted to emerge. Suddenly we were exposed to a whole new civilisation thatpreceded all others, which spoke a different language and made references totimes before their own from where all their knowledge was derived. Once again,many conservative scholars have shown great restraint and the majority of bookswritten about those new finds have placed them safely under mythology orfiction. There has however been a growing number of authors who have identifiedthat there is much more to those stories from the ancient past than meets theeye. Erich von Daniken truly popularised the whole concept of ‘extra-terrestrialactivity’ on Earth in prehistoric times already in the 1960s with his Chariotsof the Gods allowing mankind to really start thinking about the many unexplainedphenomena of our past. He was followed by many other esteemed investigativewriters, scholars and authors who took his lead to greater heights. But it wasZecharia Sitchin who truly pushed the newly deciphered Sumerian cuneiform textto the greatest heights in his nine books dealing mainly with the content of theSumerian tablets and the eroded truth behind them. He has become one of theleading translators of the Sumerian language and he has presented evidence sovivid and compelling, that it is truly hard to contest. Much of this lastchapter and the story of humanity from the beginning of our time on Earth untilabout 2000 BC, comes from the many translated Sumerian tablets and some othertablets which have emerged since the '70s. It comes from linking the stories ofscattered ancient cultures to each other and recognising the common denominatorsthat all lead to one simple conclusion. A conclusion which is exposed to us overand over again, in thousands of translated clay tablets, stone carvings, seals,stelae, and other scriptures from many cultures, clearly shining a light on whowe really are, where we come from, and why we are here. This is after all, theone question which has crossed most humans' minds. These scriptures all have onething in common, and that is their references to the Sumerian gods who came fromdistant lands and gave the early humans all their knowledge. The story has beencaptured dramatically in The lost Book of Enki by Zecharia Sitchin, which is acompilation of cuneiform translations of Sumerian tablets over a period of some30 years. On many occasions, tablets found in different parts of Mesopotamiarefer to the same events giving us plenty of proof of their validity. It is nowtime to realise that we have gone way beyond speculation. We have accumulated acritical mass of evidence to start silencing the venomous critics andnarrow-minded disciples of mediocrity.The time has come to accept at face value that we are not the pinnacle ofcivilisation, that we are only now emerging from the cradle of knowledge, andthat we need to face the facts of our genetically created origins. The mostincredible part of it all is that GOD had nothing to with it, but the many godsof our distant past were the true masterminds and manipulators of our miseryhere on Earth. We must also come to terms with the fact that there are no‘aliens’ involved in this great new truth we must face. WE ARE THE ALIENS. Wewere created as a ‘primitive worker’ by astronauts from another planet and intheir image, some 450,000 years ago, to perform a necessary task on their newplanet. We have much of their DNA in our bodies and we look pretty much the waythey looked because they used their own DNA to create us. Part of the terribletruth that we have to come to terms with, is that humans are really an‘accidental by-product’ of an ancient colonisation of Earth by the Anunnaki fromNibiru. Humans came into existence for one reason only, to be the slavelabourers in gold mines and nothing more. The importance attached to ourexistence is one which we have created in our own minds over millennia ofignorance and evolution which were primarily guided by the oppressive control ofour creators. From the early beginnings humans saw their makers as ‘gods’ forobvious reasons, and not merely as more advanced beings. But as the dramaticevents unfolded on this newly settled planet, humans were slowly given moretasks to perform, edging their way into a permanent master-slave relationshipwith their maker. But the Anunnaki had their own problems to deal with on theirnew planet and they did not really spend too much time worrying about thewell-being of the new ‘primitive worker’. Our primary task was to work the goldmines and relieve the gods of all the hard labour. These first settlers on Earthhad a crucial task to perform for their leaders on their own planet, just likeour astronauts had on the many moon landings and trips to the InternationalSpace Station, Alpha. They had their own problems and differences and ‘wehumans’ were not really a priority to them. Humans were however an importanttool to help get the gold from the ground, but we certainly did not occupy muchof the Anunnaki's pastime. All of this will be revealed in great detail usingtranslations from ancient tablets.In the chapters leading up to this point, we have looked at our DNA and itsshortcomings, its absolute control over our physical and mental capabilities; westudied the human cell and questioned the fact that such a perfect organismeventually dies while it should realistically exist forever; we have exploredthe issue of slavery and our obsession with gold from the earliest times ofHumankind; we've travelled back in time to compare the evolutionary paths ofsome remotely related species to us; and we have even reintroduced the term‘panspermia’ into the vocabulary of readers, outlining the facts that lifeexists everywhere in the universe. Now that we have set the scene and hopefullyprovided enough food for thought to start questioning the anomalies of ourexistence, let us begin at the beginning. From the very first time when thefirst group of astronauts from another planet arrived on Earth and discoveredthat there was gold… the lifesaving metal which they were looking for in thesolar system.Coming to Earth from NibiruThe Sumerian tablets refer to it as the “Olden Times” when the Anunnaki firstcame to Earth; and the “Prior Times” when they were on Nibiru. Sitchintranslates:“ In the Olden Times the gods came to Earth and created the Earthlings. In thePrior Times, none of the gods was on the Earth, nor were the Earthlings yetfashioned. In the Prior Times, the abode of the gods was on their own planet;Nibiru is its name.”The tablets refer to the elliptical orbit of Nibiru as being ‘1 Shar’, whichequals 3 600 Earth years, it is also one of the reasons we have 360 degrees inour circles. Nibiru comes in close to the sun, crossing the paths of mostplanets up to Mars and the asteroid belt and then it shoots out into deep spacejust like many of the long-term comets which we get to see every few thousandyears. So we should not be surprised that astronomers could not find it in thesolar system because at its apogee (furthest point) it is possibly 3-5 times asfar as Pluto is from the sun. Nibiru's citizens were advanced in may ways andyet they seem to be on a different level from our current state of development.I would venture to say that our human rights legislation has surpassed theirapproach to the subject all those thousands of years ago. Nibiru was under therule of a king and we will see how it was all imposed on us, the new ‘earthling’species, in future years. But they had cracked the genetic code and had a clearunderstanding of how DNA could be manipulated. Their constant reference toimmortality makes it obvious that they had also conquered the genetic defectwhich causes ‘cell death’ and humans to die. Their planet was not free ofconflict and those characteristics arrived with them on the new planet calledEarth. There are many references about the various periods of their stay andthat is why we can calculate when the Anunnaki actually arrived on Earth. In TheLost Book of Enki it clearly states that the flood came in the “120th Shar”.“In the one hundred and twentieth Shar was the Deluge awaited. In the tenth Sharin the life age of Ziusudra was the Deluge forthcoming.”That would place the flood 432,000 years after their arrival. Scholars generallyagree that the Great Flood occurred around 11,000 BC, which would place thearrival of the Anunnaki on Earth some 443,000 years ago. It is important to keeptrack of the time references because they play a crucial role in supporting manyof the activities and developments of human origins and the creation of thefirst humans, Adam and Eve some 200,000 years ago. There was however a very goodreason why the ancient astronauts arrived here, it was not just some randomdecision of a bunch of distant astronauts. After what is described as a fiercebattle on Nibiru between an appointed king and a successor by birth, a truce wascalled.“The nation of the north against the nation of the south took up arms…A war longand fierce engulfed the planet…there was death and destruction both north andsouth…for many circuits desolation reigned the land; all life was diminished.”A time of unification, rebuilding and peace followed, where great cities anddevelopments engulfed the planet of Nibiru. There is a vivid description ofNibiru's atmosphere, explaining how the volcanoes constantly feed the thickatmosphere which protects them against the sun when at its closest point “…hotperiod it shields Nibiru from the Sun's scorching rays...” and “...in the coldperiod the inner heat of Nibiru it keeps about the planet like a warm coat...”We must remember that the planet moves away far from the sun for longer periodsthan when it is closer to the sun, it therefore needs a much denser protectivelayer to sustain a temperate climate for life. Not much different from our ownatmosphere but seemingly much thicker and more active. The planet is describedas a “radiant” planet with a “reddish hue”. “A red planet, reddish in radiance;around the sun an elongated circuit Nibiru makes.” While some planets absorbheat and energy, others radiate heat. Nibiru is such a planet. That is why itcan seemingly survive the long periods in deep space, before returning closer tothe sun every 3,000 years or so. It may take Nibiru as long as 600 years toorbit the sun in close proximity, as it makes its way out into deep space justlike a comet.But Nibiru was a troubled planet, its atmosphere was disturbed by some cosmicforce, which began to have a devastating effect on the lands, animals andpeople. The hardship hit everyone and started threatening the peace. The harshrays of the sun were destroying crops and arable land, making large partsuninhabitable. Nothing new to us on Earth in the 21st century? “In theatmosphere a breaching has occurred…Nibiru's air has thinner been made, theprotective shield has been diminished.”They tried all kinds of remedies to cure the growing gaping hole in theiratmosphere with little success. “In the land strife was abundant, food and waterwere not…in the land unity was gone; accusations were abundant.” We can alsorelate to the accusations and lack of unity in our own time, when we compare theway in which the world is disagreeing on the many issues threatening theenvironment, greenhouse effect and ozone depletion. Once again we stare bluntlyat the hereditary characteristics which were passed down to us by the Anunnaki.“Rains were withheld, winds blew harder; springs from the depths did not arise.”They called a council meeting and under the advice of some bright scientists,reached a decision to use gold in a fine powder form to be dispersed into theatmosphere and patch up the hole. “…to use a metal, gold was its name. On Nibiruit was rare; within the Hammered Bracelet it was abundant.”It's important to note that they called the asteroid belt outside of Mars, the“Hammered Bracelet”. It was known to them from the descriptions in the EnumaElish or the Epic of Creation that there was gold embedded in the many fragmentsof the asteroid belt. But would they be able to retrieve it? I trust that inyears to come we will rediscover the rich gold deposits on the asteroid beltwhich the Anunnaki knew about 500,000 years ago.“It was the only substance that to the finest powder could be ground; loftedhigh to heaven, suspended it could remain.” So while they sent out space shipsto obtain the gold, they also tried to activate the dormant volcanoes to start“belching” again. “With missiles the volcanoes to attack, their dormancy tobestir, their belching to increase.” But neither of these attempts worked whilethe planet was slowly slipping into an environmental disaster. The king of thetime was weak with little skill to make weighty decisions. Unhappiness andopposition grew against him until he was overthrown by Alalu, who took thethrone. It was then discovered that Alalu was actually the successor by law,because he was the son of the prior king and his concubine half-sister. This isincidentally where the Biblical succession laws were also derived from. Thechild of a man and his half-sister was first in line as successor, not the childof a man and his unrelated bride. We will see how the Anunnaki applied this ruleon Earth and passed it onto the Hebrews, Egyptians and other civilisations. Butbefore Alalu's reign could be ordained, a young prince by the name of Anupresented himself, claiming that he was the direct descendent of the great kingAn. They studied his ancestry and came to the conclusion that he was a puredescendent of An, and therefore by their laws of seed and succession Anu shouldbe king. After some more deliberation, it was finally decided that Alalu wouldremain king and Anu would be his ‘cupbearer’, in the interest of peace andstability. This was also a very early example of a coalition parliament.“Let us live in peace, together Nibiru to abundance return. Let me keep thethrone, let you keep the succession” said Alalu to Anu, and “in this mannerAlalu on the throne remained seated”.One of his first tasks was to find gold in the ‘Hammered Bracelet’so hedispatched “celestial boats to seek the gold” but space can be a cruel place,and the mission was a huge disaster. All the space ships which were dispatchedon a discovery mission were destroyed by the asteroids. “By the HammeredBracelet the boats were crushed…” After nine Shars on the throne and very littleprogress in the relief of the planet, Alalu was challenged by Anu. As advancedas the Nibiruans may have been in technology, they certainly had someinteresting customs. The ritual was that the two opponents had to meet eachother in hand-to-hand combat, all naked. That is the way it was written some 4500 years ago, and also where the Greeks obtained some of their culturalinfluences.“In the ninth Shar Anu gave battle to Alalu. To hand-to-hand combat, with bodiesnaked, Alalu he challenged…They grappled with each other in the public square…”As fate had it, Anu defeated Alalu and replaced him on the throne of Nibiru. Hehad great plans on how to save the planet's atmosphere from further destruction.Alalu was obviously distraught by the events so he planned a dramatic act tosomehow show his supremacy over Anu. He ‘stole’ one of the advanced space shipsand flew out towards the Hammered Bracelet. “…to the place of celestial chariotshe hurriedly went…into a missile throwing chariot Alalu climbed…the commander'sseat he occupied… That which-shows-the-way he lit up…the fire stones he stirredup; their hum like music was…Unbeknown to others, in the celestial boat Alalufrom Nibiru escaped.”His escape was like a final attempt to show that he was smarter, or worthy ofgetting some sort of hold over the people of Nibiru, and by some strange twistof fortune, he achieved just that. He set his course for Earth, expecting tofind gold there. But how would he have known that earth had an abundance ofgold? Once more we find amazingly sobering information in many of the tablets,with special reference to the Enuma Elish or Epic of Creation, well-know tohistorians. It is described in great detail as a “celestial battle” betweengods. In reality it was an observation from the planet Nibiru, of how a greatcelestial collision between planets and moons occurred in the past. This couldhave only been witnessed on one of Nibiru's close encounters when crossing thepaths of other planets while rounding the sun. For the sake of brevity, I willkeep this part of the story short, but you can get a detailed outline in theEpic of Creation.PLANET OF THE CROSSING[../Images/426-1.jpg]The planet Nibiru is often represented by these two crosses. One (left) tellingus that it was a planet of the crossing which crossed the orbits of otherplanets. The other symbol (right) shows that Nibiru was also a radiant planetradiating its own heat.This is a story that was written and captured in great detail on clay tablets.The observations are such, that it could only have happened by observing theevents from the planet Nibiru, which was at the centre of the collisions, butdid not actually collide with anything. Many millions of years ago, there wasMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Tiamat, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Pluto andNibiru, which came into contact with the other planets every 3,600 years. Thatis why the Sumerians called it the “planet of the crossing” as it crossed thepaths of most of the other planets. Tiamat was a big planet, several times thesize of Earth, orbiting where the asteroid belt is today. On one of her fatefulorbits, Nibiru came very close to Tiamat, so close that their moons actuallyengaged in several dramatic cosmic collisions. The book describes these verydramatically, so that it almost reads like a Greek tragedy, and for thosereasons it has been misinterpreted by many historians and astronomers. A largebody of scholars now realise that it actually describes the cosmic collisionsbetween Tiamat and her 11 moons, with Nibiru. From the transcripts we learn thatNibiru had seven moons, which “attacked” the helpless Tiamat, ripping into herbelly, shattering her body, and splitting her in two. “…into two parts he splither, her chest from her lower parts he separated.”The outcome of this ‘EPIC’ was that as the moons pounded the planet, theobservers could actually see the many compounds she was hiding. One of the mostabundant metals present was gold. “Her inner channels he cut apart her goldenveins he beheld with wonder.” These were the collisions on the way towards thesun, and it continued as Nibiru returned on its way back. As one of the bigmoons which the tablets call “North Wind” smashed into Tiamat, it dislodged thetop half of the planet which went flying into space towards the sun. Kingu,which was one of Tiamat's moons, followed the giant piece of the planet becauseof its momentum, before the large piece settled in its own orbit beyond Mars,capturing the smaller Kingu for ever as its moon. This is the price Kingu had topay for its destructive power, the tablets tell us. “Nibiru's Wind upon Tiamatthen hovered, sweeping upon her gushing waters… In a brilliance was Tiamat'supper part to a region unknown carried. With her the bound Kingu was alsoexiled, of the severed part a companion to be.”The rest of the planet Tiamat was destroyed and smashed into pieces which becameknown as the asteroid belt, or Hammered Bracelet, by the Sumerians. “With hismace the hinder part he smashed to bits and pieces, then strung them together asa band to form a Hammered Bracelet.”The other large piece and its new over-sized moon which were now in collectiveorbit around the sun, became known as the Earth and its moon. The Anunnakithrough the Sumerian tablets continued to refer to the moon as Kingu for ever.During these collisions, there was a lot of transfer of material and 'seeds oflife' between all the bodies, which explains why Earth inherited much of thesame life forms as Nibiru. It also became visible that the new planet Earth wasrich in gold as were the fragments of the asteroid belt. Furthermore it answersthe puzzling question of why the Earth's moon is so large, and why the Anunnakiknew about the gold on Earth. As time went by Earth stabilized throughgravitational and centrifugal forces, allowing life to develop and flourish. Bythe time the crisis on Nibiru started affecting the planet, life was wellevolved on Earth, but more importantly, the Nibiruans knew that Earth was richin gold. This is why Alalu set his course for the planet behind the HammeredBracelet. They had never managed to travel through the asteroid belt before, andfrom the tablets we gather that it was a very dangerous affair. As was describedearlier, none of the space ships which were sent to find gold there, returned.Alalu knew that if he found the precious metal on Earth, he could almost holdNibiru to ransom and make a number of demands. He would be seen as the saviourof his home planet. Alalu's journey is described so vividly that even 5,000years later, one can visualise the imagery described in the clay tablets. Ishould remind you that Sumerian tablets often refer to acquiring their knowledgeand information from other sources from the 'prior times' many thousands ofyears before the tablets were actually inscribed. We do not know whether thestories were transferred orally or if they were captured in some other way, butthe amount of information and detail is too complex to have been a mere oraltradition.“Riding like an eagle, Alalu the heavens scanned; below, Nibiru was a ball in avoidness hanging…He looked again, Nibiru's great ball turned into a smallfruit…The next time he looked, in the wide dark see Nibiru disappeared.”And so he travelled rapidly towards Earth. It describes his saddened heart, notknowing what to expect and if he was going to make it alive. It describes hisflight past all the planets as he approached and passed them from the outsidein, marvelling at their spectacle. It describes how he travelled past Saturn or“Anshar”, “…the foremost prince of the heavens…” with its “…bright rings ofdazzling colour (Saturn)…” Then Alalu travelled towards the giant “Kishar” orJupiter, with its “Swirling storms obscured its face, coloured spots they movedabout…” describing the giant red spot on Jupiter.It is incredible to witness these perfect descriptions in texts which are asmuch as 5,800 years old, and included Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, yet our ‘modern’civilisation only rediscovered these outermost three planets in the past 200years. But then suddenly Alalu was faced by the threatening asteroid belt. “TheHammered Bracelet ahead was reigning, to demolish it was awaiting…Of rock andboulders was it together hammered…” As he approached it, he recalled how theasteroids “…Nibiru's probing chariots like preying lions they devoured”. Butsomehow Alalu made it through the belt by using “death-dealing missiles” toblast a way through the belt. It would become a method of getting through thebelt for others who would come after him. “Like a spell the Hammered Bracelet adoorway to the king it opened” and so Alalu was on his way past the “red-brownplanet” of Mars before the “snow-hued Earth appeared, the seventh in thecelestial count.” He describes the three regions of the Earth, white at the topand bottom and blue and brown in the middle. The planet had a thinner atmospherethan Nibiru and a lesser gravity; “…weaker than Nibiru was its attracting net.”He used some sort of scanning device to search for signs of gold as he wasapproaching from a distance. “The beam that penetrates downwards he directed,Earth's innards to detect.” And there it was…the precious metal which was sodesperately needed to save Nibiru's disturbed atmosphere. “Gold, much gold, thebeam has indicated…” Alalu proceeded to land rather ruggedly but “Then he openedhis eyes and knew he was among the living. At the planet of gold he victoriouslyarrived.”After stepping out with his “Eagle's Helmet” he was amazed to find that the airwas good to breath and the protecting “Fish's suit” and helmet were notnecessary. It may sound like a great adventure when told in this ‘romanticised’fashion, but here was a brave individual alone on a new planet. That would scarethe bravest of adventurers into thinking again. “No sound there was…Alone on analien planet he stood…”MARS AND EARTH FROM SPACE[../Images/429-1.jpg]The polar ice cap is clearly visible on Mars (left) showing that the planetcontains water even today. The swirling clouds and deep blue colour of theoceans makes Earth (right) a very attractive planet for a space traveller.Alalu set himself up in the space ship to be able to survive the elements. Overthe next few days he explored the planet but not without protection. “He pickedup the carried weapon, he picked up the handy Sampler.” He describes the shortdays, the sweet smell of the trees, orchards of fruits, the marshes of greenwater, the dark-hued soil, and his search for drinking water. The salt water wasnot drinkable and filled with fish but finally he found fresh water in a “silentpond”, where he encountered a snake for the first time. He did not know what thecreature was, and it must have been the first creature he encountered on Earth,which motived the Anunnaki to use the symbol of a ‘snake’ in so manyapplications in years to come. He did not waste any time before searching forgold with his “tester”. He found an abundance of gold in the waters of the oceanand in the banks of the rivers. He urgently sent a message to Nibiru knowingthat he had found the solution to its problems. “The Speaker-of Words he stirredup…Then to Nibiru words he uttered…On another world I am, the gold of salvationI have found; The fate of Nibiru is in my hands…”Anu and the residents of Nibiru were astounded to hear that Alalu was alive andespecially intrigued by his claims about the gold. They were reminded by theoldest of their wise men, that Alalu had been taught about Tiamat with herprecious abundance of water and gold. It was old news to him. “Of the waterymonster Tiamat and her golden veins he knowledge acquired; if indeed beyond theHammered Bracelet he had journeyed, on Earth, the seventh planet is his asylum.”It caused lots of excitement and spurred them into action. This was the point atwhich the real decisions were taken to send a full expedition to Earth to verifythe claims of gold and establish a base. “If Tiamat's gold he indeed had found,proof of that is needed; is it for protecting our atmosphere sufficient?”The Nibiruans had an incredible ability to turn adversity into stability, anotable trait which we are still trying to master. But the DNA which weinherited from the Anunnaki will hopefully allow us to achieve this state ofmind. There are however encouraging signs of peacemaking which we as humans seemto be displaying in great abundance in the 20th and 21st centuries AD. Thebloodless revolution in South Africa and its 180 degree turnaround fromoppression to democracy is one such example and the ‘Orange’ revolution in theUkraine is another. On many occasions, as we will see, the Nibiruans diffusedconflict situations by simple decisions. It was however, the children of theAnunnaki who would be born on Earth in later years, who did not possess the samecharacteristics of tolerance and forgiveness as their parents did. It wasultimately their antagonism and greed which caused the constant conflict betweenthe gods and rubbed off on the slave species who began to emulate their mastergods.Alalu transmitted the proof of the gold find to Nibiru through a well-describedtechnological manoeuvre. “Of the Tester its crystal innards he removed, from theSampler its crystal heart he took out. Into the Speaker he the crystalsinserted, all the findings to transmit.” Everyone on Nibiru was astounded by theproof of gold, and started planning the mission to Earth. Ea (Enki) was KingAnu's first born, while Enlil was the second son, but by way of seed andsuccession, Enlil held higher rank because he was the son of Anu and hishalf-sister. After some serious deliberation it was decided that Ea and notEnlil would lead the first expedition to Earth because he was the betterscientist. They did a lot of research and preparation before they sent the shipoff. They planned the course… “A tablet of destinies for the mission he wasfashioning.”There are several references to the fact that they used water as a source ofpropulsion. Is it possible that they used the hydrogen in water way back then,in the same way we are starting to use it in the 21st century? “If water is theforce, where could it be replenished? Where on the chariot will it be stored,how the force will be converted?” They assembled 50 ‘heroes’ to embark on themission and they prepared the largest chariot for the journey, fitting it outwith all the necessary tools. The day of Ea's departure was very similar to thekind of farewell one sees at the NASA launches; many people gathered to see thelaunch. Ea was the last to embark but not before King Anu blessed him and badehim farewell. “Enlil with his half brother locked arms. Be blessed, besuccessful, to him he said.” This was a time when the brothers were friendly andvery little animosity existed between them. This would however change over theyears to come as they took control of Earth and began to disagree an variousissues. What I find incredibly sobering is the way in which the Anunnaki'sbehaviour resembled those of humans today. It feels that we have a lot more incommon with them in the 21st century than humans would have had at any time inthe past. It is mainly because our levels of competence, our scientificdiscoveries and medical exploits are almost parallel to what they engaged in allthose thousands of years ago. We are struggling to save our planet fromenvironmental disaster; we are exploring the other planets in our solar system;and we have almost mastered the science of genetic engineering. We have howevermoved on beyond kingships and monarchy, only to be replaced by a greed-basedcapitalist system which does not really promote equality and stability. Thegreed gene which I have mentioned on numerous occasions is clearly visible inour social structures. I wonder how the Nibiruans handled this issue of greedand social interaction? Are there more lessons we should be learning from them?The trip to Earth was not as pleasant as one would have wished for, but thedescriptions of the planets are equally astounding while they were on their wayventuring through the hazardous asteroid belt. This was obviously a huge hurdleto cross and only one person had done it successfully before. You can sense fromthe translations that they were certainly not at ease with the prospect ofcrossing the belt. “Beyond the fifth planet the Hammered Bracelet was lurking.”It took some doing and a concerted group effort to clear a path for the ship topass through the rocks in the belt. What is even more surprising, is thedescription of how they used water to disperse the rocks. They even describe howthe boulders were turning as they travel through space, a phenomenon which weonly discovered in recent times. “Toward the host of turning boulders thechariot was rushing… the word by Ea was given, with the force of a thousandheroes the stream of water was thrust.” This was an extremely inventivetechnique, pointing to the true genius of Ea the scientist. If he had usedexplosive weapons to blast his way through, there would have been a new threatof fragments hitting the space ship. By using the water thrusters in acontrolled succession, over and over again, they managed the clear a path in thebelt for the ship to pass unhindered. This sounds like science fiction and yetit comes from clay tablets thousands of years old. If that does not make youthink, nothing will. “And then at last the path was clear, unharmed the chariotcould continue.”All the ‘path-clearing action’ depleted their water supply and they were introuble. On their approach to the sixth planet which they called Lahmu, andwhich we call Mars, they saw the planet reflect the Sun's rays. They realisedthat there was water on Mars and proceeded to land on it to replenish theirsupplies. It is notable that they recorded that gravity on Mars was not asstrong as it would be on Earth later - another fact which the ancient Sumerianscould not have known. At this point in time Mars still had an atmosphere andthey describe the sight from space.“A sight to behold was Lahmu…many hued it was, snow white was its cap, snowwhite were its sandals…There is water on Lahmu, Ea was saying…The planet's netis not great, its pull is to handle easy…” They landed with ease on Mars for ashort pit stop, on the shores of a lake and while they were taking in water, Eamade all kinds of observations, recording them in his book of knowledge. Thewater was good for drinking but the air was insufficient for breathing, whichmeans they needed their “Eagle's helmets” to breathe.MARS[../Images/432-1.jpg] [../Images/432-2.jpg] Evidence of water erosion on Mars.Just one of thousand of examples showing that Mars had an abundance of flowingwater in the past. A clear photograph of the southern polar cap showing anabundance of water in a frozen from. The Sumerians already knew 5,000 years agothat Mars had water. How so?Soon they departed heading towards their destination, Earth. The manner in whichtheir flights are described suggests that they must have travelled at very highspeeds. It certainly seems that it did not take them much longer than a few daysor weeks to cover the long distance from Nibiru, and only a hop and a skip toreach Earth from Mars. We can do a simple calculation to confirm this line ofthinking. Most cars today can easily accelerate at 10 km/h every second. If ourrocket was to accelerate at 10 km/h every second, it would reach 36,000 km/h atthe end of the first hour. In ten hours it would reach 360,000 km/h and after 60hours of such constant acceleration we would be travelling at 2,16 million km/h.Mars is only 78 million km away from us, which means that at our maximum speedwe would take approximately (78/2,16) + 60 hours = 36 + 60 hours = 96 hours toreach Mars, which is exactly 4 days. I excluded the distance covered by thespace ship during the time of acceleration, but this should be negated by thetime and distance covered by the deceleration on approaching the planet.There are probably some oversights according to professional scientific circlesbut even if I missed the mark by 50% it would still only take us 8 days to reachMars at those speeds. So what is stopping us from doing this? I would hazard aguess to say that only time is the hurdle at present. Very soon these hurdleswill be overcome and we will be achieving much greater cosmic velocities.Ea and his team of 50 explorers approached Earth and the tablets point out tothe reader that they had to slow the ‘chariot’ down before descending or itwould perish in the friction of the atmosphere. More incredible knowledge ofspace travel which comes to us from tablets which are thousands of years old.“The chariot must be slowed or in Earth's thick atmosphere it shall perish...”said Anzu the pilot to Ea. They circled the planet a few times slowing the shipdown, before they entered the atmosphere hurtling towards the solid ground. Thegravity was playing havoc with their ship and they were still moving too fastfor a dry landing. “The Earth's pulling net too powerful for on dry land todescend…” To avoid any possible damage they splashed down in the sea where thePersian Gulf is today and opened the hatch. Alalu was waiting for them and maderadio contact as they arrived. “To Earth be welcomed.” They saw the other spacecraft from Nibiru at the edge of the water and knew they were in the rightplace. Their joy was immense as they swam and waded their way to dry land whereAlalu was awaiting them. “Alalu toward him came running; his son by marriage hepowerfully embraced. Welcome to a different planet! Alalu to Ea said.” This is amere extract of what has been written in cuneiform of the dramatic eventsleading up to the first group of settlers on planet Earth some 443,000 yearsago.ENKI STEPS OUT ONTO THE LAND[../Images/434-1.jpg]Sumerian seal depicting Lord Enki leaving the water and stepping onto the landfor the first time. Notice the streams of water from his shoulders symbolisingthat he was also the Lord of the waters. Also notice the winged deity withradiating beams from his shoulders awaiting Enki. This was his chief furnacemaster in the Abzu where the mining activity took place.And so we get to the point where the real prehistory of Humankind begins, longbefore the first ‘Adamu’ was created, during the “Prior Times” when only thebrave exploring astronauts were on this new planet Earth. They realised thattheir mission was one of life or death for their home planet Nibiru. “On a lifeor death mission we have come; in our hands is Nibiru's fate.” There was littletime to waste, and after sending a message to his father Anu back home, Eamobilised a number of different teams to perform various tasks. The place wherethey landed would later be called Eridu, “The home away from home” the firstcity on Earth. It was located in modern Iraq near where Basra is today, on thecoast of the Gulf. Over the next six days they performed miracles. They createda source for drinking water; they made bricks from clay to build theirsettlement; built a camp to live in; examined and recorded the edible fruit andtrees which grew in abundance everywhere; they experienced their firstthunderstorm on Earth with great trepidation; the rain and lightning and windwas fierce; they were amazed by the moonlight as it lit up the land and sky atnight, and they were even more puzzled by the very short days and nights.Furthermore they documented the creatures which were present everywhere, in thesky, on land and in the water. They made traps for fish and fowl; they builtboats to cover the waters with; and they put up fences around their camp forprotection against the fierce beasts they observed for the first time, and theyeven brought the “Beam That Kills” from the chariot to their new camp. This iswhere the historic events become very familiar, because on the 7th day Eagathered his comrades in the camp and suddenly the opening words of the Bibletake on a whole new meaning.“On the seventh day the heroes in the encampment were assembled, to them Easpoke these words: Ahazardous journey we have undertaken… At Earth with successwe arrived, much good we attained, an encampment we established. Let this day bea day of rest; the seventh day hereafter a day of resting always to be!”And then the settlers gave their new home a name. “Let this place henceforth bythe name Eridu be called, Home in the Faraway…” and their new planet was calledKi. Now that they had the base camp established and they had identified thefoods which they could eat, they did not waste any time before the goldextraction began. The first sources were the marshes, rivers and oceans. Themethod they used sounds similar to the ‘sucking’ method which is still usedtoday in the ocean beds to find diamonds. Remember that they were searching foralluvial gold and gold nuggets from any source. So they used “That Which WaterSucks” and “That Which Spits Out the Water” to pile up the mud and sort thecontent. At the end of the week they had all kinds of metals including iron andcopper, but gold was the least amount. “Of the gold the smallest pile wasaccumulated.”Ea was fascinated by the moon and its orbits, which prompted him to call onecircuit a month. “Month to its circuit he gave the name.” The work continued fora whole year but not enough gold was collected. While Nibiru was approaching thesun in its orbit, they wanted to transport the gold to Nibiru at its closestpoint. It was decided that they should wait for one more Shar (3600 years) untilthe orbit brought the planet back. They brought out the ‘Sky Chamber’ from thespace ship and prepared it for action. With this craft they would have to scanthe planet for new richer deposits of gold. They analysed the planet andidentified where the rich “veins of gold” were hiding. Then they travelled farand wide to scan the ground below. “In the sky chamber with Abgal did Ea upwardsoar, the Earth and its secrets to learn.” We are told how they flew overmountains and valleys and rivers and vast lands separated by oceans, making agood record of all their findings. Ea also used this opportunity to hide the“seven deadly weapons” from the chariot in a secret place in a faraway landwhich only he and his pilot knew about. They were not to be used or abused ontheir new home.Anu sent word to Ea that no matter what happened, they needed to ship whatevergold they had accumulated to Nibiru. It was essential that they tested the golddispersion technique which would repair their atmosphere. But on Earth, Alaluwho would take the gold back, was furious that Ea had removed the weapons fromthe space chariot. He was going to use them to blast his way through theasteroid belt. Ea explained that Abgal knew the way through the belt, as hesuccessfully created a path through it on the way in. He would pilot the chariotback to Nibiru.Rocket ship?[../Images/436-1.jpg]Could this be an ancient depiction of a rocket ship being filled with gold andprepared for take-off ? It is clear that parts of it are underground or in somesort of protective chamber.So they loaded the gold and prepared for the launch. “Into Alalu's chariotbasketfuls of gold were carried…The chariot's Great Cracker he enlivened… Thenthe chariot with a roar heavenward rose, to the heavens it ascended.” And thisis how the first ever shipment of gold left the newly colonised planet Earth.The trip back to Nibiru is described in great detail. How they use their‘crystals’ to locate the pathway through the Hammered Bracelet and we also get aclear picture of what Nibiru, the radiant planet, looks like when observed fromspace. “…in the darkness, in reddish hue glowed Nibiru; a sight to behold itwas.” There was great excitement on Nibiru about the arrival of their preciousgold, they were welcomed by large crowds as heroes returning from space, verysimilar to the kind of reception our astronauts received when they returned fromthe first moon landing. “A multitude of populace was there assembled.” The workstarted immediately to prepare the fine dust powder mixture which was going tobe dispersed into the atmosphere. The planned experiment turned out to be agreat success. But now they needed more gold…lots more, to deal with the fullextent of the atmospheric damage. “With rockets was the dust heavenward carried,by crystal's beams was it dispersed. Where there was a breach, now there washealing.” They informed the settlers on Earth about their success, which causedmuch happiness. But the 'healing' did not last long before it was dissipated bythe rays of the sun on its approach. The chariot was assembled and returned toEarth with more explorers and more equipment to speed up the work. But afteranother whole Shar, they only collected a small amount, not enough for Nibiru'sgrowing problems. Once again Ea traversed the planet searching for signs of goldbut the signals he received all pointed in one direction, to the southern partsof the planet, where the gold was mixed with ore underground. “Again and againthere was the same indication…Where the landmass the shape of a heart was given,in the lower parts thereof, golden veins from Earth's innards were abundant.”It was at this point that they had to come up with new methods and technology toseparate the gold from the rock and it also very clearly indicated that thesouthern part of Africa was the place where this gold operation was about totake place. Anu sent word giving instruction to obtain the gold “…from theveins, not from the waters, the gold must be gotten.” In the meantime theyrealised that Ea would need help and guidance with the task, so his brotherEnlil was dispatched to join him and help with the management and command. Onceagain they surveyed the lands and saw the rich gold deposits in southern Africa.They called this part of the world 'Abzu', but the extraction from the rockwould be more difficult. “Let Anu come to Earth, let him decisions provide…”said Enlil to his brother. The decisions which needed to be made were crucialfor the future success of the operation and would also play a pivotal role inthe relationship between the royal brothers Ea and Enlil. If the activity was totake place in a faraway land, they would need to divide tasks andresponsibilities. Someone had to oversee the base camp in the north at Eridu,and the other had to oversee the mining activity in the south at Abzu. Thesewere the decisions which Anu needed to make. Once again the Nibiruans surpriseus with their simplistic ways of solving complex problems. After Anu arrived andwas shown the vastness of the proposed operation he offered a solution. Theydrew lots to determine who would perform which task, a custom which the heroesof the Bible inherited. And so it was decided that Enlil would remain in Eriduand prepare the landing sites to handle higher traffic of space ships to carryloads of gold and ensure that the necessary infrastructure was in place tosupport such activity. Ea would establish the mining operations with its owncontrol centre in the south, and devise new tools and methods to maximise theextraction process. At this point however there were already signs of frictionbetween the brothers. Ea felt that since he was the first on Earth, the one whohad established the entire place to this point, he wanted to stay at Eridu andestablish the Edin, which would become the lavish home of the “Upright Ones”. Hewanted Enlil to look after the mining in the south. “Let it the Edin be, abodefor the Upright Ones, by this name be known. The commander of Edin let me be,let Enlil the gold extraction perform.” Enlil felt that he was the bettercommander with a superior knowledge of chariots and sky ships and ports, whileEa was the scientist and engineer who would be more successful at mining tasks.The wise Anu realised that any decision would result in unhappiness so thedrawing of lots decided their fate. Ea was sad but accepted his task honourably,Enlil was satisfied and ready to start developing the space ports and commandcentre. To reward Ea for his pioneering work, Anu pronounced that he wouldalways be known as Enki, the “Earth's Master” from that moment on; and Enlilwould be known as “Lord of the Command”. And so were the responsibilities andtitles allocated to the brothers on a distant planet, called Earth.[../Images/438-1.jpg]But before Anu departed, Alalu challenged him for the throne once again. Theyengaged in a wrestling match once more, and once again Anu was victorious. Butin his anger Alalu lashed out at the crotch of Anu who was standing over him,and in a rage of fury he bit off his testicles. This was a blow for stability onthis new space colony and after deliberation and contemplation, it was decidednot to execute Alalu, but to banish him to Lahmu (Mars), to spend his time therealone. And so it was done. But Anzu, the talented pilot, volunteered to takeAlalu down to the surface of Mars in the sky chamber and chose to stay with himuntil his sickness ‘devoured’ him. There was apparently something in the ‘flesh’of others that killed anyone who consumed it. Could this have been an advancedgenetic manifestation which becomes active as the DNA evolves and we movefarther away from primitive species who may have practiced cannibalism at somestage in their past? Whatever the correct diagnosis is, it was Alalu's fate todie as a result of swallowing the testicles of Anu during their hand-to-handstruggle.The mining and shipping preparations went on with purpose on Earth. They planneda way station on Mars. You may immediately ask why, but the answer is quiteingenious and practical, once again pointing to the knowledge of space traveland the solar system of those early astronauts. At present we have the abilityto take about seven people into space. Any more than that starts to require muchgreater thrust and technology mainly because of the added weight and the effectof gravity. The gravity on Mars is only about 38% of that on Earth. By sendingregular smaller shipments to Mars, they would be able to send fewer but muchlarger shipments from there to Nibiru. Asimple and practical solution.Enki (Ea) designed a new range of tools and equipment needed for the miningoperation and beamed the designs to Nibiru to be manufactured. “An Earthsplitter with cleverness Enki designed… ‘That which crunches’ and ‘That whichcrushes’ he also designed on Nibiru for Abzu to be fashioned.” We also learnfrom the texts that Earth was too hot for some of the Anunnaki, suggesting thatNibiru had a more temperate climate with the sunshine not nearly as harsh, evenwhen the planet came in close to the Sun on its orbit. The Sumerian symbol forNibiru is a 'radiating cross' like a 'plus' sign, which indicates that it is notonly the planet of the crossing, but also a radiating planet which radiates itsown heat and energy. The sun is not really required. Several of the otherplanets in our solar system also radiate heat and energy but they are obviouslynot suitable for life. This extra heat on Earth caused Enlil to seek coolerparts of the world for himself. “Enlil by the heat of the Sun afflicted, for aplace of coolness and shade was searching. To snow-covered mountains on theEdin's north side he took a liking.” There in the middle of the cedar mountains,is where he set up his own home and started to build the new landing site fortheir space ships. Was this the historic Cedar forest in north-east Lebanon?Where Baalbek is situated?We learn of their technology to excavate and cut rocks to perfect size withtools not yet known to humans today. It explains the speed and precision withwhich they could build giant structures which would include all of the greatpyramids and temples in years to come, in Egypt and in the Americas. “Above themountain valley with power beams the surface he flattened. Great stones from thehillside the heroes quarried and to size cut. To uphold the platform with skyships they carried and emplaced them.” They indicated from the very firstbuilding activities that they liked massive sturdy structures built mainly fromstone, which would last forever. Quite different from the architecture of today.It clearly explains where the ancient civilisations got their influence andtheir knowledge to build the colossal monuments of the past. “With satisfactiondid Enlil the handiwork consider…a structure of everlasting.” Could it be thehitherto unexplained ancient platform ruins at Baalbek? It certainly sounds likeit. It was so impressive, not even the ancient Romans knew its purpose, but theyused the giant 1000 ton megaliths as a base to build their Temple of Jupiter.[../Images/440-1.jpg]This 1200 ton megalith was left behind by the original builders of the 9-hectareplatform at Baalbek. It has not been moved to date because of its sheer size.Notice the two people, one sitting on top and one beside it, being dwarfed bythe giant stone.[../Images/440-2.jpg][../Images/440-3.jpg]The giant megalithic structure at Baalbek which served as a landing platform forthe celestial ships of the Anunnaki, survived the flood and became theinspiration for the pyramids. Thousands of years later the Romans used thisplatform to build the Temple of Jupiter.[../Images/441-1.jpg]A view of the Temple of Jupiter showing the megalithic platform upon which itwas built by the Romans, thousands of years after it was originally constructedby the Anunnaki under the guidance of Enlil.Back on Nibiru, they were ready to send the next celestial chariot to Earthfilled with supplies and tools. They had also lined up a fresh group of 50additional pioneers, among whom were female nurses and Ninmah, who was Enki andEnlil's half sister. She was a medical expert with the knowledge to resuscitatepeople from the dead. We will find a number of specific occasions, when in timeto come the Anunnaki would revive individuals back to life. Part of theirmission was to stop over on Lahmu (Mars) and set up a way station for rocketships from Earth to deliver regular loads of gold to. It's fascinating to noticethe distinct references the Nibiruans made to Celestial Ships, Rocket Ships andSky Chambers. The first seemed to be much larger, used for long distancesbetween Nibiru and Earth; while the second was smaller and used on shortertrips, like those to Mars; and the Sky Chamber was seemingly used to travelaround the world and to descend from the large Celestial Ship to the surface ofa planet.[../Images/441-2.jpg]Sunset on MarsThe sunset on Mars is reminiscent of a sunset on Earth. When the planet had anatmosphere and running water, it must have been a beautiful place in our solarsystem, for astronauts to spend time on.By the time they reached Mars, and descended to the same spot next to the lakewhere Ea had landed before, they found Anzu, dead. This is the first time we arereally exposed to the scientific or medical knowledge of the Anunnaki. Ninmahperforms a variety of procedures to revive Anzu and for the first time wewitness a dead person being brought back to life. “From her pouch she took outthe Pulser; upon Anzu's heart pulsing she directed…she took out the Emitter, itscrystals' life giving emissions on his body she directed.” Ninmah repeated thisseveral times after which Anzu opened his eyes.[../Images/442-1.jpg]Exploring MarsIf this picture of the Mars Explorer digging into a rock on Mars was shown topeople 50 years ago they would not have believed it. Today we accept this kindof achievement without giving it a second thought. Nothing seems to surprise usanymore. Are we following in the footsteps of our “maker” on Mars? Will we findevidence on Mars that will take us by surprise?We are also exposed for the first time to the “Food of Life” and the “Water ofLife”, which she placed in his mouth and on his lips. Once revived, Anzu relatedto them the events which led to the death of Alalu and how he placed him in acave.I have often wondered if NASA knows something we don't, and if they are actuallykeeping something from us with regard to signs of intelligent life on Mars.Because the Anunnaki certainly spent many thousands of years there and must haveleft behind visible signs of their presence. The Sumerian texts tell us a lotabout their activity on the planet. Starting with the death of Alalu, whose bodywas placed in a cave by Anzu and Ninmah. Will NASA find the skeletal remains ofan ancient astronaut in a cave on Mars? Anzu described what he did with Alalu'sbody: “In the great rock a cave I found, Alalu's corpse therein I hid.” Theyalso carved a giant image of Alalu on the face of the great rock with their“beams”. Has NASA already found this image, or will this yet surprise them inthe future? Are the mysterious pyramids and 'Face on Mars' more clues leftbehind by the Anunnaki and Igigi on Mars some 400,000 years ago?The tablets tell us that twenty of the explorers were dropped off on Mars to setup the base under the command of Anzu, who was declared their commander byNinmah, as requested by her father Anu. She explained that Mars would become avery important stop for the gold from Earth, and that Anzu would be in commandof hundreds of men in time. One of the things which Ninmah brought to Earth werethe mysterious seeds of a bush which would grow juicy fruits while its elixirwould give the Anunnaki strength, cure disease and keep their mood happy. “Theirailments it will chase away, happier their mood it shall make.” Could this planthave had something to do with the Soma plant which the Vedic poems refer toconstantly as a life-giving ‘elixir’ many thousands of years ago?Ninmah revealed to Enlil that she bore them a son called Ninurta and they agreedto bring him to Earth. Because he was the offspring of half-siblings, he wouldbe highest on the list of succession. In the meantime the space ships keptarriving with more ‘heroes’ from Nibiru to help speed up the extraction of gold.Enlil unveiled his master plan to build five cities in the Edin away from Eridu,which would include a command post at Laarsa; its twin city called Lagash; on aline extended between the two he would build Shurubak, the 'Heaven City' and “Onthe centre line it shall be located, to the fourth city it shall beleading”…called Nibru-ki. “A bond Heaven-Earth in it I shall establish.” We canstart identifying the Sumerian language in these names e.g. Nibru referred toheaven, while Ki referred to Earth. But Enlil's plans were even more elaborate.Beyond the 5th city he wanted to build a “chariot place” to allow ships to comedirectly and freely between Earth and Nibiru. He was not a big fan of thestation on Mars from which the main shipping would take place.At the southern tip of Africa, Enki was building his base to manage the miningoperations in what they called the Abzu. He measured and surveyed the whole landand even referred to what must have been the Zambezi river. “… great riversthere rapidly flowed. An abode by the flowing waters Enki for himselfestablished.” He established a place for his house and where the 'heroes' wouldlive and “where the bowels of the Earth to enter… Place of deepness hedetermined, for the heroes into Earth's bowels to descend.” Could his domain inthe Abzu have been the mysterious Great Zimbabwe ruins? The descriptions fit itvery well. So far nobody has been able to explain its origins, but the Sumeriantablets certainly give us something to think about.And so Enlil commanded the ‘upper world’ which included Edin and the spaceports, while Enki was in charge of the ‘lower world’ or Abzu, never to beconfused with Hell. This was where the precious gold was obtained which broughtthe Anunnaki to this planet in the first place. On one specific day, Anuaddressed all the settlers who departed from Nibiru. There were 600 ‘people’ onEarth and 300 on Mars, who listened to their King as he praised them. Anu toldthem that the fate of Nibiru was in their hands and it was at this point thatthey were given their lofty names. “Those on Earth are shall as Anunnaki beknown, Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came” and “Those who on Lahmu are, Igigishall be named, Those Who Observe and See”. During the rise of Egypt in lateryears the Igigi would be known as the “watchers” or Neteru, many of whom wouldproduce offspring who became pharaohs. They would also play a crucial role increating the Aryan civilisation by intermarrying ‘earthling’ females. Anu urgedthem to do what they could and deliver as much gold as was possible. Everythingwas in place and ready to begin the mining and the shipments. “Let the goldstart coming, let Nibiru be saved,” Anu instructed them.The fascinating thing is that the Anunnaki never spoke about marriage, theyreferred to it as ‘espousal’ which was the process of acquiring a permanentspouse to procreate with. Enlil and Enki were no different. Now that they wereon this new planet and destined to stay there for a while, they also found theirown spouses, but not before both of them had sex with their half-sister Ninmahin an attempt to produce a male offspring who would be eligible for leadershipthrough his preferred bloodline. Enki took Ninmah, his beautiful half-sister tothe Abzu with him where he tried and tried, but she only bore daughters. BeforeEnki came to Earth, he espoused a young princess whose name was Damkina, but sheremained on Nibiru, and gave birth to a son called Marduk. ‘One in a pure placeborn’ was the meaning of his name, Enki's firstborn son, destined for greatnesshere on Earth. The mother and child only arrived on Earth much later to joinEnki. They had an interesting custom to change the names of their female spousesto resemble those of the man. Enki's spouse became Ninki. Is it possible thatthis was the custom which we have passed down through the ages and still use invarious ways today? Also wanting a son to be of Earth descent, Enlil seduced ayoung girl who eventually became his spouse, by the name of Sud. She bore him ason called Nannar (Sin), who was the first of the Anunnaki to be conceived andborn on Earth. Sud also changed her name to resemble that of her male spouse andbecame known as Ninlil.Other than Marduk, who was his firstborn by his half-sister, Enki had five sonsfrom his spouse Ninki and other concubines. They were Nergal, Gibil, Ninagal,Ningishzidda and Dumuzi, the youngest. Enlil's sons were Ninurta, the oldest,Nannar and Ishkur. And so the dynasty of the Anunnaki gods on Earth expanded andthe complexity of their social structure grew like a cancer. This involved thehard labour which had to be performed in the mines of the Abzu; the transportingof the gold to the space ports of the Edin; and the regular shipments to Mars(Lahmu) where the smaller base of 300 Igigi orchestrated the larger shipments tothe distant Nibiru. “From the planet Lahmu in celestial chariots was theprecious metal to Nibiru brought.”In the past few decades a number of leading scientists have proposed how wecould deal with the dwindling ozone problem on Earth. Several theories and manyideas have been bounced around. I distinctly remember reading articles whichexplained how we could disperse certain substances into the upper atmosphere tocreate an artificial layer, which would create a similar effect to the ozone,protecting us from the harmful rays of the Sun. This is exactly what theNibiruans did with great success some 440,000 years ago on their own planet. “OnNibiru was the gold to the finest dust fashioned, to protect the atmosphere itwas employed.” And from the ancient scriptures we can clearly see that theirapproach was working. “Slowly was the breach in the heavens healing, slowly wasNibiru saved.”After Enlil completed his colossal space command at Nibru-ki, he protected itwith some sort of deadly weapon. “From there beams were raised, the heart of allthe land they could search…its net unwanted approach impossible made.” Thissounds like the kind of protection allocated to the most advanced US militarybase, not what we would expect to read on a clay tablet from 2500 BC. TheAnunnaki had a number of very mysterious technological items, which we cannotfully understand, even from reading all their translations. One such item waswhat they called the “ME” or “The Tablets of Destinies”. These contained all thesecret formulas and information which basically dealt with all their knowledge.As if it was some sort of advanced computer system which could calculate andcompute any problem and provide a solution. They kept this ME in the newsafe-house from where Enlil could control all activity in the Upper World. “Withthem Enlil comings and goings oversaw.”But as time went by, the Anunnaki who worked in the Abzu, extracting the goldfrom the mines, began to complain of the hard work they were being subjected to.The short days and years on Earth somehow also affected them. So the workingAnunnaki were constantly being replaced by a new fresh group from Nibiru whilethe exhausted group was allowed to return home. But the Igigi on Mars were evenmore restless. Anzu, their leader “…to Earth from the heavens descended” todeliver the complaints of the Igigi. They wanted a resting place of their own onEarth. Enlil tried to pacify Anzu and showed him the full extent of the globaloperations. From the mines in the Abzu to the ports in Edin, and even the secretME which was in the hallowed chamber in Nibru-ki. But Anzu was not impressed andhe plotted against Enlil. When the moment presented itself Anzu stole the ME andescaped to the space port where other Igigi awaited him to stage a mutiny andtake over the Earth. With those ME tablets of destiny, they were basicallyinvincible. But the oldest son of Enlil, Ninurta offered to capture therebellious Anzu. A dramatic aerial battle followed between the two, and with theadvice and experience of Enki, Ninurta captured the unlucky rebel. The ME wasreturned and Anzu was executed. Marduk was ordered to return his body to Lahmuand lay him to rest there as he was the commander of that planet. This was alsothe point at which Marduk was appointed as the new interim commander of Mars andasked to stay there and oversee the operations. But he was to also look aftertheir well-being and to lift their spirits.We know exactly when all of this occurred because the clay tablets tell us. “Inthe 25th Shar Anzu was judged and executed.” This means that it was 90,000 yearsafter the first arrival on Earth, which translates to about 353,000 years agofrom present time. It became evident that the Anunnaki workers were kept onEarth for too long. They needed to be replaced more frequently. It was the youngNinurta who came up with a smart plan. Once again we see that their logic,actions and response to situations are so very similar to how we deal withproblems today. It is truly uncanny. He proposed to build a “Metal City” wherethey could smelt the gold to more refined levels. This would allow them to sendlesser volumes of gold to Nibiru, and allow Anunnaki to travel back while beingreplaced by new workers. And so it was adopted. In the Edin they built the citywhere metal would be smelted and refined and they called it Bad-Tibira the“Metal City”, making Ninurta its first commander. “The flow of gold to Nibiruwas thereby eased and quickened.” And so the arrival of fresh Anunnaki fromNibiru continued while the shipments of pure gold kept going out, helping torestore their atmosphere.Meanwhile, Enki was not paying attention to the growing unhappiness among theminers in the Abzu. He was preoccupied with the creatures that lived in thewilds and he also spent much time in his laboratory working with ME formulas ona number of projects. “In the Abzu by the gushing waters, a wondrous study placehe erected, with all manner of tools and equipment he furnished it.” Then Enkiinvolved his talented son Ningishzidda to work in the lab with him while theyused the sacred ME to unravel new theories. “The house of life he called theplace…Sacred formulas, tiny ME's, the secrets of life and death possessing theyshaped.” It is evident from these texts that the two scientists were involved insome kind of genetic engineering programme, specifically to unravel the secretof life and death of the Earthly creatures which they were studying. These werethe experiments which eventually led to the creation of ‘Adamu’. The tabletsdescribe how Enki was fascinated with a specific creature which lived among thetrees and in the savannah. “They lived among the tall trees, their front legs ashands they were using.” This is the first description of a Homo erectus specieson Earth. “In the tall grasses of the steppes odd creatures were seen; erectthey seemed to be walking.” A remarkable entry in clay of new discoveries fromsome 350,000 years ago, and not long before Homo sapiens made its appearance onEarth. This fascination with the wildlife on Earth, and not enough attention tothe gripes of the miners, finally caused the uprising. Enlil arrived in the Abzuto help resolve the problems, but the workers had had enough. They set fire totheir tools, they surrounded Enlil's house and would not budge. “The Anunnakistood together: Every one of us hostilities has declared! Excessive is our toil,our work is heavy, great is the distress.” The situation was so tense that evenAnu was called via some advanced communication device to give advice. Enkiexplained to him that “the lamentation is heavy…every day the complaints wecould hear.” But Anu was steadfast in his pronouncement as he made it clear that“the gold must be obtained…the work must continue”. After all, their survival onNibiru depended on it. It is also fascinating that they make mention of globalwarming 350,000 years before we regurgitated it again. The talk about “Eversince Earth's heat has been rising, the toil is excruciating…” is a precursor ofthe looming melting of the poles and the coming end of the Ice Age which wouldcause great calamity on Earth. So they began to negotiate and explored variouspossible solutions. Maybe they should send the tired Anunnaki back home; maybeEnki could devise new tools that were more efficient; it seemed that there wasno real solution to the serious problem; and then came the pivotal moment in allof human history. Enki consulted with his son Ningishzidda, before they proudlypresented their proposal. “Let us create a Lulu, a Primitive Worker, thehardship work to take over…Let the Being the toil of the Anunnaki carry on hisback.”The rest of the gathering was astounded. They had never heard anything like thisbefore, but they were also unaware of the experiments which Enki and his son hadbeen performing. They did not believe that a being could be created out of‘nothing’ and even the wise Ninmah, their sister made a statement which would bewelcomed by the Darwinians amongst us. She explained that evolution was theforce behind new species. “One being from another over aeons did develop, nonefrom nothing ever came.” Unfortunately, the rest of that statement is a bit of ablow for the religious creationists, because the creation is about to come in away very few religious folk would have believed. It does however deal with theage-old dilemma that we were created in the 'image of our maker'. Enki wasclearly very happy with himself at this point as he agreed with his sister, thatyou need a prototype to mould into something else. He proudly announced to them:“The being that we need, it already exists. All that we have to do is put on itthe mark of our essence…A primitive worker shall be created.” This was a firmdeclaration that they had knowledge of genetics and cloning. He explainedfurther “…they walk erect on two legs…Their forelegs they use as arms, withhands they are provided…They know not dressing in garments…Shaggy with hair istheir whole body…With gazelle they jostle, with teeming creatures in the waterthey delight.” One cannot wish for a more vivid description of Homo erectus. Itfeels as if we have been plunged into the middle of a Jules Verne novel, andyet, these words are the result of a scribe some 4,500 years ago.Enki demanded that a decision be made, so that he could proceed with theblessing of all. That would however prove to be much more complex than one wouldhave expected under their present conditions. At this point we are also exposedto the moral dilemma which suddenly faced the Anunnaki about creating anotherliving creature, a new species, and a ‘slave’ to them, which was strictlyprohibited according to their exploration charter. They were not allowed tocreate new living species on other planets. Enki took all of those present on atrip through his “House of Life” where some of these creatures were kept incages. They jumped at the passers-by, banging their fists on the bars. “Theywere grunting and snorting, no words were they speaking.” Everyone was astoundedby this sight. There were male and female creatures and they procreated “…likeus from Nibiru coming.” Enki was very excited by the prospects of this newcreature, his maverick scientist characteristics were unashamedly exposed.“A primitive worker shall be created. Our command will he understand…Our toolshe will handle…To the Anunnaki in the Abzu relief shall come.”Enlil was strongly opposed to this idea, and for the first time we hear theAnunnaki refer to the ‘all mighty GOD’ as Enlil says: “Creation in the hands ofthe Father of All Beginning alone is held.” These words should sound veryfamiliar to those who have been following the controversy surrounding thecloning issue in the 21st century. There is so much opposition to proposedcloning of embryos; stem cell therapy; and the cloning of humans has beenprohibited by most nations. And yet, in the USA the first Pet Cloning companyhas already opened its doors, to clone people's dead pets. If you ask me, thereis a lot of ignorance surrounding all of these issues and politicians shouldkeep their noses out of it today, just like Enlil should have done 250,000 yearsago. Ultimately it would be Enlil's inability to come to terms with this newlycreated 'slave species' which led to the conflict between the brothers, theoppression of the humans, and the disinformation campaign that was imposed bythe vengeful Enlil in an attempt to keep the slave species primitive, ignorant,obedient, fearful and in its place.But before they allowed Enki to proceed with the ‘creation’, there was muchdeliberation whether GOD would have given them such knowledge, if GOD did notwant them to use it to their advantage. Does that sound familiar? “Let us withwisdom new tools fashion, not new beings create” was the one side of theargument. “What knowledge we possess, its use cannot be prevented” Ningishziddathe young scientist answered. They even contemplated very deep and spiritualissues like “Is it destiny…or is it Fate?...That to this planet us has brought…”It was decided to put this matter before the elders from Nibiru and so it wasdecreed that a “primitive worker” would be created. And so began the arduoustask of cloning the first humans by Enki, his very smart sister Ninmah, and hisson the scientist, Ningishzidda, who would lead the team. What followed was likesomething from a horror movie, and yet our ancient 'prehistory' is filled withimages of such creatures. Ningishzidda showed Ninmah the results of manyexperiments he had been conducting in secrecy. Among the trees to “…a place ofcages” he took her. There were the living results of various cloning andcross-species experiments he had performed, with horrific outcomes. “Forepartsof one kind they had, hindparts of another creature they possessed…Creatures oftwo kinds by their essence combined” he showed her.The creation of the slave species did not happen overnight, it took the team along time and many failed attempts to finally achieve the perfect geneticcombination. One can feel their frustration and desperation as one attempt afteranother failed. They used the female creatures as the surrogate mothers, placinga fertilised egg into their womb. The results were not good. This is where weread about DNA splicing for the first time in human history. “The two entwinedstrands separate and combine an offspring to fashion.” Many times they tried,while constantly aware that they could only use a small portion of the Anunnaki‘essence’ to keep the new being primitive. “To receive our essence ingraduation…Nibiru's essence only bit by bit could be attempted.”Ninmah prepared the “admixture” or fertilised egg in a ‘crystal vessel’ beforeinserting it into the female creature. The following text could have been takenfrom a modern day scientific magazine, describing artificial impregnation. Andyet once again these astounding words are thousands of years old, eternallycaptured in clay tablets.“In a crystal vessel Ninmah the admixture was preparing, the oval of a femaletwo-legged she gently placed…With ME Anunnaki seed containing, she the ovalimpregnated…The oval back into the womb of the two-legged female she inserted.”What more do we need to hear to be convinced that the Anunnaki knew exactly whatthey were doing, and that they were indeed performing not only genetic splicingbut artificial insemination into surrogate females? But it took many attemptsand many modifications to the “admixture” to get the results they wanted. Timeand time again offspring were born deformed, deaf, hairy, short arms, blind, andother defects. It is also evident that they were creating only males.“One being had paralysed feet, another his semen was dripping, one had tremblinghands, a malfunctioning liver had another…one had lungs for breathing unsuited.”Enki and his colleagues were highly disappointed but they kept on trying newways to perfect the ‘primitive being’ till finally a being was born “In herhands she held the child…it was the image of perfection.” But their excitementwas not long lived. After several years they realised that the child did nothave the ability to speak, its animal genetics were stronger than its humanside. “Of speaking he had no understanding, grunts and snorts were hisutterings.” It was Enki who made the observation that they have only beenimpregnating the ‘two-legged’ Earth females. He suggested that they insert thefertilised egg into an Anunnaki womb. This caused a long debate about who wouldbe the carrier of the baby, but it was finally decided that Ninmah should be thecarrier and risk any danger, since it was her project. “The fertilized egg intothe womb of Ninmah was inserted; there was conception.” The gestation period wasan interesting experience. It seems to have taken longer than the other‘two-legged’ females but shorter than on Nibiru for the birth to occur. Andfinally they achieved what they had set out to do and Enki was elated. “…Theimage of perfection he was…He slapped the newborn on his hindparts, the newbornuttered proper sounds.” I suppose it should be quite simple to distinguish ahuman baby from other species, the baby cries when you slap its bum, just likethe doctors do in the maternity ward. They examined the baby, his limbs, ears,eyes, and found that everything was perfect. We learn at this point why theAnunnaki referred to the primitive worker as the “blackheaded ones” because Enkigives a perfect description of the child. “Shaggy like the wild ones he was not…dark black his head hair was…Smooth was his skin…smooth as the Anunnaki skin itwas…Like dark red blood was its colour…like the clay of the Abzu was its hue.”We learn so much about the very first human on Earth from this short statement,at the same time we corroborate a number of very important archaeological andanthropological theories. We know from Mitochondrial DNA and the Y-Chromosomestudies that the first humans Homo sapiens emerged around 200,000 years ago. Itis a widely accepted fact that the cradle of Humankind originated in southernAfrica, and now we also know what their skin and hair colour was. The parallelsbetween these clay tablets and the Biblical creation of Adam are uncanny, exceptthat once again, most of these tablets predate the Bible by at least twothousand years. But here we discover the terrible truth that will hopefully jerkus out of the confused state in which we find ourselves as a species! That ourmaker was not GOD, but rather an advanced being with advanced knowledge prettysimilar to our knowledge today. And from that moment on, we saw our maker as agod. The subservience of humans permeated across the Anunnaki ranks, and as timewent by, many of them would become worshipped, against the liking of Enlil, thesupreme commander on planet Earth.While examining the baby boy, Enki noticed that his penis had a long skinhanging from the front end. “Unlike that of Anunnaki malehood it was, a skinfrom its forepart was hanging. Let the earthling from us Anunnaki by thisforeskin be distinguished.” And suddenly the ancient ritual of circumcisiontakes on a whole new meaning. Is it possible that in years to come, the humantribes not only circumcised the newborn male babies not only for hygienicreasons, but also to imitate the gods? To look a little bit more like them?Because they saw the baby not as a creature, they decided to give it a name,they called him 'Adamu', “One Who Like Earth's Clay Is”. And if you have everwondered where the Aryan blond and blue eyed people come from, the texts alsodivulge this information. In previous chapters we read that Enki had a son wholooked just like him. It describes the baby as 'radiating' and 'bright eyes thecolour of the sky'; and light hair as the 'golden Sun'. It is pretty clear fromthat description that the Anunnaki must have had white skin, generally blondhair and blue eyes. And since Enlil and his followers preferred the coolerclimate of the lands further North, near the snow capped mountains, it wouldalso explain why the blue-eyed-blond people mostly originate from that part ofthe world even today. Further support for this revelation comes when Ninmahlifts up to hold her new ‘earthling’ baby. “Ninmah cast her hand upon thenewborn's body, with her fingers his dark red skin she caressed.” We shouldassume that if her skin was also dark, they would not have made such a fussabout it in the tablets.It's very important to recognise Enki’s immediate affinity for his new‘earthling’ creation. We see the maverick, creative scientist in his character,who absolutely adored his ‘Adamu’ and almost immediately wanted only the bestfor him. This would lead to many disagreements between him and Enlil, who onlysaw the ‘earthlings’ as primitive workers who were created to perform a specifictask. But now they had to face the problem of multiplying this baby many timesto create a large group of workers. The mass production of the ‘slave species’had begun. Out of the several hundred Anunnaki females, seven volunteers werefound to become surrogate mothers and carry the new species to term. “Their taskis heroic, by them a race of Primitive Workers shall come into being.” Theybecame known as the ‘Birth Mothers’ and these seven females became highlyworshiped in Vedic poems, Harappan and other Asian cultures in latter years,often appearing in seals and other pictorial representations. It could also bethe origins of why the number 7 is so highly revered in so many cultures.Now that ‘Adamu’ was created as they had wanted, they used his DNA as theprototype for all the other babies. The seven birth mothers were eachimpregnated with fertilised eggs, to carry the foetus to term. It is fascinatingto see that there are seven female deities which were revered in the IndusValley and Harappan cultures. The task of giving birth to the workers was alengthy process and Enki realised that this was not really going to solve theproblem of creating a substantial labour force of earthlings.7 BIRTH GODESSES[../Images/452-1.jpg]Could these representations of the 7 Mother Godesses from the Indus Valleycivilisation be related to the Sumerian stories of the 7 Birth Godesses who werethe surrogate mothers of the first humans?He proposed that they create a ‘female’ earthling to procreate with Adamu.“….For males counterparts to be… let them know each other… as one flesh the twoto become… Let them by themselves procreate… By themselves give birth… Anunnakifemales to relieve.” This time they used Adamu's blood and DNAto create the‘admixture’ for fertilisation while Enki's spouse Ninki became the surrogatemother. In good time the first female earthling was born, it made human noises,it was healthy and “her skin smooth was, as that of the Anunnaki in smoothnessand colour it was.” This is a fascinating bit of information, even right fromthe very start there was a differentiation in skin colour between Adam and Eve.Is this why we simply cannot eradicate racism from the face of the world eventoday? Is it something so deeply seeded in our DNA that more evolution isrequired to overcome this 'race' clash which lingers on and on? Only time willtell.Once again they decided that the being needed a name because it was not acreature. They called her ‘Ti-Amat’, the Mother of Life, which was also aderivative of the watery planet Tiamat from which Earth was created during theEpic of Creation. They went on to create another seven earthling females fromthe Anunnaki birth mothers, which gave them seven males and seven females. “Letthe males the females inseminate, let the primitive workers by themselvesoffspring beget.” They created cages for them and allowed them to grow uptogether while observing them. But Adamu and Ti-Amat were to be excluded fromthe hard work of the other earthlings. They were the first ones and were to beprotected for their DNA. Enki took them up to Edin in the Upper World where theAnunnaki dwelled, to show off the new ‘primitive worker’ to all. A simpledwelling was built for Adamu and Ti-Amat in an enclosure of Edin and they wereallowed to roam freely in it while the Anunnaki came from far and wide toobserve them. It was probably a bit like an ancient ‘freak show’ withnever-seen-before species on display. Even Marduk arrived from the way stationon Lahmu. What took everyone by surprise was their intelligence and ability tofollow commands and perform simple tasks. Adamu and Ti-Amat led a privilegedlife in the lush gardens of Edin. They were cared for, constantly observed andadmired by all the Anunnaki. After all, they were created in their image. EvenEnlil who vigorously opposed the creation initially, was pleased with theoutcome. But those who worked in the mines were most relieved. “Primitiveworkers have been fashioned, our days of toil to end” they were shouting.But their excitement was short-lived because while the two ‘workers’ in Edinwere being observed; so were the ones in the Abzu being observed byNingishzidda, the young scientist. “Conceiving there was not, birth-giving therewas not.” The new species was unable to procreate. This was not only proving tobe a problem for Enki in the lab but also underground. The Anunnaki miners weregetting very restless and losing their patience waiting for this new ‘primitiveworker’ to take over their toil. Enki and Ningishzidda had to do more geneticmanipulation and we read in great detail what they did. The new species only had22 chromosomes which did not include the X and Y sex chromosomes; that is whythey could not procreate. How on Earth could an ignorant scribe 4,500 years agohave had such detailed knowledge about genetics? “Like two entwined serpentsNingishzidda the essence separated…Arranged like twenty two branches on a Treeof Life were the essence…The ability to procreate they did not include.” Thenthe young Ningishzidda performed a dangerous procedure which included the ribsof the individuals and which was rewritten in the Bible some time later withsome variation. He sedated Enki and Ninmah extracting the missing “sex essence”from each one, implanting it into Adamu and Ti-Amat. “To their Tree of Life twobranches have been added… With procreating powers their life essence are nowentwined.” From that moment on all humans had 23 pairs of chromosomes.The two were allowed to roam freely in the orchards of Edin while their creatorEnki tried to teach them some basics of intelligence. He clearly wanted his new‘species’ not to be too primitive; not to evolve as a slave; he wanted to upliftthem with knowledge. Enki's symbol was the entwined serpent which is still usedas the symbol for medical doctors today. It was this imagery which has led tothe ageless confusion between the maker and the ‘evil serpent’ who tempted Adamand Eve in the garden of Eden. The story is somewhat simpler and more logical ifseen from the point of the Sumerian tablets. Enlil was furious about the‘slaves’ being able to procreate on their own. This was never part of the plan.Now they have not only created a new species which was not supposed to happen,but they have given them the essence of intelligence and life which the Anunnakipossessed.SUMERIAN TREE OF LIFE EGYPTIAN TREE OF LIFE [../Images/454-1.jpg]The tree of life referred to by the Sumerians was actually the DNA. Here we havetwo deities manipulating the DNA-Tree-of-Life with a winged deity or a wingeddisc observing them from above. Such winged deities are common in ancientdepictions and have been adopted by various religious groups like Zoroastianism.Similar representations of the DNA in the form of a Tree of Life are foundthroughout ancient civilisations.And this part of the scriptures points irrefutably to the genetic manipulationperformed by the Anunnaki which stunted our DNA, causing many of the undesirableand unexplainable characteristics among humans today; the fact that we die, thatwe get sick and other undesirable side effects associated with an incompletegenome. Ningishzidda comforted Enlil by explaining that he did not give the newspecies the gift of eternal life. “Knowing for protection they were given… Thebranch of long living, to their essence tree was not.” This statement explainswhy the Anunnaki lived so long, or even eternally and why they could be revivedfrom the dead. It also suggests that they must have performed more geneticengineering on humans after this point, because it is clear from other scriptsthat the early humans lived very long lives, unlike humans today.Enlil could not be pacified and he proclaimed “Then let them be where they areneeded…In the Abzu away from the Edin, let them be expelled.” This story is wellknow as the ‘Fall of Adam’ in the Bible. There are also some other fascinatingsimilarities when Enlil was walking in the shade of the trees in Edin lookingfor the two earthlings, wanting to see how they were getting on. By that stagethey had already been taught various things by his brother Enki and they wereaware of their nakedness. Wanting to be more like their maker, who woreclothing, they began to emulate him. This was a dead giveaway to Enlil thatsomeone had been feeding them knowledge and information which he was decisivelyopposed to. It was at this point when he expelled them from Edin for becomingtoo informed, and a stern threat was extended to the human couple not to consortwith the ‘evil serpent’ and not be led astray by his attempts and promises ofknowledge and other things. So it turns out that the serpent was actually Enki,who was the maker, the ‘creator’ of Humankind who was personified as the devilby Enlil, while from that moment on, Enlil became the ‘god of fear andvengeance’ who did everything in his power to oppress and control humans. He wasvery clear about the limits to which he would allow humans to develop. He chosehis favourites, punished those who would not listen to him, and prevented humansfrom worshipping any other god than him, although the other gods had much moreregular contact with humans, which led to them being worshipped in any case. Butin time, Enki's oldest son Marduk would take over this vengeful god role when heproclaimed himself the ‘god above all’.In the Abzu, all the earthlings were procreating, which included Adamu andTi-Amat. “With wonderment did Enki and Ninmah watch the newborns… How they grewand developed was a marvel.” They comprehended commands, did not complain aboutthe heat and dust and worked hard for rations of food. Finally, after a wholeShar (3,600 years) the Anunnaki were relieved of the toil in the mines, whileback home on their planet, Nibiru's atmosphere was healing. The earthlingworkers in the Abzu grew in numbers quickly, working in the mines and asservant-slaves to the Anunnaki. But in the north or the “Upper World” theAnunnaki were also growing in numbers. Enlil and Enki's sons had offspring withsome of the nursing Anunnaki females who arrived from Nibiru.By now the settlers from a distant planet had been on Earth for around 240,000years. They had established a stable infrastructure to perform the arduous taskof mining gold for their home planet Nibiru and they had grown in numbers, whichnow included many Anunnaki who were born on Earth and had no knowledge ofNibiru. This is quite an interesting set of variables. We are also told thattheir stay on Earth had sped up their aging process. “By lifecycles of Nibiruthey were endowed, by Earth's cycles they were quickened.” This means that thechildren grew up quicker on Earth. The larger community of Anunnaki made life abit easier on them because they could now divide their chores among moreindividuals. The biggest achievement was the creation of the ‘slave species’which was working out well. The new species performed all the lowest and thetoughest tasks, and so the ‘earthlings’ were in great demand by the Anunnaki.Those must have been very interesting times on Earth while the settlers lived ina kind of utopian paradise. After all, they were on a mission which was planned,supported in many ways with technology from ‘home’ and most importantly, it wasfunded and provided for with everything they needed. It was a fully functional‘communist’ system where all of them worked together for a collective benefit.The settlers did the work required and in return they were provided witheverything they needed. They were even allowed to break longstanding rules ofthe Nibiru civilisation by creating a cloned slave species to perform the hardlabour. There is no reference to money or currency or the need to pay forsomething until long after the flood some 11,000 BC. It was the perfectcommunity of settlers, everyone with his own task, contributing to the greaterbenefit of all the Anunnaki, feeding everyone and providing for everyone inevery way. The slave species became an inextricable part of the full cycle ofactivities on Earth. But they were functioning within their own little spherewhich was swallowed up by the larger Anunnaki sphere of activity. As slaves theywere not paid, but they were housed and fed and clothed by the Anunnaki.Enlil had twin grandchildren called Utu, a boy, and Inanna, a girl, who wouldbecome Ishtar, the goddess of love in many cultures, by many names. But theclimate on Earth was changing and causing great havoc. We are even told aboutthe Antarctic meltdown prior to the last Ice Age. “Upon the Earth the warmth wasrising…Vegetation flourished…The rains were heavier…Rivers were gushing …Thesnow white parts to water were melting…volcanoes were fire and brimstonebelching…In the Lower World the snow white-hued place the Earth was grumbling.”But the disturbance on Earth was arriving from the cosmos too as Nibiru was onher way to round the Sun. “In the heavens Nibiru was approaching, the Sun'sabode it was nearing.” This particular time the planet got a little too close tothe asteroid belt, its gravity causing many rocks to be dislodged from theirstable orbit causing them to collide with the inner planets which includedEarth. But it was Mars and the moon that were most affected. Marduk who wasstationed on Mars was very nervous and was complaining to Enki about thesituation. “From the Bracelet bits and pieces it has been displacing.” Mars,Earth and the moon were bombarded by meteors causing havoc and panic and muchdamage. “In the Hammered Bracelet turmoils are occurring…Upon the Earthbrimstones from the sky were falling…Like stony missiles the Earth they wereattacking…The faces of all three with countless scars were covered.”It is fascinating to discover that after the original ‘celestial battle’collisions between the planets and moons which created the Earth, there musthave been more collision each time Nibiru came past the Sun, but eventually thisstabilised allowing life to develop. But cosmic collisions are inevitable andthe balance must have shifted in our own solar back-yard which caused thesesudden disturbances affecting the asteroid belt. The tablets describe how agiant comet or asteroid came close to the Earth, while flying on a collisionpath with Mars. It describes the rogue celestial body dramatically. “Fromhorizon to the midst of heaven like a flaming dragon it was stretched…One leaguewas its head, fifty leagues in length it was, awesome was its tail…By day theskies of Earth it darkened.” This is a pretty awesome description of what wasactually a giant comet, which must have been a similar experience to the CometShoemaker-Levy in 1994, which we all witnessed crashing into Jupiter. But thisone was much closer and way back then, somehow the moon got in the way and tookthe full impact of the comet. It is possible that the impact which is describedby the Sumerian tablets caused the giant crater on the moon, which can still beseen with the naked eye today. You be the judge, this is what it says: “Tointercept that dragon in its path Kingu (moon) was making haste…Fierce was theencounter, a tempest of clouds on Kingu was raised…By its foundations was Kingushaken.”But as Nibiru made its turn around the sun and disappeared into deep space,everything subsided again and life returned back to normal on the fragileoutpost of the Anunnaki. They surveyed the land from their sky ships to assessthe damage, around Edin and north to the cedar mountains where the command postwas, to the landing places and all their other cities. They scanned to ensurethe gold mines were not affected – they were saved. However, the damage to Marswas severe. Marduk reported that the atmosphere was damaged and Enlil agreedthat the stability of the base on Lahmu was questionable. They would build a newspace port in the Edin on Earth to send ships directly to Nibiru. “Achariotplace in the Edin must be established…The way station on Lahmu is no longercertain.” There have been many theories by scientists about what may havehappened to Mars in the past. Today, from the diagnoses by the rovers on ourneighbour, we have irrefutable proof that Mars had water, oceans, lakes andrivers and even an atmosphere. There is still ice present today and all itreally needs is an atmosphere to stabilise the environment. The Sumerian tabletscertainly go a long way in supporting this line of thinking, but the lack ofatmosphere and the 'peeled away' crust of virtually one half of the planet havecaused much speculation. Is it possible that the descriptions in the tablets arethe actual event which 'killed' Mars? Firstly she was bombarded by giantasteroids which may have dislodged much of the peeled away surface, as issuggested by some scholars, before the close proximity of the much larger Nibirucaused dramatic gravitational disturbances which may have caused the loss of theatmosphere and a large part of its crust. We are told that all of this occurredaround 80 Shar since their splashdown on Earth. That would make it 288,000 yearsafter arrival and 155,000 years ago from our present time. It will befascinating to see what evidence the Mars probes find of the meteoric activityon our neighbouring planet.After this calamity had subsided, Anu gave instruction to build a space port onEarth. “Let a place of Celestial Chariots in the Edin be established.” Butbefore they rushed to do that, Enki and Marduk wanted to survey the moon as apossible alternative to Mars, with its much lower gravity for a possible basethere. “Eagles' helmets” they had to don, the atmosphere was for breathinginsufficient…For a way station it is unsuitable.” But the two stayed there forsome time while Enki mapped the heavens, he was taken by the beauty of Earthfrom the moon and once again we hear the Anunnaki make reference to the almightyGOD. “The Earth like a globe in the void by nothing is hanging…Are you not bythe celestial dance of Earth and Moon and Sun enchanted?...With our instrumentswe can scan the distant heavens…The handiwork of the Creator of All in thissolitude we can admire.” With this statement we get another glimpse at Enki'screative spirit which was diametrically opposed to his brother's, who was a truecommander and politician. They did a great deal of astronomical observationwhile on the moon and the tablets describe them as they captured much of theirnewfound knowledge of the cosmos from there. The circuits of the planets aroundthe Sun indicated to Enki that “Nibiru of the Sun not a descendant” was, likethe other planets in the solar system. Many modern day astronomers may find thisbit of information useful when making pronouncements and formulating theories onthe mysterious planet X. Enki pointed out that there was a family of 12 with theSun and he designated a station to each one by name. After this “twelveconstellations by their shapes he allotted…The stars into twelve constellationshe assembled.” Is this is how we inherited the signs of the Zodiac?Marduk used this quiet time with his father Enki to pour his heart out. He wasbitterly disappointed about his position and role among the Anunnaki. He wasEnki's first-born and yet he had not been given any of the higherresponsibilities on Earth. It was at this point we can sense that Marduk wasbecoming a loose cannon who would cause a lot of trouble in time to come. Enkipromises him that “…which I have been deprived your future lot shall be.”The continuing harsh climate on Mars and unsuitable conditions on the moonforced the Anunnaki to build “Bird City” at Sippar in the Edin. Now they wouldbe able to fly their ships directly to Nibiru from Earth, without having to stopon a way station. “In the eighty second Shar was the construction of Sipparcompleted...” and Anu travelled from Nibiru to see the latest developments. TheAnunnaki from the Abzu were assembled and even the Igigi were called in fromMars for the occasion. We learn about the singing and dancing skills of Inanna,the goddess of love, Anu's great granddaughter. A new era had arrived on Earth,the gold would be sent directly to Nibiru and once they had collected enough instorage, the “heroes and heroines” would be able to return to Nibiru. “A fewmore Shar of toil, and homeward they shall be bound.” The Anunnaki were excitedabout the prospects of ending their stay on this planet and returning home. Buttheir anticipation was too hasty. The hard work in the Abzu continued, theAnunnaki in the Edin were growing restless. It was they who now demanded helpfrom the slave species. But while Enlil and Enki were deliberating suchprospects, Ninurta flew down to the southern tip of Africa and captured someearthling slaves for his Anunnaki friends in the Edin. Thereby starting anever-ending tradition of slavery from Africa, which would haunt modern man formillennia to come. The events are described dramatically in the tablets: “In theforests and the steppes of the Abzu the Earthlings they chased...With nets theythem captured, male and female to the Edin they them brought.” This sounds likea scene from the 17th century when slavery became one of the most profitablebusinesses in the world and when African slaves were captured like wild animalsto be shipped and sold in distant lands. And yet, this was happening some150,000 years ago. It is amazing how strongly the Anunnaki genetic code hasembedded itself in our DNA, still playing havoc with our behaviour today.Enlil was furious once again, because he explicitly expelled the Earthlings fromthe Edin. But Ninurta his son convinced him that the slaves would pacify therestless Anunnaki in the north and prevent a repeat of the revolt which tookplace in the mines of the Abzu. They let the situation simmer, as they allbelieved that they would be heading home to Nibiru very soon. “Let the gold pileup quickly, let us all to Nibiru soon return.”The Anunnaki in the Edin were very impressed with their new slaves. They showedintelligence and could perform all tasks given to them. “Intelligence theypossessed, of commands they had understanding.” The slaves took on all kinds ofchores, all working naked for their gods. As time passed, the numbers ofearthlings grew so quickly, they outnumbered the Anunnaki by many and very soonthe food supplies began to dwindle. The slaves would constantly scavenge forfood everywhere, in the wild and in the orchards. These were days long beforedomestication of animals, keeping of herds, growing of crops and understandingof farming by the humans. Those secrets would only be revealed to the slavesafter the Great Flood, in many years to come. Enlil was still harbouringnegative feelings toward the slaves and he made it clear that Enki should dealwith the problem which he created. So Enki started scheming. He observed theearthlings only to discover that they were somehow regressing towards their wildorigins. He planned to create a civilised man out of them, but he was not quitesure how to go about it. There was already enough arguing about all the geneticexperimenting and cloning. He had to do this less conspicuously. What he did hasbecome another story which was repeated in the Bible around the birth of Moses.Enki impregnated two young Earthling females, who bore a son and a daughter. Thetablets tell us that he was ecstatic. “Who such a thing has ever known… BetweenAnunnaki and Earthling, conception was attained…Civilised man I have broughtinto being.” He told his spouse that he found the babies floating in a basket onthe river by the reeds and took the children to raise as his own. And just asMoses was raised as the son of the Pharaoh, they became known as “The GraciousOnes” growing up as the children of the Lord of the Earth. They were born in the93rd Shar, which was 334 800 years after arrival on Earth, 108,000 years agofrom present time. They were called “Adapa – The Foundling” and “Titi – One withlife”. By this action Enki personally created the first Homo sapiens sapiens,and secured their future as a new civilised species to multiply on the planet.“Civilised man I have brought forth…A new kind of Earthling from my seed hasbeen created, in my image and after my likeness.”These are some of the most important words in my entire substantiation of the'god-devil' argument. Since Enki was the creator of the original Adamu and onceagain Adapa, the first civilised human, he should be credited as the creator.But his brother Enlil described him as the deceitful and evil 'snake' and the'devil' who humans should stay away from. Enlil was for all intents and purposesthe supreme commander of planet Earth, who not only declared himself to be theirgod, but was perceived to be their god. On Earth Enlil's word was supreme.[../Images/460-1.jpg]THE CREATORSNeo-Sumerian on clay, Babylonia, 1900-1700 BC. One of various creation storiescaptured on clay. This text is unique and different from the story whichintroduces the “Creation of the Hoe” and the Neo-Babylonian Epic of Creation orEnuma Elish.Tablet translation:“IN DISTANT DAYS, IN THOSE DAYS, AFTER DESTINIES HAD BEEN DECREED, AFTER AN ANDENLIL HAD SET UP THE REGULATIONS FOR HEAVEN AND EARTH, ENKI, THE EXALTED KNOWINGGOD, LIKE A HIGH PRIEST WITH WIDE KNOWLEDGE, ENLIL-BANDA, IN THE LANDS WAS THEIRRULER. BY THE RULES FOR HEAVEN AND EARTH, THE FIXED RULES, HE SET UP CITIES. -HE DUG THE TIGRIS AND THE EUPHRATES. THEREUPON HE ESTABLISHED THE RULES OF THELANDS. HE SET UP HAND-WASHING RITES, HE SET UP LIBATIONS …”This supreme god of Humankind was fierce and brutal, as is seen throughout theOld Testament, punishing humans for disobedience, but also rewarding them forbeing loyal. Rewarding his chosen few with physical possessions like land, gold,horses, livestock and more. If you have ever wondered why we humans are somaterialistic, herein lies your answer. Enlil was the god who manipulated humansto do exactly what he wanted. The god of the Bible and all other manmadereligions. He never even gave Humankind the chance to evolve into a state ofconsciousness where they could understand the bigger picture of the universe.Instead he manipulated humans from their very beginnings into believing that he,Enlil, was the almighty GOD, creator of the universe and all things in it. So ifEnlil, our god, was the brutal one, should he not be called the devil? Formaking false representations of himself to an ignorant species barely emergingfrom the cradle, confused about their purpose among the living?When I say that god is the devil, and the devil is our maker, it should be seenin this context. Enlil should be classified as the devil for misrepresentinghimself as god; and Enki, who was portrayed as the ‘snake-devil’ was actuallythe one who created us…our maker. Enki was the only one of the Anunnaki whoconsistently looked out for our best interests, who tried to give humansknowledge and intelligence in Edin, who taught us most of the skills we possesstoday, and the one who saved humans from the Great Flood when Enlil and theothers agreed to let the water wipe out all humans from the Earth.[../Images/461-1.jpg]ORIGINS OF MEDICINEThe symbol used by the medical industry today can be traced back to earlySumerian symbolism. The wings represent a god or deity with superior knowlege;the serpent symbolises Enki and the double helix of the DNA.Adapa and Titi were brought up as little Anunnaki children, Enki and his spouseNinki taught them all the skills of the Anunnaki. Satisfied that the new kind ofearthling was in fact civilised and intelligent, he ordered the delivery of allkinds of seeds and domestic animals from Nibiru, so that the earthlings couldgrow food and learn farming. “Let us from Nibiru seeds that are sown bringdown…Ewes that sheep become to Earth deliver… farming and shepherding teach…Bycivilised man let Anunnaki and Earthlings become satiated.” He was going toenable the Earthlings to provide food for the Anunnaki and themselves. Thisknowledge was however reserved only for a small privileged group of Earthlings,who were closely associated with the Anunnaki and whose responsibility it was tofeed their masters. The mass civilisation of the slave species would only happenmuch later.Both Enlil and Anu were amazed that a civilised man could evolve so quickly froma more simple Adamu. Once again they refer to evolution before they voice theirsurprise. “That by life essence one kind to another leads is not unheard of…Thaton Earth a civilised man from the Adamu so quickly appeared, that is unheardof.” It is evident from this statement that the Anunnaki were well-acquaintedwith the concept of evolution, but they also knew how long it took for speciesto evolve. As unhappy as Enlil was with the original idea of a slave speciesbeing created, he suddenly saw the merits of the more intelligent, civilisedman, who could perform more delicate tasks. Especially that of farming andcultivating food for all of those on Earth. Their excitement rose even higherwhen Adapa and Titi had their first children, which turned out to be twins. Anuwas so impressed by the reports about Adapa, that he ordered him to be broughtto Nibiru for a visit. “Let Adapa the Earthling to Nibiru be brought.”A very important trip to Nibiru was planned to show off the amazing earthlingwho could speak, read and behave appropriately, to Anu and all otherinhabitants. Once again Enlil was not pleased with this plan. Not only have theyendowed him with all their knowledge, but now they will take an Earthling intoheaven, to become just like them? “With knowledge endowed, between Heaven andEarth will travel.” But the command of Anu could not be avoided. Enki's two sonsNingishzidda and the youngest Dumuzi were chosen to accompany Adapa and visittheir parents' planet for the first time. Anu wanted to bestow immortality onAdapa to include him in the extended family of the Anunnaki but Enki had otherthoughts. Adapa was his creation by his own seed and a ‘mortal earthling’ withmore Anunnaki blood than Adamu who was created first. Adapa had to remain anearthling on his own planet Earth and face death as all other earthlings.Creating a new species was one thing, but creating an immortal species was noton the cards.As they took off, the tablets describe Adapa's fear of flying for the firsttime, wanting to go back, while being pacified by Ningishzidda. “The lands theysaw, by seas and oceans into parts separated… Adapa agitated was, he cowered andcried out: Take me back.” This was one the earliest events of human flight everrecorded, describing clearly the geographical features in a way possible onlywhen viewed from a great height. The events which took place on Nibiru upontheir arrival, sound like a science fiction story along the lines of ‘The AlienWho Came to Dinner’. So as Adapa was admired and quizzed by Anu and the entirecity who came to see this new ‘civilised’ alien from another planet, he wasoffered various items to eat and drink. When he refused, it surprised Anu andannoyed him somewhat, that this earthling would refuse the gift of immortality.Then came the twist where fiction imitates life. We discover that the Anunnakihad some awesome technology that we do not really understand today. It allowedthem to convey or transmit secret encoded messages. Before they departed fromEarth, Enki gave Ningishzidda an encoded tablet for Anu. “Anu the tablet's sealbroke open…into the scanner the tablet he inserted…its message from Enki todecipher.”It explained the heritage of Adapa, that he was the son of Enki from anearthling female and had to return to face his destiny on Earth. “To be ofcivilised man a progenitor his destiny shall be.” Anu then immediately declaredthat “the welcome to the earthling must not be overextended, on our planet hecannot eat and drink. Let his offspring there on Earth fields till and meadowsshepherd.” Dumuzi was asked to stay on Nibiru while Ningishzidda returned toEarth with Adapa, bringing with them seeds to be planted. Dumuzi would bring thelambs and ewes on his return.Enki confessed to his sister Ninmah and Ningishzidda about Adapa and Titi beinghis offspring, stressing that by his actions he secured the survival of theAnunnaki. Civilised earthlings would relieve more of their hardship, they willbe taught to produce the food to keep everyone alive during the hard times. Butonce again, his brother Enlil's fury was immense. This is where the Anunnakibegin to debate destiny and fate as a philosophical inevitability. “So did Enlilin anger say. Now the lot is cast, destiny by fate is overtaken.” All the waythrough many of these translations we are left with a very strange mixture ofspirituality, awareness of the Creator of All things, advanced technologicalexpertise and know-how. And yet, the Anunnaki themselves showed visible signs ofa species still on the path of evolution. I personally get the distinctimpression that their genome was not as evolved as we may have believed at firstsight. It is possible that it was indeed fate which brought them to Earth tocreate humans, who would unravel the mystery of their own ancestry whichstretched all the way back to another planet called Nibiru. But I have alreadyshared my thoughts on the evolution of the genome with you. I propose thatevolution happens exponentially, and in a few thousand years we would haveevolved to the same level the Anunnaki were when they created us. They, however,have probably evolved way beyond our present levels of comprehension, and thatmay have something to do with the many UFO sightings, visitations and abductionswhich are reported recurrently. Is it possible that since they have desertedplanet Earth, the Anunnaki keep coming back to check up on their creation, andpossibly help steer us in the right, or wrong direction?Meanwhile Adapa's female partner Titi, gave birth to twin sons. They called themKa-in and Abael, showing us that once again, those who rewrote the story in theBible many thousands of years later, got it completely wrong. It was not Adamand Eve who had Cain and Abel, it was the first civilised couple on Earth whohad the troubled sons. Ka-in was taken under Ninurta's wing to his city ofBad-Tibira, to be taught everything about farming the lands, digging canals,ploughing, planting and harvesting crops and was known as “He Who in the FieldFood Grows”. Marduk took the other son Abael, “He of the Watered Meadows” andtaught him everything about building enclosures for his animals, feeding themand caring for them. We are reminded about the very long lives which these earlyhumans lived because it was a whole Shar before Dumuzi returned from Nibirubringing with him mainly sheep and other four-legged domesticated animals forfarming. “Never before was there an ewe on Earth, a lamb has never to Earth fromheavens been dropped.”Under the leadership of Ninmah, the Anunnaki built what they called “theCreation Chamber” where “the multiplying of the grains and ewes on Earth begun.”When the first crops and sheep were harvested by Ka-in and Abael, they werecalled before Enlil and Enki and we witness the first ever offering to the godsby humans. Enlil proclaimed that, “Let there be celebration of firsts...” andfor the first time in a long time he was pleased with the humans. This mentalityof subservience and offering would be imposed on the humans for thousands ofyears by Enlil and other Anunnaki gods, forcing them to make sacrificialofferings as a sign of obedience. Those must have been tough times on Earth asthe production of food was not sufficient to feed the large numbers of Anunnakiand humans, in the Abzu and in the Edin. Fish and fruit were clearly not enough.It was only after the introduction of the new seeds of a wide variety ofagricultural produce that the food crisis was alleviated among the Anunnaki andhumans.The subtle competition among the cousins Ninurta and Marduk rubbed off on theearthling brothers Ka-in and Abael. They began to argue about who had the moreimportant job, displaying typical human traits so early in human history. It wasnot long before their subtle competition turned into more visible rivalry andwhen the climate changed and times became hard on the farmers, their rivalryturned to manslaughter. Abael's sheep found the green fields of Ka-inirresistible and invaded them to graze on. Suddenly their petty arguments turnedinto a heated confrontation. The brothers got into a physical fight over theirlands and in a fit of fury Ka-in hit Abael with a stone, killing him. “Ka-in astone picked up, with it he Abael in the head struck…Again and again he hit himuntil Abael fell, his blood from him gushing.”We see the first evidence of human remorse and grieving at this point. WhenAdapa and Titi found out about the tragedy they behaved the way some peoplestill do today. “A great cry of agony Titi shouted, Adapa spread mud on hisface.” Although Ka-in was remorseful, it was too late. There was muchdeliberation and argument among the Anunnaki about how they should deal with thesituation. The decision did not come easily. In the end, Ka-in was judged by theAnunnaki and expelled from Edin to live in solitude in distant lands, to fendfor himself. “From the Edin you must depart, among Anunnaki and civilisedearthlings you shall not stay…To the ends of the Earth let him be banished.” TheBible tells us of the days that the Nefilim were on Earth…and the sons of thegods saw the daughters of man and had sex with them and so produced a newsub-species which became the Aryans. Obviously the Bible does not put it in somany words, but I believe we have now reached the point where that particularbiblical phrase begins to make much more sense.In the 95th Shar Adapa and Titi had another son whom they called Seti, thebiblical Seth, but the first civilised couple did not stop there. “Thirty sonsand thirty daughters Adapa and Titi had.” These human offspring were tillers andfarmers who grew in numbers and provided all the food required on Earth. In the97th Shar, Seti had a son called Enshi, which meant ‘Master of Humanity’. Enshiwas taught writing and counting by Adapa, he was taught about the Anunnaki andNibiru, after which he was taken to Nibru-ki by the son of Enlil and showedanointing with oils, and how to extract the elixir from the Inbus fruits. Thiswas also an important turning point in the relationship between humans andAnunnaki, when man began to call them ‘Lord’. “It was since then that bycivilised man the Anunnaki Lords were called...” and the beginning of trueworshipping of the Anunnaki. The civilised humans were also taught how to makefires with bitumen, how to operate the kiln and furnace, smelt metals and refinegold. They were taught how to make instruments and play music and sing, and evenhow to dig wells for water. The humans liked to gather at the water to socialiseand it was there, where much interaction between males and females took placewith lots of sexual activity, leading to the rapid growth in their numbers. Westill seem to display the same behaviour as water always attracts loads ofpeople. Whether it's the beach or a riverbank or even a pool in your back­yard,people have always been attracted to water. And this is the part of the claytablets which was copied into the Bible by the biblical writers thousands ofyears later, confusing virtually all scholars and theologians alike when theyrefer to the Nefilim. These were the days during which “…the Igigi to Earth weremore frequently coming” from Mars. Marduk and the rest of the Martian Igigi“…what on Earth was transpiring they increasingly desired.”The time of human expansion had arrived on earth. More and more humans werebeing born as descendants of Adapa, the first civilised man. If one considersthe cultural differences between those times and today, the one strikingdifference is that promiscuity among the gods was almost a part of theirexpected behaviour. Is it possible that the male human species inherited thoseurges from the Anunnaki? We certainly inherited most of their othercharacteristics, except the ones they specifically erased from our DNA. Therewas however a strange ironic reason for high levels of promiscuity in thoseancient times. There had to be large numbers of half-siblings who couldprocreate to keep the genetic pool strong and healthy as the species was rapidlygrowing in numbers. So, without even realising it, humans were imitating theirmaker gods in their sexual habits.A long period of human achievement and cultural foundation building dawned. Iwill mention some of the characters who stood out in their prominence orachievements. Malalu, meaning ‘He Who Plays’, was the son of Kunin and Mualit,his half-sister, and was known for singing and performing music, so Ninurta madehim many instruments which included a harp. Their whole family line worked inthe metal city of Bad-Tibira.Irid, which means ‘He of the Sweet Waters’ became the master well builder andprovider of water where the humans liked to congregate and procreate. Everwondered where the Greeks and Romans got their ideas of ‘baths’, and where theword ‘irrigate’ originates from? The Igigi from Mars were coming to Earth morefrequently and in larger numbers, wanting to escape the harsh climate there, andto participate in the seemingly enjoyable lifestyle of the earthlings. The Igigimales started to take a fancy to the daughters of man and they began to desirethem.Marduk took a bright young man called Enkime – ‘Understanding the Annals’ underhis wing and taught him many things. He took him to the moon, taught himeverything his father Enki had taught him before, about the stars andconstellations and the circuits of the planets. Imagine finding those footstepson the moon? What will that do to our perception of humanity? On their return hewas stationed under Utu at Sippar, the “Place of the Chariots” and was calledthe ‘Prince of Earthlings’. Enkime was the first human who was taught thefunctions of priesthood. Some time later Marduk returned to the heavens withEnkime and his son Matushal. But this time Enkime did not return, he stayed in‘the heavens’. “In a celestial chariot heavenward they soared…To visit the Igigion Lahmu by Marduk they were taken…That in the heavens he stayed till the end ofhis days.” It is not quite clear what exactly happened to this character but itis written that the Igigi really took a liking to him. The possibility existsthat Enkime actually stayed on Mars as a kind of pacifying force with the Igigi,who were growing restless. This would be very ironic since here we have a mortalearthling, giving real Nibiruans inspiration. Maybe he was truly worthy of thepriestly status bestowed on him. And maybe this is where he put it to very gooduse, because it would take a while longer before the Igigi finally began toleave Mars in great numbers, heading for Earth. This all happened in the 104thShar. Which was 374 400 years after arrival, 68,600 years ago.Adapa, the first civilised human or Homo sapiens sapiens died in the 108th Shar,55,000 BC. He lived for 14 Shar, which would have made him about 48,600 yearsold! This is clear evidence that the Anunnaki must have performed additionalgenetic manipulation on humans as time went by to reduce their ageing abilityand thereby reducing their numbers as well. This was however not enough to slowthe rapid birth rate of the slave species. As the numbers of mankind keptgrowing and beautiful daughters were born to them, Marduk fell in love with anearthling female. He would be the first Anunnaki to espouse an earthling andthis would clearly have some repercussions. During their controversial debates,we are reminded about Humankind's mortality and the 'image' of their maker.Marduk also reminds his father about the mess they had made by creating acivilised species which is as advanced in their thinking as the Anunnaki, theonly difference being their longevity. “Step by step on this planet a primitivebeing, one like us to be, we have created…In our image and in our likenesscivilised earthling is, except for the long life, he is we.” This was Marduk'ssubstantiation for wanting to espouse an earthling female. His options wereclearly presented to him by Enki and Enlil. Marduk would forsake all hisprincely rights on Nibiru and never be able to return there with his spouse.Even Anu was involved in this weighty affair. “Marduk marry can… but on Nibiru aprince he shall no longer be.” It was this kind of action by his elders, whichpushed the young ambitious Marduk even further towards rejecting the wholesystem and eventually rising against all of the Anunnaki when he proclaimedhimself ‘god above all’.And so after their wedding, Marduk and his bride Sarpanit were sent away to aland of their own. “Adomain of their own, away from the Edin, in anotherland...” did Enlil and Enki say. We also get a pretty good idea to which part ofthe world Marduk was restricted. “A domain above the Abzu, in the land that theUpper Sea reaches, one that by waters from the Edin is separated, that by shipscan be reached.” This was the land of Egypt they were talking about. The landwhich Marduk would rule as the god Ra, in years to come? Unbeknown to the seniorbrothers Enlil and Enki, the Igigi from Mars used the wedding ceremony as anexcuse to come to Earth. However, they had a much more cunning reason forcoming. Let's face it, their life on a lonely tough planet like Mars was notwhat they had hoped for when they left Nibiru. They also wanted the seeminglylavish and fun-filled life surrounded by slaves which the Anunnaki on Earth had.But their main attraction to Earth were the extremely sexual and beautiful‘daughters of man’. The following episode is well documented in Genesis, onceagain, copied from much earlier Sumerian tablets and misunderstood by scholarsand modern day theologians. The Igigi were saying: “What to Marduk permitted isfrom us too should not be deprived.” The earthling females were called ‘AdapiteFemales’, after their original ancestor Adapa, the first Homo sapiens sapiens,the son of Enki and an earthling of Adamu's ancestry.The Igigi said: “Come let us choose wives from among the Adapite Females, andchildren beget.” They took these females as hostages to the space port anddemanded that they be allowed the same privilege as Marduk. He obviously agreedwith them. “What I have done from them cannot be deprived.” Once again we seethe angry Enlil who was extremely agitated by this. “Enlil was enraged withoutpacification.” We can clearly sense the clandestine plot to control humans byforce and punishment. “By our own hands this planet with earthling multitudesshall be overrun.” He would become the vengeful god of the Bible carefullymonitoring every step the humans made, while ensuring they do not grow too wiseor too strong to challenge him in any possible way. So even after Enlilcapitulated “…let the Igigi and their females from Earth depart...” heimmediately had to face another dilemma. Marduk informed him that it had becomeimpossible to live on Mars any more, the conditions had become unbearable andthey would have to abandon their station. “On Lahmu conditions unbearable havebecome, surviving is not possible.”The immigrants from Mars were secluded in and around the space port in the cedarmountains, where they had originally staged their resistance from. They hadchildren who became known as ‘Children of the Rocket Ships’ often referred to inbooks and Sumerian translations. Eventually some of them joined Marduk in hisnew land, some went “…to the far eastlands, lands of high mountains...” whileothers remained where they were. It is absolutely clear from these descriptionsthat these were the original Aryans who later settled all over Europe andinvaded the Indus Valley, laying the foundation for the Indo-European languagebase. They were white, technologically advanced and possessed knowledge waybeyond ordinary humans. They would also be the original pharaohs of Egypt underMarduk's rule. Marduk started to build a large and loyal following of earthlingswho followed him, obeyed him and worshipped him. He was becoming a powerfulforce on Earth which began to worry Enlil and Enki. We hear some more biblicalwords from Enlil as he ponders what the future may hold. “The Earth by theearthlings inherited shall be.” And so Enlil planned a resistance against anypossible future moves by Marduk. He sent his son Ninurta to find the offspringand clans of Ka-in where they dwelled in the distant lands, and teach themeverything they needed to know about making tools, mining, manufacturing,smelting, ship building, sailing, and fighting a war. “In a new land a domainthey established, a city with twin towers there they built…A domain beyond thesea it was, the mountainland of the new Bond Heaven-Earth it was not.” Fromthese descriptions it sounds to me undoubtedly like the early Andean settlementand civilisations of South America in Peru and Bolivia near Lake Titicaca.Back in Edin they appointed a human called Lu-mach, the son of Matushal, to bethe work master for the Anunnaki. He had a wife called Batanash. “Of a beautyoutstanding she was, by her beauty was Enki charmed.” We see the highly sexualside of Enki's character resurface once again, creating more controversy andintroducing his gene pool into the human species yet again. He seduced thebeautiful Batanash who bore a son whom they called Ziusudra, ‘He of Long BrightLife Days’. This would be the human who survives the flood in an ‘ark’ and whowas the real original character that the Bible calls Noah. He was raised inShurubak, but the secret of his paternal line remained with Enki and Batanash.He was born in the 110th Shar, 396,000 years since arrival, 47,000 years BCwhich was right in the middle of the last Ice Age. For those who believe thatthe Ice Age meant that the whole world was covered in snow and ice, this was notthe case. Scholars describe that most of Canada, northern USA, northern Europeand northern Asia was covered by ice and snow. But further south, the world wasvery habitable with a very different climate to today. That is also why theAnunnaki settled in Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers when itwas very lush and green, and did not look anything like the desert it is today.Antarctica was probably much more extended with thick ice covering, which wouldbe the main cause of the Great Flood in time to come.Just like Adapa, Enki's first human offspring, Ziusudra was also very smart,showing great signs of intelligence and Enki adored the boy who looked just likehim. The description of the child gives us a good idea of what Enki looked like.This is how the child Ziusudra is described. “White as the snow his skin was…the colour of wool was his hair…like the sky were his eyes, with a brilliancewere his eyes shining.” From the beginning he was treated with special care byboth Ninmah and Enki. He was taught 'priestly rites' and everything which Adapaknew before him. We are also given a strong hint that the Anunnaki used adifferent language or written script among themselves when we read “…to read thewritings of Adapa he him taught.” In this bit of information lies the possiblesubstantiation that the Indus script and the Balkan-Danube script may be alanguage which the Anunnaki used, or a related script which the early humanslike Ziusudra and Adapa used long before the flood wiped out most of the world.That would also explain why there is only a small number of examples found inthe world. The rest were carried away and buried under mountains of sand andsilt. But when the Sumerian tablets refer to the “Prior times” do they meantimes before the flood? When there was a different kind of order on Earth? Whenthe language was different, before the tower of Babel and before “man's languagewas confused”? It certainly seems like it.DIAGNOSES OF MEDICAL CONDITIONSOld Babylonian on clay, Babylonia, circa 1900 BC in cuneiform script. This claytablet outlines a number of medical procedures by an ancient physician. Medicaltexts of this category are well known from Neo Babylonian literature, while fromthe tablets which are over 1000 years older, the Old Babylonian period, only afew survived. Many of the Babylonian diagnoses and prognoses still hold true inmodern medicine.[../Images/470-1.jpg]But the times were not good on Earth, it seemed as if it was trapped in adownward spiral both culturally and environmentally. The Igigi were procreatingwith earthling females at a rapid rate which made Enlil extremely unhappy. “Inhis eyes the Anunnaki mission to Earth had become perverted.” Let's face it,this kind of situation was probably the furthest from his mind when they arrivedto extract gold from the ground. What is also fascinating was the environmentaleffect on the rapidly emerging new species. Here we have a new species which wassuddenly dropped into relatively alien conditions to them. They did not evolveinto their surroundings; their immune systems were not adjusted to themicroorganisms on Earth at that time, so we should not be surprised when we readabout the diseases which overcame humans. “In the days of Ziusudra plagues andpestilence the Earth afflicted…Aches, dizziness, chills, fevers the earthlingsoverwhelmed.”But Ninmah, the smart sister of the mighty brothers, was a true healer. “Let usthe earthlings curing teach, how themselves to remedy to learn.” Enlil wouldhave none of it. He was not going to do anything to help the new species surviveand flourish. “Let the earthlings by hunger and pestilence perish.” In his mindtheir stay on Earth was nearing the end and he would rather wipe out all lifebefore they departed for Nibiru. His ‘vengeful god’ personality was clearlyexposed. The land suffered too, nothing grew and winds, heat and drought hauntedthem. Nibiru was nearing its path close to the sun and strange things werehappening to planet Earth. Tremors and quakes became regular events and Enlilconferred with Anu on Nibiru about the strange activities. They set upmonitoring devices in the Abzu to observe the south pole. “Odd rumblings in theWhiteland's snow were recorded…The snow-ice that the Whiteland covers to slidinghas taken.” This is the first real evidence of the ending of the Ice Age,clearly captured in clay tablets. How could a scribe 4 500 years ago have knownanything about the events which preceded the flood, unless he was told bysomeone who was there? The detail in his text is too specific to have beenconveyed orally over thousands of years. It became clear that when Nibiru camearound the sun, it was going to cause havoc with Earth's gravity and have adevastating effect on the polar regions where the ice was already melting. “Thenext time Nibiru the Sun shall be nearing, Earth to Nibiru's netforce exposedshall be.” Those are highly insightful words by the Anunnaki on Nibiru, warningEnlil about a severe calamity awaiting the Earth.The Anunnaki started preparing for evacuation. They ceased all the smelting“…all the gold to Nibiru was lofted…for evacuation ready, a fleet of fastcelestial chariots to Earth returned.” Enlil called an urgent meeting of all theIgigi and Anunnaki commanders and revealed the “impending calamity” to them. “Toa bitter end Earth mission has come.” He made it clear that those who wanted toleave Earth had to do so without their earthling spouses. This was the momentEnlil had secretly been waiting for, to destroy the hordes of earthlings whohave taken over the world by their sheer numbers. Those among the Anunnaki andIgigi who chose to stay, were told to move to higher grounds and wait for thecalamity to pass. The other Anunnaki who did not want to return to Nibiru wouldwait for the events to play themselves out in their “Boats of Heaven” at theedge of Earth’s atmosphere. Then came the critical moment when the true humancharacter of many Anunnaki children born on Earth suddenly emerged. Marduk andall the other sons of Enki chose to stay behind. So did Enlil's sons. This was areally emotional time for the sensitive Ninmah; they all looked at her to hearher decision. “With pride her choice to stay she declared… my lifework is here…The earthlings my created I shall not abandon.”Then Enlil revealed his master plan for the human race. “Let the earthlings forthe abominations perish.” We can clearly hear the tone of the ‘god of vengeance’whose voice we would constantly hear in the Bible. But Enki disagreed verystrongly with his brother. After all it was he who created the humans in thefirst place, and he who had fathered the next species of civilised humans. “Awonderous Being by us was created, by us saved it must be.” A fierce argumenterupted between the brothers, where Enlil accused Enki of playing GOD. “Thepowers of the ‘Creator of All’ into your hands you have taken”, blaming Enki forall the abomination caused by the humans.As the commander of Earth, Enlil made the final call, and instructed all thosepresent to take an oath, which would cause the destruction of Humankind. “Nowthat a calamity by a destiny unknown has been ordained, let what must happen,happen.” Everyone pledged their oath except Enki, who stormed out of theassembly. “On Enlil alone let the responsibility forever rest.” As part of theevacuation activities, Enlil took the ME Tablets of Destinies to Sippar, theplace of the “Celestial Chariots” and buried them safely in a protectivechamber. So what were they all waiting for? What kind of calamity did theyexpect? A great flood of water, with a wave so high that it would devastate theentire planet. “When the avalanche of waters sweeps over the lands… In onesudden swoop to an extinction shall be doomed.” And so the preparations came toan end and they waited for the disaster to strike. This is the kind of advancedwarning the people of Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and Ethiopia wishthey’d had before the Tsunami devastated their lives. But the defiant Enki andhis sister Ninmah went to the Abzu and they collected all necessary specimenswhich would allow them to recombine all the life forms they had created onEarth. “Male and female essence and life eggs they collected… For safekeepingwhile in Earth circuit to be taken.”“In Sippar the Anunnaki gathered, the day of the deluge they awaited.” Enki wasnot done yet. After all, his flesh and blood, Ziusudra, was to be left behind toperish in the flood. This is the original story of the flood and how humanssurvived. Unlike the more naïve and simplified Biblical version of Noah, theSumerian tablets tell us in great detail to what length Enki went to helpZiusudra; how he guided him with precise plans to build the 'boat'; how to sealit with pitch and exactly what he should take into it. “The boat be one that canturn and tumble, the watery avalanche to survive…into it your family and kinfolkgather…water for drinking heap up…household animals also bring.” Although Enkiwas defiant against Enlil, he did not want to blatantly disregard the oath theyhad taken. Therefore he conveyed all this information to Ziusudra from behind areed hut wall, not to expose his face. His rather childish but effectiveargument was that he did not speak to Ziusudra, he spoke to a wall. “Anoverwhelming deluge coming from the south, lands and life shall devastate…Yourboat from its moorings it shall lift…the boat it shall turn and tumble…By youshall the civilised seed of man survive.” The differences between this versionand the Biblical story lies not only in its practical content, but the fact thatZiusudra took not only his immediate and extended family into the boat, but alsoother friends. The Biblical Noah's seed would simply have died out within a fewgenerations due to inbreeding. The part where Noah has to take all the animalstwo by two into the ark has always troubled me for reasons of improbability. Butthe story has in fact a very different origin, one which makes more sense, andis achievable. Remember that Enki and Ninmah collected all the essence of humansand creatures in the wilds? Well, they carefully stored this “essence” whichmust have been DNA, sperm and ova in appropriate containers for preservation.The tablets are very clear on this. A few days before the flood, Ningaldelivered a box to Ziusudra in the boat. “The life essence and life eggs ofliving creatures it contains, by the lord Enki and Ninmah collected… From thewrath of Enlil to be hidden, to life resurrected if Earth be willing.” Those arechilling words which would be repeated many times by the heroes of the Biblethousands of years later. The wrath of Enlil became the ‘wrath of god’ which haskept humanity fearful and obedient until today.And so the flood arrived as expected. It came in the 120th Shar, 432,000 yearsafter arrival, about 11,000 BC which is exactly when modern scholars claim theflood destroyed the world. It is also important to note that at that stageZiusudra was already 10 Shars old, which made him 36,000 Earth years. It is nowabsolutely clear that the flood was not caused by GOD in a moment of anger withhumanity, but that it was actually as a result of a cosmic event when the giantplanet of the Anunnaki came closer to Earth than it normally did, in its3600-year orbit. It was indeed a natural ‘calamity’ which was abused by theAnunnaki to destroy their troublesome creation; their slave species called man.Nibiru came into close proximity of Earth, causing havoc with gravity andseismic activity. It must have been very testing times for the fragile planet.The tablets tell us clearly that “For days before the Day of the Deluge theearth was rumbling, groan as with pain it did.” The time had come for theAnunnaki to depart. “Crouched in their boats of heaven, the Anunnaki heavenwardwere lofted.” We get a very clear picture of the exact events, not because ofsomeone's vivid imagination, but because the Anunnaki were actually observingthe flood from their spaceships in orbit. The descriptions are much too detailedand descriptive for someone from a primitive age to have imagined it.“The Earth began to shake, by a netforce before unknown it was agitated…In theWhiteland at Earth's bottom, the Earth's foundations were shaking…Then with aroar to a thousand thunders equal, off its foundations the icesheet slipped…ByNibiru's unseen netforce into the south sea crashing…One sheet of ice intoanother icesheet was smashing…The Whiteland's surface like a broken eggshell wascrumbling…Tidal waves arose, the very skies was the wall of waterreaching…Northward was the wall of water onrushing…The Abzu land it wasreaching…Towards the settled land it travelled…The Edin it overwhelmed.”We all know the kind of devastation a small Tsunami can bring, so just imagine atidal wave several hundred metres high moving northward from Antarctica at 500km per hour, like a giant circle around the world, destroying all the landslower than 2,000 metres above sea level. We get another bird's eye view from theAnunnaki in their orbit above the Earth. “Where there were dry lands, now was asea of water…Where mountains once to heaven their peaks raised, their tops nowlike islands were in the waters.” We also get a good glimpse of Ninmah'ssensitive side as the 'matriarch' of Humankind, who was very sad by what shewitnessed from up there. “My created like drowned dragonflies in a pond thewaters fill, all life by the rolling sea wave away was taken.”I take it that we all know how the flood story ends, and yes you are right, theboat did settle on the twin peaks of a mountain called Arata, known to most asArarat, which the tablets call “Mount of Salvation”. The first thing Ziusudradid when he emerged from the boat, was to praise the lord Enki for saving them.They built an altar, lit a fire and gave thanks with a lamb sacrifice, somethingwhich he was taught in his initiation into the priesthood. The floatingspaceships in orbit could not have been very comfortable, crammed with too manyAnunnaki, keen to get back to solid ground. It therefore was not long afterthings subsided that Enlil and Enki landed to assess the damage. “The situationto review, what to be done to determine.” At first the brothers were smiling andembracing but “…when Enlil the survivors saw… his fury no bounds had.” And onceagain we get a glimpse of the ‘god of vengeance’ who would rule and controlHumankind with oppression and violence for thousands of years. In a rage of furyEnlil attacked Enki. “Every earthling had to perish” he said. But Enki answeredhim by explaining the truth about Ziusudra. “He is no mere mortal my son he is.”After some deliberation and argument, Enlil was persuaded that it was the willof the Creator of All which saved the humans. And before the so-called OldenTimes came to an end, we are confronted by several more statements which wererepeated in the Bible many years later. Ninmah, who loved her human creationwhom she perfected with Enki, took an oath declaring that “the annihilation ofmankind shall never be repeated” and Enlil told Ziusudra to “be fruitful andmultiply.”You can imagine what kind of sedimentation resulted from a flood of this size.It took many years for the waters to subside, only to expose the valleys filledwith mud and silt. Everything in the Abzu and the Edin was buried under mud. Allthe cities in the whole of Mesopotamia were gone, buried under mud and silt. Butthe great stone platform, their landing place in the Cedar Mountains was stillthere and could be used, mainly because it was positioned much higher than alltheir other settlements. Some scholars like Zecharia Sitchin believe this to bethe ancient stone platform of Baalbek in northeast Lebanon. When you view thegiant megaliths, placed together to form a perfectly flat platform whichstretches around 90,000 square metres, you begin to wonder why prehistorichumans on Earth needed to build such a structure. The rocks weigh between 200and 1,200 tons each. Today, there are only a handful of giant-sized cranes thatcould pick such stones up. They are perfectly cut out and shaped with smoothsides to fit into each other almost like Lego blocks at the edges. So it wouldmake sense that this kind of platform did not get washed away, due to its sheersize and also its altitude. But what it did, was give the Anunnaki the crucialidea of how to deal with possible disasters in future. And what kind ofstructures could possibly withstand a similar disaster, while serving as animportant beacon in guiding the Anunnaki pilots when coming in from space. Youguessed right… the pyramids of Giza. Imagine having to land on a new planet forthe first time...would you not prefer a clear beacon which guides you directlyto the landing spot?PYRAMIDS FROM SPACE[../Images/475-1.jpg]A view of the pyramids from space. They not only served as landmarks, but theGreat Pyramid also housed the transmitter beacon which would guide the incomingpilots and astronauts. These giant structures were built after the flood, whenthe Anunnaki saw how resistant the stone structure at Baalbek was to the floodwaters. Egypt and the Red Sea was a visible landmark from high above the Earth.I would, and clearly the Anunnaki did too. And that is where the pyramids comeinto the picture a little later.The devastation was not only restricted to Earth, the Igigi arrived from Marssaying that their planet had also been devastated. “Lahmu by the passage ofNibiru was devastated… Its atmosphere was sucked out, its waters thereafterevaporated… A place of dust storms it is.” They realised that survival was nowtheir main concern. They retrieved the ME from the Creation Chamber which theyburied next to the launch site. It is fascinating that even the material whichwas used for the chamber is mentioned. It was diorite, the hardest stone knownto man, harder than iron. “The diorite chests with seals were fastened.” Theyretrieved a whole variety of items including the seeds they brought from Nibiru,which enabled them to start planting crops again. But while the survivors onEarth were getting on with rebuilding their lives, the word from Nibiru was notso reassuring. The gravitational activity between the other planets and Nibiruhad also effected them. “The shield of gold dust was torn, the atmosphere wasdwindling again.” Suddenly the scramble for gold became critical. Just when theywere ready to pack up and go home, the urgency had returned. But this time therewere no more workers in the Abzu, they were all killed by the water, and eventhe Anunnaki were few in numbers as most of them returned to Nibiru. By fate orby destiny which could have only been preordained by the Creator of All, “…onEarth and on Nibiru there was desperation.”The task of mining gold from ore was impossible with the few numbers of peopleleft behind. They surveyed the world again and Ninurta returned with good newsfrom distant lands beyond the ocean. The mountains had been eroded by the flood,exposing rich sediments of gold which were oozing out in pure nuggets. Thesewere the valleys around lake Titicaca on the border of Bolivia and Peru, and thebeginning of the ancient Inca civilisation before the Europeans came to plunderit. “…Nuggets large and small to the rivers below fell down, without mining canthe gold be hauled.” Enlil and Enki were astounded. “Gold, pure gold, refiningand smelting not required, all about was lying.”And so began the South American prehistoric gold rush. But they needed to createa landing site nearby, from where to take the gold to Nibiru. And so we uncoverthe practical origins of the Nazca plain. Much has been written and speculatedabout the so-called Nazca lines. They have certainly challenged the bestarchaeologists for centuries. The Sumerian clay tablets provide the answers oncemore. For all those who have wondered and marvelled at the strange markings andspectacles on the flat hard desert-like ground at Nazca in Peru, the answers arecrystal clear in cuneiform text. “Now let us a new place to celestial chariotsestablish, therefrom the gold to Nibiru send…For a new plain whose soil hasdried and hardened they searched…In a desolate peninsula such a plain theyfound…Flat as a lake it was, by white mountains it was surrounded.” This fitsthe exact description of the desolate peninsula of Nazca which is surrounded bythe Andes mountain range which would have had “ white” snow on their peaks.[../Images/476-1.jpg]X MARKS THE SPOTThe symbol of the cross is well documented in ancient civilisations. Could it bethat the Anunnaki used this symbol on the Nazca plain to indicate their landingspot to incoming craft?As seen in this satellite picture this approach does the job quite superbly.Ninurta had been living there before the flood and he knew where to locate thedescendants of Ka-in. The locals who survived the flood knew Ninurta and reveredhim as their protector god. They could be used to gather the gold and othermetals, they knew the art of smelting and handling of metals. Ninurta explainedto Enlil and Enki “As the protector of their forefathers they me recall…Thegreat protector they call me.” At this stage even Enlil who had hoped for thecomplete destruction of all humans was pleased to find the survivors. The gods’future was suddenly in the hands of the humans. While the collection of goldbegan to swing into action in South America, the Anunnaki were not simply goingto abandon their original settlements in Mesopotamia. For those who have spokenabout the pyramids of Giza being built as a mirror image of Orion's Belt, thereis much vindication in the tablets. The Anunnaki decided to build a new landingsite, “…a new place of the celestial chariots.” The tablets further tell us thatin the peninsula they chose, “…the heavenly ways of Anu and Enlil on Earth werereflected… Let the new place of chariots precisely on that boundary bereflected… Let the heart of the plain the heavens reflect.” Enlil did thesurveying from a sky ship, but it was the talented Ningishzidda who once moreshowed off his great architectural skills. That is why the latter civilisationof Egypt would come to call him Thoth or Tehuti, ‘the divine measurer’ and thegod of science and knowledge. Ningishzidda designed, planned and executed thebuilding of the three pyramids of Giza.WAY OF GOD ENLIL - ANCIENT PLANISPHERE (FLAT CIRCULAR MAP)[../Images/477-1.jpg]When this disk was first discovered in the Royal Library at Nineveh it wasthought to be linked to ancient witchcraft. It is an Assyrian copy of a Sumerianoriginal. An ancient astronomical map divided into 8 segments, showing geometricshapes, unseen on any other ancient artefact and drawn with precision. Itincludes a host of astronomical content with a mathematical curve previouslyassumed not to have been known in ancient times, also introducing the 360degrees of a circle. The direct translation of the Sumerian inscriptions on thisdisk basically describe the “rout map” by which the “god Enlil went by theplanets”. It includes operating instructions with altitude and weather patternobservations on various instruments. It also clearly shows the dots representingplanets and Earth as the 7th planet to which Enlil would travel. The triangle onthe left represents the far cosmos, while the destination is the triangle on theright converging towards the landing spot. Other translations are: “The ruler'sdomain on the mountainous land” and “The way of god Enlil”. It also contains acomplex mathematical formula which has perplexed astronomers ever since and asyet remains unexplained.Not as tombs as most people still erroneously claim, but as very importantlandmarks, and indestructible beacons which made up part of the landing grid oflandmarks for pilots. “To demarcate the landing corridor…To demarcate thelanding corridor's boundary, ascent and descent to secure.” And so the threegreat pyramids were planned and measured as the beacons of their new futurelanding site. They witnessed how solid the landing platform at Baalbek was, sothey applied those principles of using heavy rocks to build the new pyramidbeacons in the south as part of a giant grid of landmarks, which would guide thepilots towards the landing site. The tablets describe how they chose the variouslandmarks which included the old platform in the Cedar Mountains as part of thedirectional grid. “Let the landing place in the Cedar Mountains be a part of thefacilities.” But why did they build the pyramids in that specific place, whileall the other fixed points they had chosen were natural landmarks? This is why…“where the second set of twin peaks was required, mountains there were none…onlya water-clogged valley from the ground protruded.” This is a perfect descriptionof Giza all those years ago, after the flood.And so Ningishzidda came to the fore as he began to design the most mysteriousand controversial structure on Earth, the Great Pyramid of Giza. “Artificialpeaks thereon we can raise” he said to the others, referring to Giza. But beforehe began the huge undertaking, he built a smaller prototype to test some of hiscalculations. That was the smallest of the three pyramids, or as we know it, thePyramid of Menkaure. “On the flatland, above the river's valley, Ningishzidda ascale model built…The rising angles and four smooth sides with it he perfected.”Only after he was satisfied with the model, he continued to build the big ones,and we also learn how they managed to cut the stones so smoothly and perfectly,so quickly and seemingly with ease. “Next to it a larger peak he placed, itssides to Earth's four corners he set…By the Anunnaki with their tools of power,were its stones cut and erected.” The next one to be built was the Pyramid ofKhafre, as outlined in Sumerian texts. The reason we know this, is because thefirst two pyramids do not have a major network of passages and chambers, whichis exactly the way they are described. “Next to it a larger peak he placed, itssides to Earth's four corners he placed.” Only once the second one wascompleted, he took on the task of constructing the Great Pyramid, with all itssecret passages which all had a specific purpose. This purpose was mostcertainly not to serve as a tomb for some ‘earthling pharaoh’ thousands of yearslater. “Beside it, in precise location, the peak that was its twin he placed…With galleries and chambers for pulsating crystals he designed it.” There wehave it, written in perfect clay, the pyramids were to be landmarks and beaconswhich transmitted signals and light to guide incoming pilots and astronauts. Alarge number of scholars have shown beyond doubt that none of the pyramids ofthe 3rd and 4th dynasty in Egypt have ever produced any evidence of burials,bodies, sarcophagi or even inscriptions to that effect. There is no evidencewhatsoever that they were built as tombs. This popular myth was created manyyears later when modern archaeologists began to fill the mesmerised world withfantastic stories created by their imagination only. Remember, that unlike thetombs of the Valley of the Kings, the Great Pyramids of Giza do not have anyinscriptions at all, anywhere, which refer to the burial of a king. The onlyinscription of king Khufu in the Great Pyramid is on a rock in one of thesmaller spaces above the King's Chamber. This is highly suspicious and points tobeing a much later addition to the structure.But the references to the pyramids do not end there. They called it Ekur, ‘HouseWhich Like a Mountain Is’. They placed what they called the Nibiru Crystals inthe chambers of the pyramid and “Enlil by his own hand the Nibiru crystalsactivated… the eerie lights began to flicker, an enchanting hum the stillnessbroke… Outside the capstone, all at once was shining.” This was a greatachievement for them, most likely inspired by the resilience of the landing sitewhich was not destroyed in the flood. They had built a landmark that wouldwithstand floods and other kinds of catastrophes, except the constant onslaughtof future human plunderers. The Anunnaki assembled to witness the spectacle andNinmah even wrote and recited a poem.“House that is like mountain with pointed peakFor Heaven-Earth it is equipped, the handiwork of the Anunnaki it isHouse bright and dark, house of heaven and EarthFor the celestial boats it was put together, by the Anunnaki builtHouse whose interior with a reddish light of heaven glowsApulsating beam that far and high reaches it emitsLofty mountain of mountains, great and lofty fashionedBeyond the understanding of Earthlings it isHouse of equipment, lofty house of eternity…”The poem goes on praising the structure and its maker. To honour the builder,they agreed to build a monument nearby, with the face of the builder and thebody of a lion, which symbolized the ‘age’during which it was built. “Let usbeside the twin peaks a monument create, the Age of the Lion it announce… Theface of Ningishzidda, the peak's designer, let its face be… Towards the place ofcelestial chariots gaze.” The speculations about the age and meaning of theSphinx have been as rife as the confusion around the pyramids. But as you cansee from this excerpt, the tablets make it very clear when and why the Sphinxwas built. As always, the answers seem to be much less complicated and moreprobable than the theories by historians who make pronouncements based onromantic assumptions. All those who argue against this information will probablyeventually find that all the clues will lead them back to this conclusion. Anumber of researchers have already made such suggestions, implying that theSphinx must have been around in times when water caused most of the erosion ofthe monument, and not wind as others assumed. Graham Hancock goes into greatdetail in his book Fingerprints of the Gods to explain the geological anderosion factors which led to the Sphinx being in the state it is today. It wasmainly water, then wind which eroded it. This could only have happened thousandsof years ago when Giza had more rain and the flood waters could reach theSphinx. Therefore many scholars now believe the Sphinx to have been built around10,000 BC. This would corroborate the information we find in the clay tablets.But even while the building was in progress, Marduk started causing troubleagain, complaining that his younger brother Ningishzidda was getting all theglory and that once again he had been passed by. A period of heated debatesfollowed during which all the Anunnaki children made all kinds of claims todifferent lands, and demanded that they be given more control over loyalearthlings and command of their own regions. “By the clamour for domains Ninurtaand his brother were also aroused… Lands for themselves and devoted earthlingseveryone was demanding.” The wise and rational Ninmah came to the fore, playingthe part of the peacemaker. She made proposals which clearly prevented violentconflict among the Anunnaki. “Let not the celebration a contest become, Ninmahamidst the raised voices shouted… For peace to prevail, the habitable landsbetween us should be apart set.” For her role as a wise and calming sister, theydecided to change her name on that day. Ninmah became known as Ninharsag,‘Mistress of the Mountainhead’. And so they divided the lands between thesiblings and their followers. Ninharsag was given the “Land of the Missiles” orTilmun, better known to modern humans as the Sinai Peninsula, which was out ofbounds to humans. This land was declared as neutral territory under Ninharsag'scontrol. “The habitable lands to the east thereof for Enlil and his offspring weset apart.” This was the whole of the Near East or ‘Olden Lands’ where theAnunnaki settled at first, which included Mesopotamia, Akkad, Babylonia, Assyriaand Sumer. The “dark-hued” lands and the Abzu (Africa) was given to Enki and hisclan which included his earthling son Ziusudra. Enki decided to appease hisoldest son Marduk, who also happened to be the regular instigator of trouble, sohe gave him the “dark-hued” lands which we know as Egypt. Under his hand we seethe sudden emergence of the new Egyptian civilisation of earthlings. But the olddays of the ‘primitive worker’ slaves were gone. Suddenly everyone clamoured forthe “civilised worker” to be their slaves and perform all kinds of tasks.One can clearly detect from the rather stressful and manic period in the livesof the Anunnaki, that they were very preoccupied with their own personalstruggle, family quibbles and problems with the mission to Earth. They didn'twant to have to deal with additional complaints of the humans who began tomultiply again. But this time the humans were mixing with the Anunnaki and Igigion a regular basis, many of them expecting to be granted the same treatment asthe gods, as opposed to being treated like the lesser human slave species. Along period of uneasy stability followed while the gold supplies were beingdepleted and the occasional violent confrontation between the Anunnaki youtherupted. The tablets describe various battles in detail where fierce andsophisticated weapons were used, which could not possibly have existed in thosedays. Most of the conflict was regarding land, instigated by Marduk and theIgigi who were making all kinds of new demands and breaking rules at everyopportunity. The way in which humans have fought over land since then is anotherperfect example of the genetic hold this Anunnaki DNA has had over us forthousands of years. The incredible desire to conquer lands and invade newterritory is so distinctly visible in the behaviour of the young offspring whichthe older and wiser Anunnaki produced on Earth. And so the incredible familydrama of the Anunnaki continued among the extended family and their allies,while the humans became mere spectators on the sideline of this global stage. Itwould not be long however, before Humankind began to play out their own drama ofcultures attacking and killing one another, but not before they were elevated toa higher level of civilisation by their makers. There is a certain irony in thatstatement which is indicative of the fact that the level of civilisation hadvery little to do with the initial behaviour of Humankind, but it was theguiding hand of violent, selfish gods who manipulated humans to achieve theirown objectives. The Anunnaki saw us in the same light we see the many kinds ofdomesticated dogs, which we breed for various purposes. We adore them, but theyare not quite equal to us, because they are animals. And so the ‘gods’ perceivedthe human creation to be part animal and disposable.The unrest among the gods continued and grew to the point where the Igigiinvaded the “Place of the Chariots”. Marduk lost both his sons which made himeven more bitter, and all this instability in the Old Land caused Enlil to beconcerned about the safety of their space port. This prompted him to build a newspace port: “Bond Heaven-Earth” facility in Ninurta's lands beyond the sea, aswas mentioned earlier. They built it “...in the mountain lands beyond the oceansbeside the great lake...”, which was Lake Titicaca. “At the foot of the mountainwhere the gold nuggets were scattered… facility in secret establish we must.”This is when the Nazca plain was first utilised by the Anunnaki, as theyintroduced advanced knowledge to the South American humans.Dumuzi was Enki's youngest and most cherished son. He was described as beingsensitive and caring and artistic. At the unveiling of the Great Pyramid, he metInanna, who was Enlil's granddaughter, and they fell hopelessly in love. Manyancient love songs and poems were written about the couple, they were like theprimordial Romeo and Juliet. They became inseparable and Inanna was described asbeing “...beautiful beyond description she was, in martial arts with Anunnakiheroes she competed.” She was also known as Ishtar, Venus and by many othernames in all the cultures around the world. No matter what name they gave her,she was everyone's “Goddess of Love”. Inanna had great aspirations ofpeacemaking between nations and people, this was one of her strongestcharacteristics. Dumuzi was given lands above the Abzu, with buffalo in thereeds, with rivers and cattle. This must have been very close to Marduk's Egypt,which the older brother did not take kindly and became insanely jealous. Hisjealousy was not only because of the lands which were given to Dumuzi, butInanna's big plans for her beloved. She wanted Dumuzi's name to rise above allAnunnaki, and this was dangerous territory which had been claimed by Marduk manyyears ago. He would not have his baby brother upset his master plan. So Mardukdevised a devious plan to entrap Dumuzi in a sexual act. He set up theirhalf-sister Geshtinanna to seduce Dumuzi with the promise that their offspringwill be the successor to the throne because of their line of seed. She must havehad some real powers of persuasion, or some sedatives, or Dumuzi simply behavedlike a highly sexed male, who could not refuse the advances of a beautiful girl.But in the middle of the night Dumuzi panicked and ran away, through a river andover rocks where he slipped, fell and killed himself in a freak accident.Enki was devastated, displaying some very human emotions which we have alsoinherited from his active gene pool. “So did Enki bewail and lament… Why am Ipunished, why has fate against me turned… Enki rent his clothes, on his foreheadhe put ashes.” This tearing of a piece of clothing when mourning was adopted bythe Jews in later years. The growing conflict between siblings knew no end.Inanna's sister, Ereshkigal must have been insanely jealous of Inanna's looksand her future role in the hierarchy of the Anunnaki, because she not onlyrefused to help Inanna in her search for Dumuzi, but she accused her of plottingsomething against Marduk, and she infected Inanna with some kind of deadlydisease or virus. “Let loose against her the sixty diseases.” This is mostcertainly a part of the tablets which must have given rise to elements ofwitchcraft in Africa and the witchdoctors who still practice an ancient form ofhealing in Africa. Ereshkigal lived in the Abzu, where she was known as the‘Mistress of the Lower World’ which was southern Africa. It was not only herskills with medicines and disease which inspired many tales, but the mysteriousthings which Enki did in his quest to find Inanna, must have also been thesource of the many ancient African traditions of strange creatures with awesomepowers; indestructible bodies; and not like humans in their ways. What Enki didnext in his quest to find Inanna, is still a mystery to most who have studiedthe tablets. “From clay of the Abzu, Enki two emissaries fashioned, beingswithout blood, by death rays unharmed.” He sent them out to find Inanna. Thesemust have been some awesome prehistoric clones, because as much as I try, Icannot fathom what else the scribe could have meant. They do however closelyresemble the ‘mythological’ creatures called Erinyes or Furies, as described inGreek and Roman myths and I suggest you have another look at chapter 14 for aquick reminder. But they did what they were sent to do. They found “…thelifeless body of Inanna… hanging from a stake… Upon the corpse the clayemissaries a Pulser and an Emitter directed… The water of life on her theysprinkled…In her mouth the plant of life they placed… Inanna stirred, her eyesshe opened, from the dead Inanna arose.” It is not clear why certain Anunnakiwere revived from the dead, while others were not.This had a devastating effect on relations between Enlil and Enki. The Enliliteswanted Marduk dead, while Enki's clan argued that while Marduk was involved inthe incident, “it was not by Marduk's hand did Dumuzi die.” Inanna was not goingto take this lying down. In her mind, Marduk was responsible for the death ofher beloved Dumuzi, so she launched an attack on Marduk with the intention tokill him. “By Inanna was the warfare begun…Marduk to battle shechallenged...Retribution for her beloved's death she wanted.” Anotherfascinating glimpse into the future behaviour of humans, challenging each otherto battle and duels and other forms of violent conflict. A very noble kind ofgesture, by which European noblemen would invite each other into thecountryside, put on very smart clothing and then try to kill each other in aduel. Once again we read about fierce weapons which caused death and destructionover a wide area as the two engaged in battle. There were many earthlingcasualties, which must have remained in the tales told throughout the ages,about the battle of the gods. We are very familiar with similar so-calledmythological stories from all cultures. The simple explanation for such ancienttales are that there were many such conflicts between the Anunnaki gods, whichmust have been witnessed by the earthlings in the affected areas. Those were notdaydreams or mythological hallucinations of primitive people with an overactivemind, those were real events in ancient times, before writing was bestowed onthe earthlings, when they still depended on oral stories being passed downbetween generations.Marduk retreated north towards the new artificial mountains in Giza, where hetook refuge inside the chambers of the Great Pyramid they called Ekur. “Withweapons of brilliance… Inanna the hiding place attacked… while Utu the Igigi andtheir hordes of earthlings beyond Tilmun held off.” Remember that the Igigi wereMarduk's followers. But the pyramid demonstrated the purpose with which it wasconstructed, to withstand any kind of disaster. Inanna's weapons the “stonestructure could not surmount, its smooth sides her weapons deflected.” We learntwo very important bits of information from these written lines. Firstly, thatthe pyramid did have a smooth finish outside, covering the building blocks; andsecondly, the description of passages and chambers of the pyramid during thechase inside. The kind of detail in the description would have only been knownby the builders of the pyramid or those who had the privilege of having beeninside themselves. All the proof we need to substantiate that the Anunnakiactually built the pyramids long before the Pharaohs inherited them.“Then Ninurta of the secret entrance learnt, the swivel stone on the north sidehe found…Through a dark corridor Ninurta passed, the grand gallery hereached…Its vault by the many-hued emissions of the crystals like a rainbow wasaglitter…Ninurta up the gallery kept going…Into the upper chamber, the place ofthe Great Pulsating Stone, Marduk retreated…At its entrance Marduk the slidingstone locks lowered, from one and all admission they barred.” These detaileddescriptions could not possibly be coincidental or some ancient person’simagination. And yet there are those who claim this is all a myth?Some decided to leave Marduk in there to die for his transgressions but hisfamily protested. The wise Ninharsag came to the rescue once more, resolving thedeadlock. Marduk would be rescued but certain conditions had to be met. “TheIgigi who Marduk follow, the landing place must give up and abandon…To the landof no return must Marduk in exile go.” Then the task was up to Ningishzidda, thearchitect, to get Marduk out of the pyramid. “Adoorway in the stones they willcut… a twisted passage they shall bore… At the vortex of the hollowing throughthe stones they will break through…Up the grand gallery they will continue… Thethree stone bars they will raise… Marduk's death prison they will reach.” Thosesound like words of someone who had a very good knowledge of the inside of thepyramid. Not some kind of airy-fairy dreamer imagining gods and myths because hewas bored. But many historians will still want to make you believe suchnonsense. And so it was that Marduk was rescued by Ninurta and brought outalive, although barely. “Carefully through the twisting shaft they the lordlowered, to fresh air they him brought.” Ninurta also examined all the hi-techequipment inside. “Its Gut Stone, that directions determined, Ninurta ordered tobe taken out… The twenty seven pairs of Nibiru crystals he examined… To removethe whole ones… Others with his beam he pulverised… To replace the incapacitatedbeacon, a mount near the place of the celestial chariots was chosen.” And so thefunction of the great pyramid was moved to a mountain top and the empty chambersbecame the fascination of archaeologists ever since. These latest developmentsrequired that control over old lands were to be evaluated and lordship over newlands had to be assigned. So Enlil and Enki divided the lands between theirother sons again. The most significant allocation was that of Egypt, which wasnow given to Ningishzidda, while Marduk was exiled. Inanna demanded a land ofher own, and after much debating, she was given the land of the Indus Valley.That bit of information has fascinated me. The highly sexed goddess of love whowas crazy about poetry is given the Indus Valley region, where by completecoincidence the highly sexual Indian cultures originate from, including the KamaSutra philosophy of sex. Another coincidence? The sixty four arts oflove­-passion-pleasure also coincidentally originated in India. There are manydifferent versions of the arts which began in Sanskrit and were later translatedinto other languages, like Tibetan and Persian. Many of the original texts aremissing and the only clue to their existence is in other texts. Vatsyayana’sversion of the Kama Sutra is a well known translation which survived. Is it alsocoincidence that unlike other religions, the ancient Vedic praises to the godsare in poetic form? And it just so happens that the goddess of love was a bigfan of poetry?But the times on Earth had undergone great change. “The earthlings haveproliferated… Of civilised mankind by Ziusudra there were descendants…WithAnunnaki seed they were intermixed…Igigi who intermarried roamed about…In thedistant lands of Ka-in kinfolk survived.” The numbers surviving pure Anunnakiwere very small and they had growing problems on many fronts. Conflict amongthemselves, large numbers of humans making all kinds of demands, supply of foodwas problematic, humans were getting out of control. The Anunnaki had to come upwith a master plan to take control of the situation, to ensure that humans werekept in their place, stayed obedient and worshipped the gods. “Few and loftywere the Anunnaki who from Nibiru had come… Few were their perfect descendants.”But to devise a plan for the future they needed the wisdom and advice of Anu.“How over mankind lofty to remain, how to make the many the few obey and serve.”And so it was that “To come to Earth one more time Anu decided.” And so we readin no uncertain terms that the gods wanted to remain ‘lofty’ over the humans.By now, enough time had passed for the flooded plains and valleys to dry andbecome habitable again. Some of the ‘black-headed people’or primitive workers inthe south of the Abzu, who survived the flood, came in search of food andprobably to also get some guidance from their gods, who lived in the north. Thedescendants of Ziusudra and his son Shem started to come down from theirprimitive dwellings in the mountains to resettle in the valleys and plains. Theywere among the few who were well trained and skilled in the art of farming. TheAnunnaki decided to rebuild their original cities on Earth, where theyoriginally stood, but were now covered with soil from the flood. They alsodecided to use the more civilised humans for providing food for the growingpopulations of survivors on a much larger scale. This would however require thegeneral upliftment of the slave species. “Upon the newly dried soil, theAnunnaki let them settle, food for all to provide… On top of the myriads of mudand silt a new Eridu was marked out.” If you remember, Eridu was the first cityof Enki when he arrived on Earth, and now he built his new home in the middle ofthe brand new Eridu, while Enlil built his new home where the old Nibru-kistood. It was a seven-stepped ziggurat pyramid. “A stairway rising to theheaven, to the topmost platform led…His tablets of destinies did Enlil therekeep, with his weapons it was protected.” It seems that Enlil was the one whoalways used weapons to protect his dwellings, a habit which Marduk learnt verywell in his dictatorship over Egypt.They built a brand new palace for Anu and Antu's (Anu’s wife) arrival in themiddle of the Edin, calling it Unug-ki, ‘Delightful Place’. We learn about theageing effect that living on Earth had on the Anunnaki when Anu arrived. “Ateach other they looked, ageing to examine…Greater in Shars were the parents,younger than the children they looked.” They debated this for some timeconcerned about this strange phenomenon. But Anu reassured them that those whoreturned to Nibiru were treated and cured of this ageing problem. A number ofbanquets and astronomical observations took place during which they awaited therising of various planets as night fell, including Nibiru. “From the topmoststep…The red-haloed Nibiru into view came…The heavenly planet of the lord Anu.”As you know by now, this was not the first time that we read about the 'redhued' planet of the Anunnaki.The appearance of their planet made them go through another spell of deeplyphilosophical deliberation about the past events on Earth, their role in all ofit, and “was the creation of the earthlings also destined?” They came to thestartling conclusion that “The will of the Creator of All is clear to see… TheEarth to earthlings belongs…To preserve and advance them we were intended.” Thisis what Anu shared with his extended family on Earth. And so by this newly foundunderstanding of their role in the greater scheme of things, they agreed toreorganise humans and teach them much more about civilisation. “If that is ourmission here, let us accordingly act, so did Enki say.” It is important towitness once again that it was Enki who led the drive to uplift and educatehumans, as he tried to do many times before. His brother and his eldest sonMarduk, would however follow a different path of educating humans, introducing along legacy of brutality and control over them. But for now, they had to startfrom scratch again, establishing cities for humans and “therein sacredprecincts, abodes for the Anunnaki create.” And so we learn about why the manytemples to worship the many gods were built in the ancient cities. We also learnthat this was the true beginning of kingship and priesthood in the world, as theAnunnaki chose appropriate humans to perform those tasks once more. “Kingship ason Nibiru on Earth to establish, crown and sceptre to a chosen man give.” Thisanswered many questions in my own mind. For I have always been troubled by thecomplex and shady origins of kingship on Earth. I could never be convinced bythe popular theories surrounding the origins of royalty and why it would havebeen necessary for kings or royalty to suddenly emerge from a group of ancient,primitive cultures. Although you will find many historians who spew forth manyarguments why kingships were a natural progression in human social andstructural evolution. Their arguments continue to be highly speculative, basedon the popular views of the origins of Humankind, which have very little to dowith the truths revealed to us in the ancient clay tablets. The king, newlyappointed by the Anunnaki, would convey the word of the Anunnaki to the peopleand enforce “work and dexterity” on them. This was pretty much the earlybeginning of the Old Testament and introduced the way in which the gods began tocontrol humans.The priests had an equally important role to fulfil from that point in history.They were to be taught “secret knowledge”, to teach civilisation to mankind andto serve the Anunnaki as lofty lords and worship them in the temples. Such talkabout secret knowledge is fascinating. It is possible that it was this licenseto teach humans, which caused Enki to continue his ‘secret society’movementwhich has been successfully traced all the way back to Edin by William Bramleyin his astonishing book Gods of Eden? After all, he was the ‘serpent’ whoconstantly wanted to uplift humanity!To achieve all this growth and development on Earth, the Anunnaki decided toestablish four new regions which would be governed by appointed gods. Three ofthese areas were set aside for humans and the fourth for the Anunnaki, which wasnot accessible to humans. Enlil received the old lands, as he pretty much didbefore, including the Edin and all of Mesopotamia, or what became the Biblicalregions in time to come; Enki retained all of Africa and Inanna, Anu's belovedgreat granddaughter was given the lands of the Indus Valley. The fourth regionwas reserved for the Anunnaki, in the Sinai Peninsula, or the ‘Place of theChariots’ and declared out of bounds to humans.Anu wanted to see his grandson Marduk, so the party departed for the landsbeyond the ocean. First they built a palace for Anu in the new golden land whichwas South America. All the buildings were covered in gold, even the statues andflowers in the gardens were made of gold, displaying incredibly intricateworkmanship like never seen before. This sounds identical to the golden citydescribed by Cortes when he first discovered the immense wealth in the Americasand stumbled upon a golden city of exactly such description. Anu saw theabundance of gold in this new land and how it was attained from the rivers nearthe lake in the mountains. He was also shown how a new metal was created onEarth by combining copper with tin. The result was a strong new metal which theycalled Anak and we call bronze. Anu was obviously pleased with the progress andrealised that the time of the Anunnaki on Earth was coming to a close. “There isgold here enough for many Shars to come...” he said and called the lake Anak. Ifwe scratch deeply enough we are likely to find references to such a name in theancient Inca traditions, or possibly Peruvian and Bolivian cultures. What isrevealed to us next is that Marduk came from the north to see Anu, which makesit pretty obvious that he must have been involved in the rise of the earlyMexican civilisations, which were slightly different from the rest and yetshared many common signs of Anunnaki interventions, especially the ‘FlyingSerpent’ god. And if Enki was the flying serpent god, it would explain why hefrequented this part of the world – to visit his son Marduk. The architecturalstyles and social building blocks are too similar to all the others around theworld, not to have been driven by the planned ‘civilisation drive’ of theAnunnaki at the time. Anu felt a great sense of pity for his grandson Marduk,for the way in which his fate had separated him from the other sons of theAnunnaki and caused him to become an outcast. And so he pardoned and blessedMarduk, which was probably all the license the young rebel needed to justify hisactions of defiance in time to come.Anu was to depart and we are reintroduced to the new landing place they hadcreated on the Nazca plain. Anu gave his final instruction on how to deal withearthlings. “From the golden place, high in the mountain, all who had gatheredto the plain below they went… There stretching to the horizon, Ninurta a newplace for the chariots had prepared… Give mankind knowledge, up to a measuresecrets of heaven and earth them teach.” We have seen that the concept of timehad a totally different meaning to the Anunnaki and that a few Shar, or fewthousand years was not an unusual timeframe to deal with. It is however a notionway outside of our human frame of reference. We can hardly comprehendcircumstances which prevailed 200 years ago, so how can we possibly try to wrapour simple minds around epochs lasting 3 600 years? But those are the realitiesthroughout the ancient times on Earth which led us to the point where we aretoday. This last interaction between Anu and the leading Anunnaki on Earth wasalmost within our grasp of comprehension because it must have taken place some5000 BC, around the time we see the real evidence of a true civilisation withthe knowledge of writing emerging on Earth. This fits in well with the finalinstructions given by Anu to his commanders on Earth. “Laws of justice andrighteousness teach them, then depart and leave.” Those are crucial words toponder, as we ask ourselves, ‘where are the Anunnaki today’? The answers may liein that single statement. The Anunnaki finished their golden explorations anddeparted, leaving humanity to their own device. Or did they? There would stillcome a period of about 7,000 years, bringing us to our present time, which wasfilled with confusion and continued conflict, causing the virtual annihilationof the planet and taking humanity through the very murky biblical times. Thiswas the time when the Anunnaki began to count their stay on Earth in orbits ofEarth-years and not orbits of Nibiru or Shars, as they had been doing upto thatpoint. “In the Age of the Bull, to Enlil dedicated, was the count of Earth yearsbegun.” (Bull 4380 BC -2220 BC)Nevertheless, those words of Anu “Give mankind knowledge, up to a measuresecrets of heaven and earth them teach...” were very important in the muchgreater scheme of things, reaching right into the 21st century. The thousands ofyears which followed became more widely documented and recorded in various formsand in different cultures where humans were being uplifted and nurtured by theAnunnaki gods. Because the period which followed has become known as the timewhen sudden ancient civilisation emerged. We now know why and how it emerged,under the watchful eye and guidance of the Anunnaki. But their internal familyproblems only escalated from this point in time, leaving humans as vulnerablebystanders in the great struggle for power among the Anunnaki. Enlil would dohis best to control his extended family on Earth, constantly having to deal withthe human problem as a side issue. Very soon the humans began to emulate theirgods, initiating conflicts and aggression against each other. But those humanconflicts were often driven by the gods of biblical times, as becomes very clearfrom the many scriptures of the Old Testament. The god of vengeance would becomethe omnipotent force which began to rule over humanity with an iron fist.However, what we need to consider is, was there only one ‘god’ in the OldTestament who ruled over humans, or were there more than one, leading toconfusion among humans and even greater conflict between the Anunnaki gods totake control of the world and its slave species with it?After Anu's final departure Marduk began to make a move to assert his rightfulcontrol over the world, which was promised to him by Enki at the very beginningof time on Earth. But as we have seen, through an unforeseen set ofcircumstances the young Marduk was always somehow left out of the distributionof power and responsibility. This is why he finally snapped and decided to takewhat was ‘rightfully’ his. We should therefore not be surprised to see thelevels of uncertainty by Enlil and Enki about how to deal with the problem. Theyboth realised that Marduk had a really legitimate case to make; his forcefulmethods however, were not so convincing.The period which followed was the miracle of civilisation. This was the timewhen so-called primitive man stepped out of the caves and started to displayvery high levels of intelligence, when the knowledge and understanding of modernsocieties came to him virtually overnight. The reason for that is simple and ithad nothing to do with some miraculous fast-track evolution or anything asdramatic as that. It was simply that the Anunnaki had strict instructions fromtheir leader Anu, to do exactly that; train the humans and leave. And so itbegan. Humankind everywhere was taught the basic skills of survival by theirAnunnaki gods. Remember that there were many gods who looked after the villages,towns and cities. Those were the members of the extended Anunnaki family whowere assigned to look over humans and keep them under control. These gods werelike field soldiers in many cases, looking after a distant outpost. When thegeneral or commander came to town, there would normally be a celebration in theform of an offering and worshipping in the temple. Every settlement had a templespecifically designed for such purpose. We have already explored the lavishtemples which were erected for the patron god of each city, with its fresh waterand shady garden, a place to rest and a place where people could make theirofferings. There was also a strict menu of what each god preferred to eat. Thosemenus would have to be prepared, sometimes several times a day, as differentgods had different taste preferences. The role of the high priest was to ensurethat the gods were looked after and in return the priest would be giveninstructions to convey to his people. Avery simple setup if you think of it. Butsomehow it was all twisted out of context over the past few thousand years,spawning human-made religions which became trapped between the needs of the godsand their control of the people.I must say that while I was reading all this information staring at me from thepages of various books, I constantly had to stop and remind myself that I wasnot reading a great novel, but I was actually reading the actual words writtenby ancient Sumerian scribes carved into clay some 4,000 to 5,500 years ago. Iwould suggest you do the same. It is very important to keep reminding oneself ofthis reality, because the content is so fantastic that it begins to sound like ascience fiction screenplay conjured up by some Hollywood writer to attract massappeal. Ask yourself once more, what possible motive would a scribe who wasappointed by a king all those years ago have, to capture such content sopainstakingly in clay?And so the civilisation of the humans began. “Where once cities of the Anunnakialone had stood, cities for both them and earthlings now arose.” The humans weretaught everything from making bricks, building, architecture, schooling,reading, writing, calculating, laws of justice, planting, harvesting, farming,finding water, using the wheel, riding of chariots, and basically everything weknow today, which we have inherited from those early civilisations. There were afew well known landmarks like the city of Lagash, where Ninurta kept his “BlackSkybird” and the city of Sippar from where Utu promulgated the laws of justicein a place called “Ebabbar – Shining House.”The time had come, to bestow kingship of sceptre and crown on Humankind and soit was that the first human king was appointed in the city of Kishi or Kish. Hewas called ‘Mighty Man’ by Ninurta. Kish became known as ‘Sceptre City’. Thistitle would be moved around from city to city every few hundred years. Duringthe rebuilding of the old cities, “where because of silt and mud the olden planscould not be followed, new sites were chosen.” The concerted effort to upliftthe humans paid off very quickly and the times on Earth were prosperous. Therewas plenty of food for everyone for the first time in a long time, industryblossomed and the manufacturing of wheeled wagons was booming. Ninurta requestedsome of the ME from Enki for his tasks. Once more we read about the distinctionbetween those who were brought up in Edin and those ‘black-headed people’ whoarrived from the Abzu. But the teaching was extended to everyone. It would bethese ‘black-headed people’ who would rise to become the great and powerfulkings of Nubia, in the Sudan, who took over Egypt in later years. “In Kishi werethe black-headed people, with numbers to calculate taught… Heavenly Nisabawriting them taught…Heavanly Ninkashi beer making them showed.” Ninurta was incharge of this land of Edin, they chanted praises to him and his ‘Black Bird’andtold tales of “how in faraway lands the bison he subdued, how the white metal tomix with copper he found.” The white metal was tin, at lake Titicaca.Inanna also wanted to obtain some ME from Enki, so she orchestrated a deviousplan of seduction during which we learn more about her powers as the goddess oflove and sex. She caught Enki at home alone, inebriated him with wine andseduced him with her semi-naked posing. It reads like a script from a soft-pornmovie. “With jewellery was Inanna bedecked, by her thin dress her body sherevealed…When she bent down, her vulva by Enki was thoroughly admired… from thewine cups sweet wine they drank, for beer drinking a competition they had.”Sounds pretty similar to the kind of behaviour humans have been engaging in forthousands of years and we can clearly see our genetic link to the Anunnaki.During their drinking games Inanna wanted to see some of the ME. Enki had noreason to suspect anything so he allowed her to hold some of them as part oftheir adult entertainment. He explained to her that “ninety four ME's that forcivilised kingdoms are needed.” Inevitably Enki fell asleep and she escaped withher stolen ME to start her own empire in the land she had been given. Enki'sassistant Ismud chased her down, but she had hidden them by then, claiming thatEnki placed them in her hand. It transpired that Enki admitted begrudgingly andhe let the matter be.When Enlil announced that the kingship would be moved from Kishi to Inanna'sabode of Unug-ki, Marduk was enraged. Once more he was denied of being thecommander of the planet that was promised to him. “Enough has my humiliationbeen… Marduk fate in his own hands grasped.” He decided to build a sacred cityof his own in the place which was at first reserved for Anu's visit. He calledthe Igigi and his followers from the dispersed lands and planned to build a“sacred city” and “a place for sky ships”. The city in question was Babylon.And so, Marduk built a city which reached the sky. They made clay 'brick andburnt them by fire' to serve as stone, because there were no stones in the area.“Therewith a tower whose head the heavens can reach they were building.” We canimmediately see the biblical parallel of the Tower of Babel in this part of thetexts. But Enlil was not impressed with this at all. He realised that this wasan attempt by Marduk to show his power and influence, which had to be kept incheck. And just as it says in the Bible, “...God came down to destroy the towerand confuse their language, because if they could achieve this, they would beable to do anything.” The clay tablets tell it almost verbatim: “If this weallow to happen, no other matter of mankind shall be unreached…This evil planmust be stopped…From their skyships havoc upon the rising tower, fire andbrimstone they rained.” But this was not enough for Enlil, he wanted Marduk faraway from him and to confuse his earthling followers, so they could notunderstand each other, just as it says in the Bible. “To scatter abroad theirleader and his followers… Henceforth their counsel to confuse…Their language Ishall confound, that they each other's speech will not understand.” Those werevery confusing words when seen in the light of an ‘all-loving God’ who issupposed to want the best for his creation and certainly not the kind of wordswe would expect from GOD. But when seen in the true ancient perspective, it nowmakes complete sense why ‘god’ would seem so angered by the building of thetower. These tablets also educate us that Marduk was the original creator of thecity of Babylon. Just as with the construction of the pyramids, which we stillstruggle to comprehend, the marvels of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon must havebeen the work of an advanced being like Marduk, the Anunnaki god. But with hisexpulsion from Babylon, Marduk set his sights on a more exciting prospect, whichwould bring him loyalty and notoriety, Egypt. This was 310 years since the newEarth count began 7400 BC. This would place the event at 7090 BC or possiblyeven 3490 BC if the later date for Earth-count years is accepted (3,600 yearslater). The later date would fit the rise of the early Scorpion King and thesubsequent pharaohs in Egypt.Sitchin gives us a very clear indication that Egypt had been ruled by theAnunnaki gods for some 12,300 years, which basically started soon after theflood ended and the Pyramids were constructed. We must remember that Marduk wasthe god of Egypt before he made a play for power in Babylon, but upon his returnhe found that his younger brother Ningishzidda had changed everything.“Ningishzidda as its master he there found…What Marduk had once planned andinstructed, by Ningishzidda was overturned.” One of the things Ningishzidda wasaccused of, was sending Horon or Horus “...to a desert place depart, a placethat has no water.” This line is very important in helping us string togetherthe rule of the god Horus in southern Egypt, known as Upper Egypt. It waspredominantly a desert area and Horus was much more worshiped there that inLower Egypt. The quarrel between the brothers lasted for 350 years, as long asthe two Egypt parts were divided. Once again this timeline seems to fitperfectly, because it is estimated that the Scorpion King united Upper and LowerEgypt in about 3100 BC, which saw the rise of the true Egyptian Empire.After the intervention of Enki, the talented Ningishzidda was convinced todepart for the “land beyond the oceans…With a band of followers thereto hewent.” We must recall that this was a talented architect who designed thepyramids and the scientist who formulated the human DNA. His symbol was similarto that of Enki, consisting of entwined serpents representing life and creation,constantly referred to as ‘The Winged Serpent’. I mentioned before that wesometimes feel uncertain whether it is Enki or Ningishzidda being referred to asthe 'Winged Serpent' because their symbols were so very similar and even theirabilities and characters were very close. Based on the tablets however, it wasmost likely Ningishzidda, who had such a huge influence on the very earlyAmerican cultures, teaching them most of what they knew including the buildingof the incredible structures in that part of the world. But there is a furtherinteresting twist to this part of ancient history. Prior to this, Ningishziddalived in Africa and probably used skilled African labourers who were trained inmining and building for his projects there. They were most likely also the oneswho were mainly responsible for building the pyramids under his supervision. Ittherefore makes perfect sense that the distinctly African features of the Olmecscould have been the labour force of Ningishzidda when he first arrived in theAmericas. They were very simply his entourage of African builders and miners.Furthermore, it would explain why the writing style of the Olmecs in Mexico,resembles the writing styles of various African tribes.[../Images/494-1.jpg]ANCIENT MINERSOlmec miner shown crouching in a confined space with some form of head-gear andtools in both his hands. He is protected by his ever present serpent deity. Werethese Olmec miners brought from Africa by the serpent god Enki to expand thesearch for gold in the Americas? There are many depictions and carvings ofminers in similar conditions which have baffled historians for ages.I have to remind you that Egypt was inhabited by humans and gods for manythousands of years before the pharaohs made their appearance. There is plenty ofevidence of that in the Narmer Plate, which was found and dated to around 4468BC and depicts the unification of Egypt by the Scorpion King Narmer. There arealso the Egyptian sky charts which point out celestial constellations of some14,000 BC. In fact, it is recorded so precisely that those specific charts canbe traced to exactly 11:57 pm on the 3rd of July 14,000 BC. Historians say thatit is not clear who was responsible for unifying Egypt, but the tablets tell usin no uncertain terms that it was Marduk. What is very exciting to me personallyand I see it as a little victory over conservative historians, is that theScorpion King has finally been proven to have been a real historic figure. Formany years he was seen as another mythological god who lived only in ancientpeople's minds. This kind of discovery will hopefully lead the way in gettingpeople to recognise that the other gods of our past were also real live beings.For many years, Menes was credited with being the first pharaonic king of Egypt.But now there is lots of evidence that King Narmer was actually the mysteriousScorpion King who predated Menes by more than 1,500 years, if not more. In theyears leading up to Menes, during the time of Narmer the Scorpion King, there isa lot of reference to the god Nannar, who was Enlil's son and was possiblyactive in Egypt before Marduk finally took control of it. Is it possible thatNarmer was Nannar's son? Who was responsible for unifying Egypt? Or did heachieve this under the rule of Marduk? The Scorpion King's images cover theruins of a fully fledged city, which was excavated at Hierakompolis dating backto 3500 BC. Furthermore, a dig at Abydos delivered 160 small bone and ivoryplates, the size of a large stamp, which contain the oldest known versions ofearly hieroglyphic text. Gunter Dryer, a German archaeologist believes that theywere the possessions of the Scorpion King, since they were found in his tomb.Could this be another example of how the Anunnaki gods were slowly introducingthe earthlings to the art of writing? Because these finds are now possibly theoldest examples of written text on Earth. It seems that Marduk took over thispart of the world around 3500 BC, which is also probably the reason why we knewso little about Narmer The scorpion King, because he did all the initial workfor Marduk, before the Pharaonic era was introduced. And besides, it is possiblethat Narmer was of Enlil's clan and this would not have been pleasing to Marduk.All future pharaohs would have to be related to Marduk and his Igigi or Neteru(watchers) in some way. All this information would make Narmer well over 1,500years old by the time he was buried. Could that be possible? Why not? Noah orZiusudra was 36,000 years old according to the Sumerians' count. But that wasall on account of him being a human son of Enki. There is therefore no reason tomarvel at the age of King Narmer if he was the son of Nannar, a full Anunnakigod. But he too would eventually die as all human half-breeds did.By the time Marduk took control of Egypt, he had the whole of the land tohimself. North and south were unified and he began building his dynasty as thegreat god Ra, “The Bright One”. Enki was known as Ptah – ‘The Developer’ andNingishzidda was Thoth or Tehuti – ‘The Divine Measurer’. From the beginning,Marduk/Ra wanted to stamp a brand new authority on this land of his. The firstthing he did was to erase the face of Ningishzidda off the Lion Sphinx statue.“To erase his memory, Ra on the Stone Lion his image with that of his son Asarreplaced.” But Marduk went a lot further to differentiate his land from theothers. He changed the counting into tens and not by sixty; he divided the yearinto ten periods; and “the watching of the moon by the watching of the Sun hereplaced…The two lands of the North and South into one Crown City he united.”This ancient statement clearly suggests that it was Marduk after all, who wasbehind the unification of Egypt, which means that Narmer was acting on hisinstructions. I hope that this will finally put this part of Egyptian history torest. Probably not. It is painfully clear that Marduk was a very talented andyet a highly frustrated individual who wanted to get his own back for the yearsof being overlooked. He was going to do everything in his power to prove hispoint and rise above the rest of the gods. He did not waste any time before heintroduced a new religion and instituted Pharaonic reign to mark the beginningof his new breed of civilisation. But his biggest mistake was to declare himselfas ‘god above the rest’. The Pharaohs had to be half-god, half-earthling andwere chosen mostly from the group of Anunnaki gods known as ‘Neteru’or ‘TheWatchers’whose job it was to look after the earthlings, but it was actually morelike ‘spying’ on the humans than anything else. The Neteru could very well bethe so-called angels who mysteriously made their appearance to humans when theyleast expected them. These were after all the early biblical times and theoccurrence of angels would become almost a daily affair. Suddenly the mystery ofthe ever-present angels does not seem so mysterious any more and there seems tobe a plausible reason for their presence in the tightly controlled humansociety.But the new ‘lofty royalty’ created an immediate class structure and allowed thekings to behave dismissively towards their followers. After all they were‘half-god’. It also explains why the kings were so obsessed with their gods,because deep inside they aspired to be like them; fully fledged immortal beings,able to travel to heaven. According to Sumerian scripts the first king to beappointed by Ra was Mena, known as Menes to historians. At this point we reach acrucial stage in our philosophical debate. Because suddenly, prehistoric myth,meets recognisable historic fact. Is it not incredibly arrogant of our conceitedcivilisation in the 21st century, that we choose which parts of history webelieve and which parts we deem as implausible? For no other reason than wedon't understand it, or even worse, we simply don't believe it.Enki was pleased that his son Marduk was making such good progress in hisregion, so he gave him all kinds of ME, to help him with the process. All exceptthe knowledge to revive the dead. “Then all manner of knowledge, except that ofthe dead reviving, to Ra he gave.” This would prove to be a major gripe withMarduk, who would do anything to gain that knowledge. We read how theycontrolled the flow of the Nile (Hapi) to benefit their farming and how“...abundance in the fertile soil quickly came, man and cattle proliferated.”Ninharsag named a constellation in Inanna's honour, to share with her brotherUtu, it would become known as the Age of Gemini. But the lands given to Inanna,the third region, was not doing so well. “Far away in the eastern lands, beyondseven mountain ranges, was the Third Region... Zamush, Land of Sixty PreciousStones, was its highland realm called.” This was obviously the Indus Valleyregion where Inanna's personality and sexuality rubbed off on the humans. Shewas after all the goddess of love and sensuality. We read about twin citieswhich were erected by her and used for food storage, among other things. Thosemust have been the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro. They were both built fromthe same bricks and in the same style and are the same age. According to theSumerian tablets they were built 860 years after the start of the Earth yearcount. This could mean either 2940 BC or 6540 BC depending on where we take thebeginning of Earth time. Either 7400 BC or 3800 BC. This would have been either1 Shar or 2 Shar after the last visit of Anu. The very curious link tocorroborate these events is the mysterious Indus Script. The tablets inform usthat Inanna introduced a new language and a new way of writing. The Indus Scripthas puzzled scholars for many years and to date is still not deciphered. Thismust have been the new language introduced by Inanna, the ‘goddess of love’ andthe first officially appointed ruler of the Indus Valley region. The way inwhich Indian culture utilises precious stones in their customs, clothing andjewellery, also indicates that the Indus Valley was indeed the ‘Land of SixtyPrecious Stones’ and the land of Inanna.The ME which Inanna requested were lost on the way to her in a bizarre set ofinterceptions by her opponents; misunderstanding of their new respectivelanguages, and deaths of the carriers. Ultimately the result was that the thirdregion of the Indus Valley did not develop as well as the other regions. “In theThird region, civilised mankind did not fully blossom.”This brought the period of growing instability among the Anunnaki and thebeginning of the end. The growing power quest by Marduk/Ra in Egypt and theresistance of the others began to cause skirmishes among their human followers.Many of the lesser gods were being worshipped in temples and sacred precinctsand the first brothel was established by none other than Inanna. “House fornighttime pleasure she established.” Inanna's mourning for Dumuzi seemed toreappear in moments of possible insanity. She began to imagine that a half-godearthling by the name of Banda was her beloved Dumuzi. It is possible that hersubtle levels of instability caused Inanna to initiate the ‘catastrophe’ in timeto come. But Banda married Inanna, the pure offspring from Enlil and the couplehad a son called Gilgamesh who was two thirds god. Gilgamesh is recognised as ahistoric king, once again crossing the line between fact and fiction. As timewent by, he realised that he had a strong divine DNA and he began to lust forthe same privileges which were reserved for Anunnaki only. Like most humanstoday, he was especially taunted by the idea of immortality. One of the mostfamous of all Sumerian legends is the “Epic of Gilgamesh” in which he venturesinto the lands of the Tilmun, the space port where the spaceships and othersecret Anunnaki items were kept, in search of immortality. His mother Ninsunpleaded constantly with her great uncle Utu, to guide Gilgamesh to Tilmun.“Endlessly Ninsun to Utu appealed… Let Gilgamesh to the landing place go.” Thejourney is written in great detail on a number of tablets and has become one ofthe most studied ancient bodies of written word. The argument still continueshowever, whether it was fictional or historical because there are historians whorefuse to accept this epic tale as part of history, while they accept many ofthe other ancient writings. Shame on them.The epic tale tells us that to reach his destination Gilgamesh has to get past anumber of precautionary measures which defy ancient logic, but his uncle Utuagreed to assist him with the aid of oracles. Oracles were also referred to as‘talking stones’ in those times. Often a priest would consult an ‘oracle’ foradvice from his god. The oracle would talk back to the priest advising him whatto do. So when we read that Utu used oracles to help Gilgamesh reach the innersanctum of the space port, it could be that these were strategically placed typeof 'sensor devices' or like modern computer ports with monitoring cameras,allowing the controller to scan the perimeter. Since Utu was a senior Anunnaki,he may have had access to those cameras and codes, to guide Gilgamesh to thenext point. But the weapons which protected the port were awesome. In the cedarforest he first encountered the “fire-belching monster” then “the secretentrance to the tunnels of the Anunnaki they found…By the Bull of Heaven withdeadly snorts they were challenged… and chased.” The reasons why the text refersto ‘they’ is because Gilgamesh was accompanied by a friend. But in the end hemade it inside where he was met by Ziusudra, the legend of the flood, who toldhim of a unique plant which does have the ability to keep a man young. “Uniqueof all the plants on Earth it was.” But the greedy Gilgamesh ripped the plantout from its roots and made his way back home. En route he fell asleep and theplant was stolen by a snake which was attracted by its fragrance. Gilgameshreturned home empty-handed where in the end he died as a mortal.The fascinating thing about this story is the part about the snake, which bearsvery strong resemblance to the events in the biblical Garden of Eden. But in theSumerian rendition of Adamu in Edin, it was Enki described as the ‘evil serpent’who came to inform and educate the new earthling pair. Is it not possible thatit was Enki the ‘snake’ who once more intervened, this time retrieving what wasrightfully his, the secrets to eternal life? It certainly has very similarcharacteristics in the simplistic description of the interfering snake. The factis that Gilgamesh was not just any old human, he was a great king of a majorcity called Uruk or the biblical Erech. So Marduk used this event asjustification to bestow his own immortality on his kings and demand even greateradulation from all. “If demigods the gateway to immortality are shown, let thisto the kings of my region apply.” He basically started to tell the pharaohs thathe could offer them a passage to heaven just like Gilgamesh was shown. Hedictated what is known as the Book of the Dead, giving kings a step-by-stepguide to reach the “boats of heaven” and the afterlife on another planet. Inreturn Ra would demand complete obedience. Then he went on to decree that allthe kings must be half human, half god. “Let kings of my region of Neteruoffspring be, to Nibiru in an afterlife journey.”The ‘afterlife’ which Ra was offering his pharaoh kings, was simply theprivilege to travel to Nibiru, and there live as the Anunnaki do, eternally.These utterances should therefore not in anyway be confused with the ‘heaven’ orspiritual afterlife with GOD with a big G; the universal Spirit or Being whichmany people have begun to believe in during the past few centuries. Thisafterlife of god Ra, was a fictitious reality in his own frame of reference andthe planet he came from, but he did not have the ability to actually revivepeople from the dead and offer them eternal life. That privilege was reservedfor the top few Anunnaki only. The ME which Marduk/Ra received from his fatherEnki, gave him many powers to rule, but they did not give him the knowledge torevive people from the dead. Despite his inability to deliver kings to theafterlife, Ra dictated his 'Book of the Dead' to his scribes outlining everystep of the way “How to reach the Duat, the place of celestial boats…By aStairway to Heaven, to the imperishable planet journey...How to build tombsfacing eastward.” As part of his rapid expansion plan, Marduk instructed hisfollowers to invade other lands in the Abzu to seize gold from them, who weremostly his own brothers' followers. He ordered his kings to capture alladjoining lands to Egypt. “To be the master of the four regions was his heart'splan.”Marduk became so obsessed and arrogant that he bluntly proclaimed to his fatherEnki, “The Earth is mine to rule.”Nannar and his wife Ningal were in charge of Mesopotamia or biblical olden landswhich were assigned to Enlil. This was known as the first region and wasbecoming very prosperous under their lordship. They held 12 festivals each year,one for each of the great Anunnaki. “Shrines and sanctuaries were built, thepeople to their gods could directly pray.” This first region was booming underthe rapidly expanding civilisation. Humans were learning everything, whileremaining faithful and obedient to their gods. Inanna liked to roam the lands tosee and observe how all the regions were progressing. She took a liking to the“People who in the upper plain of the two rivers dwelt.” She liked the sound oftheir dialect which must have been different to her own. They were the Igigi who‘descended to Earth from heaven’ from Lahmu (Mars). They knew all about thebeautiful Inanna but they called her Ishtar. This is most likely the reason whythe Igigi or Aryans moved east, following Inanna to her Indus Valley region andlaid the foundation for the Indo-European culture and language.Back in Sumer, the kingdoms were rotated between cities but Marduk had none ofthat in his own Egypt. “In Shumer (Sumer)…Kingship between the cities wasrotated…In the second region, diversity by Ra was not permitted, alone to reignhe wished.” Marduk had a very close affinity with all the Igigi who came toEarth after Mars had deteriorated, since he was their commander for a longperiod. It was mostly the Igigi who were the so-called ‘Lofty Watchers’orNeteru, whose offspring became the future Kings of Egypt. Ra went further, hedeclared himself “The eldest of heaven, firstborn who is on Earth…The foremostfrom the earliest times.” He expected all the priests to know him as such andpraise him with hymns. Interestingly enough, he was not making anything up inthose statements, he was all that. But then he went too far and his greedy ormegalomaniacal character took over. He began to believe his own propaganda withregard to immortality and suggested that he is more powerful than all the othergods. That specific aspect of our human DNA has been clearly illustrated bythousands of military leaders, presidents and dictators throughout history –another harsh reminder of where we humans got our genetic material from. Mardukdeclared himself as follows. “Lord of eternity, he who everlastingness has made,over all the gods presiding…The one who is without equal…Ra above all othergods.” I don't understand what he was thinking, he must have lost control of hisfaculties by this stage. Did Marduk expect the senior Anunnaki to simply accepthis attempts to snatch power from them so openly? But it got even worse, heactually compared the pantheon of gods which included Enlil by name andproclaimed that he was greater than them. These included Enlil, Ninurta, Adad,Nannar, Utu, Nergal, Gibil and Ningishzidda.It is not surprising that the Anunnaki were very concerned but also furious byhis behaviour. Marduk had become a loose cannon and completely unpredictable.This was a whole new twist in their stay on Earth. Even his father Enkiconfronted him, realising that his beloved son had now gone too far and that hecould no longer defend his actions before Enlil. And for the first time we hearEnki speak very strong words to his first-born. “What has you overpowered?Unheard of are your protestations.” But Marduk was so high on the quest forpower that he could not be brought down to ‘Earth’, if you forgive the pun. Hesuggested that his celestial sign was about to rise, which would give him thepower to rule. The “Bull of Heaven” which was Enlil's sign, would be replaced bythe age of the ram. He said that the “heavens my supremacy bespeak…The age ofthe Ram is coming , unmistakable the omens are.”(Ram 2220 BC - 60 BC) It isincredible to see how steadfast his faith was in the heavenly signs. But whatwas to follow would bear the most miraculous twist in all of human events, whichcaused the other Anunnaki to suspect that maybe it was Marduk's destiny tobecome the supreme ruler of the world. Incredibly enough, there is a Sumerianroyal cylinder seal which is dated from 2308 BC, celebrating the coming of theAge or Aries; The Ram, which was the sign of Marduk.And so started a frenzied period of constructing observational monuments bywhich to predict the coming of the ages, leading up to 2308 BC. This would fitin perfectly with the many structures all around the world which have been foundto have such purpose. Everyone was watching the skies to see if Marduk'sprediction was correct, if in fact they had made a mistake in their ownpredictions. This would explain to archaeologists why there are so many ancientobservatories scattered throughout the ancient cultures. Before they realisedhow the circumstances had changed, the gods were dependent on Humankind forsupport on the ground. The war of the gods had arrived in which Humankind wouldplay a crucial part. “After the Anunnaki as gods themselves declared, onmankind's support they instead are dependant.” They needed to find a strongleader among men who could spearhead their human armies against Marduk. Inannafound such a human by the name of Abrakad who had such makings of a strongleader. Enlil made him a king with “crown and sceptre” and they called himSharru-kin or Righteous Regent. The world knows him as Sargon 1, the firstpowerful king of Akkad. The tablets tell us how a new unified city was declaredwhich housed the crown in the olden lands by the name of Agade (Akkad) and thebeginning of the great Akkadian empire under their leader Sargon I, had begun.His task was simple; to ensure the obedience of all the people of Mesopotamia.Historians are well aware of the many astounding conquests by Sargon and we readin the tablets what happened. “All the lands from the lower sea to the uppersea, to his throne obedience gave.” There was a very good reason why he was sosuccessful and seemingly invincible in battle, because Inanna provided hisarmies with the advanced weapons of the Anunnaki. A similar set of circumstanceswhich would assist Abraham in the future. “By Enlil was Sharru-kin empowered,Inanna with her weapons of brilliance his warriors accompanied.”Marduk was watching all this warlike posturing by Inanna from his lands in Egyptand when the moment was right, he pounced on the unsuspecting city of Babylonwhere he established himself against the will of Inanna. This was after all hiscity. “Babili, the gateway to the gods…Dikes and walls in the place of the towerthey raised…House for the utmost god Marduk they built.” This is how cunninglyMarduk established his army of followers in the middle of the First Region, theheart of the Edin, the heart of Enlil's lands. But Inanna reacted swiftly anddecisively. She attacked Marduk's armies with all the force she possessed,destroying them where they had embedded themselves in Babylon, in the processdestroying most of the city. “With her weapons on Marduk's followers death sheinflicted…The blood of the people, as never before on Earth, like riversflowed.” We have to remind ourselves that the gods were using humans, theirslave species as their disposable foot soldiers to do all the fighting anddying. We can now look at the tales of the early biblical scriptures withgreater understanding when we read that god instructed Moses or Abraham toattack a certain group of people because they were vile and evil and who wereconspiring against god. The people were simply doing the fighting for Enlilagainst the followers of Marduk. How else do you propose to explain it? Ourhistory books are written by the victors; and at this stage it was Enlil whoheld the upper hand in the biblical lands, while Marduk ruled the roost inEgypt.Marduk was defeated at Babylon and convinced to leave the Edin. They agreed to“Peacefully wait for the true signs of heaven” to point out whether Marduk's ageof rule, the Ram, had come. Marduk did not return to Egypt at this stage and hispeople began to call him ‘Amun – The Unseen One’. Naram-Sin was the grandson ofthe great Sargon I, was appointed as the new king of Akkad and Sumer. Those weretruly strange times on Earth, as if everyone was waiting for something tohappen. The most desired event among the elder Anunnaki was to return to Nibirubut the time had not yet come, because the gold collection in the Americas wasat its peak. Their plan was to exhaust the visible gold and only then depart.But time was against them. In the East, Inanna was making plans of her own torule the planet. Marduk and Inanna were engaged in a kind of a pre-war dance,each making it clear that they wanted to rule the whole world. A strangesituation arose when Inanna realised she could make her move. “In the firstregion, Enlil and Ninurta absent were, to the land beyond the oceans theywent…In the second region Ra was away, as Marduk in other lands he travelled.”And so Inanna made her move to take control of all the lands. “To seize allpower Inanna envisioned, Naram-Sin to seize all lands she commanded.” And so hedid as he was commanded, historians will know these battles from ancient texts.Naram-Sin moved through all the lands of Sumer, Akkad and into Egypt, takingcontrol everywhere. But he made one fatal mistake when he marched his armiesthrough the forbidden land of Enlil, in the Tilmun, where the space port wasreserved for the Anunnaki only. This is a great example of how mangled thesituation was at that time. Enlil was furious and took no time to destroyNaram-Sin and his army and he even ordered the destruction of Akkad. “By thecommand of Enlil was Agade wiped out.” The tablets tell us that this happened inthe Earth count year of 1500, after the Anunnaki began to count Earth yearsinstead of Shar. That would place the event at around 2300 BC. These were earlybiblical times shortly before the appearance of Abraham and already god wasinstructing his human leaders to attack and destroy other groups of humans.At this point it becomes clear how confused the earthlings must have been. Anemerging species on a new planet, not quite in control of their own destiny,controlled by a number of different gods commanding them to do this and that andto wage war on their neighbours, the humans had very little choice but to followthe instructions from their brutal gods who showed no regard for human life. Thepeople were mere chess pieces in a great game of global conquest played by theAnunnaki gods. The clashes between the gods almost always involved humans, whonever knew the reasons for waging war against their neighbours. But as we see inthe Old Testament, this kind behaviour was commonplace. It was this inexplicableact of aggression by one group of earthlings against another, which wasinitiated by their god, that set the behavioural pattern for all future humanconflict. Humankind, which was just emerging from the age of darkness intocivilisation, perceived this kind of activity as ‘the normal thing to do’ toinvade and conquer your neighbour's land. God would command his people to invadeand attack, giving his human armies the excuse that they were vile and evil andthey were sinful against god. But this god would differ from land to land,demanding total obedience from the humans, or they would themselves be punished.This led to the worshipping of many different gods by the early people of thebiblical lands, as they worshipped the specific god who led them into battle orout of harm's way. This worshipping would lead to retribution by some otherAnunnaki god with a higher rank, demanding that people worship only him. And sothe clashes between the biblical groups of people would continue for almost3,000 years, driven by the power struggle of the Anunnaki. It is all very nicelycaptured in the Bible, but the evidence is now overwhelming that the entries inthat particular book had nothing to do with salvation and the eternal spiritualafterlife of GOD with a big G; but rather, it was all a meticulously executedpropaganda and mind control by a number of vengeful gods, who were no more thanadvanced humans with a higher level of intelligence, abusing humans for theirown gain. And so we see this human behaviour continuing even today. While somecommunities think they have elevated themselves above this kind of primitivebehaviour, just take a swipe at their religion and see their reaction.This was possibly the single most important period in all of human history,because it was this continued confusion among Humankind about the differentgods, which set the tone for the emergence of the many diverse religions visiblein the world today. There can be no other plausible reason for this amazingphenomenon. How else can it be explained that one planet has developed so manydifferent religions in such a short space of time? The answers are perfectlyclear in the many Sumerian tablets and on the pages of the Bible. All we have todo is to take the fear out of the reading of the book and rather approach it asa historic record which was commanded to be written with a very specific reason.To manipulate humans into a blind and fearful fanaticism. So from a purely humanperspective, the very first wars among humans were fought on religious groundsby humans who were controlled by different gods. And it is safe to say thatsince those early days some 3500 BC, all wars among Humankind were also drivenby religious beliefs, combined with our genetically inherited need to conquer,which was imposed on our species early in our infancy. But we see the incredibleeffect of the inherited Anunnaki DNA rise to the surface and manifesting itselfin our violent behaviour. The amazing desire by Humankind to find peace hasshown that genetically we are actually created to be more peaceful. Theoverwhelming majority of humans who strive for peace is a fascinatingphenomenon. Combined with our incredible capacity for benevolence, it becomesdebatable whether our violent behaviour is a characteristic pattern which wehave adopted from our makers, rather than a genetic code which drives us tobehave in such ways. In other words, have we been nurtured into becoming violentor is our violent behaviour driven by a violent gene? And so we get back to the‘Nature versus Nurture’ argument.The clay tablets seem to concur that the world was gripped in a state of chaosand confusion. “After Marduk Amun became, kingship in the second regiondisintegrated, disorder and confusion reigned…After Agade was wiped out, in thefirst region there was disorder, confusion reigned…Kingship was disarray, fromcities of gods, to cities of man it moved about…To faraway places kingship wasshifting.” The situation got so bad that Enlil had to consult Anu on farawayNibiru about how to deal with the situation. They appointed a new king in thecity of Ur, to be the peacemaker and “bring an end to violence and strife…in allthe lands prosperity was abundant.” This king's name was Ur-Nammu, ‘RighteousShepherd’. Enlil had a very vivid dream about the coming of the Age of the Ramand Marduk taking control of the world. It affected him so much, that hedispatched his high priests to observe the heavens for signs of the new age. Inthe meantime Marduk kept on moving from land to land telling people of hissupremacy, gaining massive support from fearful and obedient earthlings. His sonNabu was also helping to enslave more humans into obedience, with fear. Warserupted again, “Between the dwellers of the west and the dwellers of the eastclashes were occurring.” That sounds like a scene from the 20th century,seemingly not much has changed in 4,000 years. Ur-Nammu, the “RighteousShepherd” died in a chariot accident, to be replaced by Shulgi. “Full of vileand eager for battle Shulgi was.” It seems that by this stage the humans did notneed much encouragement from their gods to go to war, they began to emulatetheir gods. This Shulgi chap was a real tyrant according to the texts, withpowers on the battle field and other powers of persuasion as well, because hemanaged to seduce the beautiful goddess Inanna. It just goes to show that asearly as 4,300 years ago, women were already attracted to men of power. As sillyas this statement may be, there is a lot of historic social behaviour to supportit. This behaviour of women can be defended by outlining the genetic code, whichprogrammes the female to choose the strongest male, which will more likelyensure the survival of their offspring. And so Shulgi used his power to conquerlands and women. “In Nibru­ki himself high priest anointed, in Unug-ki the joysof Inanna's vulva he sought…Warriors from the mountainlands in his army heenlisted…The western lands he overran…The sanctity of Mission Control Centre heignored.” Once again, an arrogant human king made the mistake of 'defilingEnlil's restricted area. “Once again the rulers of your region all bounds haveexceeded… Of all the troubles, Marduk is the fountainhead...” so did Enlil sayto Enki in anger.And this is once more where we see the dramatic marriage of myth and history.Enlil needed to find a faithful, obedient, strong human leader, to oppose thechaos and growing human armies of Marduk. He did not have to search long beforehe found the most enigmatic figure in all of the Bible. The father of all thefuture biblical kings, Abraham. The father of the Jewish, Christian and Muslimfaiths. The Sumerians called him Ibruum, the Muslims call him Ibrahim. He was apowerful human with all the necessary attributes to command Enlil's army. Thetime had come for Enlil to start using the same tactics which were employed bythe other Anunnaki gods and utilise humans as his own soldiers. His mainobjective was for Abraham to defend his space port. “A princely offspring,valiant and with priestly secrets acquainted, Ibruum was…To protect the sacredplaces, the chariot's ascents and descents enable, Enlil Ibruum to gocommanded.” But as soon as Abraham departed from the city of Harran to performhis new duties to his god Enlil, Marduk arrived to incite the people and causehavoc. It would be this kind of incitement and havoc which would entangleAbraham and his nephew Lot to become spies for their god Enlil, reporting on theactivities of Marduk and his followers. Just imagine the kind of confusion whichconsumed the poor ignorant humans of those days. One god demanding obedience,the other god threatening punishment and retribution for disobedience. No wonderthe Bible is such a confusing book of constant conflict and war amongst thehuman tribes, because in reality they belonged to different gods and they werecommanded and controlled by these different gods.It now emerges that the main protagonists in the holy wars of the Bible were thefollowers of Enlil taking battle against those who were controlled by Marduk.Both were strict and brutal in their dispensation of punishment and reward totheir human followers. Those were stressful times for the Anunnaki gods, whowere in the final stages of their expedition to Earth, suddenly having to dealwith unexpected situations. The new slave species they created to help themobtain the precious gold had now become their tools of war. By now, Marduk hadreached the point of no return. He summoned all the Anunnaki to his belovedBabylon, to appoint him as the new ruler of the planet Earth. “In my templehouse let all the Anunnaki gods assemble, my covenant accept.” Obviously theothers responded with horror to such utterances by Marduk and Enlil called anurgent meeting of all the elders. “To a great assembly, counsel to take, Enlilthem all summoned.” There was consensus that Marduk had finally gone too far,everyone was extremely unhappy with the tenuous situation. Nobody knew what todo, or how to respond to the present circumstances. “Accusations were rampant,recriminations filled the chamber.”Enki was the only one who felt that it must have been fate which led them tothis situation and maybe they should not oppose fate but rather to acceptMarduk's rise to assume control. “What is coming, no one can prevent, let usMarduk's supremacy accept.” At this stage Marduk had settled himself in Babylonand basically taken control of the whole known world of the biblical times. Itincluded Egypt, Israel, Canaan, Assyria, Akkad and Sumer. There were only a fewAnunnaki strongholds which were not loyal to the brutal god Ra or Marduk, knownto most in the world today as the biblical ‘god of love’. Is that not filledwith deep dark irony? There was much deliberation and debate about what actionto take against Marduk. The Anunnaki finally decided that there was only one wayto stop Marduk: to obliterate all his cities with all his human followers whodwelled in them.By this time Abraham had been a trusted and loyal general of the lord Enlil, whoequipped him with the best chariots available together with the finest horses.Abraham fought many battles for him, mainly defending the space port in theSinai which was out of bounds to all humans. Lord Enlil rewarded him with richesof all kinds, which included “...land as far as the eye can see...”, gold,cattle and sheep and a host of things which eventually made him the wealthiestman of his time. Abraham had a crack squad of some 380 well-trained andwell-armed soldiers for the task. The weapons provided to him by his god, wereso awesome, that this small group of warriors could smite an army of tenthousand men in a matter of hours.This made Abraham not only the wealthiest man in the land, but also the mostrespected and feared. There are several references in the Bible where kings andpriests come to him for leniency and mercy. They refer to his close ties withgod, and that he should not forget their good deeds towards Abraham when godwants to pour his vengeance on them. Everyone was petrified of their god ofvengeance, whom we now know was none other than Enlil, the supreme Anunnakicommander on Earth, whose command was under threat by his young nephew Marduk.On several occasions we read in the Bible that angels came to Abraham, enquiringabout the behaviour of humans in certain cities. They clearly used Abraham andhis nephew as informants to gain information about the activities of thefollowers of Marduk. Two of the cities which the Bible mentions in great detailwere Sodom and Gomorra.We have already explored the events which led to the destruction of thosecities, but now we get a clear understanding of why this all happened. Thesewere only two of the cities under Marduk's control. From there, he would marshalhis large number of human followers and take control of all the establishmentson Earth, including the space port of Enlil.And so, after the long debate by the Anunnaki in Enlil's chamber, the fatefuldecision was made “to use therefore the weapons of terror” on all of Marduk'speople. It was not dissimilar to the USA-led pre-emptive strikes on Iraq, inanticipation of some form of deadly attack by their perceived enemy. Is it notironic that 4,200 years ago, the same part of the world was involved in aterrible battle, which by the sounds of it must have been a nuclear attack thatwiped out most of the people of the Near East and Mesopotamia, otherwise knownas Iraq? So the Anunnaki gods would use these ‘Weapons of Terror’ on Marduk. Ifwe look at the geographical area, all this information makes a lot of sense.Marduk was in charge of Egypt, the Sinai peninsula with the space port wasvirtually just to the east of him and Sodom and Gomorra were just north of theSinai, perfectly positioned to launch an attack on Enlil's space port. So weshould not be surprised when the angels came to visit Abraham shortly before thedestruction began, to get any final information about the citizens of thosecities and how they were ‘conspiring against god’. The actions of the peoplewere described in the Bible as “vile and evil”, and Abraham shows some of hishumane side as he pleads for the lives of the righteous few in the two cities.We know the rest of the story, the angels go to the city, talk to Lot, getapprehended by the citizens who suspect that they are there to kill them and thecities are destroyed by incredible explosions which turned Lot's wife into a“pillar of salt”, meaning that she was actually vaporised.The event described in the clay tablets are even more dramatic, but clearly dealwith the same situation. Only Enki was opposed to the proposed action of terror,saying that “What was destined to be, by your decision to undo will fail...”,once more displaying the Anunnaki's firm belief in a higher universal powerwhich included destiny and fate. It was Ninurta, son of Enlil and Nergal, son ofEnki, who were chosen to “the evil thing to carry out.” And so the identities ofthe two angels who visited Abraham, are exposed. The same angels who thenproceeded to Sodom to destroy it with nuclear weapons. And once again mythologymeets biblical history, but this time we have a real link with real names andplaces. Ancient Sumerian tablets which predate the Bible telling us thishorrific tale of destruction and the same diluted version is in the Bibleitself. If you believe the one, you should believe the other. Except that theSumerian tablets give us a lot more detail which was omitted in the Bible whenit was compiled by humans 2,500 years later.The deadly weapons were retrieved from their secret places and Enlil revealed tothe young Anunnaki “how the weapons from their deep sleep awaken.” They werewarned that the cities must be spared and the righteous people in their citiesmust not perish. The crucial part of the tablet which substantiates my assertionthat Abraham was a spy, is when Enlil tells his two fighters to “make sure thatIbruum is forewarned.” Many scholars of the past have implied that the weaponsused in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra must have been nuclear weapons.These suggestions are not only supported by the descriptions of the aftermath inthe Bible itself, but the clay tablets tell us in great detail what actuallyhappened. They even reveal the names which Nergal gave the weapons before theyunleashed them and they certainly leave no doubt about what they were. “Onewithout rival; Blazing flame; One who with terror crumbles; Mountain melter;Wind that the rim of the world seeks; One who above and below no one spares...”and the grand-daddy of them all, “Vaporiser of living things”. There were sevenweapons in total with which the massacre would be performed. When thedestruction began the tablets tell us that “Athousand and seven hundred andthirty six was the count of earth years then...” which would make it 2064 BCwhen the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra occurred, the end of the days ofAbraham. It is also very clear from the tablets that Enki was mortified by theactions of Enlil, as he writes: “On that day, on that fateful day, Enlil toNinurta the signal sent.”Ninurta and Nergal began the bombing. The tablets describe in great detail how“the mount's innards in an instant it melted…The rocks into a gushing wound weremade…The Earth shook and crumbled, the heavens after the brilliance weredarkened…Of all the forests, only tree stems were left standing.” For those whohave seen pictures of a nuclear aftermath, these words present a perfectdescription. They also concur with biblical descriptions. From there they flewto “the verdant valley where Nabu the people was converting.” Nabu was Marduk'sson who was also a target. There they annihilated five more cities and as itsays in the Bible, “with fire and brimstone were they upheavaled, all that livedthere to vapour was turned.”What followed is described as a typical ‘nuclear storm’ with darkening of theskies, extreme winds blowing at hundreds of kilometres per hour, distributingthe deadly nuclear clouds of dust. “Gloom from the skies an evil windcarried…The Sun on the horizon with darkness it obliterated.” We must rememberthat these words were written before a single word of the Bible had been putdown. It is very difficult to imagine that the descriptions in the Bible camefrom any other source than the same events which inspired the writing of theSumerian clay tablets. And the incredible nuclear descriptions continued. “Atnighttime a dreaded brilliance skirted its edges…Wherever it reached, death toall that lives mercilessly it delivered.” The Anunnaki were astounded by theextent of the destruction, they did not expect it to be so devastating. Thenuclear wind was distributing the deadly dust everywhere and in their directionas well. There was no place to hide, the dust or “Evil Wind” would penetrateevery nook and cranny, as it rapidly moved towards Sumer, where the Anunnaki hadbased themselves. “No door could shut it out, no bolt could turn it back.”Ninurta and Nergal sent an urgent message to Enlil and Enki. “Escape! Escape! Tothem all they cried out.” Those are dramatic words which were followed by evenmore graphic descriptions of the effect which the Evil Wind had on the people inits path. “In the streets were their corpses piled up…Cough and phlegm thechests filled, their mouths with spittle and foam filled up…Their mouths weredrenched with blood… From west to east over plains and mountains it travelled.”Those words suddenly bring to light an even more horrific truth of thatparticular biblical event. The Anunnaki were not only using nuclear weapons, butbiological weapons as well.The terrible events of the recent past when Iraq was accused of harbouringweapons of mass destruction, revolved mainly around biological weapons. It istragic that the 20th century witnessed a number of attacks where biologicalweapons were used and the descriptions in the clay tablets are a precisedescription of what happened in recent times when people fell victim to suchattacks. They fell where they stood; their skin was burnt or covered withgrotesque sores; their mouths filled with blood; suffocating in their ownphlegm. There is no doubt that those ancient accounts are the gruesomedescription of biological warfare. How is it possible that a 4,000-year-old claytablet could have depicted such events if they weren't actually real? It ishighly unlikely and utterly improbable that an ancient scribe would be able toimagine such events. This level of technology predated the Dark and Middle Agesby three thousand years, where the sword and horse were the main weapon. You beyour own judge to determine what the real meaning of those biblical and Sumeriandescriptions are. “Everything that lived behind it was dead, people and cattleall alike perished… The waters were poisoned…All vegetation withered.” But thencame the incredible miracle which was seen by Enlil in a dream some time beforethe event. All of the lands were covered and destroyed by the “Evil Wind”covering them from west to east. All except Babylon, “where Marduk supremacydeclared, by the evil winds was spared.” This was perceived as a miracle byEnlil and everyone else among the Anunnaki. Finally they declared that “Mardukto supremacy has been destined.” There was no other possible explanation intheir eyes and slowly they made plans to disperse, leaving Marduk to rule. TheAnunnaki show us their spiritual side once more as they debate the relationshipsbetween fate and destiny and how it has shaped their stay on Earth. But one cansense between the lines that they were tired, focusing on completing theirmission to find gold, and returning to Nibiru. Although Enlil and Enki wereenergetic and vibrant commanders on their arrival to Earth, the short yearlycycles had aged them, as was described in earlier parts of the story. Itcertainly feels as if they did not have the energy left to continue squabbling.They had done what they deemed necessary, at the expense of their slave species.But now the time had come to go home.The years that followed were tense and hard on the surviving humans. The oldbiblical scripts are filled with trials and tribulations of the human tribes,under the brutal dictatorship of the new god Marduk. He skilfully and cunninglycontrolled the human race, commanding them to pray to one god only, himself. Heis referred to as the ‘god of vengeance’ in the Bible, and that is exactly whathe had become. It was as if the many years it took him to gain control of theplanet, which was initially promised to him, made Marduk bitter. He did not showany of the benevolent traits his father Enki displayed towards the human speciesthroughout the years. The many demigods which people had worshipped in yearspast were slowly disappearing under pressure from Marduk and the world was beingconverted into a monotheistic society. He became the only god who humans wereallowed to worship. He demanded sacrifices of gold, food, animals, and evenhumans. The early American cultures of the Aztecs and their ancestors had abrutal ceremony during which human hearts were extracted while still beating.There were as manyas 20,000 captives killed in one massive sacrificial offeringto their god. There is no reason to believe that they would have done somethinglike that on their own. There was regular contact between the ancient culturesand their gods. Their actions would have been a direct response to a strictcommand by their god. There were many other gruesome customs performed by mostof the ancient cultures. These barbaric customs only seem to have surfaced onceMarduk took control of the planet some 2064 BC, lasting way beyond the Christianera into the Dark Ages which included the brutal power mongering of theCatholics during the Crusades between the 11th and 13th centuries AD.Now that the story has been told, we need to sit back, take a few deep breathsto absorb all this information and ask ourselves a crucial question. What thehell is going on? Have we been lied to and bamboozled all our lives? Can thehuman race be so gullible and ignorant to be so exploited for so long? Theanswer to that is a definite YES. You don't have to go back in time to witnessthe willingness of humans to follow a brutal dictator in huge numbers completelyoblivious of their own state of ignorance. Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Bush are justthe obvious examples of how people will follow a leader whom they believe willprotect them and make them stronger than their enemies. But now, the obviousquestion we need to ask is, where are the Anunnaki now? Where are Enlil and Enkiand Marduk today? Are they around, or have they all departed? Do they play anypart in the confused state of mind of the modern humans? This is a questionwhich warrants an extended study and would be a great subject of a book on itsown. But I will dare to say the following: If you had to abandon a paradiseisland which you had inhabited for many years, because of some kind ofecological disaster, would you not like to return at some stage to see how ithas recovered and developed in your absence? There is a very strong possibilitythat the many unexplained sightings of UFOs may have something to do with ourancient creators, checking up on the progress of their offspring. But we havereached a very disparate level of development or possibly even evolution on thisplanet. Some cultures are trapped in customs thousands of years old, living deepin the hearts of rain forests, not showing any signs of progress, while othersare landing probes on Mars and cloning new life. The Earth today is a verydifferent place to what it was 1,000 years ago. So if we assume that theAnunnaki departed from Earth some 1,000 years ago, it would be unwise for themto arrive on this planet in its current state of cultural and religiousconfusion. We would probably try to blow them out of the sky on their arrival,trying to tell us that ‘they’ were actually our ‘creators’. Are they trying tohelp us or guide us? Who knows. There is however an important lesson we shouldlearn. The arrogant way in which we treat the precious knowledge from ourdistant past, has only extended our years of ignorance. As intelligent as we maythink we are, we still do not know who we are, where we come from and why we arehere on this lonely planet called Earth. If we allow our minds to be opened, wecan only grow as a species, allowing us to evolve faster, both physically andspiritually. Because only then will we be able to join the universal communityof beings, becoming one with the Great Universal Spirit, the creator of theuniverse and all things in it. I believe that we are on the cusp of achievingthis giant evolutionary step, but it is up to us as a species to see it throughto its conclusion. And on our path of evolution and enlightenment, we must atall times remind ourselves, that while we are in this primitive state of mind,things are not always what they seem."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17 [../Text/toc.html#chapter17]FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN BITE-SIZE CHUNKS [../Text/toc.html#chapter17a]This chapter contains snippets and excerpts which were omitted from the mainbody. It will add a little spice to what we have already covered. Some of theseare vitally integral parts of the debate, but in this format they make asuitable dessert to end the rather lengthy tale of our origins. Now that youhave consumed a rather heavy meal, I trust that this pudding will help youdigest it.God or gods?There are various passages in the Bible like Gen 35:7-13 and Psalms 82:1, whichcreate great confusion about god, because they mix up plural and singular formsof the word “gods/Elohim”. Giving us more fodder to question the presence ofmany gods rather than just one.Goliath, Giants and NephilimErik Parker tells us that the word Nephilim does not mean giants but theyprobably were giants in size as most depictions from ancient Mesopotamia showedthe Anunnaki gods to be much taller than humans. In Numbers 13:33, it calls theNephilim the \"children of Anak.” The word for giants in Hebrew is Anak(singular) and Anakim (plural). According to the Signet – Hebrew/EnglishDictionary by Dov Ben Abba, the word for giant can be “Anak” or “Anaki”. We alsofind out from Parker that the famous giants or “Anakim” were descendants of theAnunnaki and Enki. Other examples of giants in the Bible are referred to as Og,King of Bashan (Deut 3:1), and Goliath the giant whom David defeated (Samuel21:15-19). This highlights another Sumerian influence. Goliath's name which isGalyat in Hebrew, starts with the word ‘Gal’ meaning ‘great’ in Sumerian. Todayin the English language, we can use the word Goliath to denote something big andgigantic. The word Nephilim, which has caused so much controversy among scholarscomes from the root ‘Naphal’ – to fall down. It is consistent with the wordAnunnaki, which means ‘those who from Heaven to Earth came’. Nephilim means‘those who fell down’ or ‘the fallen ones’. In historical and biblical contextit means very clearly ‘those who have fallen down from Heaven above’. In Numbers13:33 we read the following: “There we saw the Nephilim, (the children of Anak,which come from the Nephilim) and we were in their site as grasshoppers.”Matthew & JmmanuelThe Talmud Jmmanuel has been described as the original document from which theGospel of Matthew was re-written. The numerous examples are astounding, oftenpointing to more fantastical occurrences that were conveniently removed from theNew Testament. Here is one more such example:Mt 4:1-11“Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by thedevil...Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.”TJ 3:33-4:51“Behold, after these words Jmmanuel entered into the metallic light, whichclimbed into the sky, surrounded by fire and smoke, and passed over the lifelesssea, as the singing of the metallic light soon faded away. After that, Jmmanuelwas no longer seen for forty days and nights... Thus, he lived for forty daysand nights between the winds of the North and the West, where he received thearcanum of knowledge. During this instruction period he spent his days with thewise saints of El and the guardian angels, the celestial sons...Thus they spoke,the celestial sons between the North and the West, before bringing Jmmanuel inthe metallic light back to Israel, to the land of Galilee.”EgyptAncient historians like Manetho and Herodotus both agree that Egypt had gods asits rulers. We can actually track this for an extended period of some 17 500years, dating back to well before the flood. This time was ruled by actual godsthemselves which was followed by semi-human gods. The Turin Papyrus which datesback to Rameses II names the list of gods starting with Ra, Geb, Osiris, Seth,Horus and Thoth among others. But then it continues to list 38 semi-divinerulers who continued to rule over Egypt under the guidance of various gods. In1843 already, Dr. Samuel Birch who was the curator of the British Museumannounced that the papyrus and its fragments had produced a total of 330 nameswhich “coincided with 330 kings mentioned by Herodotus”. The Egyptians firmlybelieved that Ra came to Earth from a planet they referred to as a “Planet ofMillions of Years”. They also believed that the Ben-Ben, which was the uppermostseparate unit of the Great Pyramid, was the vessel which carried the gods toEarth. Another name for the Ben-Ben was ‘Pyramidion Bird’. Even then thetechnological advancement which is depicted in the tablets is astounding. Thegod Ptah was shown to be controlling the flow of the river Nile. With asuccession of reservoirs and gates which could be opened and closed, he couldallow the river to rise and fall as he wanted. Something modern engineers onlymanaged to repeat thousands of years later.The Egyptians called the gods and their offspring ‘Ntr’which means ‘guardian orwatcher’. We have discover that these ‘watchers’ played a crucial part in thePharaonic period of Egypt's history. When Marduk or Ra eventually took control,he decreed that all kings had to be descendants of the Neteru – ‘the watchers’.It was said that they came to Egypt from ‘Ta-Ur’the ‘Faraway Foreign Land’but itcould also have meant that they actually came from Ur, the city itself. Thestraits of the Red Sea were called ‘Ta-Neter’which connect Mesopotamia and Egyptand were seen as the direction from which they came.LIST OF KINGS AND CITIES FROM BEFORE THE FLOOD[../Images/514-1.jpg]This is just 1 of 6 existing copies of the pre-flood king lists which are knownto us at present. Written in Sumerian on clay circa 2000 BC in Babylonia, thelist outlines the beginnings of Sumerian and the world's history as theSumerians knew it. It provides names of kings and cities of great antiquity. Itis generally thought that the ‘antediluvian king list’ is reflected in Genesis5, which lists the patriarchs from Adam to Noah, living a collective 8,575years. Like Enoch – 365 years and Methuselah – 969 years. Is it possible thatthe 222,600 years of the king list is a more realistic reflection of the hugespan of time from Creation to the flood? The first of the five cities mentioned,Eridu, is the area where the myths place the Garden of Eden, while the lastcity, Shuruppak, is the city of Ziusudra, the Sumerian Noah.Translation:“IN ERIDU: ALULIM RULED AS KING 28,800 YEARS. ELALGAR RULED 43,200 YEARS. ERIDUWAS ABANDONED. KINGSHIP WAS TAKEN TO BAD-TIBIRA. AMMILU'ANNA THE KING RULED36,000 YEARS. ENMEGALANNA RULED 28,800 YEARS. DUMUZI RULED 28,800 YEARS.BAD-TIBIRA WAS ABANDONED. KINGSHIP WAS TAKEN TO LARAK. EN-SIPA-ZI-ANNA RULED13,800 YEARS. LARAK WAS ABANDONED. KINGSHIP WAS TAKEN TO SIPPAR. MEDURANKI RULED7,200 YEARS. SIPPAR WAS ABANDONED. KINGSHIP WAS TAKEN TO SHURUPPAK. UBUR-TUTURULED 36,000 YEARS. TOTAL: 8 KINGS, THEIR YEARS: 222,600”Code of Hammurabi: PreambleWhile Hammurabi, the founding king of Babylon, was writing his codes of lawcirca 2100 -1900 BC, he preceded them by the statement below. This should leaveno doubt in our minds as to who was actually his ‘living god’. Take note thathistorians are still not in agreement when exactly Hammurabi lived, hence the200-year margin.“Lofty Anu, lord of the gods who from heaven came to Earth, and Enlil, lord ofHeaven and Earth who determines the destinies of the land, determined forMarduk, the firstborn of Enki, the Enlil-functions over all mankind;Made him great among the gods who watch and see,Called Babylon by name to be exalted, made it supreme in the world;And established for Marduk, in its midst, an everlasting kingship.”War of the TitansIn Sumerian ‘TI.TA.AN’ means ‘those who in heaven live’. There are manybreathtaking descriptions in Sumerian tablets of the war between the Titans andOlympians, pointing to the fact that the gods were at odds with each other forquite some time. There are several smaller incidences between gods which arestretched over long periods. But then to humans a 10-year period is a long time,so it needs to be taken in context. The Anunnaki gods had a completely differentoutlook on time. Their immortal DNA made them less aware of the passage of time.It was seemingly not an important factor in their lives. Here are some Sumerianextracts describing the battles between the gods. It seems pretty clear to methat this was not just a description of a stormy night.“Thus, then, they launched their grievous bolts at one another;And the cry of both armies as they shouted reached to the starry heaven as theyclashed with a great battle cry.”Another tablet section states the following:“The hot vapour lapped around…Flame unspeakable rose high to the upper air…The flashing glare of the Thunderstone, its lightning blinded their eyes, sostrong it was.Astounding heat seized Chaos…It seemed as if Earth and wide Heaven above had come together…”Vedic scripturesThe Hindus believe that the ancient Vedic scriptures are “not of human origin”and that they were actually composed by the gods in a previous age. There arefantastic references to the gods and their awesome weapons. It was the godTvashtri or ‘Fashioner’ who provided the gods with ‘aerial cars’ and othermysterious weapons which appear as hand-held items in ancient Hindu depictions.Among a host of others, he created a trident for Rudra; a ‘Fire Weapon’ forAgni; and a ‘Bolt-hurling Thunder’ for Indra. The Vedic texts talk about “…atriple seat and reins of gold, the famous car that traverses Heaven and Earth.”And from a translation of Mahabharata, The Epic of Ancient India we read atranslation by R. Dutt which contains the following:“The gods in cloud-borne chariots, came to view the scene so fair…Bright celestial cars in concourse sailed upon the cloudless sky.”The texts also introduce us to gods who were “swift as young falcons” and whowere called ‘Ashvins’ or ‘Drivers’, who specialised in operating celestialchariots. They are referred to as “the best of charioteers who reached theheavens”. The Vedic scriptures or poems are truly a remarkable read. I highlyrecommend that you look them up on the internet and indulge in the large volumeof work. It is so rich in graphic imagery and grandiose action, it will enthralyou for weeks. Within a very short time of reading the first poem, you willrealise that this was much more than some hallucinogenic manifestation.Flying vehiclesThe Akkadians had a name for ‘the flying vehicle’ which they called Ti-ia-ri-ta.Why would they need a name for such vehicles? Where did they see them?WINGED DEITIES AND DISCS[../Images/516-1.jpg]Ancient civilisations were obsessed with images of winged gods and deities.These are just a few examples from various cultures.SATELLITE - XMM NEWTON SATELLITE CHANDRA [../Images/517-1.jpg]Would the primitive people of the modern world look at these objects in the skyand see them as winged deities or discs? We learn in the Sumerian tablets thatthe Anunnaki possessed the technology to fly around and monitor activitiesaround the world.Nature -NurtureThere has been an age-old tussle between philosophers and psychologists aboutthe effects of ‘Nature versus Nurture’. In other words, how the environmenteffects individuals as opposed to their genetic predisposition. Many are stillof the opinion that ‘Nurture’, or upbringing, plays the dominant role indetermining the eventual makeup of an individual. Without starting aphilosophical debate, we should remind ourselves that in most such cases wherethe upbringing has moulded a person, we are dealing with personality or habitualmanifestations of their character. Not physical or genetic manifestations whichare predetermined by the DNA, like colour of eyes, height, hair, or evengenetically programmed disease. You can eat as much fish as you like, if youhave brown eyes, they will not become blue. It has however been noted that incertain coastal communities with high fish intake, many people have developeddeep turquoise eye colour. This was however as a result of a genetic change inthe individuals over many generations which eventually manifested itself in sucha dramatic physical appearance.SlaveryIt is truly tragic to realise that humans have actually been enslavedeconomically, culturally and religiously for 200,000 years. You may throw allkinds of intellectual arguments at this statement, but the fact remains that ithas been this continuous oppression of humanity, which has largely retarded ourrapid progress. We don't know where we would be technologically today if we hada global society free of oppression.Capitalism versus communismHumanity is by nature a communal species. Look at what we are prepared tosacrifice for our families. We work relentlessly for the benefit of our spousesand offspring. We don't expect any reward, we simply do it for love. Okay, theremay be an argument there, but in general, each member of the family contributesto the greater well-being of the unit without expecting to be rewarded for itfinancially. They all share the spoils and benefits without much trepidation,allowing each member to enjoy whatever luxuries have been provided for. In mostfamilies this behaviour is extended to the cousins and nephews and uncles andaunts. In some cultures such behaviour is even extended to the greater communitywhich may comprise the local village. And then, suddenly everything changes. Thegentle communal character becomes the monstrous ‘capitalistic beast’. Suddenlythe concept of ‘what can I do for my community’ is crushed by ‘what can I do formyself’. Capitalism is all about amassing wealth for an individual, whichultimately means money. How can I make the most amount of money with the leastamount of effort? To achieve this elevated level of wealth, the individual wouldhave to at some stage use and abuse other humans to achieve his goal. This willundoubtedly mean some form of slavery or exploitation if you want, of lessfinancially stable individuals. Capitalism is a clear indication that the‘greed’ gene is so strong in our bodies, that we disguise it in all kinds ofcloaks which are meant to sweeten the taste of this bitter system. Capitalism isnot only a recipe for disaster among the human race, but I do also fear thatdemocracy has been successfully hijacked by a small group of capitalists whohave found a useful front to attain insane wealth at the expense of the greatermajority of humans. What is this insane chase for wealth all about? Where doesit end? Will one giant organisation eventually own the whole world and use thehumans as its slaves as it pleases? Where will capitalistic greed and wealth getus as a species on a fragile planet? You should give this some thought, and Imean deep thought. Imagine the crew of Starship Enterprise in a constantstruggle for capitalistic supremacy…I don't think they would get much furtherthen the edge of the solar system. Even on board of that imaginary spaceship,there is a well-organised communal structure, devoid of capitalist greed. Maybethe crew of Star Trek are meant to teach us more than just about deep space. Butrather a whole new form of ‘communalism’, which transcends capitalism into the22nd millennium and into the final frontier of new socio-economic disciplines.GoldThe Sumerian word Za-ab means ‘gold’ which is Ab-zu in reverse. Abzu was thename for Africa, where the gold was extracted in great quantity. It meant ‘ThePrimeval Source’.Pyramids[../Images/519-1.jpg]The Great Pyramid was the tallest building in the world for thousands of years.The first modern structure to surpass its height was the Eiffel tower. Accordingto Zahi Hawass, the respected and famous Egyptian archaeologist, there are 104pyramids remaining in Egypt, 54 of which have 'substructures' meaning that theyhave some sort of passages and rooms built underneath the pyramid. As far as myresearch has shown, there is only one pyramid with a complex of internalchambers, in the middle of the pyramid - The Great Pyramid. We should not findthat surprising as it does not take a genius to figure out that this would bethe most difficult aspect of such giant structures to plan and execute. It ismuch easier to create the passages and rooms in the foundation of the pyramidsand then build the rest on top of it. But many of the pyramids are hardlyrecognisable as such and look more like mounds of rubble. Indicating that theonly three 'properly' built pyramids were the Giza pyramids which actually stillsurvive in their awesome splendour. The two Great Pyramids were also the largestEgyptian pyramids built. While most of the others which were built later hardlystand, mostly collapsed and reduced to rubble, those three Great pyramids ofGiza keep astounding us with their architectural ingenious. They did notcollapse, they inspired later kings to build similar structures and yet no otherpharaoh, irrespective of his power or wealth, could imitate the original threepyramids in their complexity. Just imagine the sequence of events according othe popular historical theory Narmer, the first king of Egypt unified a bunch ofpeasant farmers who eked out a living along the Nile some 3 200 BC. He declaredhimself the king of the entire Ehypt and fought wars against invading armies. Hewas succeeded by Menes, the first king of 30 dynasties. And sometime during theearly part of the Old Kingdom, before building any of the other pyramids withthe exception of possibly one, they built the three Great Pyramids of Giza. IfNarmer unified a bunch of peasants under him, where did he get his knowledge andwisdom from? Where among the farmesrs did the later kings find the ingeniousbuilders with the sudden knowledge to construct the most complex of all thepyramids? It all sounds a little suspicious to me. Even today, if you wentaround the world and rounded up thousands of farmers, asking them to construct apyramid the size of the Great Pyramid, you would not succeed. So, I would urgeyou to think about this whole pyramid thing as practically and realistically asyou can and don't be influenced by the popular fairytales spewed forth by blindhistorians. Just to give you some food for thought, there are 56 perfectlypolished slabs of granite in the King's Vhapber, each weighing about 54 tons.Those had to be quarried some 900 kilometres south of Giza at Aswanand broughtall the way to the building site. Then they had to lift and place into positionthe giant blocks, shich today could only be picked up by a handful of moderncranes. But some of the stones in the mortuary temple of Menkaure, the 3rd andsmallest Giza pyramid, are over 200 tons in weight.[../Images/520-1.jpg]Great Pyramid (Khufu)[../Images/521-1.jpg]Pyramid of Djoser substructureExtract from the restoration stela of Tutankhamen as translated by Sir AlanGardiner:“When his majesty arose as king of the temples of the gods and goddesses ….TheDelta had fallen into decay, their shrines had fallen into desolation and becomeruins overgrown with weeds…The gods had turned their back on the land.”This is in keeping with Marduk's rise and eventual abandonment of Egypt between3200 and 1200 BC, leaving behind an impoverished Egypt and kings who were losingpower. Mainly because their god Marduk had deserted them.Colour of the PharaohsI find it fascinating that the different kings and queens of Egypt are depictedas having different skin colours. Some are seen as very light-skinned, othershave a darker reddish hue to their skin, while some are quite dark-skinned. Itis also notable that the slaves and workers around the kings and queens arealmost always depicted as being of a darker skin colour than the royalty. Shouldwe be surprised by this? It tells us in the tablets that Marduk decreed that allthe kings would have to be descendants of the Neteru or Igigi. I have alreadypointed out that those were advanced gods and followers of Marduk for manythousands of years and they were the eventual Aryans who were white andtechnologically advanced. It is therefore not surprising that as time went byand the Pharaohs interbred, the latter kings were darker in skin colour, muchcloser to the original humans who were “red-hued” in skin colour according tothe Sumerian tablets. The workers and slaves have often been referred to as the‘black-headed people’ in ancient scripts. It seems as if the race card hasplayed a pivotal role in human history since the very origins of humanity. Itwas only towards the end of the Egyptian Empire when the Nubian kings invadedEgypt and became kings of Egypt, that we see the emergence of ‘black’ kings inEgypt. And where did these black Nubian kings come from? Africa of course!African KingsAfrican Kingdoms have survived longer than any of the other globalcivilisations, arguably starting around 2,000 BC and still existing today. Thereare however ruins in Monomotapa, southern Africa, which include the GreatZimbabwe ruins, which could be many thousands of years old dating back to100,000 BC or more.BibleThere is no doubt that the old cities of the Bible were also the original citiesof the Sumerian gods. What there is doubt about, is why did they write the booksof the Old Testament, if the knowledge and information was already there? If italready existed for all to see? They must have been aware of it! Or were theyjust as ignorant as we are today? Looking upon ancient works some 2,000 yearsold to them, not knowing what to make of it? If one takes into account theamount of manipulation of Humankind that was going on by the gods and theroyalty, it becomes evident that most of the working ‘slave species’ were prettyignorant about mostly everything. They simply subsisted from day to day, neverknowing when they would no longer be needed or sent into some inexplicablebattle.BabylonBab-Ili means ‘Gateway of the Gods’ in Akkadian. All the historical accounts ofthe Tower of Babel have the same objectives: To build a tower to reach the skyor heavens.GodThe creator of the universe and all things in it, the GOD with a big G, washijacked by the architects of popular religions. They reduced the Supreme Beingto a materialistic humanoid with greed and vengeance as his backbone.Communism & ReligionThe basis of most, if not all popular religions, is the concept of never turningyour back on your fellow man and always being prepared to lend a hand. Is itpossible that the concept of communism was the basis of all religions? Thestronghold of Qumran was a perfect example of a communal society all sharingeverything and living together. This is where Josef, father of Jesus, lived andwas educated. This was an Essene establishment with lots of evidence that therewas constant intervention by angels and even the gods. Is this yet anotherindication that the Anunnaki gods were actually communists at heart? That theyunderstood the basic principles of sharing and working together towards a commonwell-being of the entire community? That is the origin of all human culturewhich seems to have been passed down to us by the Anunnaki. The concept of tradeand especially money, only entered the arena long after the flood and during theearly days of modern civilisations. Although it can be said that slavery, whichpredates all of these events, was probably responsible for keeping a kind ofstatus-quo among the populations while providing food and luxuries to everyone.JesusThe Pharisees called Jesus “the man of a lie” referring to his teachings asillegitimate.Other godsThere is plenty of talk about other gods in the Bible and whenever they arementioned, they are immediately condemned to being vile and evil impostors.Malachi 2:11-12“Judah has broken faith. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and inJerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the LORD loves, by marrying thedaughter of a foreign god. As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, maythe LORD cut him off from the tents of Jacob even though he brings offerings tothe LORD Almighty.”1 Corinthians 8:4-5“We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no Godbut one. For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth asindeed there are many gods and many lords…”Saviours and messengersThere are several references in the Bible to the saviour or messiah or messengerof god who will come to save humanity. But the identity of the messiah is keptvery dubious.Malachi 3:1“‘See, I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Thensuddenly the Lord you are seeking will come to his temple; the messenger of thecovenant, whom you desire, will come,’ says the LORD Almighty.”Submission to Rulers and MastersIt is unacceptable that a disciple of Jesus should condone slavery, tellingslaves to be proud and accept their unjustified punishment, because they aredoing good in god's eyes.1 Peter“Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men:whether to the king, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent byhim to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.”And here we are instructed to ‘fear’ god. Why should we fear our loving makerunless he has some malicious streak up his sleeve?1 Peter continues: 14-22“Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honour the king…Slaves, submityourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good andconsiderate, but also to those who are harsh. For it is commendable if a manbears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God. Buthow is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it?But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable beforeGod. To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you anexample, that you should follow in his steps. “He committed no sin, …and nodeceit was found in his mouth.”The conniving god uses Jesus to mislead humans:1 Peter 23-24“When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered,he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. Hehimself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins andlive for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.”CreationThe Sumerians would recite the Enuma Elish or Epic of Creation verbatim onsacred days just as other religious scriptures are recited by more recentreligions on certain days. We see a great example of dual histories whencomparing Genesis to this book, written some 2000 years earlier. LaurenceGardner has outlined some of the common elements between Genesis and EnumaElish.Enuma Elish Genesis - Divine spirit is coexistent and coeternal with cosmicmatter. - Divine spirit creates cosmic matter and exists independently of it. -Primeval chaos, with darkness enveloping the salt waters. - Adesolate waste,with darkness covering the deep. - Light emanates from the gods and thefirmament is created above Earth. - Light is created by God and the firmament iscreated above the the Earth. - Dry land is created on Earth. - Dry land iscreated on Earth. - The luminaries (sun, moon and stars) are created. - Theluminaries (sun, moon and stars) are created. - Man is created Adamu or Luluamelu. - Man is created -Adam. -God rests.It is important to remember that Genesis was written around 600 BC while theEnuma Elish is several thousand years older. Dan Sewell Ward points out that“The comparative brevity of Genesis with respect to the Enuma Elish is probablyindicative that it is far easier to edit out sections than creatively add newones, especially when there is a strong resistance to originality in writing theholy texts of a religion.”The Egyptian scribe Ipuwer allows us to make some enlightening comparisonsbetween Genesis and the Egyptian texts captured in the Papyrus Ipuwer. ImmanuelVelikovsky pointed out the similarities and showed that the Hebrew Exodus fromEgypt did actually occur at the end of the Old Kingdom and not later as is oftensuggested.Eddas and VedasIs it coincidental that the most venerated ancient Norse scriptures are calledthe Eddas and contain a character called Rig, who talks about three classes ofman: ‘Slave’, ‘Freeman’ and ‘Noble’ – while the Hindus have their sacredscriptures called the Vedas, of which the oldest is the ‘Rig Veda'. The Hinduculture is well-known for their caste class structure dividing people into fourclasses. Another clear link between the Aryans from Scandinavia and IndusValley.Papyrus Ipuwer Exodus Papyrus 2:5-6: Plague is throughout the land. Blood iseverywhere. Exodus 7:21: …there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.Papyrus 2:10: The river is blood. Exodus 7:20: …all the waters that were inthe river were turned to blood. Papyrus 3:10: Men shrink from tasting - theythirst after water for they could not drink of the water of the river Exodus7:24: And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink.Papyrus 3:10-13: That is our water!

Papyrus 9:2-3: Behold, cattle are leftto stray, and there is none to gather them together. Each man fetches forhimself those that are branded with his name. Exodus 9:19: …gather thy cattle,and all that thou has in the field. Esodus 9:21: And he that regarded not theword of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field. Papyrus 9:11:The land is not light… Exodus 10:22: …and there was a thick darkness in allthe land of Egypt. Papyrus 5:6: Forsooth, the children of princes are dashedagainst the walls. Papyrus 6:12: Forsooth, the childern of princes are cast outin the streets. Exodus 12:29: And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lordsmote all the firsborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of the Pharaohthat sat on his throne unto the firs born of the captive that was in thedungeon. Papyrus 2:13: He who places his brother in the ground is everywhere. Exodus 12:30: …there was not a house where there was not one dead. Papyrus 3:14:It is groaning that is throughout the land, mingled with lamentations. Exodus12:30: …there was a great cry in Egypt. Papyrus 7:1: Behold, the fire hasmounted up on high.

Exodus 12:21: …by day in a pillar a cloud, to lead them the way, and by night ina pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night.Source: Library of Halexandria website.God destroys the enemies of the IsraelitesThe following chapter from the Bible is a perfect example of god's partialitytowards humans. How could god choose one group of people over another? Whathappened to the others who lived in the lands? Why were they so vile and sinfulthat they warranted total annihilation? So the god of vengeance would clear thepath for those who obeyed and feared him while mercilessly destroying othergroups of humans who may have been aligned with the other Anunnaki gods. Suchwas the feud between Enlil and the younger Marduk.Deuteronomy 31:1 -8. Joshua to Succeed Moses“Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel: ‘I am now a hundredand twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you.’The LORD has said tome, “You shall not cross the Jordan.” The LORD your God himself will cross overahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will takepossession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the LORDsaid. And the LORD will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of theAmorites, whom he destroyed along with their land. The LORD will deliver them toyou, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you. Be strong andcourageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your Godgoes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you’. Then Moses summonedJoshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, ‘Be strong and courageous,for you must go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to theirforefathers to give them, and you must divide it among them as theirinheritance. The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he willnever leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.’”We get more scary examples of how the people feared the brutality of god fromDeuteronomy 31:9 -13 – The Reading of the Law and how they were reminded tofollow his every word if they wanted to avoid severe punishment.“So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, whocarried the ark of the covenant of the LORD… ‘Assemble the people-men, women andchildren, and the aliens living in your towns – so they can listen and learn tofear the LORD your God and follow carefully all the words of this law. Theirchildren, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the LORD yourGod as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.’”Once more we experience the incredible appearance of god in person to a human,this time it was Moses. But the description is a little suspicious to moderncivilised people. The Anunnaki gods would not get away with pulling stunts likethis today and therefore we no longer see such mysterious appearances. We alsohear the obvious reference to other gods and how it angered god.Deuteronomy 31: 14 -18 continues:“The LORD said to Moses, ‘Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua andpresent yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, where I will commission him.’ SoMoses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting. Then theLORD appeared at the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over theentrance to the Tent. And the LORD said to Moses: ‘You are going to rest withyour fathers and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreigngods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenantI made with them. On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; Iwill hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters anddifficulties will come upon them… And I will certainly hide my face on that daybecause of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.’”Then Moses continued to predict as he was told by god, that his people will comeunder the influence of other gods, once they leave Egypt and enter lands whereother Anunnaki gods ruled. But god wanted to retain the loyalty of these humanfollowers among the other Anunnaki gods, because it was with large human numbersthat the gods fought wars against each other. It was impossible for the gods toexert their influence over the lands without the fanatical loyalty of theirpersonal human followers.Deuteronomy continues verses 20-29:“‘When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land Ipromised on oath to their forefathers… they will turn to other gods and worshipthem, rejecting me and breaking my covenant.’ The LORD gave this command toJoshua son of Nun: ‘Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelitesinto the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you.’ Mosescontinued ‘For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corruptand to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster willfall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD and provoke himto anger by what your hands have made.’”Genesis 3: 21 -24God makes garments? God says that man has become like one of us? Who is ‘us’?Cherubim with flaming swords? It sounds just like the story in The Epic ofGilgamesh which talks about ‘Beasts with weapons’ to protect the ME in Enlil'ssacred garden. It also tells us that the gods lived forever.“The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. Andthe LORD God said, ‘The man has now become like one of us, knowing good andevil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the treeof life and eat, and live forever.’ So the LORD God banished him from the Gardenof Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. After he drove the manout, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flamingsword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.”The following passages from Exodus 3 are astonishing. They reinforce god'sintention to decimate Canaanites, Hittites and others; to afflict Egyptians withamazing wonders and other manifestations of god's fury; and it even displaysgod's greed for gold when he asks the Hebrews to plunder the neighbours for goldbefore they depart. Why would god ask his loyal followers to plunder the goldfrom the Egyptians before they are led to freedom? Why would god be so obsessedwith gold?Exodus 3:2 -20: Moses and the Burning Bush.“(On the mountain of God.) There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flamesof fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it didnot burn up…. God called to him from within the bush, ‘Moses! Moses!’ ... ‘Go,assemble the elders of Israel and say to them,’ “The LORD, the God of yourfathers-the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob-appeared to me and said: I havewatched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. And I havepromised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of theCanaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites - a landflowing with milk and honey.” ‘The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then youand the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, “The LORD , theGod of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into thedesert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.” But I know that the king ofEgypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him. So I will stretchout my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will performamong them. After that, he will let you go. ‘And I will make the Egyptiansfavourably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not goempty-handed. Every woman is to ask her neighbour and any woman living in herhouse for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put onyour sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.’”God's favouritismWho was Cain's wife? If Adam, Eve and Cain were the only people on Earth, whowas Nod? Where was the land of Nod? What ‘help’ from the lord did Eve get togive birth? What other people lived there? Where did they come from? Why didthey only start calling the Lord's name then? Surely they knew god from longbefore that?Why would god not look with ‘favour’ on Cain's crop. Why would god be upset withCain when his crop did not produce high yields? Should god not encourage andguide him? Who was Enoch's wife? Was she one of his aunts; a child of Adam andEve? We can only make practical sense of these passages if we refer to theearlier Sumerian tablets, where everything is perfectly outlined. But Genesisleaves many questions.Genesis 4:1- 26: Cain and Abel.“Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. Shesaid, ‘With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man.’ Later she gavebirth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. Inthe course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering tothe LORD. But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock.The LORD looked with favour on Abel and his offering, but on Cain and hisoffering he did not look with favour. And while they were in the field, Cainattacked his brother Abel and killed him. Then the LORD said to Cain, ‘Where isyour brother Abel?’ ‘I don't know,’ he replied. ‘Am I my brother's keeper?’ TheLORD said, ‘What have you done?’ So Cain went out from the LORD' presence andlived in the land of Nod, east of Eden. Cain lay with his wife, and she becamepregnant and gave birth to Enoch. To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was thefather of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushaelwas the father of Lamech. Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the otherZillah. Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tentsand raise livestock. His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all whoplay the harp and flute. Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kindsof tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah. Adam lay withhis wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, ‘God hasgranted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.’ Seth also hada son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of theLORD.”Where did all these people come from? Who were the wives of all the men who hadmore offspring, if Adam and Eve were the only two humans created by god in thebeginning? How is it possible that they were moulding bronze tools when theBronze Age only started at the earliest some 4,000 BC? And how is it possiblethey knew about Iron, when the Iron Age only began much later, around 1,500 BC?This is all very suspicious, showing that these chapters could only have beenwritten by ignorant people way after 1,500 BC, when iron and bronze werecommonly used.Gold & Genesis 2:10 -12The Bible has hardly ‘taken off’ when god already displays his lust for gold.Why would god be so obsessed with gold right from the very beginning of humanityon Earth?“A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated intofour headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through theentire land of Havilah, where there is gold. The gold of that land is good…”Genesis 8:18 -21God smells the burnt frying meat and describes it as a pleasant aroma! Was god acarnivore? If all the animals were killed by the flood, Noah only had one pairof each in the ark. So when he sacrificed some animals after landing, it meanshe just offered one of the only pair of surviving animals left on Earth. Alittle silly, is it not? How did that animal procreate without a partner?“So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives. Allthe animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds –everything that moves on the earth came out of the ark, one kind after another.Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animalsand clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it. The LORD smelled thepleasing aroma…”God rewards with treasures“‘ Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure inyour sacks; I received your silver.’ Then he brought Simeon out to them.”Is this an example of the god of love?Giving man poisoned water to drink, destroying their crops, their families andsending poisonous snakes against man? Even the mention of a full attack by afierce army on horseback.Jeremiah 8:2 -17“‘They will be exposed to the sun and the moon… They will not be gathered up orburied, but will be like refuse lying on the ground. Wherever I banish them, allthe survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life,’ declares the LORDAlmighty. ‘The wise will be put to shame; they will be dismayed and trapped.Therefore I will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners. Iwill take away their harvest,’ declares the LORD. ‘There will be no grapes onthe vine. There will be no figs on the tree, and their leaves will wither. WhatI have given them will be taken from them.’ For the LORD our God has doomed usto perish and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned againsthim. We hoped for peace but no good has come, for a time of healing but therewas only terror. The snorting of the enemy's horses is heard from Dan; at theneighing of their stallions the whole land trembles. They have come to devourthe land and everything in it, the city and all who live there. ‘See, I willsend venomous snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they willbite you,’ declares the LORD.”Jesus – The godly offspringIf Mary was impregnated by an ‘angel’ through some artificial insemination, thechild could be some form of genetic offspring of Enlil or another one of thegods, like Adapa, Noah, Gilgamesh and others before him. Jesus must have knownthat he was special, he must have had some contact with the Anunnaki who toldhim certain things about their expectations and guided him along. God Enlil musthave made him all kinds of promises which made him go along with the whole planto die for the sin of mankind. While this was developing, the Anunnaki had tothink on their feet. They must have planned their manipulation and activity ofJesus almost on a daily basis. This prophet's effect has spread further than anyof the others they had planned and planted.Anunnaki TimetableBut the Anunnaki did not have a planned timetable of things to come. As I said,they had to think on their feet and they did not necessarily want to commit toany time scale. They would rather see how this ‘Jesus effect’ would play outamong the people. In Acts 1 we read just that.Acts 1:6 -11: Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven.“ So when they met together, they asked him, ‘Lord, are you at this time goingto restore the kingdom to Israel?’ He said to them: ‘It is not for you to knowthe times or dates the Father has set by his own authority. But you will receivepower when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses inJerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.’”And then Jesus was taken into the sky by some way which is also described in theTalmud Jmmanuel.“After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid himfrom their sight. They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going,when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. ‘Men of Galilee,’ theysaid, ‘why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has beentaken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him gointo heaven.’”Once more we have ‘angels’ intervening to set things straight just in case thedisciples had any other thoughts about what just happened. They needed to bereminded that Jesus was actually taken into ‘heaven’ and not by some other weirdset of events.Messiah & SaviourThe Jews were waiting for a messiah to save them from the Romans and notnecessarily someone who would preach ‘to turn the other cheek’. We learn in Luke24:19 that even his disciples thought Jesus was going to defeat the Romans and“Redeem Israel...”Different prophetsDifferent prophets and messiahs planted by the Anunnaki gods in various parts ofthe world would have a disturbing but premeditated effect on humans. It wouldconfuse and divide humanity, keeping them religiously enslaved and in fear formillennia.Angels control the apostlesAfter the apostles were put in jail, an angel appeared and set them free withoutany sign of force. This was a wonderfully calculated intervention by theAnunnaki gods to get the apostles on their side as well. They had to believe inthe power of god. Now the apostles would be lifelong believers in god, hismiraculous angels and their power.Acts 5:8 -21“They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail. But during thenight an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.‘Go, stand in the temple courts,’ he said, ‘and tell the people the full messageof this new life.’ At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had beentold, and began to teach the people.”Jesus' legions of angelsWhen Jesus was confronted by a group of men with swords wanting to kill him hemust have made quite an impression, because they put away their swords andobeyed him. The impression he made was in his reference to “legions of angels”.The people of the time were quite aware of the angels who made their regularappearances and they were also aware of the power of the angels who had fierceweapons to destroy. It seems that Jesus played the powerful Anunnaki card veryeffectively.Matthew 26:53“Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposalmore than twelve legions of angels?”Ancient Fatherly AdviceFrom the Ancient History Sourcebook comes this amazing bit of fatherly advicewhich Shakespeare would have been proud of. It does however enforce theimportance that slavery played throughout the ages and the relationship and fearof god in those days, indicating that god had a physical interaction with humanson a regular basis. It deals with the basic tenets of law and order and it alsopoints to the early evolution of philosophy among humans. What is mostinteresting however is the concept of ‘love thy neighbour and thy enemy’ whichwas only really promoted in earnest by Jesus some 2,200 years later. Ithighlights the confused state of the time when the Old Testament was about tostart preaching ‘an eye for an eye’ and yet some individuals had a completelyopposing view of such things. These words shine a bright light on the controlthat was soon to be enforced on Humankind by Enlil and his foe Marduk in aneffort to control large numbers of fearful humans in the early days of the OldTestament. To achieve this, the gods would begin a relentless campaign ofpunishment and abuse of humanity, ushering in the early days of Abraham.The Advice of an Akkadian Father to His Son, circa 2,200 BC:“Do not set out to stand around in the assembly. Do not loiter where there is adispute, for in the dispute they will have you as an observer. Then you will bemade a witness for them, and they will involve you in a lawsuit to affirmsomething that does not concern you. In case of a dispute, get away from it,disregard it! If a dispute involving you should flare up, calm it down. Adisputeis a covered pit, a wall which can cover over its foes; it brings to mind whatone has forgotten and makes an accusation against a man. Do not return evil toyour adversary; requite with kindness the one who does evil to you, maintainjustice for your enemy, be friendly to your enemy.Give food to eat, beer to drink, grant what is requested, provide for and treatwith honour. At this one's god takes pleasure. It is pleasing to Shamash, whowill repay him with favour. Do good things, be kind all your days.Do not honour a slave girl in your house; she should not rule your bedroom likea wife, do not give yourself over to slave girls...Let this be said among yourpeople: ‘The household which a slave girl rules, she disrupts.’Do not marry a prostitute, whose husbands are legion, an Ishtar-woman who isdedicated to a god, a kulmashitu-woman...When you have trouble, she will notsupport you, when you have a dispute she will be a mocker. There is no reverenceor submissiveness in her. Even if she is powerful in the household, get rid ofher, for she pricks up her ears for the footsteps of another.My son, if it be the wish of a ruler that you belong to him, if you areentrusted with his closely guarded seal, open his treasure house and enter it,for no one but you may do it. Uncounted wealth you will find inside, but do notcovet any of that, nor set your mind on a secret crime, for afterwards thematter will be investigated and the secret crime which you committed will beexposed.Do not speak ill, speak only good. Do not say evil things, speak well of people.He who speaks ill and says evil, people will waylay him because of his debt toShamash. Do not talk too freely, watch what you say. Do not express yourinnermost thoughts even when you are alone. What you say in haste you may regretlater. Exert yourself to restrain your speech.Worship your god every day. Sacrifice and pious utterance are the properaccompaniment of incense. Have a freewill offering for your god, for this isproper toward a god. Prayer, supplication, and prostration offer him daily, thenyour prayer will be granted, and you will be in harmony with god.”(Source: J. S. Arkenberg, Dept. of History, Cal. State Fullerton. Modernised byProf.Arkenberg.)This shows that people were quite ‘with-it’ all those years ago and they hadsharp minds. They were however fearful of the vengeful god. One who wasever-present and had ‘ears’ everywhere to smoke out those who conspired againsthim. We saw what he did with those in Sodom and Gomorrah who conspired againsthim.Assyria: “The All-Seeing god”.We see another example of the fanatical control by god in Assyrian history. Thechief deity of Assyria was Ashur the 'All Seeing'. The people were petrified todo anything suspicious or say anything out of line, because god's spies wereeverywhere. God's behaviour is very reminiscent of the Soviet dictators,especially at the height of oppression under Stalin.CrusadesIs it possible that the Crusades which started in the 11th century AD wereorchestrated by the Anunnaki during their last near orbit of the sun? Rememberthat about 600 years of their orbit is taken up when the planet Nibiru isrounding the Sun and in close proximity to the other planets. There are manysuch references to Nibiru in the clay tablets pointing out its reddish hue andradiance.MeccaIt is written that Mohammed encircled Mecca seven times before he entered it anddestroyed over 300 statues of deities. He did this under strict instructionsfrom god. Which god was it? Enlil or Marduk? Remember that this was some 620 ADand the rivalry for supremacy between the two Anunnaki gods was fierce. What weshould however take note of, is that the worshipping of other god-deities wasstill rife and 300 of their statues were destroyed by the newly chosen prophet.Who was actually behind this? You decide, but the instructions were clear. BothMarduk and Enlil or possibly some of their angels which remained on Earth, wereworking very hard at establishing their respective leaders as the supreme divinepower on the planet which had gone out of control.RamadanIt is said that the angel Gabriel recited the Koran to Mohammed every yearduring the month of Ramadan. Who was this angel? Was it the same one who firstthrottled him to “recite the glory of god”? By this stage Mohammed was obviouslybehaving accordingly and the angels needed to ensure that their new prophet wasnot going to weasel out on them. So they sat him down once a year and remindedhim of his mission.Last PyramidsThe last Egyptian pyramids were built in Nubia, Southern Egypt/Sudan around 300AD by the black Nubian kings. These kings wielded extreme power, they dressed inexquisite leather clothing and they also created the largest sarcophagus everfound. Like their predecessors they were obsessed by gold and piles of gold havebeen found in secret chambers.Gods & AngelsMost of the gods we read about in ancient mythology became ‘angels’ in the Koranand the Bible, interacting with the human slaves, giving them instructions,warning them, punishing them and even rewarding them. During the early days ofthe Bible it was only really Enlil who was referred to by the angels as god. Hewould often appear in person along with some of his godly angels and interactedwith humans. Later, it would also be Marduk who was seen as god because heproclaimed himself as such and he dealt ruthlessly with those who opposed him.Just think of the plagues and pestilence with which he punished his EgyptianKings from time to time.MarriageGod, church and religion were not involved in marriage until the 9th century AD.Until the twelfth century there would be blessings and prayers during theceremony and the couple would offer their own prayers. Then the church becameinvolved on a low level and priests asked that an agreement be made in theirpresence and suddenly religion was part of the ceremony. In the thirteenthcentury the English upper class weddings became religious events but the churchonly blessed the marriage and did not want a legal commitment. Only in 1563 theCouncil of Trent required that Catholic marriages were to be celebrated at aCatholic church by a priest in the presence of two witnesses. Astonishinglyenough, it was only by the eighteenth century, that the wedding became areligious event in all countries of Europe. So we need to be very careful whenreading too much holiness into marriages. Marriage was construed by man, notGod.First Agriculture in the WorldOxford University Press tells us about Abu Hureyra, an ancient village locatedin the valley of the Euphrates River in modern Syria. It was also in this partof the world that Enlil built his residence, in the cedar mountain forests ofLebanon, not far away from this flood-plain and valley. The village has shownirrefutable evidence of agriculture starting as far back as 11,000 BC, possiblybecoming the first known village of farmers inthe world. Brian Fagan in TimeDetectives agrees that following the development of farming, the population grewand the small village of Abu Hureyra expanded until it became one of the largestsettlements of its age in the Middle East. These were probably the first humanswho were taught such skills before the rest of humanity, mainly because theywere close to Enlil and had to provide food for him and the rest of the gods ofMesopotamia. The village was occupied for an uninterrupted period of 4,500years, which is possibly a record for early civilised human settlements. It wasafter the flood and after the success of this agricultural experiment around11,000 BC that the gods began to teach the rest of the slave species how tocultivate crops and other aspects of civilisation. They did not rush into ithowever, it took several thousand years for the great civilisations of humans totruly flourish. There is however talk in the tablets about gods who taught somehuman slaves to perform certain basic planting and harvesting even before theflood, mainly to be able to feed the gods. This is confirmed in Time Detectivesby Brian Fagan, who shows conclusively that specific crops were consumed andmust have been cultivated in the Nile Valley 18,000 BC. Once again concurringwith other claims that Egypt had been settled by the gods for some 17,500 yearsbefore the common era.Ancient Mining in AmericaOn the 15 March 1865 an article by Albert D. Hagar appeared in the AtlanticMonthly outlining ancient copper mines in the Lake Superior region. We learnfrom Sumerian tablets that while the earliest tin mining was taking place atlake Titicaca, other gods were responsible for obtaining copper, which wasnecessary for making bronze, from lands to the north of Titicaca. Could these bethe ancient copper mines of Marduk and Enki and other Anunnaki?“IN the month of March, 1848, Samuel O. Knapp and J. B. Townsend discovered,from tracks in the snow, that a hedgehog had taken up his winter-quarters in acavity of a ledge of rocks, about twelve miles from Ontonagon, Lake Superior,which was in the neighbourhood of the Minnesota Copper Mine. In order to capturetheir game, they procured a pick and shovel, and commenced an excavation byremoving the vegetable mould and rubbish that had accumulated about the mouth ofwhat proved to be a small cavern in the rock. At the depth of a few feet theydiscovered numerous stone hammers or mauls; and they saw that the cavern was nota natural one, but had been worked out by human agency, and that the stoneimplements, found in great profusion in and about it, were the tools used inmaking the excavation. Further examination developed a well-defined vein ofnative copper running through the rock; and it was evidently with a view ofgetting this metal that this extensive opening had been made.”“This was the first instance where “ancient diggings” – as they are familiarlycalled in the Lake Superior region were ever recognised as such; and thisartificial cavern presents the most conclusive proofs that a people in theremote past worked those mines. Upon the discovery of this mine, attention wasat once directed to numerous other cavities and depressions in the surface ofthe earth at this and other points, and the result was that nearly a hundredancient pits were found, and in all of them mining tools of various kinds. Theseancient mines or pits are not restricted to one locality, but extend over theentire length of the copper region, from the eastern extremity of Keweenaw Pointto the Porcupine Mountains, a distance of nearly one hundred miles.”Secret TextsIn 367 AD the Archbishop of Alexandria ordered the destruction of the ‘secrettexts’ of the New Testament. He gave them to one of the younger bishops withclear instructions, but the man was obviously not too keen to destroy suchvaluable works. He disappeared into the desert and hid them in such a manner inwhich they would remain preserved and possibly be recovered in years to come.Could these be the Gnostic Texts which were discovered at Nag Hammadi in theEgyptian desert in 1945?Tree of LifeThe Tree of Life referred to in Sumerian tablets and in the Bible, is actuallythe double helix of the DNA. If we understand its workings and structure, we canconquer all aspects of life and death.[../Images/539-1.jpg]One of the many seals depicting a tree of life and a flying god above otherdeities who are manipulating the DNA.Nag Hammadi – Gnostic TextsFrom the translations of Søren Giversen and Birger A. Pearson of the Nag HammadiTexts, we read the same story which in the Bible is called ‘The fall of Adam’.But this time we are also told that god called the serpent ‘devil’. This meansthat until that point the serpent was only an ordinary member of the ‘godly’group of deities which god himself keeps referring to as “one of us”. We havealready explained that Enki was the Anunnaki with the serpent symbol and fromthis point on, he became the devil. Since we have established that the ‘Tree ofLife’was actually DNA, it is also clear from the script that it was theknowledge of DNA and genetics and eternal life which the god of Eden wasprotecting.“But God came at the time of evening, walking in the midst of Paradise. WhenAdam saw him, he hid himself. And he said, ‘Adam, where are you?’ He answered(and) said, ‘I have come under the fig tree.’ And at that very moment, God knewthat he had eaten from the tree of which he had commanded him, ‘Do not eat ofit.’And he said to him, ‘Who is it who has instructed you?’ And Adam answered,‘The woman whom you have given me.’ And the woman said, ‘It is the serpent whoinstructed me.’ And he (God) cursed the serpent, and called him ‘devil’. And hesaid, ‘Behold, Adam has become like one of us, knowing evil and good.’ Then hesaid, ‘Let us cast him out of paradise, lest he take from the tree of life, andeat, and live forever.’”In further translations by Bentley Layton of the Nag Hammadi scripts calledHypostasis of the Archons we learn that the ‘snake’ was also referred to as the‘instructor’. Supporting the events which point to Enki as the teacher ofHumankind.“And the snake, the instructor, said, ‘With death you shall not die; for it wasout of jealousy that he said this to you. Rather your eyes shall open and youshall come to be like gods…’”Ered...Is the Sumerian word for sunset which refers to the land in the west. It is alsothe origin of the name for Europe, where the sun would set for the Sumerians.Deuteronomy 5:6 -11: God demands obedience.After god Enlil saved the Jews from the Egyptians, he laid down the rules. Heneeded these frightened people to obey him only, and at all times, if he wasgoing to have any chance of standing up to Marduk's onslaught on the slavespecies. By now we are well acquainted with the threats of punishment andendless violence against his slave species who were more confused and morepetrified than ever.“ I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land ofslavery. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourselfan idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or inthe waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, theLORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of thefathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showinglove to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not holdanyone guiltless who misuses his name.”DarwinDarwin's famous statement was “Natura non facit saltum”. Which means ‘naturedoes not go in jumps’. One of the many criticisms of Darwin, is that he deniedthe science of bacteriology to preserve his own doctrine. Through bacteriologyit becomes evident that evolution most likely does occur in leaps rather than asmooth continuous evolutionary process. Mutations in bacteria give us a greatinsight into this highly charged topic.Oldest SceptreThe sceptre found at Abydos, in the tomb of the Scorpion King, is the oldestsceptre found to date. It is thought that Narmer was most likely the ScorpionKing. Is it possible that this King Scorpion was the human son of Marduk andalso the first ruler of Egypt, given the task to unite the land, which hesuccessfully did? Remember that Marduk insisted that all Egyptian kings had tobe of ‘divine’ offspring.CometsHale-Bopp – Last seen on 22 March 1997.

On the 21st of June 2004 this seeminglyimpossible task, which was the domain of the US and Russian governments, wasmatched relatively effortlessly by the first privateer. Burt Rutan's teamsuccessfully built a humble and somewhat flimsy looking rocket, which waspiloted into space twice in one week. Showing that it is quite possible forclear-thinking scientists to achieve manned space flight without astronomicalamounts of taxpayers' money. When looking at Spaceship One, the small andfragile rocket in which they achieved this, one cannot but display a high levelof amazement at how simple they made it look. We should therefore not be amazedwhen reading about advanced beings who could achieve such flight on a regularbasis without too much effort. Our time will come in the near future, when the'slave species' will also be whizzing in and out of space without the effortdisplayed by today's space agencies.More Flood StoriesThe story of Atra-hasis and the flood is the most comprehensive of theMesopotamian flood stories dating back to around 1700 BC. Here is a shortextract from a James W. Bells’ adaptation, to support many of the other talesabout the involvement of Enlil and Enki.“Enlil said, ‘I cannot sleep because of the bellowing of men, but I cannot bringthem under control because of my brother, Enki. He protects them. Because hecreated them, they are his children. I will see him about this.’ So Enlil wentto Enki and said, ‘You persuaded us to kill a god and used your power to createmen. You imposed our yoke upon them but you also had Mami gift them with thespoken word. What you did was wrong, for men use their power to shout and curseand argue with each other. Now, you must swear an oath to correct the wrong youhave caused. You must use your power against your creation and create a Flood torid the earth of men.’”[../Images/542-1.jpg]Old Babylonian on clay; Babylonia circa 1900 BC. This part of the Atra-Hasisflood story is missing on all other known tablets. There are only some 13tablets and fragments preserved of the Atra-Hasis Epic and much of the epic islost. Genesis tells us that the cause of the flood was mankind's wickedness andviolence. The Babylonian story tells us that the cause was the noisy activitiesof humans, preventing the chief god, Enlil, from sleeping. It also mentions theharsh account of swollen animals and human bodies. This part was apparentlydeleted from the biblical flood story, even if it would have been the firstsight meeting Noah as he left the Ark.Translation:“ATRA-HASIS, EPIC, THE END OF THE BABYLONIAN FLOOD STORY: …IN HIS HEART HE DIDNOT TAKE COUNSEL(?)..., THE ANIMALS HAD SWELLED UP..., MANKIND HAD SWELLEDUP..., AT THAT TIME THE SAGE WATRAM­HASIS SAW THIS. HE SPOKE TO EA HIS LORD,(ENLIL WAS DISTURBED BY) THE NOISE OF (THE PEOPLE)…”Sperm of the godsWhy do humans have such a wild and immoral streak embedded in their DNA? Weinherited it from our makers of course! Just like the Greeks and Romans, theVedas of the Indus Valley display equally high levels of wild sexual forays andimmorality. In the Greek ‘Iliad’ we read about wars of men and gods overbeautiful goddesses, their conquests and their fall in the pursuit of sexualdomination. The Vedic scriptures are no exception. 'Ramayana' is such an epictale which talks about prince Rama, whose beautiful wife was abducted by theking of Lanka of the island of Ceylon, known today as Sri Lanka. A whole host ofgods came to the rescue as they do in Sumerian and Greek tales. In anotherepisode of lust, the stunning Tara and wife of Indra's charioteer the“Illustrious Rudra”, was abducted by Sukra, an immortal god. These lustfulabductions would always erupt in a short but fierce battle between the gods. Inthis case they actually took refuge with the ‘Prime Deity’ which resulted in thegrand leader and grandfather of the gods to come to Earth in an attempt topacify the earthly gods. And suddenly we read a sentence which supports that godgenetically interfered in the conception of the great prophets on earth,including the Buddha and by deduction also Jesus. Tara gave birth to a son“whose beauty overclouded the celestials…Filled with suspicion, the godsdemanded to know who the true father was…” Tara informed them that the boy wasthe son of Soma, the “Celestial Immortality” and so she called him Buddha.Devils, Famine and WarsRemember that the Indus Valley was largely influenced by the Aryans who werefollowers of Marduk. They were at odds with the other Anunnaki gods whose nameswere derived from gods like Ashur, Asar and Osiris, assuming the roles of‘demons’ in Hindu tradition. Much of the conflict among gods was driven byfamine. At first, the Earth “produced food without cultivation” but when foodbecame scarce, the gods' eagles would bring down from their Celestial Abode adrink called Soma, which they mixed with milk to sustain their immortality.Their favourite sacrifice was “kine” or 'cow-cattle' which is in keeping withthe gods of the biblical lands whose favourite sacrifice was roast lamb. Theysurely showed a great affinity for a good barbecue. Is that where we get ourappetite for lamb on the spit?EDIN– In Sumerian means ‘Abode of the righteous ones’.Our maker – the SerpentThe Serpent god features prominently in Sumerian history. In the depictions heis often represented by a symbol consisting of a ‘star-and-arrow’ which could beread as ‘BUR’, ‘BURU’ or ‘BUZUR’. These words can be translated as ‘God WhoSolves Secrets’ or ‘God of the Deep Mines’. In the original Hebrew Bible, thegod who tempted Eve is called Nahash, which translates into ‘Serpent’ but alsomeans ‘He Who Solves Secrets’ or ‘He Who Knows Metals’. This further supportsthe argument that the serpent who tempted Adam and Eve was actually Enki, theircreator, who wanted to uplift them with knowledge.Mammi! Mother of the gods & humansNinmah or ‘Great Lady’ was the sister of Enlil and Enki who was later calledNinhursag. She was a member of the pantheon of 12 Anunnaki gods and was alsoaffectionately known as Mammi, Mother of the gods. Is it possible that her namehas remained the global name for mother?The Divine WeaponUr-Nammu was a warrior king who found favour with Enlil and became his earlyweapon against the disobedient human slaves. He fought several battles for hisgod Enlil which are reminiscent of the latter biblical tales of warfare in thename of god, in which evil and vile people who were opposing Enlil were subduedin their cities. What we do find out in Sumerian tablets however, is that godEnlil gave Ur-Nammu an unfair advantage by empowering him with secret weapons,way beyond the enemy's comprehension.“The divine weapon, that which in the hostile lands heaps up the rebels inpiles, to Ur-Nammu, the Shepherd, He the Lord Enlil has given it to him;Like a bull to crush the foreign land,Like a lion to hunt it down;To destroy the evil cities, clear them of opposition to the lofty.”The circumstances surrounding Ur-Nammu's death on the battlefield are highlysuspicious and point to a setup by the gods. Maybe he just became too popularand too powerful with the other humans so god had to remove him and find anotherobedient slave. Ur-Nammu died around 2096 BC, shortly before Abraham foundfavour with Enlil and went on to fight many battles and spy for his god againstthose ‘evil and vile’ people who conspired against god.Abraham's ArmyThe Old Testament is very clear in its instructions to Abraham when god commandshim to move to the land of Canaan. So he rapidly took his wife and nephew Lotand travelled south. We do not however get any reasons why Abraham should sourgently move, nor do we get any clues to his final destination. He stopped overat Shechem where the Lord spoke to him. Further on at Beth-El he built a templeand called the lord's name. He carried on travelling towards the Negev, a verydry region where Canaan and the Sinai peninsula meet. Why on Earth would godwant Abraham to move into the middle of the Negev Desert? What was so urgentthat made god bring Abraham over many miles of barren desert land into themiddle of nowhere? The only significance it had in those days was that it justso happened to have been the gateway to the ‘spaceport’ of the Anunnaki gods inthe Sinai. Mount Moria, Mount Zophim, Mount Zion, were all landmarks surroundingthe forbidden spaceport of the gods. But Abraham was not alone. He had a groupof ‘Naar’ men with him. This has previously been misinterpreted as ‘young man’but the true Hurrian meaning of the word is ‘fast riders or cavalry men’. Thismeans that Abraham had a small army of Naar men with him. What did god haveplanned for them in the middle of the desert? To protect the space port againstinvasions by other humans. Even Josephus writes that “Abraham reigned atDamascus, where he was a foreigner, having come with an army out of the landabove Babylon.” And so god's golden boy would get great rewards from his godEnlil. Abraham was Enlil's warrior and eventual spy, endowed with a crack squadof fighting men and the latest weapons.Erra EposThe Erra Epos is the Sumerian version of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.This is how god describes the events in those texts. You can make your ownconclusions regarding its relevance to the events at Sodom and its biblicalsimilarity. “The people I will make vanish, their souls shall turn to vapour.”MardukMarduk had a much more sympathetic relationship with humans probably because heespoused an earthling female. In several tablets we read of his intentions andhere is one such clear example from the time Marduk was on his way back to hisbeloved Babylon. What we also realise is that humans became disposable pawns inthe conflict between the gods. The tablets tell us that Marduk wanted to bringpeace and prosperity to the lands and “chase away evil and bad luck…bringmotherly love to mankind...” But his adversary under the leadership of Enlil“...his wrath had brought” upon Babylon, Marduk's city. And once again humansfought under the instructions of their separate gods for a cause in which theyhad very little say.Amun-RaThe god Amun or ‘Unseen one’ was also called ‘Amen’ by the Egyptians. Manyobelisks praise him endlessly and support the fact that Amen-Ra was a god with agrowing following of earthlings. It was in fact Marduk who was preparing for hisonslaught on the ruling gods under the leadership of Enlil. In Cleopatra'sNeedles by Sir Wallis Budge, we read:“ Amen, from being merely the god of Thebes, became king of the world and kingof the gods. He possessed towns in Palestine and Syria, and a very large numberof slaves, male and female, and the commands of his high priests were obeyedunhesitatingly throughout the lands.”But in this remarkable book which is filled with endless praises and prayers toAmun-Ra by the kings of Egypt, we get all the evidence we need that the gods ofEgypt were real physical entities who interacted with the kings and theirpeople, from the volumes of praises by the god Amun-Ra for his kings and theirfollowers. One such incident occurs when Amun-Ra thanks Thothmes III for hisconquests.“Come to me, rejoice at the sight of my beneficience,My son, my avenger…I rise in the sky for thy pleasure (or love of thee)My heart dilateth with joy at thy beautiful comings to my temple.” This book isfilled with translations of virtually every obelisk ever found, and concurs thatit was in fact Marduk, or Amun-Ra, who conquered and united Egypt.“Horus…King of the South and the North…He made them as his monuments to hisfather Amen, lord of the thrones of the two lands.”Favourite storiesPopular stories among the ancient Babylonians were repeated in more than onecomposition. For example, the story of the flood is known in the Epic ofGilgamesh and from the Atra-hasis Epic. The most famous epics and myths were:Gilgamesh, Atra-hasis, Adapa, Nergal and Ereshkigal, When Above, Descent ofIshtar into Hades, Anzu, Etana and Era. Another sub-genre is the historical epicof ‘The king of battle and Tukulti-Ninurta I'.Aryans & JewsAdolf Hitler would have been devastated to find out that the relationshipbetween the Aryans and Jews long before Christ, was one of liberation andcompassion. Cyrus the Great was a true Aryan king of real Aryan descent. Cyruswas the first Persian king who united the two original Persian tribes of theMedes and Parsees. Where did he get all his knowledge and power from? He wasjust another one of those Aryan kings who appears in the biblical texts andnobody makes any fuss about his mysterious arrival. This invader is treated bythe Old Testament as part of daily events. He is best remembered for hisunprecedented tolerance and magnanimous attitude towards those he conquered.Around 539 BC he liberated Babylon, freed the slaves and allowed 40,000 Jews tomove back to Palestine. He was known by the Hebrews as the “Anointed of Yahweh”which was a very unusual relationship between a Hebrew god and a non-HebrewAryan king. He is said to be the first king to release a charter of human rightsand was known as the 'Law Giver' whose main objective was to liberate peoplefrom slavery. Was Cyrus possibly another one of the Anunnaki prophets sent torally humans behind one god? He was the first Achaemenid Emperor of Persia whounited people everywhere he went and he was depicted with wings, similar toother gods. The Achaemenids worshipped a deity called 'Wise Lord' who wasdepicted as hovering in the sky within a winged globe. So who was Cyrus really?Just another messenger of Enlil? A prophet who achieved moderate success inspreading the new benevolent message of god while preparing the way for Jesus?We should also remember that the Aryans were called the ‘Lordly people’ by theSumerians.FurnacesSumer did not have ores but it was rich in fuels like asphalt, bitumen and otherpetroleum products. That is why the early kilns and smelting facilities wereestablished there to process the golden ores. And that is also why there aremany ancient inscriptions describing the bringing of metal ores from afar.Hammered BraceletThe Sumerians were not the only ones talking about the asteroid belt as theHammered Bracelet. In Psalms it is outlined equally eloquently, also describinga mysterious planet's orbit. Was this Nibiru? The planet they all knew was thehome of the Anunnaki gods?“The Heavens bespeak the glory of the LordThe Hammered Bracelet proclaims his handiworkHe comes forth as a groom from the canopy;Like an athlete he rejoices to run the course.From the end of Heavens he emanates…”The Cross and the Planet of the CrossingNibiru was referred to as ‘The planet of the crossing’ which was depicted by asymbolic cross in pictographs and in cuneiform text. It was also the symbol forAnu ‘divine’ and it evolved into the sign of the cross even in the Semiticlanguages, represented by the letter ‘tav’ which meant ‘the sign’. Mesopotamiantexts speak about the planet's appearance and the anticipated effects it willhave on Earth.“The great planet.At his appearance, dark red.The Heaven he divides in half and stands as Nibiru….When from the station of Jupiter the planet passes towards the west,When from the station of Jupiter the planet increases in brillianceAnd in the Zodiac of Cancer will become Nibiru….Hostile kings will be at peace,The gods will receive prayers and hear supplications…The gods will give peace; troubles will be cleared up…”The biblical Isaiah had similar things to say about the ‘End of Days’:“ And it shall come to pass at the End of Days:…The Lord shall judge among the nations….They shall beat their swords intoploughshares…Nation shall not lift up sword against nation.”[../Images/548-1.jpg]Sumerian stone depicting Anu the supreme god; Nibiru, the planet of thecrossing; and the star symbol of the radiant planet Nibiru. It also depicts theage of the lion; the scorpion and the ever-present serpent which surrounds thestone. The crescent moon was the symbol used to depict Ea/Enki. The associationwas probably made from the tidal effect that the moon had on the waters of theworld. Enki was renowned for being able to control and manipulate the waters ofthe world. Enki was also the ‘god of the water’, known as ‘god of the sweetwater’.Furnace MasterEnki was assisted in the mines of Abzu, by a god called Gibil ‘he who burns thesoil’. Gibil was in charge of the smelting process and was depicted withshoulders emitting red-hot rays or sparks of fire, emerging from the ground.Towers and RocketsIt is written that the Babylonians “wanted to make a ‘shem’ (name) forthemselves” by building the tower of Babel. The word ‘shem’ was translated inthe Bible as ‘name’. Zecharia Sitchin points out that the word ‘shem’ which isused in the original texts was incorrectly translated. The root of the word for‘shem’ is ‘shamah’ meaning “that which is highward”. Is it accidental that theancient obelisks were made to resemble ‘shems’ which had the shape of a rocket?Or were they consciously emulating the rocket ships of the gods? Why else wouldEgyptians choose such a strangely cumbersome shape to worship the gods? So whenthe Babylonians wanted to make a ‘shem’ for themselves, it actually meant a‘rocket ship’ to match that of the gods. That would explain perfectly why godwas so upset by their efforts and came down to ‘confuse their language’. Thetower could have been a launch pad or command centre of sorts for their intendedshem or rocket.Gold BootyWhen Pizarro, a Spanish conquistador, entered the royal palace in Cuzco in the16th century, he found a chamber filled with 100,000 gold ingots weighing aboutfive pounds each. This was after extorting 200,000 ounces of gold from the Incapeople by taking their king hostage and demanding a ransom paid in gold. Thiskind of activity continued for around 200 years displaying the insatiable greedfor gold by barbaric Europeans, and shining a light on the incomprehensiblecollection of gold by an ancient civilisation.Aztec PrayerThis Aztec prayer highlights the similarity in which they saw the god of Heavenwho gave them knowledge, to the Sumerian descriptions and even laterJudeo-Christian religions. This is a translation from the Aztec Nahuatllanguage.“You inhabit the heavens,You uphold the mountains…You are everywhere, everlasting.You are beseeched, you are entreated.Your glory is eminent.”The American Wrath of godEven the American people experienced the wrath of god. It is written in Incahistory that under the rule of Capac, there were a group of foreign men whodisembarked and settled along the coast. They had unusual tools and were said tobe “despoiling the land”. They eventually settled in the mountains with theirmetal tools and implements. They provoked the wrath of the “Great God” whoquickly destroyed them with a “heavenly fire”. What were they doing to deservesuch brutal punishment? Were these a group of miners who decided to mine somegold for themselves, not wanting to share it with Enlil?Five Ages of the IncasThe Incas of the 16th century believed that there were Five Ages of the Sun,each one lasting 2 900 years and that they were in the fifth age. Thiscalculation could trace back the origins of the Incas for about 14 500. Thefirst age was that of Viracocha and the gods who were white and bearded. The 2ndAge was that of the giants many of whom were not benevolent, often resulting inconflict between gods and giants. The 3rd Age was the period of primitive manand uncultured humans. The 4th Age was the age of heroes and demigods amongHumankind, half-man, half-god. The 5th Age was when human kings emerged,instated by the gods, of whom the Incas were last in line. For the Mayas thegreat cycles last 1,872,000 days, which is 5128.7 years. Is it possible that theIncas used a similar calendar with similar dating? In which case the five ageswould go back to around 23,000 BC. Such a suggestion would not be in conflictwith what we are told in the Sumerian tablets because Ka-in was well known tohave established a civilised people in the Andes by then.GeneticsIn 1909 British biologist William Bateson gave the study of inheritance a name.He called it ‘genetics’. James Watson says “Understanding genetics is not justunderstanding why we look like our parents. It is also about coming to gripswith Humankind's oldest enemies: the flaws in genes that cause genetic disease.”If we are the pinnacle of intelligent evolution on Earth, why should our geneshave so many defects? Why have these defects not ironed themselves out in theprocess of evolution over millions of years? Or is it simply because our geneshave been purposefully manipulated, leaving behind an incomplete sequence whichcauses inexplicable genetic mutations and disease, because it is only a piece ofthe whole?GenesWe would assume that as the most intelligent or evolved species, humans wouldhave the most number of genes from among the animals and plants. This is not thecase however. The current estimate is that humans who have an estimated 100trillion cells making up our bodies, will end up with about 25,000 genes oncethey have all been identified. It is amazing to find out that a creaturecomposed of only 959 cells, the Nematode worm, has around 20,000 genes. Doesthat make any sense? The mustard plant actually has even more genes than humansat around 27,000, while the Fruit fly has 14,000, Baker's yeast 6,000 and evengut bacteria E. Coli have about one fifth of the number of genes in humans, atabout 4,000. It is proposed by James Watson that our human abilities haveevolved to make our genes multifunctional. “Humans, it would appear, are simplyable to do more with their genetic hardware.” Does that make any sense to you?How could a gene code for more than one specific effect? Would this mean that ifwe eliminate the gene that causes cancer, we accidentally eliminate the samegene which codes for cell division? I would suggest that there is probably muchmore to our introns and junk genes than we currently understand. Their effectsand activity will yet be understood.Was John the Baptist killed by Jesus?According to Barbara Thiering, The Dead Sea Scrolls tell us that between Marchand September of 31 AD, while The Baptist was under arrest, a sinister plotemerged against him. Jesus, who was also called ‘The Wicked Priest’ because heillegally claimed the high priesthood, is accused of plotting against theBaptist, the ‘Teacher of Righteousness’. Jesus confronted ‘The Baptist’ on apoint well-understood by ancient Sumerians: the fact that priesthood wasreceived by ordination from god and not by birth. Only the god of the time couldbestow priesthood on a man. This god was Enlil. Why would Jesus feel so stronglyabout this issue of ordination? Because he was the instrument of the Anunnakigods, sent to pacify people and restore their faith in a single powerful god,one above all the other gods of the time. And suddenly John the Baptist, who wasone of the other possible prophets of the Anunnaki gods was in the way of theirnew golden boy Jesus. It is therefore quite plausible that the gods requiredJesus to get rid of the Baptist who was causing confusion among the newconverts. The Anunnaki gods wasted no time. But even then the people requiredmuch persuasion that Jesus was ‘the one’ and Jesus had to be bestowed withspecial skills and ‘legions of angels’ to help him convert the locals of thetime. The weird events and so-called miracles are pretty much ancient history.Bad SpellingThe excavation of the pyramids of Giza have been embroiled in almost 200 yearsof conspiracy and deceit, mostly relating to the legitimacy of the discovery ofthe names of kings, supposed quarry marks and cartouches with royal names insidethe pyramids. It was Col. Howard Vyse and his partner JR Hill who made theseastonishing discoveries under very suspicious circumstances. It involved thedismissal of trained foremen and very private and explosive excavation of thepyramids' interiors. It is very suspicious that it was Vyse who miraculouslyfound very coarse and unrefined inscriptions of the names of king Khufu andlater Menkaure in the two respective pyramids. The inscriptions were not onlymuch larger than the normally encountered Egyptian inscriptions, but they arevery rough compared to the usually refined and precise work of Egyptian scribes.The worst part is, that the name Khufu had been miss spelt in the Great Pyramid,and yet it was this discovery which led to the pyramid being called Khufu. Inthe dubious inscription, the king was called ‘RAUFU’ instead of ‘KHUFU’. Such asimple mistake would never have been made by a royal Egyptian scribe. And yet,the whole world has quite happily accepted these findings and ignorantly forgeahead. It is this kind of continuous disinformation which adds to the extendedsurvival of the lies and dogma which entraps us as the human slave species.Mayan FloodThe great sacred book of the Maya, Popol Vuh, states that at the beginning oftime the “Great God” decided to create humanity and so began to experiment with“figures made of wood that looked like men and talked like men.” But they fellout of favour with their maker because “...they did not remember their creator.”Then the “Great God” decided to destroy his creation in a great flood and startagain. “The face of the world was darkened and the black rain began to fall byday and by night…The wooden figures were annihilated, destroyed, broken up andkilled.” But the ‘Great Father and the Great Mother’ survived because they foundfavour with god, to become the father of the human race.Book of JubileesWe have already established that the Sumerian Noah was called Ziusudra and wasactually the secret son of the god Enki by a human female. It was written in thetablets that Ziusudra looked very differently to his biological parents, withhis white skin, bright blond hair and blue eyes. In the apocryphal Book ofJubilees we read the same about Noah. “His body was white as snow...” It had aprofound effect on Lamech, his supposed paternal father. It supports thatNoah/Ziusudra was no ordinary human child and therefore he was the one chosen tobe saved from the flood by Enki. When Noah was born, his father Lamech ran tohis father Methuselah and said: “I have begotten a strange son, diverse from andunlike Man, and resembling the son of the God of Heaven; and his nature isdifferent and he is not like us…He is not sprung from me but from the Angels.”Lamech believed that his wife was impregnated by one of the angels, which wouldbe a sort of trial run for several more virgin births to come. Both Jesus andhis mother Mary were born by some ‘divine’ intervention by angels. We now knowexactly what that means, don't we?Coming of the LordAt Shrinagar, in the Vale of Kashmir there is a temple which is called the‘Jewish Temple’. It is the biggest temple in Kashmir and is also known as the‘Temple of the Sun’. We have already suggested that some of these giant stonebuildings were used by the Anunnaki gods as landing sites for their “boats ofheaven” or various air travel devices they used. It is very curious that thisparticular temple has been found to have very high levels of radioactivity inthe centre area of a large flat rock platform. This phenomenon has baffledexplorers for decades, but there is a clear indication in the Bible whichexplains such a possible event. An event which would be in keeping with the manyappearances of god to various humans. In this case it was Ezekiel 43:1 - 4:“And behold the glory of God of Israel came from the east; and the sound of hiscoming was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with his glory…Andthe mobile vessel that I saw was like the vision that I have seen by the riverChebar and I fell upon my face…And the glory of the Lord entered the temple bythe way above the door…”We can clearly deduce that something very unusual was happening here and it wasquite necessary for the frightened Ezekiel to ‘fall upon his face’ for reasonsof noise, heat and brightness of such a rocket ship coming to land in front ofhim. But we get even more clues from god about this event shortly afterwards,when he confirms with Ezekiel that he had seen where he dwells.Ezekiel 43:7“And He said unto me, Son of Man, thou hast seen the place of my throne, and theplace of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the childrenof Israel…”Such references abound in the Bible and many other older scriptures throughoutman's prehistory. We cannot continue to refute such events and ascribe them tosome inexplicable miraculous activity inspired by god. We need to be big enoughand brave enough to face the truth and dissect the historic facts for what theyreally were.Credo MutwaCredo Mutwa is South Africa's pre-eminent mystic, Sangoma (medicine-man) andvisionary. His writings have inspired millions and his knowledge of theprehistory of African people is simply mesmerising. From his book Indaba MyChildren and in a number of recent interviews as recent as early 2005 we getsome sobering substantiation for the ‘slave species’ theory. We have alreadyshown with some examples of African mythology that the people believed in godswho came down to Earth from the sky and created humans. Credo Mutwa shines evena brighter light on it, while at the same time enforcing the southern African‘cradle of man’ theory. In an interview with Rick Martin during September 1999he had this to say.“The people of Rwanda, the Hutu people, as well as the Watusi people, state, andthey are not the only people in Africa who state this, that their very oldestancestors were a race of beings whom they called the Imanujela, which means “theLords who have come”. And some tribes in West Africa, such as a Bambara people,also say the same thing. They say that they came from the sky, many, manygenerations ago, a race of highly advanced and fearsome creatures which lookedlike men, and they call them Zishwezi. The word Zishwezi means the ‘dival’ orthe ‘glidal- creatures’ that can glide down from the sky or glide through water.Everybody, sir, has heard about the Dogon people in Western Africa… who claimthat their tribe or their king were first founded by the supernatural race ofcreatures that came from the sky.”But the real surprise comes when Mr. Mutwa starts to talk about the Zulus ofSouth Africa and the origin of their name.“When you ask a South African white anthropologist what the name of Zulu means,he will say it means ‘the sky’, and therefore the Zulu call themselves ‘peopleof the sky’. That sir, is nonsense. In the Zulu language, our name for the sky,the blue sky,’is ‘sibakabaka’. Our name for inter-planetary space, however, is‘izulu’ and the ‘weduzulu’, which means ‘inter-planetary space, the dark skythat you see with stars in it every night’, also has to do with travelling sir.The Zulu word for travelling at random, like a nomad or a gypsy, is ‘izula’.Now, you can see that the Zulu people in South Africa were aware of the factthat you can travel through space, not through the sky, like a bird, but you cantravel through space, and the Zulus claim that many, many thousands of yearsago, arrived out of the skies, a race of people… who married their daughters…andproduced a powerful race of Kings and tribal Chiefs…”Mutwa further explains that African people believe that “God was a woman, thegreat Cosmic Mother. And, it is contrasted by the Abapezulu belief that God is aman who dwells in the sky.”This would support the Sumerian writings about Enki and Enlil's sisterNinhursag, who was called the ‘Great Mother’ of humans and still survives inmany European cultures of ancient times. There is so much more support for theslave species theory by African tradition that it truly boggles the mind. Mutwacontinues:“According to the ancient books which were written by the people of Sumeria, outof clay, gods came out of the sky and forced human beings to work for them, tomine gold for them. This story is confirmed by African legends throughoutAfrica, that gods came out of the sky and made us into their slaves, and theymade us into slaves in such a way that we would never realise that we areslaves.”[../Images/554-1.jpg](Exerts from an interview with Rick Martin 1999)The cross as a symbol of healing has survived for thousands of years. We shouldnot be surprised that its origins are also found in the Sumerian texts whichpoint to the Anunnaki who came to earth and taught people healing.The Cross & The Planet of the CrossingThe cross is a mysterious symbol which can be traced right back to the veryearly days of Humankind. The Sumerians introduced the world to the symbol of thecross in many of their pictorial seals, where it represented the divine symbolof Anu and the planet Nibiru. Affectionately referred to as ‘the planet of thecrossing’, because it crosses the orbits of many of the planets in our solarsystem as it approaches the Sun every 3,600 years. Just like all of the arts,culture, science and technology which was bestowed on humanity by the ancientgods of prehistory, so was the symbol of the cross. From a biography on CredoMutwa by Roman Thomas we learn that the symbol of the cross was well-known tothe African people long before the missionaries arrived on the continent. Infact, the Africans had been familiar with three types of crosses from the“remotest of remote times”. They were used by healers for good purposes or evilones. There was the ‘T’cross which was known as the ‘Tau’ cross in Westernmysticism; there was the ‘Jesus’ cross, obviously not related to Jesus; and thenthey also knew the ‘unsaid’ cross. Roman Thomas writes the words of Credo Mutwa:“Then there was the unsaid cross, known to white people as the Ankh, which manywestern thinkers wrongly assume to have been only known to the ancientEgyptians. This ankh was actually known by our people as the knot of eternity,or the knot of eternal life, and it was used even by Khoi San people, forpurposes of healing.”The Khoi Khoi, Zulu, Xhosa, Swazi and other Nguni speaking people all believedthat this cross represented their Sun god. And that is why they recognised themissionaries who first arrived with their crosses as messengers of their Sungod, without needing much explanation. But the most powerful of all the crosseswas the ‘perfect cross’ with all arms the same length. This cross was sometimeenclosed in a circle and used as a powerful tool for all kinds of healing. But aperversion of this cross which looks like an ‘X’, is deemed to be bad andominous of unsavoury events. When people have gone crazy, it is said that theyhave the (X) cross on them.Is it coincidental that this form of the cross was also the divine symbol forAnu, the grand commander of the Anunnaki? And that it also represented the‘planet of the crossing’ which was Nibiru and portended the coming of newmedicine, a time of peace and prosperity and harmony among the people of Earth?This would happen every 3,600 years and every time Anu would descend from his‘planet of the crossing’ while it was in close proximity to Earth in its orbit.It seems that the symbolism of the cross has played a very important role in ourevolution as a species, without many of us being faintly aware of it. Just thinkof the symbol for places of healing in our modern world, called a hospital. Oreven the Red Cross. They all go back a long way, and just like most elements ofour civilisation, we seem to have inherited them from the Sumerians.It is appropriate that the story of Humankind begins and ends in the cradle ofhumanity of southern Africa. And so we examine one last statement from CredoMutwa as he speaks about the Bantwana people, meaning ‘children’. He tells usabout a village of very shy and friendly people living in seclusion along theZambezi river, said to be among the wisest people in the world. The peculiarthing about them is that virtually all of them only have two large toes on eachfoot. They will tell you that there are 24 inhabited planets within reach ofEarth. They also believe that they are the descendents of ‘bird-like’ peoplefrom the sky who came to earth thousands of years ago from the ‘red star’ called‘Liitolafisi’ and had children with ‘earthling females’. We read the same storyin Sumerian tablets about the Igigi/Nefilim who came to Earth from Mars and tookhuman females as their wives. And let me remind you one last time of the verysame sentiment raised in Genesis 6:1-4:“When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born tothem, the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and theymarried any of them they chose… The Nephilim were on the earth in those days,and also afterward, when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and hadchildren by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.”This passage has troubled priests ever since it first appeared in the Bible.There is no rational explanation for it, unless you offload everything you haveever been taught and open your mind to new truths about the real origins ofHumankind. I hope you will experience the same sense of liberation I did, whenthe pieces of the puzzle suddenly fell into place and I could suddenly see howmanipulated and brainwashed we had been for too many years. The new truth is theonly way forward for our enslaved species to liberate ourselves from all thedogma that surrounds us, as we edge closer to rejoining the Universal Communityof Beings. After all, we came from the stars, and we will return to the stars.Planets 10, 11 and 12, just waiting to be found.Just a few days before going to print with this book, New Scientist featured anarticle under the title ‘Far-Out Worlds, Just Waiting to be Found’. Not onlydoes this article provide my theories with great scientific support, but it evenshows a diagram of the distant planets in our solar system, which very closelyresembles the diagram in this book. I will leave you with a few extracts fromthis article by Stuart Clark and show the illustration as provided by NewScientist, 23 July 2005.“In the dark reaches of the solar system lurk swarms of hidden worlds. ‘It'squite possible that there is a halo of planets surrounding our solar system,just waiting to be found,’ says Eugene Chiang, an astronomer at the Universityof California, Berkeley. Chiang is not the only one to think that the nineplanets we know of are only half the story. Alan Stern, a planetary astronomerat the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, is convinced there aremore sizeable planets out there. ‘I think it is a 100 per cent certainty,’ hesays. ‘Definitely there are Earth-sized objects out there and some will belarger than the Earth.’The halo, if it exists, would surround the sun withplanets orbiting at all sorts of crazy angles, at 1,000 or even 10,000astronomical units (AU) from the sun – that's up to 10,000 times the distancefrom the sun to Earth.Just a decade ago, most astronomers had backed away from the idea of a tenthplanet beyond Pluto. Today's change of mind has come about thanks to the latestfashionable theory to explain the creation of the solar system: ‘oligarchicplanet formation’. Adherence to this theory appears to demand a secondpopulation of planets surrounding our solar system (see diagram). Despite theirsize, the new planets are going to be tough to find: ‘The hidden planets couldbe orbiting at all sorts of crazy angles beyond Pluto.’Zeljko Ivezic at the University of Washington in Seattle is confident that LSST(telescope) will be up to the job. ‘A conservative estimate is that we coulddetect Earth-sized planets at approximately 500 AU,’ he says. ‘I'm expectingplanets 10, 11, 12 and many more to be found in the distant outer solar system,all larger than Mars and possibly even than the Earth.’ The planets thought tobe the missing half of the solar system are unlikely to have been thrown as faras the long-period comets. But they are still going to be a long way out,anything between 25 to 250 times further from the sun than Pluto.”[../Images/557-1.jpg]A copy of the illustration as presented by New Scientist, 23 July 2005. Thediagram indicates the orbits of the known planets close to the sun, and predictswhere the new planets will most likely be found in the distant reaches of oursolar system. This diagram bears an uncanny resemblance to that which wasdescribed by the Sumerians in their clay tablets over 4,000 years ago. It nowseems that we will find these ‘new’ planets in the not-so-distant future. Whenwe do find these planets, will we also find ‘our maker’?ROUTE TO THE LAND OF OPHIR AND RICHES IN GOLDSince there is overwhelming evidence that Humankind originated in Africa, it isfitting that we end this book in the place where it all started, southernAfrica. There are various references about Enki setting up his gold-miningstronghold near the gushing waters in the Abzu. We know from the Sumeriantablets that Abzu was in southern Africa. It is also here where the GreatZimbabwe ruins are situated. Is it a coincidence that the origins of the GreatZimbabwe ruins have not yet been explained? There is only one river with gushingwaters in this part of the world, the Great Zambezi River, which happens to beVERY close to the ruins. Even today the gushing waters of the Zambezi attractsthrill-seekers from all over the world for its white­water-rafting. We haveshown conclusively that the Phoenicians had a long standing history ofvisitations to southern Africa where they must have obtained all their wealth ingold. The same can be said for King Solomon, his gold mines and the land ofOphir, which has mystified historians for many centuries. As an African I feelcompelled to share this knowledge about the wealth of the ancient pre-history ofthis part of the world with you. The conclusions that I have reached from myresearch surrounding this book points to only one plausible theory. It is insouthern Africa where humanity was created. It is also here that the first goldin the world was mined and extracted by the early settlers on planet Earth,using their genetically created slave species.The route which the Phoenicians and King Solomon took to reach their goldenriches.[../Images/558-1.jpg]The End"},{"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHYANDRESEARCH REFERENCES [../Text/toc.html#bibliography]Descriptions of Egypt – Gilles NeretValley of the Kings – Reeves & Wilkinson 1996The Peopling of Southern Africa – RR Inskeep 1979Southern Land – AR Willcox 1976The World's last Mysteries – Reader's Digest 1977Tutankhamun – Aude Gros de Beler 2004The Atlas of Early Man – Jacquetta Hawkes 1976Atlas of Archaeology – Prof. K Branigan and other contributors.Jewellery in Ancient Times – Renate Rosenthal 1973Races of Africa – CG Seligman 1961Gods, Graves & Scholars – CW Ceram 1956The Second Sphinx – Bassam El Shammaa 2003A Picture History of Archaeology – CW Ceram 1958Ancient Greece – Don Nardo & various contributors 2001Ancient Egypt – Lionel Casson for Time Life 1966The Daily Life of the Aztecs – Jacques Soustelle 1964Jesus The Man – Barbara Thiering 1992Jesus of the Apocalypse – Barbara Thiering 1996Forbidden Science – Richard Milton 1995Gods of Eden – William Bramley 1993According to the Evidence – Erich von Daniken 1977Return to the Stars – Erich von Daniken 1968The Stairway to Heaven – Zecharia Sitchin 1983Genesis Revisited – Zecharia Sitchin 1990The Lost Realms – Zecharia Sitchin 1990The Wars of Gods and Men – Zecharia Sitchin 1985When Time Began – Zecharia Sitchin 1993The 12th Planet – Zecharia Sitchin 1978The Lost Book of Enki – Zecharia Sitchin 2002Plague Wars – Tom Mangold & Jeff Goldberg 1999Illustrated History of World Religions – Geoffrey Parrinder and others 1983The Book of Life – Stephen Jay Gould & other contributors 1993The Mayan Prophecies – AG Gilbert & MM Cotterell 1995In Search of the Edge of Time – John Gribbin 1998The Language of Genes – Steve Jones 1994Our Place in the Cosmos – Fred Hoyle & Chandra Wickramasinghe 1996A Dictionary of African Mythology – Harold Scheub 2000The Koran – NJ Dawood 1997The Gospel of Buddha – Paul Carus 1997The Encyclopedia of Gods – Michael Jordan 1995Fingerprints of the Gods – Robert Bauval & Graham Hancock 1996Keepers of Genesis – Graham Hancock 1997The Facts of Life – Richard Milton 1992Taber's Cyclopedic Medical DictionaryThe Merck ManualBreaking the Maya Code – Michael D Coe 1992The Face on Mars – Giuseppe Filotto 1995DNA – James Watson 2003Cleopatra's Needles and Other Egyptian Obelisks – Sir Wallis Budge 1926The Private Lives of Pharaohs – Joyce Tyldesley 2000Time Detectives – Brian Fagan 1995Cradle of Civilization – Samuel Noah Kramer for Time Life 1969The Mars Mystery – Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval & John Grigsby 1998The Selfish Gene – Richard Dawkins 1989Billions & Billions – Carl Sagan 1998Nature via Nurture – Matt Ridley 2003The Goddess and the Bull – Michael Balter 2004National Geographic – Various Printed Editions and Television ChannelDiscovery Channel – Various programme contributorsHistory Channel – Various programme contributorsNew Scientist – Various editionsWebsites: Newscientist.com Sumerian.org NASA Enchantedlearning.com Pbs.orgStarchild.gsfc.nasa.gov Geocities.com Biblegateway.com Hubblesite.org B17.comSitchin.com Landoverbaptist.org Arden.com Human-nature.com Ncbi.nlm.nih.govReligioustolerance.org Welcome.ac.uk Etext.virginia.edu Talkorigins.orgSymbols.com Esd.ornl.gov Geohive.com Icr.org Smallcomets.physics.uiowa.eduAnsweringenesis.org Solarviews.com Vh.org Minelinks.com Fi.edu Sciencenews.orgInventors.about.com News.bbc.co.uk Bbc.co.uk Accessexcellence.orgBibleexplained.com Ststp.com Xfacts.com Panspermia.org Earthchangecentral.comUnisci.com Crystalinks.com Purgingtalon.com Home.comcast.net Ornl.govGenomesize.com Iclnet.org Goldsheetlinks.com Historyworld.net Ex.ac.ukWarphead.com Gold.org Alienidentities.com Sbs.com Ancienttexts.org Usmint.govSanskrit.gde.to Akhet.co.uk Sacred-texts.com Tm.wc.ask.com Conspiracyarchive.comPnas.org Gnosis.org Mbe.oupjournals.org Jesus21.com Pubmedcentral.nih.govReligious-cults.com Fsmitha.com Deliriumrealms.com Fordham.edu Innerbody.comEarth-history.com Roman-emperors.org Questia.com Pagewise.com Hti.umich.eduJulen.net Batavia.ugent.be Harappa.com World2world.com Csep10.phys.utk.eduPing.de Ancientx.com Biblebell.org Mars-earth.com Christiananswers.netUsers.cihost.com Wikipedia.org Rmc.library.cornell.edu.
